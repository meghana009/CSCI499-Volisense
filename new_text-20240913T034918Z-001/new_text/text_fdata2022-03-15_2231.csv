responding to a barrage of guest criticism about understaffed and overcrowded ski hills vail resorts nyse mtn announced monday that it will spend 175 million next season to boost employee pay and bring staffing back up to needed levels combined with the 320 million capital plan that the broomfield based company previously announced for the upcoming off season that means vail resorts will put nearly half a billion dollars toward improving employee and guest experiences heading into the 2022 23 season chief financial officer michael barkin said he expected the employee costs to be offset by increases in revenue particularly in areas like food and beverage services where coronavirus restrictions and staffing shortages have left income down 27 season to date versus the same period two years ago before the pandemic hit company leaders expressed a strong belief that these investments not only will be able to retain the 47 growth in season pass sales customers they attracted this year with discounted pricing but will fix the issues that generated national criticism they resisted calls from one analyst who asked if they planned to hire a public relations firm to do damage control and said in fact that they have seen improved guest satisfaction scores on surveys since the omicron wave died down and day to day staffing levels have risen obviously the narrative has been quite challenging tied to short staff and passes said ceo kirsten lynch who argued additionally that the pass sales have not led to a massive rise in visitors what we really are focused on is what are the actions we ve taken as a company tied to the experience we are confident in our strategy and that we have made the right investments in the long term complaint levels rose particularly around the christmas holiday season as guests arrived to find a shortage of available terrain at many of the company s 37 north american resorts creating long lift lines compounded by a lack of workers to help frustrated visitors in addition to struggling to staff to pre pandemic levels as many hospitality companies have vail had more than 10 of employees go down at one time with covid 19 at some resorts leading the company to implement a 20 million bonus program for workers who stayed at resorts through the end of this season that immediate personnel investment is tiny however compared to the 175 million announced monday a program that is not expected to boost staffing levels over pre pandemic conditions so much as it is to bring them back up to those numbers the money will allow vail resorts to raise minimum hourly wages across the company to 20 per hour from levels that now are 15 in high cost states like colorado and as low as 12 50 at some midwestern resorts a 4 million chunk of the spending will go to adding 66 more centralized human resources employees amounting to a 50 expansion of that department to help speed hiring and onboarding and to address employee concerns employees had expressed dissatisfaction with human resources support and this addition is viewed as a key step to retaining needed workers the experience of our employees and guests is core to our business model and the company intends to use its financial resources and the stability it has created through its season pass program to continue to aggressively reinvest to deliver that experience lynch said while the surge in pass sales has helped to produce lift ticket revenue that is up 10 3 season to date as compared to the 2019 20 season when the company shut down its ski hills on march 15 the boost in visitors over the same time is just 2 8 and that lynch argued was a refutation to those who have said vail s season pass sales strategy has led to many of the problems it s experienced this year first lynch argued during the company s quarterly earnings call most of the people who bought season passes are not new customers clogging the mountains but customers who switched from daily ticket sales to pass products and second she noted while weekday traffic is up 9 across company properties this season versus the pre pandemic period weekend and holiday visitation is flat a statistic that shows the company has been able to spread passholders more effectively across non peak days that is an outcome we have wanted to achieve lynch said i think the narrative about passes directly translating into visits misses the fact that these are mostly existing guests moving onto passes that hasn t stopped vail resorts from making some customer concessions in january it announced that it would offer passholders at its stevens pass resort in washington state credits that can be applied to future passes because of problems from the combination of limited terrain and the employee shortage but officials declined to say monday if they would make special deals like that anywhere else to try to retain customers even with the boost in pass sales and visitation vail resorts revenues fell 2 in the quarter that ended on jan 31 versus the same period in 2019 20 as ancillary revenues fell off dramatically in addition to the 27 drop in food and beverage sales ski school revenues fell 8 9 during the quarter and rental retail revenues were off 2 8

development of the next generation of our wave energy conversion systems in august 2021 we completed all required documentation and signed the doe contract the 9 month project began in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 pb3 powerbuoy the pb3 generates electricity by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves the pb3 features a unique onboard power take off pto system which incorporates both energy storage and energy management and control systems the pb3 generates a nominal name plated capacity rating of up to 3 kilowatts kw of peak power during recharging of the onboard batteries power generation is deployment site dependent our standard energy storage system ess has an energy capacity of up to a nominal 150 kw hours to meet specific application requirements the pb3 is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid in remote offshore locations the hull consists of a main spar structure loosely moored to the seabed and surrounded by a floating annular structure that can freely move up and down in response to the passage of the waves the pto system includes a mechanical actuating system an electrical generator a power electronics system our control system and our ess which is sealed within the hull as ocean waves pass the pb3 the mechanical stroke action created by the rising and falling of the waves is converted into rotational mechanical energy by the pto which in turn drives the electric generator the power electronics system then conditions the electrical output which is collected within an ess the operation of the pb3 is controlled by our customized proprietary control system the control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the pb3 subsystems we believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output of the pb3 is a significant advantage of our technology in the event of large storm waves the control system automatically locks the pb3 and electricity generation is suspended however the load center either the on board payload or one in the vicinity of the pb3 may continue to receive power from the ess when wave heights return to normal operating conditions the control system automatically unlocks the pb3 and electricity generation and ess replenishment recommences this safety feature helps to prevent the pb3 from being damaged by storms the pb3 can be transported over land to the deployment port using conventional transportation methods once at port the pb3 can be lifted into the water or onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity the pb3 may then be towed to a site using a standard vessel if the location is within an appropriate distance from the port or the pb3 may be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location and craned into the water at site the pb3 is then attached to the mooring system which is installed during a separate operation after which a brief commissioning process places the pb3 into operation a single mdas equipped pb3 can monitor vessel traffic with or without ais turned on across an area approximately 1 300 square kilometers of ocean territory with the ability to link multiple surveillance assets together over large ocean areas giving end users visibility into potentially damaging environmental or illegal activities customized solutions are also available including the addition of subsea sensors to monitor for acoustic signatures including tsunami and water quality 29 table of contents hybrid powerbuoy the company is currently optimizing the design of our original hpb the hpb is capable of utilizing solar and wind power in addition to wave energy based on prototype testing we are optimizing the solar and wind generation as well as increasing the battery energy storage capacity the hpb is capable of providing reliable power in remote offshore locations regardless of ocean wave conditions we believe this product is complementary to the pb3 by providing the company the opportunity to address a broader spectrum of customer deployment needs including low wave environments with the potential for greater product integration within each customer project the hpb is intended to provide a stable energy platform for our mdas solution and for agile deployment of subsea power applications such as recharging and surface communications hub for electric remotely operated vehicles erov such as our wam v and auv used for underwater inspections and short term maintenance subsea equipment monitoring and control the design has a high payload capacity for surveillance and communications equipment with the capability of being tethered to subsea payloads such as batteries or with a conventional anchor mooring system energy is stored in onboard batteries which power subsea and topside payloads the hpb is designed to be able to operate over a broad range of temperature and ocean wave conditions as with the pb3 the control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the hpb subsystems the load is powered by the onboard lithium ion batteries so that payloads are powered no matter what the weather or sun conditions the hpb can be transported over land to the deployment port using conventional transportation methods once at port it can be lifted into the water or onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity the hpb may then be towed to a site using a standard vessel or the hpb may be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location and craned into the water at site subsea battery we have product launched a subsea battery that is complementary to both the pb3 and hpb products and can be deployed together with our powerbuoys or on its own it offers customers the option of placing additional modular and expandable energy storage on the seabed near existing or to be installed subsea equipment our pressure tested lithium ion subsea batteries supply power that can enable subsea equipment sensors communications and auv and erov recharge our pb3 and hpb are complimentary to the subsea batteries by providing a means for recharging during longer term deployments or the batteries can be used independently for shorter term deployments the subsea battery has been designed to provide continuous and or short term power supply from its integrated energy storage system enabling us to supply into a range of industries and applications from backup power to critical subsea infrastructure to continuous operation of subsea equipment such as electric valves the base design of the subsea battery has a nominal 100kw hours of energy storage the subsea battery can be transported over land to the deployment port using conventional transportation methods once at port the subsea battery can be lifted onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity the battery can then be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location and craned into the water at site it comes installed on a ready deployable subsea skid suitable for installation on the seabed the subsea battery can be integrated into other subsea equipment on land prior to deployment strategic

application was approved and that the loan is now fully forgiven the company recognized a gain on extinguishment of ppp loan of approximately 890 000 in the consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ending january 31 2022 during 2020 we started to experience some delays related to the impact of covid 19 on the international supply chain we were able to mitigate much of the impact by consuming not only internal inventory but also by expanding our supply base we have a global supply chain and in addition to domestic sources we obtain components from asia and europe we use a combination of off the shelf components and equipment cots as well as custom developed parts there have been a number of disruptions throughout the global supply chain which have impacted our development and manufacturing as the global economy continues to open up it is driving the demand for certain components this has outpaced the return of the global supply chain to full production although we have been able to find alternatives for many component shortages we experienced and continue to experience some delays and cost increases with respect to container shortages ocean shipping and air freight in addition our key suppliers have experienced longer lead times and cost increases for raw materials and have experienced periods of interruption to production due to covid 19 and its variants affecting manpower though local manpower and similar covid related problems are starting to ease we continue to have concerns over component shortages particularly for semiconductors and specialty metals which we foresee to continue at least through the first half of calendar 2022 if spikes in covid 19 and its variants occur in regions in which our supply chain operates we could experience periodic interruptions or impacts due to delays in components and incur further freight price increases we continue to monitor and adjust our operations as appropriate in response to the covid 19 pandemic 31 table of contents commercial activities we continue to seek new strategic relationships and further develop our existing partnerships we collaborate with companies that have

solutions we have made progress in transitioning from r d to commercialization and moving further into the ocean data as a service market we intend to build on these efforts by implementing processes and solutions that cover the entire life cycle from demand generation to close of contract and from channel strategies to customer care this strategy was further enhanced by our acquisition of mar in november 2021 most of the company s opportunities with potential customers have been for projects in western europe including the north sea as well as north and south america and south east asia nearly two thirds of these opportunities have progressed past initial feasibility and non disclosure agreement stages to more detailed confidential discussions around specific customer applications many proposal requests are for projects where one of our powerbuoy products either the pb3 the hpb or our subsea battery is part of a larger solution deployment and typically include the potential lease or sale of one or more of our solutions deployed on our powerbuoy platforms as well as required services and maintenance support historically demonstration projects have been a necessary step toward broad solution deployment and revenues associated with specific applications like our new jersey mdas test array as part of our data as a service offering a proposal phase typically lasts from three months to more than one year during the demonstration project specification negotiation and evaluation period we are often subject to the prospective customer s vendor qualification process which entails substantial due diligence of the company and capabilities and may include negotiation of standard terms and conditions many proposals contain provisions which would mandate the sale or lease of our powerbuoy product upon successful conclusion of the demonstration project the company is pursuing a long term growth strategy to expand its market value proposition while building the company s revenue base this strategy includes partnerships with leading companies in adjacent and complementary markets we continue to commercialize our powerbuoy products for use in remote offshore power and real time data communications applications and in order to achieve this goal we are pursuing the following business objectives integrated turn key solutions sales or leases we believe our data and power as a service offerings together with our platforms are well suited to enable many uncrewed autonomous non grid connected offshore solutions such as topside and subsea surveillance and

required to reduce the scope of our operations including our planned product development and marketing efforts which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if we are unable to secure additional financing we may be forced to cease our operations 36 table of contents backlog as of january 31 2022 the company s backlog was 0 8 million as of april 30 2021 backlog was 0 2 million our backlog can include unfilled firm orders for our products and services from commercial or governmental customers if any of our contracts were to be terminated our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contract the amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized using the input method used to measure completion over time of customer contracts and changes in estimates from time to time may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due to the timing of new awards critical accounting policies and estimates to understand our financial statements it is important to understand our critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap the preparation of financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates see the section entitled item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended april 30 2021 there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates or accounting policies during the nine months ended january 31 2022 recently issued accounting standards in june 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 2016 13 financial instruments credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments this amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses on instruments within its scope including trade receivables this update is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision useful information about the expected credit losses in november 2019 the fasb issued no 2019 10 financial instruments credit losses topic 326 derivatives and hedging topic 815 and leases topic 842 which deferred the effective date of asu 2016 13 for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2022 including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2016 13 on its consolidated financial statements financial operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results revenues a performance obligation is the unit of account for revenue recognition the company assesses the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and identifies as a performance obligation either a a good or service or a bundle of goods or services that is distinct or b a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer a contract may contain a single or multiple performance obligations for contracts with multiple performance obligations the company allocates the contracted transaction price to each performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price which represents the price the company would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer the company determines the standalone selling price based upon the facts and circumstances of each obligated good or service the majority of the company s contracts have no observable standalone selling price since the associated products and services are customized to customer specifications as such the standalone selling price generally reflects the company s forecast of the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation plus an appropriate profit margin 37 table of contents the nature of the company s contracts may give rise to several types of variable considerations including unpriced change orders and liquidated damages and penalties variable consideration can also arise from modifications to the scope of services variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include such amounts in the transaction price are based largely on our assessment of legal enforceability performance and any other information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to us there was no variable consideration as of january 31 2022 and 2021 the company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a good or service to a customer either 1 at a point in time or 2 over time a good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of it the evaluation of whether control of each performance obligation is transferred at a point in time or over time is made at contract inception input measures such as costs incurred or time elapsed are utilized to assess progress against specific contractual performance obligations for the company s services the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the services to be provided for the company the input method using costs incurred or time elapsed best represents the measure of progress against the performance obligations incorporated within the contractual agreements when the company s estimate of total costs to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligations exceed revenue the company recognizes the loss immediately the company s contracts are either cost plus or fixed price contracts under cost plus contracts customers are billed for actual expenses incurred plus an agreed upon fee under cost plus contracts a profit or loss on a project is recognized depending on whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount the company has two types of fixed price contracts firm fixed price and cost sharing under firm fixed price contracts the company receives an agreed upon amount for providing products and services specified in the contract a profit or loss is recognized depending on whether actual costs are more or less than the agreed upon amount under cost sharing contracts the fixed amount agreed upon with the customer is only intended to fund a portion of the costs on a specific project under cost sharing contracts an amount corresponding to the revenue is recorded in cost of revenues resulting in gross profit on these contracts of zero the company s share of the costs is recorded as product development expense the company reports its disaggregation of revenue by contract type since this method best represents the company s business for the nine month periods ended january 31 2022 and 2021 all of the company s contracts were classified as firm fixed price as of january 31 2022 the company s total remaining performance obligations also referred to as backlog totaled 0 8 million the company expects to recognize approximately 100 of the remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next twelve months the company also enters into lease arrangements for its pb3 and wam v with certain customers revenue related to multiple element arrangements is allocated to lease and non lease

you are here washington march 14 xinhua the u s federal reserve is widely expected to start raising interest rates from near zero this week as the ukraine conflict could further push up u s inflation which has been rising to the highest level in four decades economists said despite the geopolitical developments we still expect the fomc will hike the federal funds rate by 25 bps basis points at the conclusion of its march 15 16 meeting jay bryson chief economist at wells fargo securities said in a recent analysis referring to the federal open market committee the fed s policy making committee a near complete labor market recovery and inflation that is well above the central bank s target make the case clear for beginning the tightening cycle bryson said adding skyrocketing commodity prices and more potential supply chain disruptions due to the ukraine conflict create additional sources of inflationary pressure the consumer price index cpi last month surged 7 9 percent from a year earlier the largest 12 month growth since the period ending january 1982 according to the u s labor department at a congressional hearing earlier this month fed chair jerome powell said that he was inclined to support a 25 basis point rate hike at the march policy meeting the first move since the start of the covid 19 pandemic when asked about how international events would impact the fed s decision powell noted that before the ukraine crisis the fed was set to initiate a series of rate hikes this year powell said it s too soon to say for sure how the ongoing conflict the response from nations around the world including sanctions may have changed that expectation but for now the fed will proceed carefully with that plan diane swonk chief economist at major accounting firm grant thornton said that the fed is expected to be demonstrably more hawkish than it was just a few months ago the statement following the fomc meeting is expected to highlight the need for a series of rate hikes while closely monitoring financial market conditions swonk said last week in a blog powell will be walking a tightrope balancing the needs to raise rates and rein in a more systemic rise in inflation with the need to avert a meltdown in credit markets she added desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute also said that higher international oil prices could exert considerable inflationary pressure and force the fed to be more aggressive on raising rates the fed s quarterly summary of economic projections to be released wednesday could show the median projection of 25 basis point rate hikes in 2022 rising from three to at least four and even more likely five bryson said some economists have been calling for more aggressive rate hikes from the fed goldman sachs economists said last month that they expected seven 25 basis point rate hikes this year up from five it had projected earlier to contain hotter than expected inflation joseph brusuelas chief economist at accounting and consulting firm rsm us llp warned that top line inflation may exceed 10 percent this year before settling into the high single digits to close out the year we have most likely arrived at a turning point where elevated inflation will define the economic narrative for several years that may require much higher interest rates than have been observed in recent years and will diminish the probability of central banks achieving a soft landing for the economy brusuelas said monday in an analysis we think the current price shock will shave roughly 1 to 1 5 percentage points off economic growth over the next 12 months brusuelas said adding the probability of a recession will most likely jump from the current 15 percent to about 33 percent in the coming weeks enditem
the united states is facing an expanding gap between how much workers earn and how much they have to pay for housing workers have faced stagnant wages for the past 40 years yet the cost of rent has steadily increased during that time with sharp increases of 14 to 40 over the past two years now more than ever workers are feeling the stress of the affordable housing crisis while i was conducting research in economically hard hit communities from appalachia to oakland california for my recent book published in november 2021 nearly every person i met was experiencing the painful reality of being caught between virtually stagnant wages and rising housing costs as a sociologist i had expected that low wage workers would struggle with the cost of housing i did not expect to meet people who worked two jobs and lived with roommates and still struggled to pay their bills for perspective a person making us 14 an hour would have to work 89 hours a week to cover the rent on a modest one bedroom rental estimated to cost 1 615 per month according to a 2021 study by the national low income housing coalition millions of workers earn less than 14 an hour among u s employees the average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation were only 11 22 in 2022 in january 2022 median rents in the u s reached their highest level yet the average median cost of one bedroom units in the 50 largest metro areas rose from 1 386 in 2020 to 1 652 in 2022 new affordable housing units in irvine calif are shown on jan 26 2022 mindy schauer digital first media orange county register via getty images now i m having to scrounge i interviewed pl a pseudonym for my recent book he is among the 44 million people in the u s who rent their homes pl is a longtime oakland california resident who works full time in a professional career despite employment stability his financial circumstances are worsening rent is raised dramatically from year to year i work in a nonprofit organization so i don t get a raise every year pl told me during an interview in 2018 his monthly rent increased by 250 over the previous three years yet his salary remained static that 250 was going toward the grocery bills the gas bills now i m having to scrounge pl said pl is not alone households that spend more than 30 of their income on rent are referred to as cost burdened according to the u s department of housing and urban development in 2019 37 1 million households or 30 2 of all u s households fit this category the situation has worsened since the pandemic the financial burden of the increasing cost of rent falls hardest on the half of workers in the u s who earn less than 35 000 each year after paying rent about 80 of renter households with incomes under 30 000 have between 360 and 490 left to cover all other expenses including food health care transportation and child care where can you live oakland has been described by gentrification experts as the new center of the nationwide affordable housing crisis a growing tech industry in san francisco a lack of affordable housing weak rent control laws and a predominance of low wage service industry jobs contribute to the shortage of affordable housing in oakland vanessa torres is one of the more than 15 000 people who live in a low income neighborhood in oakland known as the deep east when i spoke with torres in 2020 the worry in her voice was clear this is the hood if low income latinos can t afford it anymore well where do we go if we can no longer afford to live in low income communities that are considered dangerous that are considered poor then where do we see ourselves torres said in 2019 the midpoint for monthly rent for a one bedroom apartment in oakland was 2 300 torres would need to earn almost 50 per hour approximately 96 000 a year to be able to afford 2 300 a month in rent according to the nonprofit california housing partnership corp torres earns roughly 50 000 a year as an educator california has one of the highest homeless rates in the country here a man walks past tents in los angeles on april 26 2021 frederic j brown afp via getty images still seeking solutions elected officials across the country have tried to address the affordable housing crisis through proposals to raise the minimum wage and to mandate more meaningful rent control they have also proposed greater government investment in affordable housing and pursued partnerships with developers as yet none of these efforts has been successful to any significant extent countries with more government control over the economy have taken a different approach to affordable housing for example nordic countries treat the development of low and medium cost housing as a public utility this reduces and stabilizes housing prices by removing the cost of land construction finance and management from the speculative market they have succeeded in producing quality housing that is subsidized and permanently price restricted known as social housing in denmark this strategy has produced 20 of the total available housing there given the affordable housing problems in the u s taking stock of other options could provide some inspiration for pl the oakland renter feeling the squeeze of rising rents as well as for many other full time workers the future doesn t look any better pl who is in his mid 50s told me he doesn t see a way to retire he would need to leave his community in order to retire but he can t imagine where he would go the east bay is his home this article is republished from the conversation under a

and mcdonald s wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 3 2022 this video was recorded on march 10 2022 chris hill today we re digging into the latest on russia oil and the price of gas motley fool money starts now i m chris hill joined by motley fool senior analyst bill mann thanks for being here bill mann hey chris how are you chris hill i am looking forward to the latest edition of where are we now with oil and gas let me start with this the us house of representatives voted overwhelmingly to ban the imports of russian oil natural gas and coal into the united states whether their colleagues in the united states senate take up the bill remains to be seen regardless how important is this industry for the russian economy bill mann it is almost everything for the russian economy i would describe the russian economy as being mafia in how it is structured and the very core is the oil and gas the extractive industries in russia funding for the government and funding for the elements of the country that are most important to vladimir putin come almost exclusively from the oil and gas industry chris hill despite the fact that we get three percent of our oil from russia that didn t stop the price of gas increasing 49 cents a gallon in a single week it is the largest one week spike since hurricane katrina that s the ripple effect here what is the ripple effect of what we re seeing play out in ukraine for people and economies in europe bill mann the natural gas price in europe that matters the most is called the ttf price which is the price of natural gas assets delivered to rotterdam in the netherlands which is the primary depot as of earlier this week it was up 1 300 percent year over year the prices have come down very sharply since then and as we were recording they were down only 700 percent on year over year it came down pretty sharply this week we remember economic classes or the concept of the j curve and we have had a disruption in the form of the elimination of oil and gas as a product or as a threat even and we re getting ready to come into a new synthesis i don t know if the synthesis is better but the pricing has come down pretty sharply in the last couple of days chris hill i ve never taken an economics class in my life what is the j curve bill mann you faked it so well the j curve is essentially the disruption of a status quo which causes a drop of some form and then you move to a new place in terms of pricing in terms of demand those types of things to get off that topic as quickly as humanly possible chris hill no educate amuse and enrich that s our model or it was once upon a time one of the headlines this week is us based companies like mcdonald s coca cola and starbucks closing up shop and suspending operations in russia on wednesday in russia the legislative commission approved measures that essentially paved the way for the nationalization of property in western companies that are leaving i read that i hear that and i try to wrap my head around the russian government taking possession of a lot of mcdonald s and starbucks although at least in the case of starbucks i think there are more starbucks in south carolina than there are in all of russia but the larger point to me is this the end or the beginning of the end of foreign investment in russia if western companies think there s a chance that this could happen bill mann i don t believe there is keep in mind that the western companies let s take mcdonald s for example which is closing about 800 restaurants in russia they are almost all company owned honestly what is the russian government or their successor company going to do they re not going to come in and have access to mcdonald s they ve just got space we have seen dislocations in the past where people have pulled entirely out of an economy iran is one cuba is one vietnam was one but you go to vietnam now and every western brand you can conceive of is there yes this is something that is happening i would not view this as the end of western investment in russia at all russia is still a market of 150 million people and that matters that matters in the long term in the short term these companies are voting with their conferences if you will and getting out of the market but there s always this such a delicate balance between making sure that you re doing the moral thing and making sure that you re not actually harming your own company in a grievous way in the process chris hill i m not asking you to predict what vladimir putin does next bill mann that s good chris hill i am curious however where do you think the next couple of weeks go what are you watching to give you an indication because i think that what most if not all of us are hoping for is an end to this conflict and a return to normalcy in terms of relations and hopefully there are some rebuilding of ukraine short of that what are the things you re keeping your eye on bill mann well one is the oil and gas policy in this country i was very heartened to see this morning the us energy secretary jennifer granholm she brought some real michigan logic in reality to the situation she was in an oil and gas conference and she said look we need to work together to the oil and gas companies our future is going to be less dependent on hydrocarbons than it is now but we need to come up with a way so that we can fill the bucket in the us to make sure that our energy needs are not disruptive i was really heartened by that chris because it tells me that there is actually an avenue for an industry they ve been demonized in a lot of ways and people are starting to talk about windfall profit taxes well almost 170 billion of capital has been lost through bankruptcy in the oil and gas industry since 2015 this is an industry that has been in some ways brought to its knees i don t think that demonizing the us oil and gas industry is actually helpful at this point that to me was something that was very pragmatic very heartening i ve seen very many pragmatic discussions happening in europe and i hope that they continue because obviously when you cut off a massive component of not just the oil and gas industry but other extractive industries other markets there s pain to be had across the board in places that we might not expect that was really heartening to me that that conversation is taking place in that way chris hill last thing and then i ll let you go at least once a year we have an earnings season that involves some type of a weather event of some sort and there will be companies that will come out on their earnings report on the conference call and they ll talk about the impact of that and there s almost always one company that tries to use that as cover and it doesn t hold water at all we all just as investors collectively go that was a weather event in california and your entire base of operations is enduring lend i m not really sure how the two are connected all of that is set up to this i know that global supply chain challenges are very real it seems like this is one more large event that is not helping in that regard when you look at supply chain is there an industry or two that is more greatly impacted by the oil and gas industry in russia than others bill mann it s interesting that you asked me that question because i think some of the areas where we re going to see a fair amount of pain are some of the same industries that felt a lot of pain during the covid shutdown i think restaurants are really in for it not just in supply chain availability but then the cost of raw materials the cost of distributing it throughout their networks i think it s going to be extreme these are companies that i adore obviously mcdonald s has already made its decision but domino s pizza is in forward a little bit when you ask that question i really think that we re going to be in a little bit of a 2020 environment again where every time a company said covid has impacted us you said oh yeah of course it has maybe there was a little bit of the boy who cried wolf there but i think this is going to be another one of those scenarios in which investors really ought to think about giving their companies a bit of a pass when they say there are some real pressures that we have had no opportunity to be able to counteract in the short term bill mann i know you want me to call somebody out i heard that loud and clear but i think a little bit of grace is going to go a long way in this situation chris hill i want you to call people out only when they deserve to be called out bill mann fair chris hill i appreciate your perspective that now this is something that pretty much everyone is going to and deserves a pass on bill mann yeah well we can come back after the fact and say maybe you didn t get to quite the 98 percent of your earnings came from or were impacted by russia but there will be time chris hill bill mann thanks for being here bill mann thanks chris as i mentioned before russia only provides about three percent of our oil supply so why are we seeing such a major impact on gas prices for more here is ricky mulvey ricky mulvey a surge in oil prices can make any investor sweat today we re looking at some of the historical context why shutting off one relatively minor supplier of oil to the united states is leading prices to skyrocket joining me now is motley fool senior analyst nick sciple nick the united states imported about 700 000 barrels of crude and petroleum products a day from russia last fall that s only three percent of our consumption how did we get to a point where cutting off this relatively minor supplier has such a significant impact on prices nick sciple sure rick well thanks for having me i think to look at what s going on with oil prices we really need to zoom back a few years as i m sure a lot of people know the oil market is notoriously a boom and bust industry i think the oil market may have invented the term boom and bust but the past couple of years we ve really reached the bottom of the bust of the oil market 2020 most folks are familiar oil prices went negative a very highly publicized headline there 2020 was also the record the year in the history the oil and gas industry for bankruptcies obviously when folks aren t making money by producing oil and gas and businesses are going bankrupt they re going to invest less money in producing oil and gas pulling oil and gas out of the ground which we saw in 2021 2021 was the lowest year for new oils discoveries since 1946 was also in terms of capital expenditure spent on looking for new oil and gas was the lowest we ve seen since 2004 we entered 2022 in a condition where the economy was recovering folks are returning to travel leaving their homes but investments in oil production were at cyclical lows we were already in a situation where the market was very tight yet some big banks projecting 100 bill even before the conflict in ukraine of course now we have one of the biggest oil and gas producers in the world russia involved in a conflict in ukraine ukraine is also one of the main through fairs by which gas gets from russia to western europe you have these duo political issues coming at a time where the market was already heightened and so things got even more tight and have been impacted that s why you ve seen oil prices shoot up as high as 150 ricky mulvey also the oil market is talked about in a very general term three percent of the oil comes from russia but russia is also producing these very specific type of oils that affect our economy nick sciple not all oil is created equal so when you hear oil prices quoted you will usually hear one or two prices there s west prices intermediate which is the us benchmark oil price which represents a particular bench of oil the other grade you will hear quoted is brent which is the european grade of oil in the us the oil that we produce is the light suite crude that s best used for making things like gasoline but you need heavier oil stuff like oil russia produces to make things like diesel fuel part of the issue is we are in this global commodity market where the price ain t set the us it s set by the entire world s demand but also just not all oil is created equal obviously there is lots of demand for gasoline but we still need to run those diesel trucks too to get goods to market and so folks are out there looking to replace those russian oil supplies that s part of why you ve seen the biden administration reach out to venezuela to try to their exports increased to united states because their oil is somewhat of a substitute for what we traditionally would get from russia ricky mulvey it s tough to turn on the taps because we don t necessarily know where they are to begin with with less oil discovery so why is it so difficult to flip the switch right now and just start pumping oil from other countries like saudi arabia and the uae nick sciple well part of it is in the us oil and gas companies are facing the same supply train crunch that lots of other businesses are facing you need things like pipe and steel to actually run your operation the other thing is we ve seen this under investment in production for a number of years which means there s been a reduced amount of hiring you just don t have the people out there working in the fields to increase production that s in the us when you look abroad even before 2022 you ve seen opec plus that group struggled to meet its targets as far as increasing its oil production they have over complied with cuts is the word you hear them say even before this issue the russian war those countries were struggling to increase production you add urgency now i don t think it changes the conditions on the ground the last thing to say is physics at the end of the day governs how these oil wells flow you can try to drive more production out or some folks have called for canadian oil companies to skip some scheduled maintenance in order to increase production in the short term the issues that it creates is it hurts the production of the asset over the long term i think we re going to need oil and gas not just this year but next year and so some of the encouragement folks have to hey we will need to increase production now could be harmful in the long term that s another thing to think about ricky mulvey yeah you re essentially hey we re going to create a short term solution by creating another long term problem nick sciple correct that s a potential issue the other thing is we should be mindful of as well when you hear oil prices quoted you re hearing this front month oil contract what s oil going for today but what oil companies are looking at when they choose to produce is what s the prices going to be in the future if you look in the past week or so the future s price for december 2022 oil is actually down over the course of the past week part of the signal that the market is giving to these oil producers is not quite as bright as you see with that headline price you get quoted ricky mulvey it s not just oil producers and oil stocks that are being affected by the volatility you ve also seen a lot of supply chain effects for industries that you would think are relatively unrelated to oil what are some of those nick sciple the way i think about is energy is the prime commodity energy goes into everything we produce and so some high energy intense industries like steel making have been impacted you ve seen some steelmakers in europe slowdown some of their production another industry that s worth watching is fertilizer a key impact for fertilizer production is natural gas and so as natural gas prices have increased again even before 2022 you saw some fertilizer producers slowdown some of their production obviously fertilizer prices read through into things like food because they are a key input in food costs and that has potential to get even worse because we saw i think just this morning on thursday russia announced they re going to temporarily suspend exports of fertilizer russia and belarus who s also involved in the ukraine conflict are two of the biggest suppliers of that in the world some of these other industries both energy intensive industries and also industries that use oil and gas as feed stocks are in a tough spot here ricky mulvey it s not a shocker to say that one supply chain issue can often create a contagion for others we ve heard this adage the cure for higher oil prices is higher oil prices you are hearing analysts say that the solution for this is demand destruction but what does demand destruction actually mean for a lot of industries nick sciple oftentimes you ll hear analysts say at x price if oil prices go too high you ll see demand destruction in the economy what that really means is that prices get so high that the people choose not to drive or choose not to travel etc and so it leads to just less demand for the commodity in the economy which leads to prices going down obviously prices are a function of supply and demand in any industry but especially so in a commodity industry like oil and gas there s really two ways out of this current tightness ran there s either one you increase production which as we talked about there are some hurdles to that both on the supply chain side and that sort of thing or you reduce demand that can come in the form of we talked about companies that are producing less of the goods and services they make they can come in the form of higher prices limiting folks willingness to pay but those are really the two ways out long term is either you increase production or you decrease demand there are some constraints as we talked about on increasing production in the near term it may be that demand destruction is what we need to get but i will say is implicit in that is that s a recessionary prediction if you re predicting that there s less demand that people are going to go around drive less produce less goods etc the definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of slowing economic activity whenever you hear those demand destruction predictions just get to understand what they are they re a recessionary production ricky mulvey nick thanks so much nick sciple thanks for having me chris hill that s all for today be coming up tomorrow a conversation with tess vigeland host of the wall street journal s new podcast on the future of work as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against we don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow

because we re talking about investing trends with legs motley fool money starts now i m chris hill joined by motley fool senior analyst jason moser thanks for being here jason moser hey thanks for having me chris hill everybody loves a good trend right jason moser sure chris hill we re investors we love a good trend lately i don t know if you ve noticed as the market has continued its grim slide of 2022 that doesn t stop potential trends from emerging here or there i wanted to talk with you about how to figure out which trends have legs and which ones don t i ll just start with an example of one that i think for me anyway doesn t really have legs and it goes under the umbrella of because of reasons this industry has sold off tremendously therefore it presents an opportunity for investors because it s trading below where it should be the one that leaves to mind for me that s come up several times over the past two plus years is the cruise industry and that may be a good short term opportunity for some people i m not interested in that because it s not an industry that i think has great long term tailwinds behind it i don t mean to pick on the cruise industry but you know what i m talking about there are some trends that get a lot of attention but it s for short term reasons jason moser yeah i m glad you said short term reasons because i agree with what you re saying i think the way i typically try to break this down in my own mind and i ve talked before about the way that i invest as a long term investor someone who typically like to be a net buyer of stocks i d like to buy i don t really like selling typically i am looking for companies that i feel they re going to be relevant for decades figuring out and following the long term trend in differentiating that between what i would call a short term catalyst and so i think that the cruise example there is a good example of something where there s a short term catalyst before 2020 i don t know that cruise ships were really a place where i was interested in investing it sounds you feel the same way it s just not an industry that you re all that interested in i think that s how i start to at least look at this because you could look at the cruise liners for example and say well i m not all that interested but by the same token it does feel there s a short term catalysts in place that could result in value for shareholders if things continue to improve the travel industry in general has been shellacked but things are starting to come back there were a lot of questions early on in 2020 as to whether these major cruise liners would even survive they did a good job i think of figuring out ways to survive and keeping their balance sheets in working order there but i think for me you see the benefit of a reopen and then say alright cruise liners could benefit from that the stock s been may start to reflect that optimism but beyond that short term catalyst is there something there do you see more people clamoring to go on cruises as the years go by i m not convinced that s the case i think it s a relevant industry i think there are people who love to take cruises but i think there are also a lot of risks that come with something like that for me it s trying to think about what direction the world is headed and i ll be honest with you i m sure you probably can relate to this as a parent i looked at my kids i have two daughters they re are at sophomore junior and high school i looked at them and their friends and what they re doing what they re watching the apps that they re using ways that they re conducting their business that to me starts to tell a little bit more about consumer behavior trends that may be forming things that matter to younger generations that will continue to matter even as they get older i typically try to break it down between looking at a long term trend versus a short term catalysts in figuring out ways to discern between the two chris hill if you think back to last year in the late spring one of the big trends getting a lot of attention was what was referred to as the great reopening jason moser yeah chris hill it seems we re at that point again as omicron levels continue to drop vaccines continue to rise more and more businesses we talked about this last friday on motley fool money about some of the biggest tech companies in america opening up their offices mask mandates coming down you were talking to the folks at cheddar and i m happy to share jason moser as a resource our with media outlets you re welcome cheddar but seriously you were talking to them about this trend weren t you jason moser yeah we were talking about reopening and to me it feels like reopening 2 0 we did go through a reopening before where i think a lot of us are starting to get back out there and resuming somewhat normal behavior this is the next iteration of that where i think the wall start to come down and even more people start to go out and really get their lives back to normal we were talking about ideas investments companies that will benefit from this next phase of reopening and then what future they may have even beyond that because i would look at reopening as definitely a short term catalyst this is not something where the long term trend is for our economy to reopen and so for me that doesn t mean that there aren t great ideas out there that doesn t mean there s no money to be made but by the same token and i think we said this a lot when we were talking about the stay at home stock theme that we were delving into a couple of years ago you want to make sure that regardless these are businesses that you feel will continue to do well even beyond the short term catalysts because this short term catalyst will end and then you want to make sure that you re not left holding the bag with the business that maybe isn t going to continue to benefit beyond just that catalyst for me there are a lot of different ways you can look at the companies that will benefit from this i mean you re talking about incremental traffic in all places people going back to work office buildings getting busier the areas around the office buildings getting busier malls getting busier so what companies can you expect a benefit there to me there are a lot of different ways you can look at it i think travel is one that stands out immediately just because so many people are ready to go do something we saw some of the snap back in travel earlier through the course of this last couple of years but it does look things continue to get even better i was looking through booking holdings for example their most recent earnings call they were talking about the fact that they are seeing the trends continuing to move in the right direction they said the first half of february they saw meaningful improvement across all of their regions compared to january but then they made this reference to gross bookings they said gross bookings for the summer are higher than they were at this time in 2019 so that s encouraging for a number of different reasons and it sounds a lot of people are planning trips i know that we are both planning to get a trip and i m going to be going a few places here over the summer as well looking forward to that but when you think about just the fact that gross bookings for the summer are higher than they were at this time in 2019 that s really encouraging the nice thing about travel is it s truly a global opportunity i think travel is going to continue to be a long term trend that investors can benefit from so booking holdings stands out as one way to look at this reopen 2 0 chris hill it is interesting the difference as you said the long term trend versus the short term catalysts because ultimately there has to be something sustainable there has to be something about an underlying business that we as investors can see a pathway for growth which and this may be just my preference i always prefer organic growth as opposed to growth through acquisition it s not to say that that doesn t work there are plenty of businesses that have rewarded shareholders by going the route of acquisition but to me it s just preferable to see a business like i ve talked before about home depot and lowe s and not that they do a tremendous amount of increasing their store count year over year but you look at the way that they ve grown out their online presence their deliveries that sort of thing that s just easier for me to wrap my head around jason moser well yeah i think home depot and lowe s two very good examples of businesses that i think could certainly benefit here over the next several months as consumer traffic continues to pick up we ve seen the strength in the housing market over the past couple of years and the neat thing about housing is whether you own or you rent home improvement maintenance all that stuff is always on the table that s to me one of the most obvious long term trends out there because everybody needs a roof over their head you look at home depot and lowe s the quarters that they just chalked up to be able to maintain their gross margins in a time like this when inflation really is front and center lowe s actually expanded their gross margin very modestly home depot a little bit of pressure but overall they ve really been able to maintain prices very well and passes these costs along to consumers i think part of that is just due to the nature of the market that it serves it s a necessary market then they love to throw the statistics out there 50 percent of the homes here in the us are over 40 years old a lot has changed in 40 years the ways that we build houses the ways that we ve repair our homes and update and improve our homes what that ultimately means is you get this massive installed housing base out there just in this country alone that really requires a lot of what home depot and lowe s are selling they may not be the sexiest names in the world and they may not like the world on fire in the near term but when you stretch the chart out if you look at the way these companies performed through the years 3 5 10 years they are just tremendous performers lowe s in particularly you look at what marvin ellison has done there that has been just nothing short of spectacular i think what we ve got now is really two businesses there in lowe s and home depot that you and i have likened before to mastercard and visa it s almost like a which one should i pick why bother choosing you could actually own both and get away with it just fine it s not a bad idea actually chris hill not a bad idea at all last thing and then i ll let you go when you think about long term trends i suppose there are a couple of different ways you can think about them one is to try and predict where the future is going and be right not only about the direction but the timing of how soon we re going to get there i was on david gardner s rule breaker investing podcast recently and on an episode that were set in the year 2052 and one of the jokes we made on that was that self driving cars still not a thing and it may not be by the way that s one way to do it like ok this is where the world is going but another way to do it is to look at trends right now and say ok do i think this is going to be here in 20 years you can say that about individual products you can also say that about industries it s why whenever someone has a new baby and he s like i want to buy a stock for them my answer is always starbucks because i know that the way we drink coffee in 50 years is going to look a whole lot like the way we drink it now jason moser if it looks any different starbucks is probably going to be one of the companies that is innovating and iterating there so you probably win either way yeah i think to me one of the trends that i think it s front and center right now for a lot of people is work exactly how we re going to be working we re talking about stay at home now we re talking about reopen it s been a weird two years there re offices that never closed down and then there are other offices that just have closed down completely and you wonder what exactly the future holds i look to a business like microsoft for example and i think it s very telling that you ve got a lot of these big tech companies that are reopening their offices they re eager and excited to do that and i think that s for a number of reasons i think that you ve seen some of the ceos of these businesses twitter for example they re talking about the fact that yes remote work is available but it is harder it makes things a lot more difficult i m sure probably you run into some challenges where remote work does make things harder but by the same token there are a lot of folks that like that convenience in being able to go do what they want to do when they want to go do it it certainly expands that work schedule for me i look at the absolutes as being probably what you want to avoid if you re saying well we re just going to be a virtual only company you re probably leaving something on the table there but if you say that well everybody has to be at the office all the time well you re leaving some talent out there that you might not be able to get otherwise to me the hybrid work environment that s what seems like the future holds you look at a company like microsoft a company that s responsible for getting so many of those tools that we ve been able to use whether you re slack or zoom or microsoft teams microsoft teams and all of the tools that microsoft provides they help enable what ultimately i think we re going to see is the hybrid work environment where a lot of folks have the opportunity to do it however they want to do it but companies still have a process and a philosophy in place that leaves everybody feeling included i think that s probably one of the bigger challenges i think that s going to be one of the things that companies will figure out as time goes on is managing the remote and the physically present workforce together not saying that s an easy thing to do but i think that s going to be something that companies are going to have to do because to me again it feels like you ve take it to the extreme if you go absolutes one way or the other that to me seems to open up more challenges of opportunities the longer you play that out chris hill jason moser thanks for being here jason moser thank you chris hill remember back in high school when your english teacher taught you how to write a thesis statements it s the main idea of your essay and you are not going to get an a without a strong thesis statement it turns out that s one of those skills that comes in handy for investors like you and me here to talk through the nuts and bolts of an investment thesis is motley fool senior analyst alicia alfiere thanks for being here alicia alfiere thanks for having me chris hill before we get into some of the key questions that can go into an investment thesis why do you think an exercise like this is helpful for us as investors alicia alfiere first when we think of an investment thesis it s really a summary of what you think of the company and why you think it makes a good investment case as well as some of the risks it s really important particularly now when we are seeing a lot of market volatility the idea here is that i will help you cut through all the noise of that market volatility and focused on signals for your company and hopefully stop you from selling a company that s actually pretty good chris hill i know that you ve been using duolingo let s use that as an example here and some of the key questions that people can ask when they are looking to build an investment thesis for any business for any stock and it starts with really knowing the company alicia alfiere this one sounds like a no brainer but there are actually companies out there that require a little bit extra time and research to be able to answer questions like what does this company sell do what problem are they solving who are their customers how do they make money that s really fundamental to understand if we use duolingo as an example here duolingo is a global mobile learning platform with the mission to develop the best educational content in the world and make it universally available they offer a gamified approach to learning over 40 languages and they offer a lot of different solutions here they have their flagship duolingo learning language app which is free they have duolingo plus which is a subscription duolingo english test which is a proficiency exam and duolingo for schools essentially the problem that they re solving here is making education accessible to the mobile generation and their lessons are pretty effective according to their internal study users with five duolingo units were as proficient in reading and listening as students with four college semesters of language classes then in terms of how do they make money again really important to understand they make most of their money from their subscription products the rest comes from the premium apps so those are based revenues and revenues from their english tax chris hill every business has competition so obviously it is worth spending a minute or two when you re putting together an investment thesis thinking about competitive advantages that a business might have alicia alfiere look at the competition within the industry is there a product or service sticky does the business have network effects when we talk about network effects think of a platform like facebook where you have this virtuous circle of data which makes your users use it more which brings in more data which allows you to get more insights which again makes that product even more valuable in terms of duolingo they are in a highly competitive industry lots of options to learn new languages whether it s a virtual or in person classes other apps and websites and there is substitution items that you could use as well like translator apps but what advantages does duolingo have they have a strong brand they have had over 500 million downloads and their flagship app is the top grossing app in the education category on google play and the apple app store this strong brand recognition really helps to drive organic growth for them they also have strong network effects so 41 7 million monthly active users which includes a us contingent that actually out numbers total us high school foreign language learners which a massive amount here they have over a half billion exercises completed daily on the platform and as a result of that strong network duolingo beliefs they have the largest collection of language learning data and they feed this virtual cycle of their network by using their collection of data to make learning experiences more efficient and differentiated for its users in terms of platform stickiness over 50 percent of daily active users have used the app for more than seven days in a row and one million users have an active stretch of longer than 365 days pretty impressive there but there are some tricky parts here for paid subscribers it s a bit more complicated about 40 percent of annual subscribers renew their subscriptions after a year or about nine percent of monthly subscribers renew their subscription after one year they got some work to do here chris hill at the motley fool we re not just interested in the business we re interested in the management as well it s worth spending time figuring out hey who are the people running this business alicia alfiere absolutely take a look at who are the co founders who is leading the company do they have a long term vision what s their culture like remember their employees are what make a vision come to life if employees don t buy in it s going to be really hard for a company to grow for duolingo it was founded by luis von ahn and severin hacker two engineers who met at carnegie mellon luis is the ceo and director severin is the cto and director they re both heavily involved in the company which we really like for luis growing up in guatemalan he saw how access to education can truly transform lives and when he met his kindred spirit in safran the two embarked are creating an accessible effective and intelligent learning solution while they started with languages their long term goal is to have language learning be just one of the education solutions that they offer they ve already started along this path they have their literacy app duolingo abc which teaches children how to read and they re working on an app to teach elementary school math for culture i like to look at website like glassdoor to see what employees think do they like working there are they dedicated to vision on glassdoor 93 percent of employees would recommend duolingo to a friend and 97 percent approve of the ceo so pretty solid results here chris hill we say all the time investing is about the future at some point when you re putting together an investment thesis you got to check a couple of boxes in terms of what does the future look like for this business alicia alfiere yes think about the future what s the market opportunity for them can they grow how can they grow are there any broader trends that can help or hurt the company in the future for duolingo they re a player in a growing market the mobile learning space preferences for convenience an on demand services have driven a lot of consumers toward mobile solutions whether it s shopping or learning and covid accelerated the usage for mobile learning though the growth will probably edge away from some of that covid highs it s still expected to grow global language learning spending both online and offline reached 61 billion in 2019 and is projected to grow to 115 billion by 2025 within this market online learning is growing fast from 12 billion in 2019 to 47 billion in 2025 perhaps the convenience and flexibility of mobile learning as well as smartphone adoption overall is broadening the demand for that language learning products since duolingo s annual revenues were about 161 million in 2020 they re only about 1 3 percent of the current market for online language learning which gives them a ton of room to grow they have a plan to grow which is really important they think that they could grow by increasing the number of users converting free users to those paid subscription users increasing subscription stickiness which we already talked about and expanding their solutions beyond that language learning chris hill we want to be bullish when we re thinking about stock that we re considering adding to our portfolio but at some point you have to put on the bare hat and think about what are the risks to this business alicia alfiere because every investment has risks that s the nature of the beast and if you can t find one you need to research more be curious play the part of the skeptic and ask what could go wrong this is especially important in times of market volatility for duolingo we already talked about some of the issues that they have here operating in a highly competitive environment and subscription retention numbers that could be better but there s also another issue we didn t talk about and that s low switching costs what that means that it doesn t really cost a lot of money and it s not a huge hassle for users to simply change apps or take in person costs instead and so that is another risk chris hill you ve clearly put in some work on duolingo tell me how the story ends is this stock you re adding to your portfolio or is it on your watchlist for right now alicia alfiere well right now it s more on my watchlist at the end of this process what i like to do is summarize and actually hey what would the investment thesis look like in this case i would say duolingo has gamified approach to learning which has helped the company build a strong brand and benefit from strong network effects in some platform stickiness with these competitive advantages strong tailwinds from online education trends a large market to expand into and a plan for expansion duolingo is an intriguing company by subscription retention statistics and those low switching costs give me a bit of a pause for right now i m going to continue to follow them and research them because i find this company fascinating and a really value leadership s vision and plans for the future chris hill do you ve more information about putting together your own investment thesis in our show notes so check those out when you get a chance alicia alfiere thanks so much for being here alicia alfiere thanks for having me chris hill that s all for today i will be coming up tomorrow three analysts share some of the biggest investing lessons that they ve learned over the past 20 years as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow

the ceo recently highlighted the growing value of paramount s content library what happened shares of paramount global para 0 55 formerly viacomcbs were up 9 8 as of 12 31 p m et on monday this performance is noteworthy on a day when the nasdaq composite was down 1 3 at the time of this writing the move follows comments made at a recent investor conference that might suggest paramount global is open to being acquired so what during the morgan stanley technology media and telecom conference on march 8 paramount global ceo robert bakish said our investment strategy is increasing optionality because we re gaining more and more control over high quality content investors are taking that as a cue that management might be open to a sale paramount global has previously been linked to possible offers by large streaming providers like amazon and apple last year amazon acquired mgm for 8 45 billion which gives amazon a treasure trove of more than 4 000 films to bring to prime video it would take a large company with cash to burn to buy paramount given its market cap of 22 billion paramount global has been active on the dealmaking front lately the company already has the iconic hollywood studio with a movie catalog that goes back 110 years but it s expanding with more last year it acquired a majority interest in fox telecolombia and estudios teleméxico from walt disney now what paramount s deep content library would obviously be worth a lot to one of the top streaming platforms as amazon s mgm deal suggests but this is all speculation at this point meanwhile paramount global is doing well on its own the company reported a blockbuster fourth quarter with revenue increasing 16 year over year paramount was the star of the show with revenue up 84 year over year driven by strong subscriber growth

of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions paid in 2022 will be made after the end of the year the fund is subject to federal income tax on its taxable income unlike most investment companies any taxes paid by the fund will reduce the amount available to pay distributions to stockholders and therefore investors in the fund will likely receive lower distributions than if they

production china s sow beginning stocks in 2022 expected to exceed 2021 by 1 percent sow beginning stocks in 2022 are estimated at 40 million head china s ministry of agriculture and rural affairs mara noted that 2021 sow inventory is oversupplied and exceeded prescribed levels animal disease had a smaller than expected effect in 2021 according to mara information and sow stocks continued growing despite hog and pork price declines publicly traded hog producers suffered significant losses in 2021 according to released financial statements and media reports to stem financial losses and generate cash reports indicate that large hog producers culled substantial numbers of inefficient sows china requires producers provinces to maintain national sow inventory at 41 million on september 23 2021 mara published the interim implementation plan to manage swine production capacity see gain report ch2021 0121 this plan aims to stabilize the swine sector from dramatic fluctuations by providing production targets the plan requires the national sow inventory to be maintained at 41 million and specifies a normal inventory target for each province area that should not fluctuate more than 5 percent the central government will use control measures if production is outside the targeted range the plan also provides support for large scale farms defined as more than 500 head industry contacts indicate these measures could further accelerate concentration in the swine sector new asf strain appears to be less fatal more manageable in 2022 hog losses from animal diseases are expected to fall but asf is expected to remain endemic in october 2021 the harbin veterinary research institute of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas identified a less virulent new strain of asf this strain appears to be less fatal to hog sow and piglet populations hog producers and provincial authorities have adapted production and slaughter practices to mitigate against large losses and disease spread see footnote 1 below 1 in 2021 china s swine sector noted substantial production increasing piglet hog and pork inventories this exacerbated declines in prices through the end of 2021 see chart 1 below significant swine sector losses boost culling of inefficient sows in 2021 media reports indicated that low hog and pork prices quickened the culling of inefficient sows as producers looked to increase cash liquidity reports indicated that one of the top five publicly traded hog producers in china announced that in 2021 primarily in the second half of the year they had culled 2 2 million inefficient sows bringing their total year end sow inventory to just under 400 000 head in december 2021 mara announced that while the fertile sow population had been declining since july 2021 the overall supply exceeded the target population and that china would aim to keep the sow population to around 41 million head note china s official national bureau of statistics nbs had the sow population at the end of 2021 at 43 29 million sows higher than industry estimates suggest industry sources have noted that some producers are retaining and raising piglets in anticipation of an increase in piglet and breeding swine prices concerns mount regarding china s publicly traded hog companies reports indicate that china s top twelve publicly traded companies registered losses totaling nearly 80 billion in 2021 investors are increasingly concerned that public companies may not be able to ride out prolonged low prices without substantial financial assistance or subsidy from central provincial or local agencies see chart 2 below in september 2021 mara announced the establishment of a national swine production adjustment base for swine farms with over 10 000 head which emphasizes support for large hog producers provinces like jiangxi and henan the homebase of two of china s largest publicly traded hog companies have provided a variety of subsidies to producers including access to low cost loans to maintain production targets and avoid further stock shocks hog production is estimated to exceed 2021 rates by 2 percent in 2022 hog production is estimated to reach 665 million hogs exceeding 2021 higher beginning sow inventories coupled with more efficient breeding sows are expected to improve hog production by 2 percent in 2022 further growth in hog production is expected to be stifled by government policies that are designed to stabilize the swine sector and limit production volatility see above consumer demand for pork has been weak and is expected to remain weak throughout 2022 industry sources note that consumers diversified meat consumption during the high pork price period following outbreaks of asf and that these changes in preferences appear to have persisted even as pork prices declined in 2021 reportedly weak consumer demand higher supplies and product availability dramatically lowered national pork prices in 2021 see chart 2 above finally high feed costs are estimated to continue through 2022 putting further pressure on profits making substantial expansion less attractive trade 2022 live swine imports expected to decline as sow herd stabilizes in 2022 live swine imports are expected to decline to 20 000 head live swine imports have historically been relatively low and recent growth was spurred by the desire to improve herd genetics while pork prices were high see chart 3 below however costs for transporting testing and delivering imported hogs are reportedly unrealistic for china s hog producers at current hog prices reports indicate that some large producers are establishing nuclear herds to centralize breeding within their facilities those producers increasingly focused on vertical integration while others have returned to relying on breeders to supply piglets in 2022 live hog imports will be dominated by long term partners such as the united states demark france and the united kingdom in september 2021 ireland signed an agreement with the general administration of customs of the people s republic of china gacc to ship breeding swine industry sources note that breeding swine from the united states are preferred because of hog size higher survival rates and higher meat production efficiency rates danish origin breeding swine are popular due to higher rates of piglet production on average over the life span of the breeding sow swine import and export estimates for 2021 are revised from usda official data based on information from china customs exports estimated to rise to 900 000 head dominated by hong kong and macao in 2022 china s live swine exports are estimated at 900 000 head a similar level as 2021 see chart 4 below china mainly exports live swine to hong kong and macao consumer preferences in hong kong and macao favor hot fresh pork meat which supports the export of live hogs for immediate slaughter read more about china s pork production supply and

liz peek get ready here comes the biden recession at a recent confab president biden s imperiled party pushed a new message democrats deliver the proposed slogan was panned democrats were terrified republicans would respond with yes democrats deliver crushing inflation soaring crime an open border critical race theory for tots full term abortions on demand a woke military high taxes and out of control spending and now will joe biden s democrats deliver a recession yes just when you thought things could not get worse along comes the very real possibility of a downturn thanks to bidenomics the war in ukraine and an inept federal reserve a year ago during a robust recovery such a forecast would have seemed ludicrous a top wall street economist recently conducted an informal poll of his firm s clients to his surprise 100 percent thought the u s would be in a recession by next year why such gloom it starts with accelerating inflation caused by out of control government spending and measures taken by the biden white house that kept workers on the sidelines inflation is also being fueled by soaring energy prices thanks to lower u s production amid reviving growth and now the disruption to russian oil exports the past four recessions have been preceded by sharp hikes in energy prices 120 oil is a red flag to combat spiraling prices the federal reserve must begin raising rates aggressively which will slow growth investors hope the central bank will manage a soft landing history tells us the odds are low and especially for today s fed which has been behind the curve for months combined with sinking optimism down stock markets and declining real incomes the stage is set for a slump after initially dismissing spiraling inflationover the past year and then blaming supply chain snafus and greedy corporations the white house is now saying russian president vladimir putinis responsible unfortunately for biden most voters disagree in the latest wall street journal poll 63 percent disapprovedof biden s handling of inflation moreover by a wide margin respondents chose republicans over democrats as better able to handle rising prices voters know that democrats signature government spend a thons have driven 40 year high inflation which surged from 1 4 percent in january when biden took office to 5 4 percent in june and last month to 7 9 percent biden signed into law the 1 9 trillion american rescue plan arp just three months after congress passed a 900 billion package it brought total covid related spending to 5 7 trillion more than was spent fighting world war ii the risk is not doing enough biden told reportersat the time actually it turned out the risk was doing too much biden says the arp was necessary to rescue the economy but that is not true the u s was growing at over 6 percent the quarter that biden took office the arp exploded already strong demand and led to shortages and inevitably rising prices simply stated it created too much money chasing too few goods it also included myriad benefits that allowed workers to stay home worsening a deepening labor shortage and kicking off what has become a wage price spiral astonishingly even now with voters saying inflation is their number one issue democrats and some republicans still see no reason to slow the gusher of federal funds consider the recent 1 5 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by congress last week after no hearings no discussion and with only hours available for legislators to review the more than 2 700 page package as reportedin the wall street journal the bill was chock full of earmarks like a 3 million museum in houston celebrating the life of mahatma gandhi and 1 6 million for the development of equitable growth of shellfish aquaculture small potatoes maybe but in the aggregate costly beyond measure soaring energy costs are also clearly a major factor in the recent inflation surge biden is blaming putin but voters know that of the 1 75 hike in gasoline prices fully 1 predated the war in ukraine one dollar per gallon which is robbing americans of 400 million every single day oil markets were tight even before the war mainly because opec has limited production increases and because u s output fell almost 2 million barrels per day from late 2019 to early 2021 as covid cut demand as people began to travel and demand recovered american oil companies have been slow to ramp up production given the hostility of the biden white house towards u s fossil fuels a posture the white house has stubbornly maintained even as gas prices reach record levels meanwhile americans are becoming more pessimistic the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index sank to the lowest level in 11 years in february worse than expected respondents were especially gloomy about the future and about price increases projecting inflation one year out of 5 4 percent the highest such forecast since 1981 considering the robust jobs market the dismal reading is surprising but real wages are down 2 6 percentover the past year people know when they re falling behind recession in 2023 is not yet the consensus to be sure after all the economy is still motoring ahead driven by a 40 percent increase in the money supply over the past two years rising nominal wages and a near record low inventory to sales ratio which means that even with rising uncertainty many businesses will continue to invest in restocking goods but the odds of biden s recession are rising fast what more will democrats deliver comments are closed

stocks lost more ground crude oil prices fell and bond yields rose sharply monday as anxiety over the war in ukraine and an upcoming federal reserve meeting on interest rates keep global financial markets on edge the s p 500 gave up an early gain and closed 0 7 lower after another choppy day of trading on wall street the dow jones industrial average closed essentially flat and the nasdaq composite fell 2 the pullback came as the yield on the 10 year treasury touched its highest level since the summer of 2019 elsewhere around the world markets pulled in opposing directions european markets climbed while stocks fell sharply in hong kong after the neighboring city of shenzhen was ordered into a shutdown to combat china s worst covid 19 outbreak in two years oil prices tumbled to take some pressure off the high inflation sweeping the world with a barrel of u s crude falling toward 100 after touching 130 last week markets have careened in recent weeks amid uncertainty about whether the economy may be heading for a toxic combination of stagnating growth and persistently high inflation russia s invasion of ukraine has caused prices to surge for oil wheat and other commodities produced in the region that in turn has led to sharp day to day and hour to hour reversals across markets as expectations for worsening inflation rise and fall on monday negotiators from russia and ukraine met over video conference for a new round of talks after the two sides expressed some optimism in the past few days the talks ended without a breakthrough after several hours the negotiators took a technical pause ukrainian presidential aide mykhailo podolyak said and planned to meet again tuesday investors were already uneasy before the war began because central banks around the world are preparing to shut off the stimulus they pumped into the global economy after the pandemic struck the federal reserve s policymaking committee is meeting this week for example brand connections you re seeing pretty muted trading today and people aren t going to get too short or long ahead of the fed said jay hatfield ceo of infrastructure capital advisors we expect the market to stay pretty range bound until the fed meeting on wednesday the wide expectation is that it will raise its key short term interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on wednesday it would be the first increase since 2018 and it would pull the federal funds rate off its record low of nearly zero finally the fed gets moving economists at bofa global research wrote in a report besides raising short term rates the fed may also give more details about how it will put into reverse the massive bond buying program it ran during the pandemic to keep long term rates low the economists wrote the central bank bought trillions of dollars of bonds to shower the economy with cash uncertainty about the next developments in the conflict in ukraine and what the fed will do this week has opened the market to daily swings as investors try to position themselves for whatever comes next last week the s p 500 marked its fourth losing week out of the last five on monday the benchmark index fell 31 20 points to 4 173 11 while the dow inched up 1 05 points after wobbling between small gains and losses earlier leaving it essentially unchanged at 32 945 24 the nasdaq fell 262 59 points to 12 581 22 small company stocks also fell the russell 2000 index slid 37 95 points or 1 9 to 1 941 72 the fed s moves this week are likely to be the first in a long march to raise interest rates and slow the economy enough to stamp out the highest inflation to hit the united states in 40 years the yield on the 10 year treasury jumped to 2 14 from 2 00 late friday after earlier touching its highest level since july 2019 the two year yield which moves more on expectations for fed policy changes rose to 1 86 from 1 75 the fed faces twin dangers though if it raises rates too quickly or too high it would cause a recession if it s too passive high inflation could become more permanent the war in ukraine makes the balancing act even more difficult it s pushing inflation higher by raising prices for everything from nickel to natural gas and it s threatening to pull down on economic growth that s why the s p 500 is coming off its fourth weekly loss in the last five while crude oil prices are up by

according to media reports the sec has announced that it will propose rules mandating disclosure from publicly traded companies about climate change and associated risks on march 21st this is a highly anticipated development the sec has been expected to propose such rules for several months and these regulations were thought to be a centerpiece of the climate agenda of the biden administration once the proposed rules are available for review the impact of such regulations on corporate america can better be evaluated nonetheless the very fact that the sec will propose such rules concerning mandatory climate disclosures is itself highly significant the sec is taking action to advance a climate regulatory agenda through the financial markets that has been stymied elsewhere in the administrative state further the sec is now taking steps to bring the united states into parity with other advanced economies many of which particularly in europe are also using financial disclosures to advance regulations designed to address the issue of global climate change we should also expect however that these new rules will be subject to legal challenge from the moment of announcement additionally whether these proposed rules are ultimately implemented will likely depend on the political fortunes of the biden administration the announcement on march 21st will simply be the first step in a long and complicated process

offering college course website iim lucknow iiml executive programme in fintech banking applied risk management visit indian school of business isb professional certificate in product management visit indian school of business isb product management visit iit delhi iitd certificate programme in data science machine learning visit japan s softbank has engaged with indian conglomerates tata group and mahindras for a potential investment rajeev misra ceo sb investment advisers which manages softbank vision fund said in an interview at the et global business summit the discussions have been ongoing for six months he said tatas have been in talks with global investors including some sovereign and pension money managers to fund its digital foray as et reported earlier misra also spoke about the rebalancing of private tech valuation amid a broader slump in the public markets and the overall macro concerns edited excerpts last year october saw the peak in tech stocks after which investors started worrying about inflation and the fed said it will taper the bond buybacks faster so we had a one and a half year liquidity boom from may 2020 to october 2021 with zero rates a lot of subsidy checks going out to investors and a lot of retail participation in the stock markets but it s nothing to do with the 2008 crisis because the banks and the financial system are in good shape the cash flow for companies is actually not down some of them are up if you look at india versus the us the us index has 40 tech in it while india is small at 12 13 tech as for the russian crisis it will be a prolonged affair the west will pay for higher inflation it s not just oil it s wheat it is soybean 25 of the wheat production in the world is from ukraine and russia and there is a drought in latin america so soybean and wheat products are down so you will have ramifications on hydrocarbon inflation food inflation european exports to russia among others number one private financing was available in plenty in 2020 and 2021 which will be limited i can see the change already today between december and january so if a company is raising early stage 50 150 million and you have to write 20 million cheques there is a lot of crowd willing to do that but if the company is trying to raise 250 or 500 million they re struggling to find the lead investor who will come in with 100 150 million yes in the last few weeks in the private markets we have seen certain investors back out after verbal commitments also the power of capital has shifted back to the capital provider i had to go and beg why we at softbank are a decent brand and how we can help which is all true founders had multiple choices of investors sending them term sheets in one week without detailed due diligence and so on where they decided the price and the valuation that has changed we have analysed 300 plus of our companies and put them in three buckets ones which have capital on the balance sheet for more than two years those that have more than a year which is worrisome and firms which have a runway of less than a year which means they need to raise funds in the next 6 12 months in that bucket we are working with them so that they can pick up financing at whatever valuation telling them don t get greedy what happened last year was a lot of companies didn t raise a lot of money thinking that their valuation will go up and why dilute too much now if you look at softbank fund i in 2017 19 we invested 83 billion in 80 plus companies at an average ticket size of 1 billion fund ii we invested 51 billion across 220 companies 150 million each why not because we pulled back but because nobody was raising much they said why dilute we can raise a year later at a higher valuation and the next point is that the ipo market which is the final frontier for raising capital is also getting very selective no the good news is we have capital our team is working hard in india if you were in my shoes you would do the same you would sit back and wait for the market to rationalise in valuations and find interesting opportunities i mean if you read warren buffett s newsletter you know at 92 he is not in a rush to deploy capital he is sitting on 110 billion of cash yes we have slowed down not because we have said no to investments but because we re not finding enough investments around the globe at the right valuation by definition it takes time because it is sticky we are speaking to a couple of conglomerates tata mahindra who have amazing offline reach amazing brands they don t have to spend on customer acquisition because they have consumers across all their platforms it will come down to two things the valuation and how independent and aligned is the management if the management doesn t have esops doesn t have independence we ll get stuck in the bureaucracy of the organisation and won t be able to make decisions fast enough then it doesn t work for any of us even softbank trying to do it or ibm trying to do it or microsoft or google large organisations are not as nimble as a founder led organisation a founder led organisation is very different from an employee run organisationwe have been working for six months there will be issues with one or two ipos getting mispriced but that doesn t mean tech ipos will not be a big part of the indian stock market going forward like it is in the west as for the paytm ipo we were a large shareholder with around 20 stake we didn t decide the valuation price it was decided by the bankers and the company and the board so it was 20 billion where it went public as is today in the range of 8 9 billion perhaps that is not the right price and has to grow into that price policybazaar is doing well which is a profitable company and growing step by step it depends on the company delhivery is the market leader in logistics which is a key sector firstcry an omnichannel retailer for children and mothers lenscart will come at some point which is

the new york state assembly and senate began passing their versions of the state budget monday and both houses led by democrats propose spending more than 6 billion above democratic gov kathy hochul s spending plan assembly speaker carl heastie said his house is adding an additional 3 billion to help fix a broken child care system and revive the economy he said it includes money to pay workers higher wages and subsidize costs for lower income parents the expansion of child care is very important said heastie who added that without adequate child care many women have to choose between caring for their children and going to work the senate is proposing over 4 billion in additional funds for child care saying the goal is to provide universal access senate finance committee chair liz krueger said both houses also want to reduce chronic shortages of home health care workers by boosting what are often poverty level wages we need to be able to pay them a wage that even provides them enough money to pay for a car to drive to their job kruger said and right now the wages are so low they can t even afford to take the jobs hochul s 216 billion budget plan already increased state spending by more than 5 from the previous year she was able to do so because of generous federal relief packages earlier in the pandemic and higher than expected tax collections including a new income tax surcharge on the wealthy fiscal watchdog groups warned that the final budget should not spend more than the governor has proposed the citizens budget commission s patrick orecki said with the additional funds hochul and the legislature have been given a rare opportunity to finally end new york s chronic year to year budget deficits orecki said the governor s plan is carefully balanced to rein in projected deficits until 2026 he said any additions would result in higher future budget gaps before then any new spending that you layer on top of what was already in the executive budget is just going to create a gap in the out years orecki said both houses say their plans are balanced for the next two years but could not say whether their spending plans would create deficits after that orecki also said lawmakers should put aside more money in reserve funds he said the governor s budget proposed that 5 billion be set aside but the senate and assembly budgets reduce that amount by 1 8 billion he said new york s finances are more precarious than in many other states new york state has a pretty potentially volatile revenue stream relying a lot on ultra high income earners and the performance of the stock market he said the legislature s budget plans in a departure from past practices leave out many items that the governor said were important to her including authorizing alcohol to go for the state s restaurants a revamping of the troubled state ethics commission and term limits for statewide elected offices in recent decades governors have increasingly included in their budgets policy items that are not directly related to state spending because they have more leverage over lawmakers during the budget process than during the rest of the year heastie said the democratic conference in his house wants to end that practice and keep the state spending plan separate from other issues i m not trying to send governor hochul a message i m just relaying the feelings and sentiments of the conference said heastie they just want to put forward a fiscal document the speaker said he expects the budget talks over the next few weeks with the governor to go smoothly he said hochul has set the tone by extending an olive branch to the legislature compared with the actions of past governors she has left a 2 billion pool of money from the federal relief funds so that the governor and legislature can decide together how best to spend it the budget is due by april 1

photo taken on jan 25 2022 shows the u s federal reserve in washington d c the united states photo by ting shen xinhua some economists have been calling for more aggressive rate hikes from the fed goldman sachs economists said last month that they expected seven 25 basis point rate hikes this year up from five it had projected earlier to contain hotter than expected inflation washington march 14 xinhua the u s federal reserve is widely expected to start raising interest rates from near zero this week as the ukraine conflict could further push up u s inflation which has been rising to the highest level in four decades economists said despite the geopolitical developments we still expect the fomc will hike the federal funds rate by 25 bps basis points at the conclusion of its march 15 16 meeting jay bryson chief economist at wells fargo securities said in a recent analysis referring to the federal open market committee the fed s policy making committee a near complete labor market recovery and inflation that is well above the central bank s target make the case clear for beginning the tightening cycle bryson said adding skyrocketing commodity prices and more potential supply chain disruptions due to the ukraine conflict create additional sources of inflationary pressure the consumer price index cpi last month surged 7 9 percent from a year earlier the largest 12 month growth since the period ending january 1982 according to the u s labor department at a congressional hearing earlier this month fed chair jerome powell said that he was inclined to support a 25 basis point rate hike at the march policy meeting the first move since the start of the covid 19 pandemic when asked about how international events would impact the fed s decision powell noted that before the ukraine crisis the fed was set to initiate a series of rate hikes this year powell said it s too soon to say for sure how the ongoing conflict the response from nations around the world including sanctions may have changed that expectation but for now the fed will proceed carefully with that plan consumers shop at a grocery store in washington d c the united states march 10 2022 photo by ting shen xinhua diane swonk chief economist at major accounting firm grant thornton said that the fed is expected to be demonstrably more hawkish than it was just a few months ago the statement following the fomc meeting is expected to highlight the need for a series of rate hikes while closely monitoring financial market conditions swonk said last week in a blog powell will be walking a tightrope balancing the needs to raise rates and rein in a more systemic rise in inflation with the need to avert a meltdown in credit markets she added desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute also said that higher international oil prices could exert considerable inflationary pressure and force the fed to be more aggressive on raising rates the fed s quarterly summary of economic projections to be released wednesday could show the median projection of 25 basis point rate hikes in 2022 rising from three to at least four and even more likely five bryson said some economists have been calling for more aggressive rate hikes from the fed goldman sachs economists said last month that they expected seven 25 basis point rate hikes this year up from five it had projected earlier to contain hotter than expected inflation people pass stores in the westfield shopping mall at the oculus in new york the united states on march 10 2022 photo by michael nagle xinhua joseph brusuelas chief economist at accounting and consulting firm rsm us llp warned that top line inflation may exceed 10 percent this year before settling into the high single digits to close out the year we have most likely arrived at a turning point where elevated inflation will define the economic narrative for several years that may require much higher interest rates than have been observed in recent years and will diminish the probability of central banks achieving a soft landing for the economy brusuelas said monday in an analysis we think the current price shock will shave roughly 1 to 1 5 percentage points off economic growth over the next 12 months brusuelas said adding the probability of a recession will most likely jump from the current 15 percent to about 33 percent in the coming weeks
the reckless escalation of economic political and military pressure by the united states and nato against russia is rapidly leading to a major global economic crisis with serious repercussions for the international working class the campaign against russia which includes a crippling sanctions regime aimed at starving out the russian people and which has all but cut off russia from the world economy is aimed at the conversion of that country into a colony of western imperialism and the plundering of its natural resources putin s invasion of ukraine while it is reactionary and must be opposed is the product of a years long campaign of escalating provocations by nato against russia using ukraine as bait millions around the world look at the unfolding events in eastern europe with anxiety and fear that they could rapidly escalate into a nuclear war but the crisis is also triggering immense economic dislocation that is driving towards a massive explosion of class conflict the orientation of those who seek to oppose the drive to a third world war must be as leon trotsky observed in 1934 not to the war map but to the map of the class struggle in a statement last week on the economic impact of the war and western sanctions against russia the international monetary fund predicted price shocks will have an impact worldwide especially on poor households for whom food and fuel are a higher proportion of expenses should the conflict escalate the economic damage would be all the more devastating the sanctions on russia will also have a substantial impact on the global economy and financial markets with significant spillovers to other countries this is already beginning to take place oil prices have reached 130 per barrel and in the united states gasoline prices at the pumps have surged past 4 a gallon to their highest levels ever in france the price of gas has gone from 1 65 per liter at the end of last year to 2 20 per liter or 9 16 per gallon wheat futures have already risen by 70 percent this year russia and ukraine together account for one quarter of all grain exports in europe industrial production is beginning to shut down due to soaring energy prices in the month of february us inflation reached 7 9 percent and in the eurozone it reached 5 8 percent the highest level on record since the creation of the single currency in 1997 inflation is expected to rise sharply in march as the consequences of sanctions reverberate throughout the world economy but among the worst hit will be developing countries in africa and the middle east starvation and famine in this region of the world is a real possibility eighty percent of grain in egypt is purchased from russia other major importers of russian grain include turkey bangladesh nigeria and yemen the impact on the working class will be enormous it is already reeling from more than two years of the pandemic in which millions have died and living standards have been eroded to the breaking point by inflation caused by pandemic induced chaos in global supply chains this social trauma is the product of the deliberate rejection of necessary public health measures by the world s governments above all the united states on the basis of herd immunity or the sacrificing of life to profit governments are using ukraine to deflect attention from the war which should be waged against the pandemic which is not over and is already beginning to surge again they are also using it to recast inflation which was already at its highest level in decades before the outbreak of war in ukraine as a putin price hike entirely the fault of russia in an attempt to deflect economic anxiety towards hatred of a foreign enemy but while the wealthiest layers of society including the most privileged layers of the middle class have been gripped with war hysteria there are no signs that this campaign is having any significant effect within the working class in a speech last week announcing a ban on russian oil imports to the united states president biden presented the economic impact of these measures in the united states as a necessary sacrifice in the name of defending freedom but neither biden nor anyone else ever bothered to ask workers in the united states much less workers in africa and the developing world whether they wanted to make such sacrifices for a reckless campaign that raises the danger of world war iii no such sacrifices are being demanded of the corporate oligarchy which will make money hand over fist from the war just as it has during the pandemic indeed the stock prices of major us defense contractors such as northrup grumman and raytheon have risen sharply in recent weeks western oil companies and agribusinesses are also licking their chops at the prospect of superprofits from worldwide shortages caused by the removal of their russian rivals the war in ukraine is being used as cover to redirect billions in resources away from social programs benefiting the working class towards war the latest spending bill making its way through congress includes nearly 800 billion for the military including 15 billion in spending for ukraine while omitting 15 billion in pandemic related funding the corporate media in britain is calling for the gutting of the postwar welfare state for the sake of increasing military spending most ominously germany has rammed through a tripling of the military budget for this year the largest increase since adolf hitler the attitude of the ruling class was summed up most crudely and bluntly by an op ed comment in the wall street journal whose headline declared nato needs more guns and less butter the phrase recalls the infamous statement by hermann goering that iron has always made an empire strong at most butter and lard have made the people fat the social consequences of this reckless campaign are preparations for a showdown between the working class and the capitalist class in each country in which mass anger will intersect with the growing radicalization which is already underway as a consequence of the pandemic the past two years have seen major strikes by industrial workers in the united states the growth of wildcat strikes throughout turkey the defiance of anti strike injunctions by health care workers in sri lanka and australia and other significant expressions of social opposition excerpted the nato campaign against russia will drive escalating class struggle across the world courtesy wsws org
