s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

over a half century queen elizabeth ii made three visits to virginia where her appearances marked pivotal points some of them wrenching for the british colony turned american state named more 400 years ago for her enthroned ancestor elizabeth i the queen who died thursday at age 96 made her initial visit in 1957 marking the 350th anniversary of jamestown the first permanent english speaking settlement in the new world her appearances at jamestown and williamsburg the colonial capital were for the conservative machine that controlled virginia a celebratory respite from growing tensions over a u s supreme court ruling three years earlier opening to black students previously white only public school classrooms at the reconstructed jamestown fort the queen and prince philip who died in 2021 noticed in its stocks according to an account by richmond times dispatch columnist charles mcdowell two unhappy looking prisoners elizabeth wondered aloud whether such confinement was painful with the prince asking if they had been pelted with rotten eggs when one of the prisoners said he d been punished for spreading gossip to this day the bane of britain s royal family del lewis mcmurrran d newport news an unapologetic anglophile and chairman of jamestown anniversary celebration referred to the men in the stocks as her majesty s loyal opposition elizabeth returned during the american bicentennial in 1976 as virginia s transition from rural backwater to suburban dynamo was accelerating she also would make a brief stop at arlington national cemetery during a visit to washington in 1991 her visit to monticello home of thomas jefferson and the jefferson founded university of virginia spotlighted virginia s role in shedding the british imperial yoke for representative democracy that paradoxically would perpetuate for more than 250 years black slavery that the english established here in 1619 it was in 2007 on elizabeth s final visit to virginia that the monarch in an address to the state legislature at the freshly renovated state capitol would note that the state s long story not unlike that of her realm had failed to fully acknowledge the roles of the indigenous peoples whose lands were seized by english colonists and whence sprang wealth achieved with the labor of enslaved black people that trip too would be something of a balm easing the sting of a mass shooting at virginia tech several weeks earlier in which 33 people died including the gunman speaking from the dais in the house of delegates elizabeth expressed condolences for the dreadful events at virginia tech offering on behalf of the people of the united kingdom my deepest sympathies at this time of such grief and sorrow she and philip would include in their stop in richmond a private meeting with students who had survived the mass slaying then the worst in u s history as well as families of students killed or wounded in the attack she and prince philip couldn t have been more solicitous sen tim kaine d va who was governor at the time said in an interview thursday with the times dispatch adding that the queen also visited with workers from the capitol restoration many of them hispanic in the old senate chamber where hangs a vast mural of the british defeat at yorktown in october 1781 behind the queen at the speaker s rostrum sat republican house speaker william howell of stafford and senate president pro tempore john chichester r stafford the pair then estranged over policy combined on a present for elizabeth a rare first edition book by jefferson they presented to her at a reception at the executive mansion recalling that moment howell said she was quite the lady noting too that the queen resembled his aunt margaret an english emigree known as billie in her remarks to the general assembly elizabeth said that the virginia colony named apparently at the suggestion of explorer sir walter raleigh for elizabeth i known as the virgin queen would become the foundation of a great nation founded on the eternal values of democracy and equality based on the rule of law and the promotion of freedom but elizabeth said she had learned since her 1957 visit that ideals and reality were in conflict fifty years on we are now in a position to reflect more candidly on the jamestown legacy she said human progress rarely comes without cost she added and those early years in jamestown when three great civilizations came together for the first time western european native american and african released a train of events which continues to have a profound social impact not only in the united states but also in the united kingdom and europe noting virginia s quadricentennial and the bicentennial of the abolition of the british slave trade fell on the same year the queen said it is right that we continue to reassess the meaning of historical events in the changing context of the present the remarks to the legislature did not go off seamlessly confusion over the timing and staging of the appearance prompted the house sergeant at arms to mistakenly announce several times elizabeth was entering the chamber jammed with lawmakers and guests all of whom sprang to their feet to cheer and applaud expecting to see the sovereign ply the center aisle but alas when the queen finally arrived the boisterous welcome included former gov george allen jokingly calling out sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants the state motto elizabeth s 1976 visit included remarks to 18 000 outside uva s cabell hall where accompanied by gov mills e godwin jr she declared the long standing partnership between britain and america has its roots here in virginia a reference to the jamestown settlement in the swampy tidewater more than 100 miles east of charlottesville she had visited in 1957 five years after assuming the british throne and to which she would return in 2007 the queen was not alone among royal visitors to modern day virginia in 1981 two months before marrying diana spencer elizabeth s son and successor now king charles iii appeared in norfolk touring nato headquarters there and the giant aircraft carrier uss nimitz before heading by helicopter to williamsburg for stops at the restored colonial town site and the college of william mary it is the only american university that still operates under its royal charter one issued in 1693 by william iii a dutch born member of the family that has reigned great britain for more than 1 200 years including 70 under elizabeth ii that distinguished her as her nation s longest serving monarch sen mark warner d va recalling thursday meeting the queen in richmond in 2007 described her as an individual who literally committed her whole life to public service

looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date except as required by law we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements non gaap financial measures and other key metrics to supplement our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we use certain non gaap financial measures as described below to understand and evaluate our core operating performance these non gaap financial measures which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision making we present these non gaap measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry however these non gaap measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from a substitute for or superior to our gaap results non gaap gross profit non gaap gross margin non gaap operating expenses non gaap income from operations non gaap operating margin non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share we define these non gaap financial measures as the respective gaap measures excluding expenses related to stock based compensation employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions amortization of acquisition related intangibles amortization of debt discount and issuance costs acquisition related expenses fair value adjustments to strategic investments executive transition costs lease related impairment and lease related charges as these costs are not reflective of ongoing operations and as applicable other special items the amount of employer payroll tax related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business when evaluating the performance of our business and making operating plans we do not consider these items for example when considering the impact of equity award grants we place a greater emphasis on overall stockholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants we believe it is useful to exclude these expenses in order to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies and over multiple periods in addition to these exclusions we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non gaap net income we utilize a fixed long term projected tax rate in our computation of the non gaap income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods for fiscal 2023 we determined the projected non gaap tax rate to be 20 tax rate free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available if any after purchases of property and equipment for operational expenses investment in our business and to make acquisitions free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash in excess of our capital investments in property and equipment once our business needs and obligations are met cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth billings we define billings as total revenues plus the change in our contract liabilities and refund liability less contract assets and unbilled accounts receivable in a given period billings reflects sales to new customers plus subscription renewals and additional sales to existing customers only amounts invoiced to a customer in a given period are included in billings we believe billings is a key metric to measure our periodic performance given that most of our customers pay in annual installments one year in advance but we typically recognize a majority of the related revenue ratably over time we use billings to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers for a reconciliation of

mathematically to equivalent barrels of oil boe peyto uses the industry accepted standard conversion of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil 6 mcf 1 bbl the 6 1 boe ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip it does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is not based on current prices while the boe ratio is useful for comparative measures and observing trends it does not accurately reflect individual product values and might be misleading particularly if used in isolation as well given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil to natural gas is significantly different from the 6 1 energy equivalency ratio using a 6 1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value

10 0 09 ftse100 7262 06 24 23 0 33 dax30 12904 32 11 65 0 09 by greg peel a pause for thought we are conscious that there are lags in the operation of monetary policy and that interest rates have increased very quickly and we recognise that all else equal the case for a slower pace of increase in interest rates becomes stronger as the level of the cash rate rises but how high interest rates need to go and how quickly we get there will be guided by the incoming data and the evolving outlook for inflation and the labour market and with that the asx200 rallied 1 8 having fallen 1 4 the day before on these comments yesterday from rba governor philip lowe investors decided we ve seen the last of the 50 point rate hikes risk on the aussie ten year yield fell 14 points to 3 56 and the two year also fell 14 points to 2 87 pulling away from the perceived neutral rate target over 3 but for one sector it would have been a buy everything session that sector was energy which not only had to cope with a 5 fall in oil prices overnight but also woodside energy wds going ex its massive dividend take out energy s 2 8 fall down over 4 early in the session and we might note the direct comparison of staples rising only 0 6 when consumer discretionary jumped 2 6 staples has been the one sector to hold its ground as the pure defensive throughout recent market weakness while discretionary has wallowed on the promise of high inflation higher rates higher energy prices and household stress the rba is not about to pause its hikes but lowe has effectively acknowledged that the impact of tighter monetary policy follows on a lag taking up to several months to really work through the system notwithstanding that banks don t tend to muck around with mortgage rates the risk therefore and this is the big discussion point on wall street is that the rba goes too hard too fast and takes the economy into recession it will still depend on the data but the good news on that front is as of next month the abs will bring australia into line with developed economies and publish monthly cpi numbers while october brings the september quarter cpi result as usual we won t have to wait until january to see the next inflation reading technology was the best performing sector yesterday 3 2 as one might expect tyro payments tyr jumped 28 after rejecting a takeover offer while life360 360 leapt 16 4 megaport mp1 12 6 novonix nvx which is in battery technology 11 2 and zip co z1p 9 0 these aren t all strictly tech sector names but they are tech and highly volatile on the downside if we take out woodside s 5 5 drop and medibank private s mpl 1 7 fall it also went ex the next worst performance was 1 4 it was that sort of day to put it into perspective the index is up about 20 points in two days so spun out are the futures that they closed flat this morning no pause history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy i can assure you that my colleagues and i are strongly committed to this project and we will keep at it until the job is done somewhat of a contrasting view from fed chair jerome powell while wall street chopped around last night before rallying into the close it was agreed powell was simply reiterating last night what he said at jackson hole last month under more scrutiny was the 75 point rate hike implemented by the ecb while this was as expected and was not 100 it is still being criticised as achieving little more than to kick the european economy when it s down runaway inflation in europe and the uk is all about the energy crisis and that is not a natural phenomenon it will be interesting to see what the bank of england does next given forecast of inflation in excess of 20 it s all also interesting that one day a former anti monarchist is chosen as pm and the next the best performing sector in the s p500 last night were the banks which reflects rising global rates otherwise wall street is looking ahead to next week s august cpi result the fed has clearly indicated it needs to see a sustained fall in inflation before it reconsiders its stance powell specifically noted that while the drop to 8 5 in july from 9 1 in june was heartening it s just one month hence if august brings a lower number again it won t change near tem policy but wall street is hanging on the result of particular note is the 30 fall in oil

already listed on the nasdaq these kinds of deals have became popular in recent years when interest rates were near zero in effect they give private companies a shortcut to going public requiring less transparency than traditional ipos the trump company tmtg and dwac announced their merger last october but it needs regulatory and stockholder approval since then however the two companies have been dealt several setbacks in june a grand jury in new york subpoenaed tmtg and according to dwac certain current and former tmtg personnel have also recently received individual grand jury subpoenas in addition dwac and some of its board members have been subpoenaed by the sec which is investigating the spac s communications and due diligence in a filing the spac said these subpoenas and the underlying investigations by the sec and the u s department of justice could materially delay materially impede or prevent the consummation of the deal facing a deadline to finalize the deal dwac ceo patrick orlando asked the company s shareholders many of whom are individual investors to approve a year long extension but the company hasn t been able to secure enough support from investors and a special meeting originally scheduled for tuesday was adjourned quickly and two subsequent efforts to reconvene led to similarly fast adjournments without an announcement of the vote tally on thursday afternoon orlando announced the meeting would reconvene at noon on oct 10 we are diligently working to record all votes that are continuing to come in from our stockholders and are adjourning this meeting to provide additional time for stockholders whether small medium or large to cast their vote he said if enough shareholders don t agree to the extension sponsors of the deal say they will throw more cash in the shell company s coffers which would allow them to extend the deadline by three more months if the deal isn t finalized by then the sponsors can finance an additional three month extension what led us here when former president trump founded the trump media technology group almost a year ago he acknowledged it would be hard and expensive to build a new platform that could compete with the likes of facebook and twitter it would have to be extremely well funded he said digital world acquisition corp has 293 million in cash and completing the spac merger would provide the company with 1 billion in additional financing from private investors in the days following the announcement investors signaled their support for the combination last october dwac s stock price surged to an eye popping 175 per share but almost a year has passed and the sec hasn t given the deal its blessing and neither have dwac s shareholders dwac s stock has fallen precipitously after both

android operating system what happens next chris delmas afp via getty images afp via getty images trump media and technology group truth social s parent company entered into a merger agreement with digital world acquisition corp last october spac mergers have to be completed on a set timeline and at the moment it s looking difficult for trump s social media venture to complete the merger if the deal isn t approved by the deadline and there isn t another extension dwac would unwind and president trump s media company would have to find a new way to raise money in a recent post on truth social the former president seemed to downplay the difficulty of doing that i don t need financing he wrote private company anyone and as for those outstanding legal issues they shouldn t in theory need to get fully resolved in order for this deal to go through says michael ohlrogge an associate professor of law at new york university the sec s biggest interest is in seeing that the risks are fully and clearly disclosed to shareholders dwac has urged the sec to finish its investigation and in recent interviews orlando has said the company is cooperating with regulators we ve had some delays he said

san francisco saw home prices fall 7 year over year during the four weeks ending september 4 2022 seattle business wire nasdaq rdfn a surge in mortgage rates over the holiday weekend sapped much of

to its lowest level since march 2021 the typical home that sold during the four weeks ending september 4 went for 0 3 below its final list price following a year and a half of the average home selling

down this time of year but this year i expect fall and winter to be especially frigid as sales dry up more than usual said redfin chief economist daryl fairweather thanks largely to mortgage rates near or even above 6 potential homebuyers and sellers are focusing on the back to school season and enjoying the last days of summer rather than getting into an uncertain market it may feel like you

former president trump s social media company has another potentially big problem on its hands it s struggling to complete a stock market listing that would allow it to raise more than 1 billion it needs to keep running trump media and technology group which includes the truth social app it launched earlier this year had been planning to list on the nasdaq stock exchange through a complicated process known as a spac merger but that deal is under legal and regulatory scrutiny and the securities and exchange commission has not yet signaled its approval the spac or the organization that will help list the stock is called digital world acquisition corp and it now needs an extension for the listing it said thursday the company has struggled to get the support of enough shareholders to move the deadline here s more details of what s going on what s this all about instead of pursuing a traditional ipo the trump media and technology group decided to merge with a blank check company that is already listed on the nasdaq these kinds of deals have became popular in recent years when interest rates were near zero in effect they give private companies a shortcut to going public requiring less transparency than traditional ipos the trump company tmtg and dwac announced their merger last october but it needs regulatory and stockholder approval since then however the two companies have been dealt several setbacks in june a grand jury in new york subpoenaed tmtg and according to dwac certain current and former tmtg personnel have also recently received individual grand jury subpoenas in addition dwac and some of its board members have been subpoenaed by the sec which is investigating the spac s communications and due diligence in a filing the spac said these subpoenas and the underlying investigations by the sec and the u s department of justice could materially delay materially impede or prevent the consummation of the deal facing a deadline to finalize the deal dwac ceo patrick orlando asked the company s shareholders many of whom are individual investors to approve a year long extension but the company hasn t been able to secure enough support from investors and a special meeting originally scheduled for tuesday was adjourned quickly and two subsequent efforts to reconvene led to similarly fast adjournments without an announcement of the vote tally on thursday afternoon orlando announced the meeting would reconvene at noon on oct 10 we are diligently working to record all votes that are continuing to come in from our stockholders and are adjourning this meeting to provide additional time for stockholders whether small medium or large to cast their vote he said if enough shareholders don t agree to the extension sponsors of the deal say they will throw more cash in the shell company s coffers which would allow them to extend the deadline by three more months if the deal isn t finalized by then the sponsors can finance an additional three month extension what led us here when former president trump founded the trump media technology group almost a year ago he acknowledged it would be hard and expensive to build a new platform that could compete with the likes of facebook and twitter it would have to be extremely well funded he said digital world acquisition corp has 293 million in cash and completing the spac merger would provide the company with 1 billion in additional financing from private investors in the days following the announcement investors signaled their support for the combination last october dwac s stock price surged to an eye popping 175 per share but almost a year has passed and the sec hasn t given the deal its blessing and neither have dwac s shareholders dwac s stock has fallen precipitously after both companies have acknowledged they are under legal and regulatory scrutiny today it is trading at about 23 per share the launch of the truth social app was delayed and it still isn t available on the android operating system what happens next chris delmas afp via getty images afp via getty images trump media and technology group truth social s parent company entered into a merger agreement with

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

bollinger was supposed to start selling the b1 electric suv and the b2 electric pickup truck as its first products in january bollinger announced these evs would have to wait because commercial vehicles were more promising mullen changed all that by giving bollinger the money to complete the b1 and b2 development the cost is bollinger becoming part of mullen which bought a 60 controlling interest in the b1 creator robert bollinger must have thought that it was better to own 40 of something with more chances of delivering its products than 100 of a company that could not do everything it wanted for lack of funds as he stresses in the video below automotive is expensive this is why his company put b1 and b2 in pajamas at the beginning of the year according to bollinger the electric chassis his team developed had high demand the company founder was putting his own money into the development process and the electric chassis would turn a profit more quickly than the evs it was a pity for the more than 50 000 people bollinger said reserved the b1 and b2 the capability to carry long objects through a system of liftgates made them unique vehicles belonging to the class 3 market segment came with less rigorous homologation requirements turning the process into something more feasible for a startup mullen stated it injected 148 2 million in cash and stock into bollinger but did not disclose how much money that company actually received it must be enough to complete the b1 and b2 development of which david michery mullen s ceo is a great fan it is not clear if michery will become the ceo of both companies or if bollinger will keep running the company that bears his name while reporting to michery what marc tarpenning and martin eberhard went through at tesla is definitely something we would not like to see happening with bollinger michery said mullen would manufacture a class 1 utility truck we are not sure if that is a reference to the mullen 5 a gorgeous electric crossover although mullen said its production will start in 2023 at the advanced manufacturing engineering center amec in tunica mississippi deliveries should begin only in q2 2024 the facility has the ability for light vehicle assembly next year bollinger should start delivering the b4 the company s class 4 commercial truck roush is bollinger s manufacturing partner but we don t know if the deal with mullen changes anything we ll probably hear more about that soon

the current economy is like a hurricane loud volatile and the result of multiple pressure systems converging to create a perfect storm what comes next will be of great importance to investors particularly those already in retirement or saving for it john shrewsbury is co owner of genwealth financial advisors in little rock arkansas we believe that inflation will begin to moderate as the pent up demand that occurred in the aftermath of covid 19 subsides during the pandemic we experienced an unprecedented shutdown of the economy while demand bottomed out meanwhile the supply of goods and services shrank for a number of reasons not the least of which was hiccups in global supply chains as the lockdowns eased consumer demand for those goods and services began to climb but the supply was still lacking this presented a textbook too much money chasing too few goods scenario one that historically results in higher inflation in this case it was further fueled by an excess of free money in the economy from stimulus checks and near zero interest loans however all storms eventually blow over as supply chains have opened up factories have started humming to life and workers have returned to their offices the much discussed new normal is in sight and while we may not go back to levels of benign inflation soon it s doubtful that a 9 rate will sustain itself much longer still inflation remains a major concern for millions not only because it lowers purchasing power but because of its effect on the stock market s volatility as a result many pre retirees and retirees worry about how the market s current conditions might impact their funds the good news is that there s a lot that advisors can do to help clients protect themselves the hybrid retiree the flexibility workers enjoy today is unprecedented as such clients in or close to retirement should consider a hybrid arrangement one in which they work part time perhaps from home in addition to helping them adjust socially and psychologically to this significant life change it will also smooth the financial transition by taking some pressure off their retirement portfolio in the meantime advisors can help clients craft retirement income plans that take inflation into account most savers think in terms of replacing their current paycheck without considering that the purchasing power of their salary will be far less years from now a decade or more into retirement that paycheck may need to be 50 to100 higher depending on the rate of inflation inspect expenses people are always concerned about costs except when there s plenty of money we ve seen this in the housing market recently with realtors claiming that they could put a house on the market and have multiple offers in hand within 48 hours some well above asking price that was a direct result of americans having lots of money they saved during the pandemic that could then be leveraged with cheap mortgage debt inflation has changed the mindset creating margin in our cash flow is necessary especially now that the record savings produced by covid 19 lockdowns and stimulus have evaporated the first question we ask clients approaching retirement is how much income do you need oftentimes all we get is a blank look and a response along the lines of i don t know we live on a certain amount of money we don t really budget that must change investors need to examine what they spend every month to get an accurate baseline for their post retirement monetary needs to do that they must understand where their money is going which means taking into account budget leaks in bank accounts such as auto renewal subscriptions for premium music television podcast services and the like automation has been a great convenience but it s also made us less conscious of our spending many people likely have hundreds of dollars leaking from their budget and don t even realize it avoid risky investments the traditional 60 40 rule an allocation to 60 stocks and 40 bonds worked well until zero interest rates came along zero interest is bad news for the most risk averse investors but there are some opportunities in fixed assets now that interest rates are rising fixed rate of return instruments such as annuities are more attractive now than they were even a few months ago there are five year fixed annuities in the 3 to 4 range that can act a lot like a bank cd for clients no one should currently be blindly chasing yield instead they should worry about the return of their money before the return on their money right now interest rates may be artificially low because investors are betting the federal reserve will lose its nerve as an inflation fighter low rates will help some consumers in the short term but their collective fist will remain clenched as we saw with decreased spending on consumer goods in july in the long term we expect that consumer staples will likely do very well while consumer discretionary will likely suffer americans tend to protect the four walls of their financial house food clothing transportation shelter expect them to prioritize taxes insurance and other unavoidable expenses over the next twelve months stay largely invested in stocks in this fraught economic environment it may seem counterintuitive to advise clients to invest or to stay invested in stocks but equities and real estate are the only two asset classes that have historically outpaced inflation if your client is one of the 90 million americans in or nearing retirement it s crucial to keep in mind that their proximity to their retirement date is not necessarily their investment horizon rather the proximity to the end of one s life is their investment horizon no one wants the money they need for next year s income to be invested in stocks this year but clients will nevertheless need investments that offset inflation this is where equities play a critical role even in times of benign inflation the prices of some equities can double within a decade as such we continue recommending equities and real estate as a portion of a portfolio even for our clients in their 70s and 80s but in the short term they should consider ways to best conserve and protect their assets in other words they must ensure they re prepared to ride out this storm

former president trump s social media company has another potentially big problem on its hands it s struggling to complete a stock market listing that would allow it to raise more than 1 billion it needs to keep running trump media and technology group which includes the truth social app it launched earlier this year had been planning to list on the nasdaq stock exchange through a complicated process known as a spac merger but that deal is under legal and regulatory scrutiny and the securities and exchange commission has not yet signaled its approval the spac or the organization that will help list the stock is called digital world acquisition corp and it now needs an extension for the listing it said thursday the company has struggled to get the support of enough shareholders to move the deadline here s more details of what s going on what s this all about instead of pursuing a traditional ipo the trump media and technology group decided to merge with a blank check company that is already listed on the nasdaq these kinds of deals have became popular in recent years when interest rates were near zero in effect they give private companies a shortcut to going public requiring less transparency than traditional ipos the trump company tmtg and dwac announced their merger last october but it needs regulatory and stockholder approval since then however the two companies have been dealt several setbacks in june a grand jury in new york subpoenaed tmtg and according to dwac certain current and former tmtg personnel have also recently received individual grand jury subpoenas in addition dwac and some of its board members have been subpoenaed by the sec which is investigating the spac s communications and due diligence in a filing the spac said these subpoenas and the

members of congress and key leaders of the bush administration find themselves wrestling with one of the more important though obscure issues currently in public debate how to change the process of estimating the revenue effects of budget policy changes in a way that will incorporate the effects of those changes on the u s economy though this issue seems to be narrowly defined it is playing a central role in the larger debate over which tax policy changes would best promote economic growth and widespread prosperity while most economists would address this issue by estimating the effects of policy changes using a statistical model of the u s economy the current practice of washington based budget estimation is to assume that taxes have no effect on the macroeconomy in other words the federal government s principal tax analysis groups do not use a model of the u s economy in creating their estimates of revenue change this practice however runs counter to real world experience in which the level of taxes is critical in determining how businesses organize and how people allocate the resources available instead of assuming these effects away the structure of any model used in budget analysis must at the very least allow taxes to enter the relevant economic decisions some still disagree with the whole idea of evaluating tax policy changes in terms of their macroeconomic effects but most parties to this dynamic scoring debate are actually engaged in arguments over which assumptions to make when using a model of the u s economy the assumptions of any model are key to the results it will produce for example if a model assumes that employees will not change their hours worked whether take home pay goes up or down one should not be surprised that the model will predict no economic effects from increasing payroll tax rates similarly if a model assumes that taxes play no role in how much capital is made available by investors it will conclude that changing tax rates will have no effect on economic activity the economic properties of macroeconomic models are the crucial elements in creating an accurate forecast of how tax policy changes affect economic activity getting these properties right matters more to the information the model produces than how many economic concepts or years the model can report in other words if the economics are not right the model will produce output that may lead the model user to the wrong conclusions policy leaders in congress and the administration must insist on a higher more sophisticated and more informative level of analysis from the tax staffs that support the government s important policy work the joint committee on taxation and the treasury department s office of tax analysis should be required to adopt immediately the practice of routine macroeconomic modeling for all important tax policy changes key elements of an economic model for budget analysis policymakers are right to wonder what major building blocks a model of the u s economy should have selecting these building blocks or key elements is important the ones selected will largely determine the results of a model run or simulation of a policy change thus the users of a model s output need to know the important assumptions of the model if they are to make a sensible assessment of what it reports the following are examples of some of the most important economic relationships that should be incorporated into a model that is used for budget and tax analysis but that are now overlooked labor and capital combine to produce private output more labor and more capital available to business should result in more output as the rewards to labor and ownership of capital increase workers and investors are willing to increase their respective supplies this is how it works in the real world and any budgetary model should exhibit this result how capital and labor inputs relate to output is a matter of existing technology any budgetary model should be able to demonstrate that its representation of technology can replicate the historical record and comport with observed facts more labor and more capital available to business should result in more output as the rewards to labor and ownership of capital increase workers and investors are willing to increase their respective supplies this is how it works in the real world and any budgetary model should exhibit this result how capital and labor inputs relate to output is a matter of existing technology labor and capital respond to changes in marginal tax rates workers supply labor based on real after tax wage rates in considering whether to work additional hours workers will evaluate how much they will keep of the extra wages they earn after taxes and inflation therefore what matters are marginal not average tax rates studies that look only at the effect of average taxes on economic decisions miss the mark both on theoretical grounds and with respect to real world experience similarly the supply of capital is based on the return paid to owners of capital after inflation replacement costs and taxes again it is tax rates at the margin that matter furthermore the analysis must cover all taxes not just selected federal taxes historically the real after tax return to capital has been extremely stable more important this stability has persisted despite many substantial changes in the way investment is taxed the reason for this stability is that the stock of u s capital adjusts very quickly in response to changes in the real after tax return on capital for example lowering the marginal tax rate on capital brings forth more investment until the stock of capital increases enough to lower the rate of return to where it was before the tax cut these adjustments occur fairly quickly indeed the historical record of the past 50 years indicates that the supply of capital is very adjustable after the first 5 to 10 years following a significant change in marginal tax rates the constancy of the real after tax return to capital implies that stock adjustments occur through changes in domestic saving and the placement of capital worldwide experience of the past 50 years shows that a 10 percent increase in the real after tax return to capital will produce a similar increase in domestic saving the reverse is true for a decrease in after tax return an acceptable budget model would incorporate the relationships among marginal tax rates the supply of and demand for goods and services and the supply of and demand for the factors that produce them workers supply labor based on real after tax wage rates in considering whether to work additional hours workers will evaluate how much they will keep of the extra wages they earn after taxes and inflation therefore what matters are marginal not average tax rates studies that look only at the effect of average taxes on economic decisions miss the mark both on theoretical grounds and with respect to real world experience the united states operates in a global economy changes in the volume of domestic saving however are usually not enough to drive the after tax return to capital back to its historically stable level within the typical adjustment period the rest of the change in supply must come from changes in international capital flows specifically increases decreases in the real after tax return result in less more u s investment abroad more generally an increase in the rate of return to an asset due to lower u s taxes on capital is shared with all investments including those not directly affected by the tax change for example suppose taxes are cut for u s citizens owning physical assets in the united states as these individuals rearrange their portfolios to take advantage of the increased returns on the newly favored assets the rate of return on other assets that they liquidate also will increase making them attractive to investors who cannot directly take advantage of the tax change in other words a tax change that initially appears limited to the united states is in reality shared worldwide absent this linkage the real after tax return to capital would not exhibit the constancy that it has exhibited clearly changes in the ownership mix of capital sited in the united states have implications for tax collections adjustments from abroad which involve changes in factor payments to foreigners will be incorporated into u s tax bases increases in foreign ownership for example will lower the portion of dividends paid to u s citizens however these changes will be small in comparison to the increase in tax bases resulting from the higher growth due to more foreign investment in the united states a suitable budgetary model must not assume that the u s economy is closed it must allow international capital flows to be affected by changes in budget policy changes in the volume of domestic saving however are usually not enough to drive the after tax return to capital back to its historically stable level within the typical adjustment period the rest of the change in supply must come from changes in international capital flows specifically increases decreases in the real after tax return result in less more u s investment abroad federal reserve policy matters an acceptable budget estimation model must assume that monetary policy significantly influences the general price level and thereby nominal interest rates simulations done with the model should assume that the federal reserve would undertake whatever policies are necessary to maintain prices at their baseline levels guessing the future course of monetary policy as a function of alternative budget policies is simply an added complication an acceptable budgetary model would not assume that the federal reserve would misbehave the return on financial assets interest rates depends on the real after tax return to capital and on inflation assuming the federal reserve holds constant the general price level interest rates will change only with the return on physical assets an acceptable budget estimation model must assume that monetary policy significantly influences the general price level and thereby nominal interest rates simulations done with the model should assume that the federal reserve would undertake whatever policies are

model would not assume that the federal reserve would misbehave the return on financial assets interest rates depends on the real after tax return to capital and on inflation assuming the federal reserve holds constant the general price level interest rates will change only with the return on physical assets tax and spending policies affect the federal debt changes in tax and spending policies should affect the level of government borrowing and debt symmetrically the requirement that interest rates be primarily tied to the real rate of return to capital means that changes in borrowing principally affect domestic portfolios since there is no incentive for the portfolios of foreigners to change for example while an increase in spending or a decrease in taxes may put money in peoples pockets it must also take that same amount out of the pockets of lenders the model should show little or no first round income effect from either tax or spending changes the major effect of such changes flows from the initial price effect and subsequent adjustment to the new prices changes in tax and spending policies should affect the level of government borrowing and debt symmetrically the requirement that interest rates be primarily tied to the real rate of return to capital means that changes in borrowing principally affect domestic portfolios since there is no incentive for the portfolios of foreigners to change for example while an increase in spending or a decrease in taxes may put money in peoples pockets it must also take that same amount out of the pockets of lenders the model should show little or no first round income effect from either tax or spending changes the major effect of such changes flows from the initial price effect and subsequent adjustment to the new prices federal purchases of goods and services affect private output and gdp some government purchases of goods and services count as part of the nation s output the compensation of government employees adds directly to the value of the gross domestic product gdp government employment also raises the total demand for labor thus expanding government employment bids up the price of labor in general higher labor costs in the private sector reduce private output offsetting part of the gain attributable to the government increase government capital expenditures should show a similar effect in this case gdp goes up by less than the value of the expenditure because under department of commerce accounting rules government capital yields only asset depreciation again the direct increases are generally offset by reductions in private output due to higher factor costs to the extent that either of these types of government spending increases private sector productivity the private sector loss is lower but this must be the exception rather than the rule an acceptable budget model should show that a dollar increase in government employment or investment would lead to less than a dollar increase in gdp some government purchases of goods and services count as part of the nation s output the compensation of government employees adds directly to the value of the gross domestic product gdp government employment also raises the total demand for labor thus expanding government employment bids up the price of labor in general higher labor costs in the private sector reduce private output offsetting part of the gain attributable to the government increase federal subsidy programs cause price distortions direct and indirect through the tax system subsidy programs artificially reduce certain prices facing consumers and businesses the lower price shifts demand away from other goods and services toward the favored items as a result more of the favored goods and services are produced than would otherwise be the case leading to a less efficient allocation of resources the price of the subsidized good increases with demand and the prices of other goods decrease in markets where there are supply difficulties the usual justification for intervention subsidies are often counterproductive for example tax credits for higher education typically lead to increases in tuition that can offset most or all of the subsidy an acceptable budget model should show the negative gdp effect of the price distortions as well as the increased spending on the subsidized item direct and indirect through the tax system subsidy programs artificially reduce certain prices facing consumers and businesses the lower price shifts demand away from other goods and services toward the favored items as a result more of the favored goods and services are produced than would otherwise be the case leading to a less efficient allocation of resources the price of the subsidized good increases

for higher education typically lead to increases in tuition that can offset most or all of the subsidy an acceptable budget model should show the negative gdp effect of the price distortions as well as the increased spending on the subsidized item federal transfer programs also affect price levels government transfer programs operate in a manner similar to subsidies they generally target a group of individuals rather than particular goods or services increased spending by the subsidized group raises the price of goods for everyone producing a similar gdp effect an acceptable budget model should show the negative gdp effect of the price distortions as well as the increased spending by the subsidized groups government transfer programs operate in a manner similar to subsidies they generally target a group of individuals rather than particular goods or services increased spending by the subsidized group raises the price of goods for everyone producing a similar gdp effect an acceptable budget model should show the negative gdp effect of the price distortions as well as the increased spending by the subsidized groups federal mandates and regulatory programs act like a shadow tax on the economy mandates and regulations require businesses and individuals to engage in economic transactions they otherwise would not undertake this acts like a shadow tax on the economy to maintain the rate of return to capital and in some cases labor the marginal value product of capital or labor must increase to comply with the government requirement this increase in factor costs should result in reduced gdp externalities such as pollution from a coal plant are the typical justification for government mandates and regulations the benefits from this kind of government intervention are generally not measured because they do not show up in measured gdp an acceptable budget model should show the negative effect on gdp and the price distortions caused by regulations and mandates estimates of the value from reducing externalities could be shown separately as a cost benefit analysis much as the office of management and budget does for major rule changes
