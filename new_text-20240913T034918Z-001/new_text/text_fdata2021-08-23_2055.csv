suzanne flannery v genomic health inc et al is a case about the acquisition of genomic health inc genomic or the company by exact sciences corp exact pursuant to a merger agreement count i of the inevitable complaint asserted the baker brothers entities which were purportedly the controlling stockholders of genomic along with exact and genomic violated section 203 of the delaware general corporation law because the baker brothers entities separately agreed to sell their greater than 15 stake in genomic to exact prior to the merger more specifically plaintiff contended that defendants violated section 203 because exact entered into a business combination with genomic two days after exact became an interested stockholder plaintiff claimed exact became an interested stockholder of genomic on july 26 two days prior to the board signing the merger agreement when the baker brothers entities allegedly agreed to vote their shares in favor of the transaction defendants disagreed and argued plaintiff s section 203 claim failed for among other things the following reasons exact never became an interested stockholder because the baker brothers entities did not agree with exact to vote in favor of the merger until after the board approved the merger when the voting agreement was actually executed and the board implicitly approved the voting agreement prior to july 26 the date plaintiff claims the two sides came to an agreement plaintiff pointed to the proxy which stated that on july 26 representatives of akin gump contacted representatives of skadden to inform them that the baker brothers entities were no longer willing to agree to transfer restrictions on their shares between signing and closing but would still agree to vote in favor of the transaction this according to plaintiff evidenced an agreement arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring such stock in violation of section 203 according to the court the proxy s language did not evidence either a formal or informal meeting of the minds between the baker brothers entities and exact on prior to approval of the merger on july 26 in fact the proxy disclosed that the baker brothers entities had plainly rejected exact s proposed voting agreement and that they would only agree to a voting agreement with different terms the fact that that the baker brothers eventually expressed their intent to support the merger did not change the analysis without an agreement exact cannot conceivably be classified as an interested stockholder and thus cannot have violated section 203 this was further bolstered by the existence of the later executed voting agreement entered into immediately after the board approved and executed the merger agreement that agreement evidenced nothing more than the commonplace scenario where a large stockholder agreed to vote its shares in favor of a transaction approved and authorized by the board of the target company as to implicit approval the court noted the only reasonable inference was that the board well understood exact would require voting agreements in connection with the merger by continuing to negotiate with exact on those terms the board demonstrated its agreement to the unremarkable proposition that exact would seek to secure the commitment of genomic s largest stockholder to the merger prior to the stockholder vote that agreement to the transaction which resulted in exact becoming an interested stockholder prior to the parties themselves agreeing excepted the transaction from section 203 s proscriptions ultimately the court found plaintiff s attempt to pigeonhole defendants conduct into a violation of section 203 was inconsistent with the statute s designated purpose according to the court section 203 was intended to strike a balance between the benefits of an unfettered market for corporate shares and the well documented and judicially recognized need to limit abusive takeover tactics the court stated plaintiff s view of section 203 would authorize the court to prevent a merger even when a target s board was aware of and did not object to a buyer s attempt to secure the endorsement of a significant stockholder in favor of a deal that the board itself was attempting to secure for all of the target s stockholders even if plaintiff was correct that the board had not formally approved of either the merger or voting agreement prior to july 26 and that there was a meeting of the minds between the baker brothers entities and exact with respect to voting on july 26 it was undeniable that the merger was formally approved by the board on july 28 with full knowledge of the voting agreement negotiations and endorsed by the board much earlier than that nothing about this dynamic suggested exact was engaged in abusive takeover tactics the court noted that it should be hesitant to strain the statute s language to cover situations that do not threaten the interests the statute was designed to protect therefore plaintiff s section 203 was dismissed

a parent with two small children sent the world socialist web site the following letter opposing the ontario government s decision to reopen schools amid canada s rapidly surging fourth wave of the covid 19 pandemic the parent is a supporter of the cross canada educators rank and file safety committee cersc the cersc is fighting to mobilize educators students and parents to close schools to in person learning suspend all nonessential production and secure workers full financial compensation so they can shelter at home and look after their families until the pandemic is brought under control to attend the cersc s next meeting on saturday august 28 at 1 30 p m est please email cersc csppb gmail com as parents of two small children my wife and i are feeling very uneasy as the school year fast approaches in ontario we are very concerned about what the next few months will look like the delta variant is causing alarming increases in infection rates already even before the calendar changes to september new scientific information is telling us that children under 12 who will not be vaccinated when school starts are vulnerable to increased risks of severe illness long covid significant cognitive decline and death but this knowledge will be of little comfort for parents who are locked into an in person learning model as the school year begins a lot has changed since schools closed in june parents across the province had to declare by last june whether their kids would be enrolled in remote learning for this september we had little knowledge then of the severity of the delta variant only now is a clearer picture emerging of how dangerous it can be to unvaccinated children under 12 although the province maintains that parents have a choice between in person and remote learning that choice is limited and does not even exist in many parts of canada some school boards will not allow you to pull your kids out until january 2022 the earliest time to transition to remote learning in more fortunate school zones is a window in october in early august my wife and i began to have second thoughts about sending our children back to in person learning we called our school board and requested a change to remote learning we were told that we could not change and that the time had passed to choose remote learning for september we raised concerns about the inadequate return to school plan and the emerging data on the dangers of the delta variant we were told that no one was working at the board office and that we would have to contact our principal in early september to request a change to remote learning the earliest that change could be implemented was the late october window when my wife and i made it clear that we did not want our children in school at all in september i was told that if my children missed 15 consecutive days of school they would be withdrawn from our neighbourhood school and that child services would be contacted since my wife and i would be breaking the law we are appalled and livid with that response to our legitimate safety concerns we are not looking forward to the september discussion with the principal despite all the reassurances and talk about a safe return to in class learning from politicians school boards and the chief medical officer in ontario i do not trust nor do i believe that a safe return to full in class learning is possible my skepticism does not stem from any conspiracy theory or superstitious beliefs rather it is informed from what i see already happening around the world where children have returned to school kids are already getting sick parents are losing their children to the delta variant as we speak in the united states yet the alarm bells are not ringing in ontario we are walking with our eyes closed into a hurricane the reality is that classrooms will not be safe for a full return to school in two weeks time every classroom in ontario will not have hepa filters ventilation systems will not be upgraded in every school in the province cloth masks will not be effective against delta children will not be issued k95 masks all this talk of having mandatory vaccinations for every adult around our children in some kind of protective invisible wall will not work the delta variant will find itself into crowded classrooms and infection will spread like wildfire schools are vectors for transmission they are not isolated islands apart from the community children will get infected many will get sickened and sadly families across ontario will lose children the province and school boards are taking a tremendous risk bordering on criminal negligence it is sheer lunacy that we are willing to gamble with the lives of unvaccinated children everyone wants their kids back in school who doesn t want to see children thriving playing learning in front of a live teacher in a classroom with their peers no one can deny the importance of socializing with their friends yes remote learning was brutal mental health is a concern no doubt parents want to go back to normal how many of us have said that we just can t do this anymore we love our kids but we are not all meant to be stuck in the house together all day every day enough but how is my mental health going to be for the rest of my life if i send my children to school during the most dangerous phase of the pandemic and i lose them how will that impact their brothers and sisters what will it do to their grandparents how will my wife and i go on to put it bluntly the back to school plan is a not a plan at all it does not inspire any confidence that my two young children will be safe in elementary school they will not be vaccinated and they will be vulnerable to becoming infected from a highly contagious delta variant that is a fundamentally different virus than the original covid 19 so what is the solution i honestly have no clue we are trying to figure this out as we go parents have limited options how many of us can afford to stay home and watch our kids how many of us have family that we can turn to for support yet deep down inside i know my wife and i cannot be the only ones feeling this uncertain and anxious we need to find other parents teachers and concerned workers and act we need to demand that schools stay closed until all our children are vaccinated why are none of our leaders talking about eradicating this virus once and for all short term pain long term gain how can china contain this virus but we can t in our advanced western societies is it all about money and the stock market do our kids need to be sacrificed for the sake of the economy what kind of world do we live in all the talking heads in the media keep telling us our children face little risk that they need to be in school that the vast majority will only suffer minor symptoms that it s important for their mental health and that ontario has a safe reopening plan on the other side i see kids dying and getting sick this should not be happening period finally we have ontario s chief medical officer saying we need to normalize covid 19 and that schools will not close unless a catastrophic situation arises kids getting sick from covid in schools should never be normalized ever my wife and i cannot allow our children to be a part of an experiment this fall will they suffer academically maybe will their mental health suffer perhaps but at least we are trying to do whatever it takes to keep them alive and safe until the fourth wave is over like minded parents teachers and other workers need to come together and demand that all our kids are vaccinated before we send them back to in person learning as the bare minimum we cannot accept anything less never mind changing the damn air filters and wearing ineffective cloth masks in a war you never leave anyone behind on the field of battle the government and the school boards are leaving all children under 12 behind in the war against covid we cannot afford to lose the most precious thing we have we need to protect our children at all costs the children are our future only we can protect our future
high in the mountains of peru can be found the ceremonial center of chavin de huantar it is a striking place a large stone paved courtyard is surrounded by towering stone steps reminiscent of the maya temples at tikal but much older from this great courtyard a pathway leads to a smaller circular area and onwards to a flight of stairs which lead up to the temple of the lanzon this temple is quite hollow and contains the god of the chavin the civilization which built the complex and occupied the site between 900 and 200 bc the lanzon itself is a great granite stela at the heart of the temple standing 15 feet 4 5 m tall named for its resemblance to a lance but the lanzon is so much more than a statue supplicants were introduced to the maze containing the lanzon and would arrive in the presence of their god from one of several angles depending on the path they took in the darkness and it seems that the chavin considered the stela to be a living god the only example of this still in situ in the entirety of the americas an expert sculptor carved the granite stela around 2 500 years ago in the shape and image of a supernatural being sacred to the chavin religion the image is arresting a grinning man jaguar with bared teeth long nails held close to its sides the name lanzon itself is quite deceiving as the form of the stela does not resemble a lance so much as a highland plow that would have been utilized for cultivation purposes during that time as a result the deity was likely associated with agrarian worship at least in one aspect chavin de huantar the entire chavin civilization revolved around the chavin de huantar archaeological site the religious center for the chavin culture in the middle of the site is a large main plaza surrounded on three sides by stone terraces the main temple itself a huge flat topped pyramid surrounded by these lower platforms sits across from where people would enter the square the huge monolithic temple at chavin de huantar mark adobe stock the entire area forms a u shape with a central sunken plaza beyond lies the smaller circular area with steps leading to the entrance to the temple this smaller area appears to be for only a select few of those gathered in the main plaza perhaps a staging area for those who were going into the temple maze the temple walls were originally covered with carvings and sculptures stone obelisks and grotesque carved heads depicting caimans jaguars and other anthropomorphic forms although the chavin remain enigmatic and nothing survives of what took place in this plaza it is clear that the complex had a ceremonial function inside the temple there are several passageways with no natural light switchbacks and changes in height are frequent as you progress into the center where the lanzon waits several strange small channels also lead into the temple from various other areas across the site anthropomorphic head carving on the exterior wall of the temple psamathem cc by sa 4 0 the weird anthropomorphic carvings are also found on artifacts uncovered at the site despite being located high in the andes several conch shell trumpets have been discovered these artifacts along with pestles and mortars have intricate decorations assumed to be related to chavin rituals what happened here archaeologists still debate about the religious practices at chavin de huantar given the disorienting nature of the interior of the temple it is possible that psychoactive drugs were involved this would certainly explain the channels leading into the interior through which smoke as well as water could be introduced those who met the lanzon would then be questioned by the priests of the temple who would interpret what they saw during the 1970s peruvian archaeologist luis lumbreras went to the site and talked to the locals to see if any of the chavin traditions were remembered the people believed the chavin word comes from chaupin a quechua an indigenous south american language word that means center this shows the significance of the site to the local indigenous communities during that time after some investigation lumbreras theorized that higher class people in the communities had created the rituals associated with the lanzon he believed that these elites might have persuaded the followers of the spiritual importance of the temple complex to maintain their social and political structure high in the andes the lanzon itself sits at the very core of chavin de huantar itself situated on a high pass between the dense amazon rainforest and the mountainous coastal region due to the andes forming a natural barrier the site is therefore situated on a key passage between the pacific and the interior a beautifully carved conch trumpet found at chavin de huantar joe green public domain the chavin were certainly actively trading with distant cultures as the conch shells prove archaeologists also discovered textiles that resemble chavin architecture and artifacts buried far away in coastal areas like karwa in the south of peru this suggests that the influence of the site reached much farther than most ceremonial sites of that time a living god the lanzon is present in the central cruciform chamber of chavin de huantar s underground passages devotees who entered the temple would find themselves in pitch black tunnels and intersecting galleries all tunnels eventually lead to the center but not straight away and not from the same directions to add to this confusion the lanzon looks very different depending on from which angle it is viewed the tall standing figure has big round eyes on either side of its head looking upwards the mouth of the figure is large with bared teeth and protruding fangs its left hand points downwards while the right one is pointing upwards suggesting gestures towards heaven the earth and the underworld one carved channel runs right from the top of the stela to the lanzon s forehead this channel may have been carved so that liquid could be poured over the face of the god either as an offering or for visual effect two main elements characterize the deity firstly it is a combination of animal and human features secondly the representation is deliberately visually confusing and complex the talons and fans symbolize connections with the caiman and the jaguar who are the predators of the forest lowlands often depicted in andean iconography and chavin art the hair and the eyebrows of the figure are carved as snakes another animal commonly considered sacred the lanzon at the heart of his temple frenchguy cc by sa 3 0 at the bottom of the carving two animal heads share one fanged mouth the technique is an exmaple of contour rivalry where carvings deliberately create a complexity in what is being seen to be interpreted by the viewer according to their own understanding worship the lanzon but the central aspect of the lanzon is that of the jaguar an animal commonly seen in chavin art this prominence of jaguar imagery has resulted in the prevailing hypothesis that this was a jaguar cult where the animal s characteristics were admired and worshiped the lanzon s key role within the site was as a central pivot or axis mundi connecting the sky the earth and the underworld the duality of the arms pointing in opposite directions suggests parallels in nature such as night or day life or death and the sacred balance found between them even though the anthropomorphic deity was made from terrestrial material it was believed to be a celestial being and for the chavin their god was very real top image replica of the lanzon god of the chavin source dtarazona cc by sa 3 0 by bipin dimri

editor s note on friday august 20 the reserve bank of new zealand governor adrian orr told bloomberg that a fundamental imbalance in the new zealand economy is a lack of supply within the residential housing market but will a supply correction alone resolve new zealand s affordable housing crisis stephen minto analyses this question special report and analysis by stephen minto housing affordability is more than a simple case of demand and supply there are structural factors creating too much investor demand for residential housing because of this new zealand can t just build its way out of this crisis and removing planning restrictions will delay intensification and the supply of affordable housing the exact opposite of what its proponents claim the structural forces in which the property market functions must be fixed to see this we need to understand three things how we got here and where here is our current trends and economic forces what direction do we want to go in and how possible solutions part 1 how we got to this crisis the nz economy is a one trick pony residential housing we all know tdb recommends newzengine com the normal principles of taxation favour holding a relatively low effort non productive asset residential property especially because you could claim the mortgage interest paid as an expense there was no capital gains tax the banks want to lend on leveraged property as a relatively secure loan they are risk adverse you can have a holiday home and rent it out occasionally as a pretend business to subsidise having it huge tourism to new zealand along with airbnb and bookabach etc have given a lucrative income stream in the short term rental market mum and dad savers investors learnt from the 1987 1998 and 2008 economic crashes that property was the best at retaining its value the renters pay your mortgage so there is little drain on your income or there is positive enhancement from rental losses new zealand has had positive migration flows all these factors have been in place for many years making residential housing a fantastic investment or superannuation scheme or wealth gain mechanism it s not clever to invest in residential property it s stupid not to but wait there s more the neo liberal economic crisis commentators don t talk about the neo liberal structural changes in new zealand and other first world economies from 1980 that have collapsed alternative investment opportunities the world economy was opened up on the mistaken belief that the great growth years of capitalism were made in an environment of little regulation and tax a mantra to free up the private suppliers of goods and services supply side economics from laws labour and taxes was said to lead to an economic boom we all know there has been no boom for working or middle class people there has been a boom for financial capitalism technology and billionaires what happened was skilled manufacturing and industrial jobs were exported to countries like china vietnam and india many high income jobs evaporated in new zealand leading to fewer people being able to save house deposits or save capital to start a business yes we got lower cost imports to match lower incomes but we also got a throw away society with so much rubbish brought in also lower taxes and a smaller government meant the main source of apprenticeships from ministry of works railways defence etc dried up leaving new zealand small businesses without a source of trained and qualified people they now had to pay to train them we now have to import skilled people we have fewer skilled people to build houses fewer apprenticeships means fewer people to set up their own businesses meaning fewer opportunities for those wanting to strike out on their own fewer new businesses means fewer medium sized businesses which could be an investment option for those wanting to invest the above reality is compounded due to the absence of a capital gains tax as business owners have an incentive to take an easy life option and sell up to overseas buyers these overseas owners contribute tax and labour costs but they often do their best to avoid these businesses listed on the sharemarket are often sold overseas and pulled out of our sharemarket we now have a thin share market profits from new zealand assets are exported overseas most investment capital is not being invested back into growing the new zealand economy instead huge amounts of new zealand s investment capital is going to non productive assets such as residential property these are all structural problems significantly damaging the ability of the new zealand economy to grow new zealand is now a service based economy but business set ups in new zealand are often for overseas franchises with low margins and wages in fast food our small shop owners struggle retail as a business model is struggling because consumers have less disposable income because of high rents high rents and other utilities like power suck money out of other areas of the economy our overall economy is being damaged by being skewed to the non productive asset residential property this is where the new zealand economy is today there is almost nowhere in new zealand to invest except in residential property neo liberal policies have shrunk our domestic economy and removed opportunities for investment entrepreneurs are risk averse they minimise risk and buy property is there a property bubble yes high house prices mean loans are beyond the ability of borrowers to ever repay but that is still profitable for banks the loans help push house prices higher which rewards investment in property and so it continues but like the 25 july 2021 radio nz article the problem with economists forecasts many have predicted a bubble burst but all have failed why it s obvious the structural problems and incentives to buy residential housing are all still in place where else can the investors go the economic signals from a dysfunctional economy trap investors in residential property ref radio new zealand july 25 2021 the property bubble can t deflate until there is a functioning economy with alternative low risk options for investment there are ways out of this which is covered in part 4 of this four part series part 2 the current trends and economic forces shaping housing affordability new zealand can t just build its way out of the affordable housing crisis previously i noted the normal principles of taxation and the legacy of the neo liberal experiment are skewing the economy to trap investors into holding residential housing as investments this part looks at the recent developing economic trends that now trap middle and working class people into renting for life and why that is bad for our economy trends big business residential renting the new zealand situation sits along with a trend in the united states where large corporations e g the koch brothers have been investing in new rental properties because the returns on rentals are so strong this is because house prices in the us like nz are high this shuts out most young middle and working class buyers these people then become a captive market of renters as they are wealthy enough to pay high rents and the high rents in turn make it almost impossible for renters to save a deposit to buy a home and the captivity continues the returns and prospects for business are great over time the rental investor market is moving away from mum and dad investors as they surrender their houses to pay for retirement homes or to release capital to live comfortably big business will take up a lot of that divestment they can leverage far more and so are able to pay and sustain high prices for residential houses they will also be buyers of older homes to redevelop into more productive new builds banks will feel secure to lend to a large business with captive renters this means the future of housing is evolving into a big business build to rent model which means not generation rent but generations of rent and this is bad for the economy one of the ways it is bad is it leaves people with little capital to borrow against to take up a business option it traps people as employees and people renting won t be able to build equity because there are fewer other investments options and those other options aren t performing as well as residential property because all the investment capital to grow those other options is being sucked into residential property and the chances of saving to build equity are low because rents are high more reasons are given in the next trend see below some governments have also undermined social housing which has exacerbated the problem but that failure did not create the affordable housing crisis at this point some people who own lots of properties will say so what nothing is wrong with people renting nothing is wrong with high rent if the market is willing to pay it the critics are all anti business my response is this yes it is wrong if there is no choice people are not willing to pay high rents they have to pay them redirecting investment to the productive economy exports innovation producing goods and services is good for business all businesses will benefit from a shift to investment in the productive economy except the types of business based on highly leveraged rental property the property investor landlords that are not based on highly leveraged property will carry on renting trends high price houses and rents are here to stay in theory increasing housing supply will bring down house prices but that is not so in the economy we have for renters the high prices paid for housing purchases are used to justify charging high rents also big business is very keen on making sure there is a good rate of return on capital so there s an incentive to keep rents high supply of housing and the rental price is not really linked pricing is about how much consumer surplus the seller believes they can extract it is not about the costs of the business so much as what they think the renter can pay e g linked to area what others are charging in that area for that size of house what the renter thinks the rent should be is not really relevant business costs do not really matter for price e g as a landlord pays down their mortgage on a rental property they do not reduce the rent on the property cost and supply do not drive rent prices the easiest example to see how supply and price is not linked is the car market used and new there are a huge number of cars in new zealand and it is presented to the consumer as a myriad of choices about car style and performance why do you want the car each choice means it becomes a smaller range of cars to choose from every extra feature is a way to distinguish one car from the hundreds of other cars to push price up or help hold it up this is what will happen with the housing market the business model market will have a deliberate desire to push choice and variety up to push or keep the price up so for the build to rent business model we will see tiny studio apartments marketed as the affordable option which really primarily just suits a very young guy on his own or short term stays as the size increases it will exponentially get more expensive the business model will run that tried and true for profit strategy they will start organising your loans to make the purchase so they can get a commission supply is only one of the many factors e g location quality number of rooms to set a rental price too many people are talking as if supply will fix the problem of affordability and this is a mistake for example a tradie did a job at a rental house almost 700 a week for a whole house in an outer suburb there were several people home a polynesian extended family and the rental owner in casual conversation with the tradie said as there were more people in the house than they thought they would raise the rent i e they can charge more this is an insight to price setting the idea that people can just go somewhere else if rents rise is silly people want continuity with where they live especially if they have children at schools also demand to rent a property would generally be seen as inelastic i e you need a place to live so you have to pay what is asked for if you negotiate a rent reduction it tends to be by quite small amounts i m sure there are anecdotes of some large reductions but clearly that is not the norm from the trade me site or as renters report this shows cost and supply is not what primarily drives rent prices and this business model will work counter to the government s and most voters objectives of ensuring there is affordable housing for our families children and grandchildren trend a business ownership model versus a home ownership model residential housing is currently being repurposed into a very strong and profitable business model either with long term renting or short term renting airbnb book a bach etc for tourism when tourism returns the previous model being high levels of home ownership these business models will further push out home buyers unless they can pay a very high price therefore an affordable housing shortage will persist due to new zealand s lack of building resource capacity and a positive net migration this is the nature of the private market and it has already shown it can t deliver affordable housing it needs a push and help to deliver affordable housing with a move to big business running more rentals the chances of rents being lowered by supply are slimmer than if it was lots of mum and dads running the rental market a large business will hold many properties and can carry empty property more easily as tax deductions can still be made against the property high rents on some properties can cover for vacant periods on other properties also the concept of affordable is a monetary concept but housing is a qualitative experience the economic profit drive for business will be what is market affordable e g those apartments that are south facing and that do not get any direct light or they look onto a concrete wall more planning rather than less will be needed to avoid these sort of outcomes the private rental market is not conducive to lower rents for example one rental comes onto the market and the fact that 10 or 100 people applied for that one new flat is taken as a signal to all the other people holding rentals with that rental service company to raise the prices on their other rentals the private market tends to quickly inflate the impacts of scarcity but when one rental takes a long time to rent there is no rush to drop their prices on their other rental properties private markets tend to hold prices high so housing supply if held in the private business model market will not necessarily bring down rental prices anecdotally i am personally aware of many houses in new zealand s capital city wellington that are not occupied ideally this housing stock would be used for housing supply if done up restored renovated or simply rented out some supply currently exists but is not being utilised this is the scourge of land banking rents are high now and deflation is only generally associated with economic crashes there is nothing identifiable yet that would indicate rental prices will decrease the whole discussion about increasing the supply being the solution to the housing affordability crisis is just magic thinking if left alone the economic forces at work will prevent increasing supply being able to have a positive impact former bnz economist and now an independent economist tony alexander made a point in a nzme bulletin that getting tough on landlords will just drive up rental prices however i argue prices not quality have been rising anyway therefore now is the perfect time to remove interest deductibility from residential rental property particularly as interest rates are currently low nobody is getting tough on landlords rather investor demand is being dampened and investment capital gently directed away to the productive economy ref youtube nzherald co nz march 1 2021 i repeat increased supply and intensification definitely needs to happen but it is not going to launch a huge reduction in house prices or rent as the forces driving investor demand will still be in place and supply is still a long way off but there are things that can be done to free renters and house buyers from high prices by making the market work better see solutions in part 4 of this four part series trend government as the good quality high paying tenant the outlook for investors in the rental business is getting even better if rent is made to beneficiaries as the rents are paid direct to the landlord by the government if there is an overloaded or not properly funded bureaucracy any complaints about the quality of the rental may be slow for the government to follow up on but the rent continues to be passed through directly to landlords business loves it as it is a very secure income stream if government has to pay repairs for damage it may be a more reliable payer than a private tenant on rental price settings that impact government it was strongly anecdotally reported that with the government s first budget where the accomodation allowance was raised by 50 a person rents increased correspondingly this showed the rental business market s true colours the rental rise was not based on costs but on the ability to extract the money as the government had declared it available this shows the government therefore will become trapped in a cycle of paying for high rents by leaving so much of the rental market in this growing private business model trend business model housing is bad for the economy this is bad for the new zealand economy high rents or mortgages and for other utilities means less disposable income for renters mortgagees which leads to less stimulus into the rest of the economy more disposable income could mean more people seek education experience the arts take up exercise domestic travel etc all these are nz based service industries that are struggling at the moment but landlords in particular have a captive inelastic market where they can continue to raise rental prices even though interest rates are at a record low as said before high house or rental prices prevent slows people developing capital on which to create a business opportunity and or push an innovation they may have developed as bad if not worse is the diversion of so much of new zealand s investment capital into a non productive asset residential housing we need that investment capital to go into innovation projects and or producing things for export or for the services industries that our economy employs most of our people in the housing market built on a business model is not a service industry we want to encourage and once the build to rent companies take over and they are big enough they might list on the stock market and then the chances of it being sold overseas with all the rental profits going overseas becomes very real new zealand will not get wealthy selling houses to each other no business representative group should be upset about this redirection of investment into the productive sector of the economy it will benefit most businesses it is only those rental businesses built on being highly debt leveraged that will have to change there are solutions to high housing prices and the affordability crisis outside a big business rental model i talk about some solutions in part 4 of this four part series part 3 the problems that come from a supply fixation as a solution to housing affordability the government is aware of complexity in dealing with the housing affordability crisis so it wants to include the private market as part of the solution they have reflected this in the urban growth agenda it encourages changes to relax planning rules to facilitate residential development and intensification this means developers can force their dreams and vision through rather than a community s visions of a city being realised history shows this will inevitably result in conflict and a firestorm will come down on the government and councils as the private market will not deliver affordable housing again inevitably government and councils will be blamed for damaging the cities as developers will insist they are simply following the rules and in turn opposition political parties can exploit that conflict the places where these ideas arose from is as follows alternative ideas on affordability tony alexander in the youtube clip when will house prices cool down cooking the books from march 1 2021 says house prices won t go down because low interest rates are what is driving the high prices this is a factor because it makes it easier to borrow and leverage a property but pressed for his suggestion to solve the housing crisis it is not to raise interest rates i agree with him but to remove planning restrictions this solution is linked to the defective increase supply argument as explained previously he expresses sympathy for first home buyers and has a great analysis but overall he is passive about most of the factors driving affordability they just exist for him using the metaphor of climate change i think his analysis is more as a weather forecaster looking at the factors of the day but not as a climate scientist looking at what is underlying and driving the factors alexander s suggestion on planning is to relax the rules so that six story buildings can be built beside single story buildings to take wellington as an example when this sort of absence of rules existed back in the 1950 s and 1960 s huge amounts of heritage for example in central wellington te aro flats and into thorndon and mount victoria were destroyed in an ugly way this is why protection rules were introduced alexander also critiques actions that impact the landlord investor as being counter productive as any costs placed on them will just be passed on in rents but even without any government actions rent prices are unaffordable fatalism or perhaps a desire for defeatism pervades his argument because if the actions were successful and investors are less active in the market there would be less demand and less push for prices to rise and the new zealand property council has said actions on removing the deductibility of interest would dampen investor demand can planning laws alone fix supply the answer is no because of the structural problems created by the normal principles of taxation and the neo liberal economic legacy that encourages excessive investor demand and that will hold housing values up which holds up rents as well planning laws are needed to drive intensification which i fully support but not at a cost to the historic character and liveability of a city however it appears the policy ideas alexander supports are being listened to by the government urban growth agenda right idea wrongly executed for those on the left the government s recently developed urban growth agenda is a neo liberal s dream come true why it is predicated on giving permission to private developers to disregard the needs and wants of the existing local communities so the developer can build a six story build right beside one story houses meaning they will loose their sun and privacy with no chance to complain the developer s dream or plan to make money will come first and be forced through the urban growth agenda does not have urban planning as its primary focus it does have a vision of urban growth intensification which i fully support but it is not urban planning it has a feature housing infrastructure fund which is money set aside to pay for infrastructure to support the private developer s vision this fund could cover parks play areas but it could also cover drains and water etc but that is not urban planning for the local community the risk is the fund will just be mitigation after an eyesore is built and the damage done to the house values of surrounding private home owners the result one group is allowed to make money over another group some developers may not care if large buildings are built beside their properties as they can put one up beside it and each building can look into each other the private developer sector s vision is bounded by the constraints of i have this bit of land here and i need to maximise the profit from it so i stay comfortably in business even allowing for ideas like stunning new architecture it is still bounded by those facts and those facts are not transformative urban planning in a positive community led way the urban growth agenda also has the housing acceleration fund which provides for government directed as well as private developments why should it include private developments when these companies already have access to funds through debt leveraging which banks seem quite happy to do our current housing experience in auckland already shows private developers are not building affordable housing they advertise studio apartments for 600 000 this suits short term rentals airbnb investments or young men looking for a bolthole to call their own and if a studio costing 600k is rented out the rent will be high it will not be affordable the history of private developers conflicting with the resource management act is simply their vision conflicting with others who are also stakeholders in the community a simple way to fix this problem is for there to be an earlier process to identify needs in the city a proper urban plan of what the housing should approximately look like in this or that area or site and then for developers bidding or volunteering to be part of that development the current connect of development and ownership of random pieces of land and then developers trying to impose their vision on that piece of land is causing conflict urban development should be more planned areas should change as part of a process that is well signalled and worked towards over time in many areas of central wellington for example this can be done quickly as there is so much low intensity commercial use the current urban growth agenda is not urban planning but a one sided urban permission to build the plan too much takes the side of the developers interests once high rises are built there will be community reactions developers will then say we are just doing what we are allowed to within the rules the public will then turn on the rules makers the government and council it is a recipe for anger and conflict which is generally not good long term politics there are many ideas to fix the affordable housing crisis while increasing intensification which i fully support i cover these in part 4 of this four part series wellington city an example of planning relaxation that will not lead to intensification and affordable housing supply presumably following the urban growth agenda the current wellington city council has gone zombie logic against historic suburbs in the mistaken belief that this is the cause of a lack of intensification in the central city where more people want to live but a simple glance across the city shows there is lots of low level commercial buildings and plenty of land on which to intensively build e g te aro and there is little heritage over large parts huge fields of carparks cover large amounts of te aro so intensification is not happening in the non heritage areas which indicates that heritage is not the cause of a lack of intensification there is simply no economic push to intensity which is why intensification hasn t happened and reducing the planning rules to increase the amount of land that could be available to intensify which is what the council has done will actually reduce the drive to intensify in the central areas the issue is simply not about heritage holding back intensification and counterintuitively is not about relaxing planning restrictions to increase the supply of land there needs to be some scarcity and an economic push to intensify profit is a good one but that won t make for affordable housing and not just a council or government planning rule we want to intensify and a permission you can developers will be screaming at this point there is scarcity now okay so what is causing that scarcity for their development ideas landbanking developers have their little pieces of land they want to develop but they can t get central city pieces of land because others own it and are just holding it for huge capital gains and possibly a lack of finance or ideas or ability or desire as an example wellington city is underdeveloped for central city living because of previous lax misguided neo liberal councils and in part caused by reducing rates on commercial ratepayers and shifting the cost of commercial rates reductions onto residential taxpayers as part of the user pays philosophy with lower land rates costs businesses can afford to sprawl and underutilise land land banking is more cost effective with low costs this has encouraged a lack of intensification of land use in the central city and encouraged suburban sprawl up the coast and hutt valley to get affordable housing the wellington city council is currently allowing several developments of low level townhouses in the city car yards in taranaki street and near vivian street between willis and victoria streets the obvious question why aren t these semi industrial commercial areas car yards and carparks developed into quality high rise intensified living areas the owners likely answer is that low level two story builds are lower cost to build compared to multi storey builds and therefore profit is maximised but the real answer is nobody is demanding they build up or else developers should be instructed that as this site area is slated for medium to high density housing therefore they must comply and build it that way and if they are unwilling to do so then perhaps somebody else will another example to demonstrate this lack of push to build up is car parks in wellington carparks used to be many stories high now te aro has many sprawling field carparks parking provides enough income to business to cover costs there is no drive for central city landowners to intensify and make the most of their land so they do not council has listened and responded to developers who argued about planning issues because that is what developers see but what residents see is liveability with heritage there are plenty of other areas to build affordable housing without destroying heritage the new wellington spatial plan which has significantly relaxed planning rules is a disaster for heritage housing in central wellington and the liveability of the city for all ratepayers heritage brings tourism and is one of the main factors that makes a place special and gives it character successful central cities have gardens and trees connected to history that allow views and sun for those who have lived in and hated dilapidated heritage houses that fault lies with the landowners who are land banking and exploiting people that is what needs to stop heritage housing can easily be renovated and restored to a modern exciting excellent standard to those who say heritage is a poor use of land which is not permitting inner city development to occur so as to accomodate an increase in inner city residents and people come first heritage is people coming first the brand new two story no parking townhouses in taranaki street are no more effective at housing than low level heritage yes more people will live there than before it was a car yard but what about the long term opportunity cost of not having medium to high density intensification on those sites more importantly these are crammed in with little outlook or privacy the chances of them being subject to an urban vicious cycle is quite high i e good residents move out as the units are too cramped not private noisy from wooden frames ergo rents drop maintenance drops those with little means arrive poverty can drive overcrowding meaning more people move out repeat but even if we destroy all heritage and built residential burj khalifi towers over every block in wellington a time will come when all space will be used with a maximum possible number of people then what for the people who still want to come my point there is a limit to the number of people who can live central new york did not destroy central park to allow more people to live central beijing didn t destroy the forbidden city to allow more people to live central wellington should not destroy its heritage either heritage pre 1930 s houses is a very finite and dwindling resource that is critical to the wellington economy i e tourism including domestic tourism it is also critical for the liveability of all residents and unfortunately new zealand history can t just be corralled to a few tiny zones as proposed in the plan because historic houses in wellington have not been corralled previously so they are mixed in with other buildings that is the nature of history the problems arise as though the buildings do not mind a big new six story building beside it the people living there do and they vote relaxing planning rules on heritage is not the solution to drive intensification of the residential housing supply more planning and direct requirements on developers is needed not less but their projects can be supported when they accord or are adapted to fit with the community s vision of the city it could be that a developer may have land in an unsuitable location for their desired project but there may be land in another location held by council or government or somebody else that could fit with that development so it could be supported by a land transfer or some such vision i put forward several solutions to the housing affordability crisis and the need for intensification in part 4 of this four part series i also suggest that wellington city councillors roll back their spatial plan before the next local body election as there is already talk about councillors being challenged it is a political gift to an opposition when large buildings are built in low level residential areas councillors want affordable housing and intensification like i do but the roll back of planning restrictions is the empowerment of big business to force through changes they want without direct community involvement you are facilitating the old neo liberal ideas that have failed so ironic that nicola young didn t vote for less planning rules good on her on affordability you are saying to developers you do it build it save us but that is simply not how they operate they are attracted by the high prices for high rewards but the high prices can t deliver the affordable rents as they must have a sufficient return on capital your permission to developers to ignore the community is going to come back and bite you solutions we first need to acknowledge there is an affordable housing crisis also it is not a political issue but a fact that needs action to be taken to address it the current actions will not fix it because the underlying economic forces are still in place that trap investors in the housing market and an increasing number of renters will be trapped renting with long term equity consequences for the new zealand economy that is the basis for the following suggestions it is the crisis that means we must look at things that may previously have been unthinkable for many no political party should be upset about redirecting investment into the productive economy for innovation and exports no political party should want to stop voters the average new zealander having the chance to build some equity through owning a house and possibly create business opportunities for their family and for the rest of society from that equity those on the conservative side might reflect on the fact that homeowners have traditionally been more conservative voters who are eternal renters may be less conservative than you would like tough confronting solutions have to be looked at it is a crisis the following areas of action are needed the normal principles of taxation are overdue for a reset not just for housing but in regards to how it directs and shapes the economy and supports tax avoidance if done right it can lead to a less growth oriented economic model but a more sustainable one less chance of boom bust with more economic activity that benefits smaller entrepreneurs and nz based businesses if we don t do this the lack of affordable housing will remain a problem for new zealand as the principles are twisted in our economic environment and it will continue to push money into housing that is not affordable i have developed a submission that reduces tax avoidance and by shutting down some behaviours it redirects investment capital into innovation exports technology and small local businesses provide councils communities and government with the tools to urban plan more forcefully and directly these can then be used to ramp up affordable housing much more quickly the current idea with reduced planning rules is to give that force to private developers ensure the current housing stock is available and being used to reduce the affordable housing crisis this is a cheaper and quicker option than building new especially compared with intensification projects create secure profitable alternative investment options other than housing government must take the lead to build an affordable housing market there is no escaping the fact that the government must take the lead it must be government projects first the recent trends show private enterprise does not deliver affordable housing the burden must be on private developers to prove otherwise how can the government build affordable housing the government is best placed to provide affordable housing but is constrained by not having much control over urban land on which to build and intensify housing and it needs to be fiscally prudent to prevent inflation so it must be careful about borrowing so as the need for social housing is in crisis the government should take some or all of the following steps to get hold of existing residential housing trade in house for investment security mum and dad investors with one or two rentals may be willing to trade the rentals in for a long term government term deposit paying a high rate of interest that is sufficient to compensate for loss of the rental revenue this means government gets a house it can provide instantly to a family or person in social need displacement of demand by another renter occurs but it is for a higher need mum and dad investors with one or two rentals may be willing to trade the rentals in for a long term government paying a high rate of interest that is sufficient to compensate for loss of the rental revenue this means government gets a house it can provide instantly to a family or person in social need public works act acquisition we do it for roads so let s use it for affordable housing sites close to transport could be taken if they were identified for development from my understanding the act is actually generous and some people dream of the cash injection from having some rural land taken a question to consider is should it be this generous in the netherlands and germany such acquisitions for housing are normally made at existing land use cost i ve not researched what happens in new zealand we do it for roads so let s use it for affordable housing sites close to transport could be taken if they were identified for development from my understanding the act is actually generous and some people dream of the cash injection from having some rural land taken a question to consider is should it be this generous trade up a home for a home if an intensive development is going to occur but some local houses are needed for that development then perhaps they should be invited to choose one of the brand new houses at no cost to surrender their existing house this policy would need to consider how much mortgage there is to pay should some of that mortgage be paid as well if an intensive development is going to occur but some local houses are needed for that development then perhaps they should be invited to choose one of the brand new houses at no cost to surrender their existing house this policy would need to consider how much mortgage there is to pay should some of that mortgage be paid as well low intensity land use swap a developer may have a vision for urban housing intensification and can think of a site where it would be good but does not own the land in such a situation a process could be initiated to evaluate the desirability of the low intensity land use versus the quality affordable development and whether the two could be integrated e g business on a lower level with apartments above once a decision is made a swap of land could be enforced and perhaps a small compensation paid exemptions for historic buildings can be made for low intensity use other factors would need to be considered the same could also apply for the government or local council around transport hubs where they have a desire for housing intensification or other urban planning objectives like parks that would support intensified housing a developer may have a vision for urban housing intensification and can think of a site where it would be good but does not own the land in such a situation a process could be initiated to evaluate the desirability of the low intensity land use versus the quality affordable development and whether the two could be integrated e g business on a lower level with apartments above once a decision is made a swap of land could be enforced and perhaps a small compensation paid exemptions for historic buildings can be made for low intensity use other factors would need to be considered the same could also apply for the government or local council around transport hubs where they have a desire for housing intensification or other urban planning objectives like parks that would support intensified housing reverse mortgages for house acquisition the government eyeing up future development sites or as a more general service could enter the reverse mortgage market with lower fees and protections for these people a purpose in this is that the house could eventually become an asset for affordable housing it should allow transfers from other entities that hold reverse mortgages these mortgages are generally not good for home owners in rising markets several of these options are relatively low cost to the government or a council there is a cost layout but the asset house and land will be on the government s council s books once land is accumulated the process may be the government council create a site designing and planning its function and then inviting tenders to build it if land is going to ancillary services or activities attached to it e g shops there may be the possibility of a joint cost or build it could be that a site or area is identified and developers are invited to make proposals and tenders for development of that site redirecting investment from housing trade in house for investment security the first bullet above is a key component for redirecting investment in some ways it is similar to a mum and dad rental investors who pay a property company to handle dealing with the rental maintenance and monitoring etc and the renters so they don t really see the rental house this option would have to be developed and promoted the first bullet above is a key component for redirecting investment in some ways it is similar to a mum and dad rental investors who pay a property company to handle dealing with the rental and the renters so they don t really see the rental house this option would have to be developed and promoted micro private public partnership the government can also rethink the private public partnership model which is heavily centred on cooperation with large corporate enterprises the government could trial a descale down to individual new zealand investors a series of infrastructure projects e g transport housing education research stadium could be announced and people could choose to sign up to invest in the ones they want to their capital could be used to support the construction and then they would get some sort of reward over time as the asset is used it means new zealanders can use their capital to back new zealand projects and they can see the result the government would have to ensure there is not too much exposure to risk just like they do with a big business other options to deliver affordable housing sooner requiring maintenance of historic houses for historic houses pre 1930 s the local council should have the power whether the building is rented or not to require the owner to bring the house up to a modern or restored excellent standard of housing a house cannot be left to become dilapidated even if the owner chooses to do that because it is an asset for the city and future generations it is also a little piece of carbon capture but as importantly the community must ensure a person living there is not at a health fire or safety risk to themselves or others if the house is rented then the renting standards should apply there should be no slum landlords but the local council or government perhaps administered by heritage new zealand must decide if any action is to be taken should the owner not be financially able to update the house professionally then the council government should undertake the work and the amount spent becomes a low interest loan that is secured over the property they should not be permitted to do the work themselves unless it is professionally being done and checked timeframes would be established when the person sells or dies the loan can be collected from the house sale disposal or the house can move into the council s or government s stock of affordable housing assets with any balance in value paid out to the estate for historic houses the local council should have the power whether the

home tax this is a tax in vancouver as i understand anecdotally around wellington there are lots of empty houses that could be rented but aren t such houses should be sold if the person doesn t want to do it up neighbours could be one of the main way this is identified obviously more work needs to be done to investigate and establish how this would work before it is applied this is a tax in vancouver as i understand anecdotally around wellington there are lots of empty houses that could be rented but aren t such houses should be sold if the person doesn t want to do it up neighbours could be one of the main way this is identified obviously more work needs to be done to investigate and establish how this would work before it is applied if a house has no occupier then the house must be required to be rented this is similar to an historic houses requirement and an empty home tax if the house is in need of repair so it can then be rented the council can undertake the work contract in and the cost of the work becomes a loan normal interest secured against the house in wellington for example there is anecdotally many empty houses that are a little rough but could quickly and easily be brought up to an excellent standard for rental if the house is still not rented then the empty home tax would apply details to stop delaying tactics would all need to be worked out these options would all generate local work and open opportunities for apprenticeships they are quicker than new builds to increase the housing supply how should the government council treat housing ownership when built through schemes it leads or looks after the ownership model for affordable residential housing is open government ownership with rotating occupancy as people move on traditional state housing occupiers and rents rent to buy with financial support schemes from government to make this viable government creates and builds affordable housing on sells the price will vary according to each development price would be influenced by market but pushed down to make affordability possible on sells the price will vary according to each development price would be influenced by market but pushed down to make affordability possible government owns houses but rentals not targeted to any economic group rents capped at affordability for the renter e g 20 of income as income rises so does the rent a mix of the above is possible and there may well be others e g below rent capped rent capped according to some economists there should be no need to buy a house but just rent which gives social economic mobility if people need to move for work or there s a change in family circumstances i do not support this model but it is not without some merit if this was the case most housing should be owned by government or other entities and rent capped according to an affordability concept e g 20 of income some push back may occur if private entities complain about the ability to maintain property or to get a sufficient return on capital you can clearly see the housing investment sector is currently in a holding pattern due to the government announcements on removing interest deductibility and the inland revenue discussion document that holds out the prospect of options to get around the restrictions but if this rent cap was required by government now it would certainly create a very quick and immediate reaction in the rental and housing sectors it is not something i would recommend but excess investor demand would dry up almost instantly in summary the new zealand economy is a one horse pony based on residential housing excessive investor demand driven by the normal principles of taxation leveraging and a lack of safe alternative investor options is holding up prices leading to a housing affordability crisis high prices shut out working and middle class people from buying and make saving deposits impossible as high prices mean high rents even if banks make huge loans for people to buy this strips disposable income out of the economy just as high rents do this leads to less demand through all other sectors of the new zealand economy e g education arts domestic tourism hospitality the trades as importantly it leads to less chance for a person to build equity to one day take up a business opportunity of their own making which in turn could employ others and turn into a medium sized business that further benefits new zealand new zealand has had almost forty years of a private business model focus on housing and it has not delivered affordable housing but rather the opposite it can not deliver supply to meet demand the new build to rent model is driven off the current system and the prospect of good profit not affordability but we cannot build our way to sufficient quality affordable houses because all the drivers of excess demand remain in place so prices will remain high we need to make a collective effort not just our private effort and use the strength of government for tax reform overhaul existing housing stock and building the affordable housing crisis is not just about the low quality of the lives of new zealanders now and the problems from low levels of disposable incomes it is now about the strength of the economic future of new zealand for our children s and grandchildren s sake editor s note

here s what you need to remember the navy s decision to punt on the montana class will disappoint battleship lovers forever fortunately it probably shortened the war and saved many lives the u s navy s most powerful battleships were never actually built the five montana class battleships leviathans designed to dwarf even the giant iowa class battleships were authorized for construction but never built victims of the ascendance of naval aviation nearly as large as a modern supercarrier the montana class like all battleships was made obsolete by the success of the aircraft carrier in the late 1930s the u s government recognizing the deteriorating world situation sought to rebuild u s naval power the crash of the stock market in october 1939 as well as the washington and london naval treaties had slowed the growth of the u s navy and reduced its tempo of peacetime operations by 1940 however with fighting raging in asia and europe it was clear the united states needed to beef up its defensive capability to deter attack or to prosecute a war if it were dragged into conflict in 1940 the federal government authorized the famous two ocean navy capability that laid the groundwork for the wartime u s navy that followed one set of authorized ships five montana class battleships to complement the iowa class battleships america s shipyards would split the work between the philadelphia navy yard two new york navy yard two and norfolk navy yard one numerous proposals were floated for the montana class ships though they all had one thing in common they were considerably larger than the iowas the iowa class battleships were 860 feet long displaced 58 000 tons fully loaded and featured nine 16 50 caliber main guns secondary armament was in the form of twenty 5 38 caliber dual purpose guns capable of firing on targets in the air on land and at sea speed would have been 28 knots slower than the iowa class 33 knot top speed the montanas montana ohio maine new hampshire and louisiana would be slower than the iowas but much more heavily armed and armored one of the first designs of the class which never made it off paper was for an 860 foot long warship with a displacement of 52 000 tons with a trial displacement of 64 500 tons the ships would have been armed with twelve 16 50 caliber guns giving them twenty five percent more firepower in the main battery the twelve guns would have been installed in four three gun turrets two forward and two aft to the iowa classes two forward and one aft secondary armament would consist of twenty 5 inch 38 caliber dual purpose guns capable of anti ship amphibious landing support and anti air defense by march 1940 navy ship architects floated a new even bigger design a battleship 1 050 feet long with a waterline beam of 120 feet the ship would have a standard displacement of 70 000 tons and a trial displacement of 80 000 tons the main battery would have stayed the same but the secondary battery would feature twenty 5 inch 54 caliber guns the longer barrel length on the new 5 inch guns resulted in a higher velocity and longer range thus increasing the size of the battleship s protective bubble against aircraft officially the u s navy states the montanas would have been a compromise between the two designs though on the high end the navy s statistics for the ships include a length of 921 feet a beam of 121 feet and the same armament of twelve 16 50 guns and twenty 5 inch 54 caliber guns top speed would have been the same as previous ships maxing out at 28 knots the navy states that the third design featured improved armor against shellfire and torpedo attacks over previous battleships and would have been the only new world war ii era u s battleships to be adequately armored against guns of the same power as their own the montana class battleships would have served on the u s navy s battleship line prepared to duke it out with the opposing navy s own fleet of battleships in a decisive battle unfortunately for the battleship community the reign of the battlewagon was already coming to an end the attack on pearl harbor on december 7th 1941 and the destruction of the royal navy s force z on december 10th 1941 made it painfully clear that aircraft including aircraft carriers had eclipsed battleships as the primary weapon at sea the sinking of the battleship hms prince of wales and battlecruiser hms repulse for the loss of only three japanese aircraft demonstrated how much large surface ships were at the mercy of airpower the montana battleships were initially delayed to prioritize new aircraft carrier construction then canceled outright in 1943 the u s navy would not build a ship as large as the proposed montanas until 1955 when the supercarrier uss forrestal entered service like montana forrestal was approximately 900 feet long and had displaced 80 000 tons fully loaded unlike montana however it could pack up to eighty five aircraft of various types on its flight deck and hangar giving it a much greater striking range flexibility in adapting to various missions and the ability to rapidly replace lost combat power by simply adding more aircraft the u s navy never built more battleships after the iowa class let alone larger ones the montana class battleships were obsolete before the steel was cut for them tragic for battleship fans but proof that the navy was heeding trends and choosing to spend resources wisely during a turbulent and stressful time had the navy stubbornly pushed ahead and built the montanas a lack of carriers could have extended the length of the war and cost even more lives ironically had the montanas been built we might look back on the battleship era with considerably less pride and nostalgia than we do today kyle mizokami is

michel martin host it has been a week of painful images and deep soul searching as america s longest war nears its end taking stock of these 20 years at war is going to be a long process but we wanted to spend some time considering what s been gained and what s been lost how is this conflict going to be viewed by history how might this long conflict have changed the country now this is going to be just one of many conversations but today we ve called on three guests who are experienced thinkers on this subject two of them are veterans themselves theodore johnson is the director of the fellows program at the brennan center for justice he is also a retired commander in the u s navy with two decades of service including as a military professor at the u s naval war college theodore johnson thank you so much for joining us theodore johnson thank you martin kathleen belew is a professor of modern history at the university of chicago her scholarship focuses on violence in american life and culture professor belew thank you so much for joining us as well kathleen belew thank you for having me martin and last but not least professor gary solis is a former u s marine company commander and a longtime professor of law of war including at georgetown university and west point professor solis welcome back to you as well gary solis thank you glad to be here martin professor solis let me start with you as we said you ve taught the law of war and conflict and i know that you ve written about and thought a lot about and talked a lot about ethical challenges that we have faced in this conflict over time i want to ask two things like what does this bring up for you and how do you think this war will be remembered solis well it brings up in me memories of past conflicts going back to the u s philippine war in 1899 to 1902 and how history tends to repeat itself and how do i think history will look at this war i would say that it will be reminded of the folly of hubris i think that this war will be remembered as evidence that republic and democracy is seldom a successful export and if one were a cynic one might say that it will be remembered as america s dominion in retreat martin hmm professor belew you are an historian of the modern era and we re still watching events unfold in afghanistan but i wanted to ask if you think we could start by thinking about what this conflict represents in american history 20 years of war ending in this way what are your thoughts about that belew you know the place that i always like to start is thinking about historical continuity and one of the things that i ve studied that s very concerning that is already afoot and likely to increase is a ginning up of activity among violent political extremists at home we ve seen the aftermath of war is the best predictor for klan and other white power kinds of activism and particularly after the vietnam war we saw this reach a fever pitch in the united states now what happens to that effect when we re talking about a prolonged conflict like the one that we are ending in the global war on terror i think we don t know yet but i think that there are some really important parallels between the images of the embassy falling in saigon in 1975 and the images we saw this week in afghanistan martin theodore johnson what about you i know that you served in afghanistan and you were mainly on ship because you were in the navy and you also have a background in intelligence you know as a military adviser to an intelligence agency i want to ask what this brings up for you how this is ending and what that s bringing up for you and also because you ve been writing about this lately what do you think this means for our national identity if there s a sense that this is a war that the u s has lost johnson yeah yeah so that idea that we have lost has tremendous ramifications for our nation s sense of itself as a military superpower so much of the consternation about our presence in afghanistan is not about national security alone but about security in our national identity are we still the nation that makes the world safe for democracy this experience in afghanistan has thrust the american capacity capability and interest in protecting democracy into question martin so theodore johnson stay with me for a minute here do you have a sense of the way how this will affect americans desire to get involved in issues overseas as you saw like during the last presidential campaign there was a debate about what america s responsibility is overseas and how that should be expressed and i m wondering if you think theodore johnson right now that this is affecting that debate in the united states johnson so i think that is putting two things in tension whether or not we have a moral obligation to protect afghans particularly women and children knowing that once we leave there that many of the human rights violations they experienced before we arrived in afghanistan in 2001 will return and that is in tension with the idea that we have national security interests to prevent terrorist organizations from sort of regrouping and mounting an offensive from afghanistan as they did in 2001 if we have a national security interest then we will expend resources and time et cetera in order to keep forces in country and put that threat to bed if we have a moral obligation we will do the same but when the national interest suggests that the threat has been mitigated and that it s time for the troops to come home then that s in tension with the idea that we have a moral obligation to stick around martin professor solis do you mind if i ask because yourself obviously you know you served for such a long time and you have a lot of relationships remaining how are the people that you talk to i m particularly interested in returning service members talking about the end of this conflict and the way it ended solis well i haven t had an opportunity to talk to many people about how it is ending but i am pretty confident that i know what at least the friends that i have are thinking about and they re saying that laughter well i can t you know martin can t use the language they re solis i can t use the words but they re thinking that this is pretty fouled up and well the question of blame is another question entirely and i think that some americans would be surprised at where the blame really should be laid i feel that what has happened at the end of the conflict is a result of poor planning on the part of the military we had a four star general who was there for two years and he left with no plan no plan to get people out the state department on the other hand got all of their people out but they slow rolled visas for those who helped us in the conflict and i think that was another great mistake that does no justice to the righteousness of the war martin hmm professor belew you know after vietnam returning service members were some of the most vocal about social issues here in the u s i mean that whole vietnam generation had a real mark on our politics wouldn t you say belew absolutely martin and i m wondering what your sense is of how returning service members from this conflict will make their mark belew so i think one thing to keep in mind here is that we have in this conversation we ve been talking about war as if it is only fought out there and then the violence of warfare stays where we put it and this is simply not how it works i think that one of the things that the war in vietnam shows us is that different ramifications of political and actual violence come into the home front in a lot of unpredictable ways in the aftermath of war it measures across all sectors of society including nonveterans all of us men women children people who served who didn t everyone is more violent in the aftermath of warfare but the aftermath of vietnam we see the loss we see the outspoken anti war movement largely helmed by veterans we see a movement against that we see white power activism we see paramilitarism and we see a large social reluctance to warfare in the whole of our society but the thing that s different here is the timespan so i teach undergraduates they don t remember a time when we were not at war this has been going on for such a long time and has impacted so many different people and has been a sort of subsumed part of our accepted political reality for such a long time that i think that we all have a lot of coming to terms to do to enter this new moment martin that s fascinating theodore johnson i want to ask you because you are often called upon to comment on sort of current politics you know political issues what effect do you think this has on president biden s domestic agenda those scenes of chaos at the airport and you know chaos in the street does that translate into kind of a lack of confidence in president biden s leadership domestically johnson it remains to be seen but one thing is true americans have short memories so the idea that the pictures we re seeing today will harm democrats in presidential elections in 2024 or even in the midterms next year that s an open question and one that i m not completely convinced of more important in terms of politics not in terms of substance of the matter is the way the exit is framed if this is seen as biden being weak in his leadership sort of losing control of the situation that stigma will stick with him more than the visuals of afghans in the airport trying to be evacuated i think what we ve seen in biden s first eight months is he s deployed the vaccine out across the country and tried to reopen schools and the economy he s gotten an infrastructure bill passed a major one that many previous presidents have failed on and now he s adding a feather in his cap on the exit of afghanistan all things that americans wanted so if he can shape these three major accomplishments in his first eight months as a win i don t know that he pays a political price for the visuals we re seeing today however if the situation in afghanistan worsens if there is an attack somewhere then they will characterize the exit as a lack of planning a lack of strategic thinking a lack of leadership and i think those labels will stick with him in ways that may be politically damaging more so than again the pictures or the video that s coming out of the country today martin professor solis i want to give you the last word was this war worth it in your opinion and what s your sense of whether other americans will think it was worth it solis i don t mean to waffle on you but i think it s a two edged question i think it was a righteous conflict that we got into after 9 11 that we should have gotten into and that the american public are strongly in favor of but things rapidly went downhill we started paying bounties for people to be arrested we ended up with guantanamo and so forth and i think through political misjudgments and ineptitude it became something that it s difficult to be proud of but then i would also ask as ted suggested who remembers vietnam who remembers what happened on the rooftop of the embassy when we were trying to get nobody remembers that the memories of the american public are short they will remember 9 11 and they will forget much of what has come after so i would say on balance this was a war that was worth it martin that s professor gary solis he s a former u s marine company commander he s a longtime professor of the law of war including at georgetown university

civilisation has tended to be seen like a gift by those claiming to grant it it is done in the sense rudyard kipling intended it with solemn duty it is a task discharged as a burden borne heavily in its modern form notably in the hands of the us it comes with fast food roads schools and blue chip stocks civilisation in this context is also unsolicited imposed upon a country whether they would wish it to be autonomy comes into it superficially the custodianship of a puppet regime often rapacious the results of such unsolicited gifts are there to be seen by the proclaimed civilisers who eventually leave of which afghanistan is simply another example they create classes and groups of citizens who risk being compromised by the forces that seize power they cause discord and disruption to local conditions when the paternalism of civilisation s builders goes wrong the only ones blamed are those who either did not understand it or ignored its beneficent properties this was the implication in the august 16 speech by president joseph biden to be fair biden had never believed in a counsterinsurgency or nation building mission to begin with being in afghanistan had in his mind only one purpose counterterrorism and the threat had changed metastasized to include a global consortium of challenges al shabaab in somalia al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al nusra in syria the efforts of isis advertisement while the speed of the taliban s advance had surprised the president he noted those afghan political leaders who gave up and fled the country the us armed afghan military had collapsed sometimes without trying to fight all of this provided firm reassurance to him that ending us military involvement in afghanistan now was the right decision us troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves an acknowledgment was also made about the money training and material provided those attributes of imperial supply to local soldiers who simply would not pull their weight we spent over a trillion dollars we trained and equipped an afghan military force of some 300 000 strong incredibly well equipped a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our nato allies such a picture of ingratitude the paternalists stricken by a misplaced sense of duty of care insist that more must be done to save personnel who worked for coalition forces and afghans who served their projects washington s allies have been scolding accusing biden of not carrying the standard of western values high enough let alone long enough norbert röttgen chairman of the german parliament s foreign relations committee assessed the withdrawal as fundamentally damaging to the political and moral credibility of the west these were bitter events for the believers in democracy and freedom especially for women german politicians had gone so far as to see the mission in afghanistan in moral terms it was meant to be an invasion without those historically militarist overtones that had characterised previous uses of german military strength the security of the federal republic of germany declared former defence minister peter struck in justifying the troop presence is also being defended in the hindu kush tom tugendhat conservative chair of the uk parliament s foreign affairs committee put a touch of britannic gloss on the episode using all the themes that come with benevolent and eventually departing empire afghanistan is the biggest foreign policy disaster since suez we need to think again about how we handle friends who matters and how we defend our interests in the us itself the worried paternalists on the hill are many democratic senators bob menendez of new jersey chair of the senate foreign relations committee edward markey of massachusetts and jeanne shaheen of new hampshire have women s rights on their mind in a letter to secretary of state antony blinken and secretary of homeland security alejandro mayorkas the signed parties strongly urged the creation of a humanitarian parole category especially for women leaders activists human rights defenders judges parliamentarians journalists and members of the female tactical platoon of the afghan special security forces and to streamline the paperwork process to facilitate referrals to allow for fast humane and efficient relocation to the united states advertisement for these worried souls the demonic taliban is responsible for war crimes summary executions public beatings and flogging of women sexual violence and forced marriage as well as a press clampdown there is no mention of a restoration of order the reining in of banditry and the protection of property their version of the afghan conflict is one resolutely cockeyed shaheen of the senate armed services and foreign relations committees issued a plea to biden for swift decisive action lest afghan civilians suffer or die at the hands of the taliban massachusetts democrat rep seth moulton chastised the leaders from both parties who refused to go on with the occupation they had failed to hold the votes for re authorizing this conflict for the last two decades since we invaded to find osama bin laden for that all of us in congress should be ashamed the subtext to all of this we should be telling the afghans what to do how to sort out squabbles and how to march to the beat of our nation building tune like fans of the deceptively named responsibility to protect doctrine it is left to powerful states to determine the conditions under which such responsibility is determined and when the gift of civilisation shall be provided the line between the duty to protect and the idea of might is right is not only crossed but rubbed out altogether amidst the warnings pleas and bleeding heart urgings the apologists ignore that the mission civilisatrice in afghanistan came with its own barbarisms atrocities torture the use of drones and an assortment of devilishly lethal weapons but these were seen as a necessary toll the events unfolding over the last few days should be offering us lawmakers and washington s allies firm lessons these promise to be ignored

afghanistan as they did in 2001 if we have a national security interest then we will expend resources and time et cetera in order to keep forces in country and put that threat to bed if we have a moral obligation we will do the same but when the national interest suggests that the threat has been mitigated and that it s time for the troops to come home then that s in tension with the idea that we have a moral obligation to stick around martin professor solis do you mind if i ask because yourself obviously you know you served for such a long time and you have a lot of relationships remaining how are the people that you talk to i m particularly interested in returning service members talking about the end of this conflict and the way it ended solis well i haven t had an opportunity to talk to many people about how it is ending but i am pretty confident that i know what at least the friends that i have are thinking about and they re saying that laughter well i can t you know martin can t use the language they re solis i can t use the words but they re thinking that this is pretty fouled up and well the question of blame is another question entirely and i think that some americans would be surprised at where the blame really should be laid i feel that what has happened at the end of the conflict is a result of poor planning on the part of the military we had a four star general who was there for two years and he left with no plan no plan to get people out the state department on the other hand got all of their people out but they slow rolled visas for those who helped us in the conflict and i think that was another great mistake that does no justice to the righteousness of the war martin hmm professor belew you know after vietnam returning service members were some of the most vocal about social issues here in the u s i mean that whole vietnam generation had a real mark on our politics wouldn t you say belew absolutely martin and i m wondering what your sense is of how returning service members from this conflict will make their mark belew so i think one thing to keep in mind here is that we have in this conversation we ve been talking about war as if it is only fought out there and then the violence of warfare stays where we put it and this is simply not how it works i think that one of the things that the war in vietnam shows us is that different ramifications of political and actual violence come into the home front in a lot of unpredictable ways in the aftermath of war it measures across all sectors of society including nonveterans all of us men women children people who served who didn t everyone is more violent in the aftermath of warfare but the aftermath of vietnam we see the loss we see the outspoken anti war movement largely helmed by veterans we see a movement against that we see white power activism we see paramilitarism and we see a large social reluctance to warfare in the whole of our society but the thing that s different here is the timespan so i teach undergraduates they don t remember a time when we were not at war this has been going on for such a long time and has impacted so many different people and has been a sort of subsumed part of our accepted political reality for such a long time that i think that we all have a lot of coming to terms to do to enter this new moment martin that s fascinating theodore johnson i want to ask you because you are often called upon to comment on sort of current politics you know political issues what effect do you think this has on president biden s domestic agenda those scenes of chaos at the airport and you know chaos in the street does that translate into kind of a lack of confidence in president biden s leadership domestically johnson it remains to be seen but one thing is true americans have short memories so the idea that the pictures we re seeing today will harm democrats in presidential elections in 2024 or even in the midterms next year that s an open question and one that i m not completely convinced of more important in terms of politics not in terms of substance of the matter is the way the exit is framed if this is seen as biden being weak in his leadership sort of losing control of the situation that stigma will stick with him more than the visuals of afghans in the airport trying to be evacuated i think what we ve seen in biden s first eight months is he s deployed the vaccine out across the country and tried to reopen schools and the economy he s gotten an infrastructure bill passed a major one that many previous presidents have failed on and now he s adding a feather in his cap on the exit of afghanistan all things that americans wanted so if he can shape these three major accomplishments in his first eight months as a win i don t know that he pays a political price for the visuals we re seeing today however if the situation in afghanistan worsens if there is an attack somewhere then they will characterize the exit as a lack of planning a lack of strategic thinking a lack of leadership and i think those labels will stick with him in ways that may be politically damaging more so than again the pictures or the video that s coming out of the country today martin professor solis i want to give you the last word was this war worth it in your opinion and what s your sense of whether other americans will think it was worth it solis i don t mean to waffle on you but i think it s a two edged question i think it was a righteous conflict that we got into after 9 11 that we should have gotten into and that the american public are strongly in favor of but things rapidly went downhill we started paying bounties for people to be arrested we ended up with guantanamo and so forth and i think through political misjudgments and ineptitude it became something that it s difficult to be proud of but then i would also ask as ted suggested who remembers vietnam who remembers what happened on the rooftop of the embassy when we were trying to get nobody remembers that the memories of the american public are short they will remember 9 11 and they will forget much of what has come after so i would say on balance this was a war that was worth it martin that s professor gary solis he s a former u s marine company commander he s a longtime professor of the law of war including at georgetown university

after the ignominious exit of america from afghanistan three weeks ago everyone is wondering about the shape of things to come in terms of historical parallels it is on par with the defeat russia suffered at the japanese in 1894 and in afghanistan in 1989 wrote that the world was witnessing a major transition wherein the 500 year dominance of the western hemisphere was getting rapidly eroded ruminating over this last saturday t n ninan a distinguished former editor of this paper that the world was witnessing a major transition wherein the 500 year dominance of the western hemisphere was getting rapidly eroded that s absolutely true but it is also worth reiterating that this has been happening with unfailing regularity

michel martin host it has been a week of painful images and deep soul searching as america s longest war nears its end taking stock of these 20 years at war is going to be a long process but we wanted to spend some time considering what s been gained and what s been lost how is this conflict going to be viewed by history how might this long conflict have changed the country now this is going to be just one of many conversations but today we ve called on three guests who are experienced thinkers on this subject two of them are veterans themselves theodore johnson is the director of the fellows program at the brennan center for justice he is also a retired commander in the u s navy with two decades of service including as a military professor at the u s naval war college theodore johnson thank you so much for joining us theodore johnson thank you martin kathleen belew is a professor of modern history at the university of chicago her scholarship focuses on violence in american life and culture professor belew thank you so much for joining us as well kathleen belew thank you for having me martin and last but not least professor gary solis is a former u s marine company commander and a longtime professor of law of war including at georgetown university and west point professor solis welcome back to you as well gary solis thank you glad to be here martin professor solis let me start with you as we said you ve taught the law of war and conflict and i know that you ve written about and thought a lot about and talked a lot about ethical challenges that we have faced in this conflict over time i want to ask two things like what does this bring up for you and how do you think this war will be remembered solis well it brings up in me memories of past conflicts going back to the u s philippine war in 1899 to 1902 and how history tends to repeat itself and how do i think history will look at this war i would say that it will be reminded of the folly of hubris i think that this war will be remembered as evidence that republic and democracy is seldom a successful export and if one were a cynic one might say that it will be remembered as america s dominion in retreat martin hmm professor belew you are an historian of the modern era and we re still watching events unfold in afghanistan but i wanted to ask if you think we could start by thinking about what this conflict represents in american history 20 years of war ending in this way what are your thoughts about that belew you know the place that i always like to start is thinking about historical continuity and one of the things that i ve studied that s very concerning that is already afoot and likely to increase is a ginning up of activity among violent political extremists at home we ve seen the aftermath of war is the best predictor for klan and other white power kinds of activism and particularly after the vietnam war we saw this reach a fever pitch in the united states now what happens to that effect when we re talking about a prolonged conflict like the one that we are ending in the global war on terror i think we don t know yet but i think that there are some really important parallels between the images of the embassy falling in saigon in 1975 and the images we saw this week in afghanistan martin theodore johnson what about you i know that you served in afghanistan and you were mainly on ship because you were in the navy and you also have a background in intelligence you know as a military adviser to an intelligence agency i want to ask what this brings up for you how this is ending and what that s bringing up for you and also because you ve been writing about this lately what do you think this means for our national identity if there s a sense that this is a war that the u s has lost johnson yeah yeah so that idea that we have lost has tremendous ramifications for our nation s sense of itself as a military superpower so much of the consternation about our presence in afghanistan is not about national security alone but about security in our national identity are we still the nation that makes the world safe for democracy this experience in afghanistan has thrust the american capacity capability and interest in protecting democracy into question martin so theodore johnson stay with me for a minute here do you have a sense of the way how this will affect americans desire to get involved in issues overseas as you saw like during the last presidential campaign there was a debate about what america s responsibility is overseas and how that should be expressed and i m wondering if you think theodore johnson right now that this is affecting that debate in the united states johnson so i think that is putting two things in tension whether or not we have a moral obligation to protect afghans particularly women and children knowing that once we leave there that many of the human rights violations they experienced before we arrived in afghanistan in 2001 will return and that is in tension with the idea that we have national security interests to prevent terrorist organizations from sort of regrouping and mounting an offensive from afghanistan as they did in 2001 if we have a national security interest then we will expend resources and time et cetera in order to keep forces in country and put that threat to bed if we have a

the swift and startling takeover of afghanistan by the taliban in the wake of the us backed ashraf ghani regime in kabul is causing concern not only about the war ravaged country s future but also about its potential implications for pakistan s economy in the short to medium term even though the return of the taliban will likely affect all regional economies pakistan was the immediate focus of international investors as indicated by rising yields of its dollar denominated eurobonds in the wake of the quick collapse of the ghani administration though it is too early to predict the economic spillover of the taliban s return to power after 20 years in regional countries like pakistan serious concerns remain while a stable and secure afghanistan is projected to work in islamabad s favour the comeback of the taliban is not going to be trouble free for pakistan with chaos in the neighbourhood triggering risks of an influx of refugees and insecurity spillovers the taliban takeover in afghanistan has several unanswered questions about the shape of the future government and its acceptability to the international community and whether the taliban will keep their promises made to the world intermarket securities analyst raza jafri wrote in a note on the change in kabul for the investors of the immediate concern for pakistan according to him is the impact of the disruption in bilateral trade and the possible influx of afghan refugees of medium term importance is the possibility of a spillover of insecurity from afghanistan which will have serious implications for pakistan s security conditions with the hard fought gains over the last five years vulnerable to threats from the banned tehreek e taliban pakistan ttp the surge in the bond yields immediately after kabul s capture indicates that global investors are feeling jittery it ll increase the cost of future debt islamabad plans to raise from international markets another analyst who sought anonymity because of restrictions from his employer says the potential implications of insecurity in afghanistan and the taliban s failure to address the valid concerns of the world on political and human rights of afghans especially women and girls could be huge for pakistan there are already 15 million internally displaced people in afghanistan and the deterioration of the security conditions owing to the disagreement of the taliban on a broad based inclusive government could push millions into pakistan that will place a punishing burden on the economy and the external sector he argued further he is of the view that the security spillovers will have a long term impact on investment sentiments the surge in the bond yields immediately after the taliban retook kabul indicates that the global investors are feeling jittery about the situation it ll raise the cost of future debt islamabad plans to raise from the international markets to boost its reserves in addition to the refugee and insecurity spillovers he believes pakistan is facing a difficult situation with the us and other western powers if we re suspected of somehow endorsing the taliban and their actions against their opponents or violations of human and women rights it would make it difficult for islamabad to access multilateral dollars and lift debt from the international bond markets this will also bring the fiscal and external sectors under immense stress he contended almas hyder a businessman and chairman of the engineering development board is quite optimistic about the situation however the collapse of a pro india regime in kabul and the ascendancy of the taliban has reduced security risks for pakistan once the present transition period is over and stability returns to afghanistan we will be able to significantly increase exports to afghanistan besides accessing the central asian markets once the reconstruction work starts there pakistan will also have a big role to play with china leading the way to fill the void created by the american pullout from that country he believes that the taliban s comeback has made pakistan strategically more important to the us implying pakistan would continue to receive multilateral dollars another businessman who sought anonymity warns that the fears of insecurity spillovers into pakistan the resurgence of the terrorist groups linked to tehreek i taliban pakistan and the arrival of refugees are well founded we can escape these consequences of the regime change in afghanistan only by helping the international community convince the taliban to agree to the formation of an inclusive secular government representing different groups and ideologies fahad rauf head of research at ismail iqbal securities does not see much trade or reconstruction opportunity in afghanistan any time soon there will be no aggressive development in afghanistan or a massive jump in trade between the two countries unless the afghan economy also picks up he argued nevertheless he agrees that the establishment of a pro pakistan government in kabul will make pakistan especially balochistan securer which will help complete china pakistan economic corridor projects in that province besides attracting investment in oil gas exploration along the pak afghan border the greater involvement of china russia and pakistan in afghanistan will be a positive for that country s stability and development and if china invests there it will be good for pakistan as well he does not agree with the suggestion that the west will isolate pakistan because of afghanistan pakistan has already announced to go along with the international consensus when it comes to recognising the new rulers in kabul pakistan also wants peace there just like the us and the rest of the

nikki haley was governor of south carolina from 2011 to 2017 and u s ambassador to the united nations from 2017 to 2019 president biden badly bungled the withdrawal from afghanistan making the united states weaker and less safe while leaving more than 10 000 americans and 38 million afghans at the mercy of the brutal taliban he must not also bungle the coming decision on whether to recognize these barbarians as afghanistan s legitimate government doing so would bring the united states even lower while raising up a regime that deserves nothing but scorn and isolation shockingly the biden administration has yet to rule out recognizing the taliban the administration is taking stock of the situation while calling on the tyrannical group to protect the afghan people s rights hopefully biden is just posturing until we get all americans out if not it s an embarrassing reversal from the administration s previous promise to oppose the taliban if they took power at the point of a gun which they did this is not a run of the mill transfer of power it is a violent coup against a democratically elected government advertisement recognizing the taliban would ignore how sick and twisted it truly is the taliban of 2021 is little different from the taliban of 2001 then those terrorists harbored other terrorists namely the murderers behind the sept 11 attacks they are still terrorists as they proved in their violent 20 year insurgency that involved suicide bombings of marketplaces and throwing acid in the faces of schoolgirls they are already chanting death to america on the streets of kabul and they refuse to cut ties with al qaeda which is still active in afghanistan jihadist groups around the world are cheering the taliban s victory this time around the taliban is pretending to play nice its mouthpieces are telling the world it will be an inclusive islamic state yet what matters more is its bloodstained handiwork the taliban has reportedly already started to execute civilians in the streets forcibly marry young girls and return afghanistan to the dark ages u s recognition of the taliban would reward and encourage such evil actions worse it would encourage other revolutionaries and radicals in other countries to follow the taliban s lead why not overthrow the legitimate government when the united states will give its stamp of approval share this article share the united states should refuse recognition until the taliban proves over many years that it s part of the civilized world there s precedent for holding back it took 30 years for the united states to recognize communist china and 20 years to recognize communist vietnam in other cases we never acknowledged the claims of horrible regimes and rulers such as pol pot in cambodia given what we know and what s happening now the taliban should be treated no differently advertisement many of our allies have already shown more spine than biden britain has rejected prematurely or bilaterally recognizing the taliban while the european union has no plans to lend any legitimacy to afghanistan s new rulers meanwhile enemies china and russia have already cozied up to the taliban as they believe a terrorist run afghanistan weakens and endangers the united states the united nations is probably not far behind it must vote on whether the taliban is the true representative of afghanistan the united states should rally a majority of countries to oppose this move such a campaign would always be difficult given u n favoritism for dictators it is much more difficult thanks to biden s rushed withdrawal even our friends and allies distrust his judgment why follow the united states when its leadership is so disastrous biden may feel pressure to recognize the taliban because it would allow the united states to send aid to the afghan people this is foolish thinking every aid dollar will line only the pockets of their oppressors and empower the taliban to double down on its pre medieval tyranny more to the point the taliban threw away any chance of u s aid when it harbored the terrorists behind the sept 11 attacks no american foreign aid should ever go to the taliban advertisement

michel martin host it has been a week of painful images and deep soul searching as america s longest war nears its end taking stock of these 20 years at war is going to be a long process but we wanted to spend some time considering what s been gained and what s been lost how is this conflict going to be viewed by history how might this long conflict have changed the country now this is going to be just one of many conversations but today we ve called on three guests who are experienced thinkers on this subject two of them are veterans themselves theodore johnson is the director of the fellows program at the brennan center for justice he is also a retired commander in the u s navy with two decades of service including as a military professor at the u s naval war college theodore johnson thank you so much for joining us theodore johnson thank you martin kathleen belew is a professor of modern history at the university of chicago her scholarship focuses on violence in american life and culture professor belew thank you so much for joining us as well kathleen belew thank you for having me martin and last but not least professor gary solis is a former u s marine company commander and a longtime professor of law of war including at georgetown university and west point professor solis welcome back to you as well gary solis thank you glad to be here martin professor solis let me start with you as we said you ve taught the law of war and conflict and i know that you ve written about and thought a lot about and talked a lot about ethical challenges that we have faced in this conflict over time i want to ask two things like what does this bring up for you and how do you think this war will be remembered solis well it brings up in me memories of past conflicts going back to the u s philippine war in 1899 to 1902 and how history tends to repeat itself and how do i think history will look at this war i would say that it will be reminded of the folly of hubris i think that this war will be remembered as evidence that republic and democracy is seldom a successful export and if one were a cynic one might say that it will be remembered as america s dominion in retreat martin hmm professor belew you are an historian of the modern era and we re still watching events unfold in afghanistan but i wanted to ask if you think we could start by thinking about what this conflict represents in american history 20 years of war ending in this way what are your thoughts about that belew you know the place that i always like to start is thinking about historical continuity and one of the things that i ve studied that s very concerning that is already afoot and likely to increase is a ginning up of activity among violent political extremists at home we ve seen the aftermath of war is the best predictor for klan and other white power kinds of activism and particularly after the vietnam war we saw this reach a fever pitch in the united states now what happens to that effect when we re talking about a prolonged conflict like the one that we are ending in the global war on terror i think we don t know yet but i think that there are some really important parallels between the images of the embassy falling in saigon in 1975 and the images we saw this week in afghanistan martin theodore johnson what about you i know that you served in afghanistan and you were mainly on ship because you were in the navy and you also have a background in intelligence you know as a military adviser to an intelligence agency i want to ask what this brings up for you how this is ending and what that s bringing up for you and also because you ve been writing about this lately what do you think this means for our national identity if there s a sense that this is a war that the u s has lost johnson yeah yeah so that idea that we have lost has tremendous ramifications for our nation s sense of itself as a military superpower so much of the consternation about our presence in afghanistan is not about national security alone but about security in our national identity are we still the nation that makes the world safe for democracy this experience in afghanistan has thrust the american capacity capability and interest in protecting democracy into question martin so theodore johnson stay with me for a minute here do you have a sense of the way how this will affect americans desire to get involved in issues overseas as you saw like during the last presidential campaign there was a debate about what america s responsibility is overseas and how that should be expressed and i m wondering if you think theodore johnson right now that this is affecting that debate in the united states johnson so i think that is putting two things in tension whether or not we have a moral obligation to protect afghans particularly women and children knowing that once we leave there that many of the human rights violations they experienced before we arrived in afghanistan in 2001 will return and that is in tension with the idea that we have national security interests to prevent terrorist organizations from sort of regrouping and mounting an offensive from afghanistan as they did in 2001 if we have a national security interest then we will expend resources and time et cetera in order to keep forces in country and put that threat to bed if we have a moral obligation we will do the same but when the national interest suggests that the threat has been mitigated and that it s time for the troops to come home then that s in tension with the idea that we have a moral obligation to stick around martin professor solis do you mind if i ask because yourself obviously you know you served for such a long time and you have a lot of relationships remaining how are the people that you talk to i m particularly interested in returning service members talking about the end of this conflict and the way it ended solis well i haven t had an opportunity to talk to many people about how it is ending but i am pretty confident that i know what at least the friends that i have are thinking about and they re saying that laughter well i can t you know martin can t use the language they re solis i can t use the words but they re thinking that this is pretty fouled up and well the question of blame is another question entirely and i think that some americans would be surprised at where the blame really should be laid i feel that what has happened at the end of the conflict is a result of poor planning on the part of the military we had a four star general who was there for two years and he left with no plan no plan to get people out the state department on the other hand got all of their people out but they slow rolled visas for those who helped us in the conflict and i think that was another great mistake that does no justice to the righteousness of the war martin hmm professor belew you know after vietnam returning service members were some of the most vocal about social issues here in the u s i mean that whole vietnam generation had a real mark on our politics wouldn t you say belew absolutely martin and i m wondering what your sense is of how returning service members from this conflict will make their mark belew so i think one thing to keep in mind here is that we have in this conversation we ve been talking about war as if it is only fought out there and then the violence of warfare stays where we put it and this is simply not how it works i think that one of the things that the war in vietnam shows us is that different ramifications of political and actual violence come into the home front in a lot of unpredictable ways in the aftermath of war it measures across all sectors of society including nonveterans all of us men women children people who served who didn t everyone is more violent in the aftermath of warfare but the aftermath of vietnam we see the loss we see the outspoken anti war movement largely helmed by veterans we see a movement against that we see white power activism we see paramilitarism and we see a large social reluctance to warfare in the whole of our society but the thing that s different here is the timespan so i teach undergraduates they don t remember a time when we were not at war this has been going on for such a long time and has impacted so many different people and has been a sort of subsumed part of our accepted political reality for such a long time that i think that we all have a lot of coming to terms to do to enter this new moment martin that s fascinating theodore johnson i want to ask you because you are often called upon to comment on sort of current politics you know political issues what effect do you think this has on president biden s domestic agenda those scenes of chaos at the airport and you know chaos in the street does that translate into kind of a lack of confidence in president biden s leadership domestically johnson it remains to be seen but one thing is true americans have short memories so the idea that the pictures we re seeing today will harm democrats in presidential elections in 2024 or even in the midterms next year that s an open question and one that i m not completely convinced of more important in terms of politics not in terms of substance of the matter is the way the exit is framed if this is seen as biden being weak in his leadership sort of losing control of the situation that stigma will stick with him more than the visuals of afghans in the airport trying to be evacuated i think what we ve seen in biden s first eight months is he s deployed the vaccine out across the country and tried to reopen schools and the economy he s gotten an infrastructure bill passed a major one that many previous presidents have failed on and now he s adding a feather in his cap on the exit of afghanistan all things that americans wanted so if he can shape these three major accomplishments in his first eight months as a win i don t know that he pays a political price for the visuals we re seeing today however if the situation in afghanistan worsens if there is an attack somewhere then they will characterize the exit as a lack of planning a lack of strategic thinking a lack of leadership and i think those labels will stick with him in ways that may be politically damaging more so than again the pictures or the video that s coming out of the country today martin professor solis i want to give you the last word was this war worth it in your opinion and what s your sense of whether other americans will think it was worth it solis i don t mean to waffle on you but i think it s a two edged question i think it was a righteous conflict that we got into after 9 11 that we should have gotten into and that the american public are strongly in favor of but things rapidly went downhill we started paying bounties for people to be arrested we ended up with guantanamo and so forth and i think through political misjudgments and ineptitude it became something that it s difficult to be proud of but then i would also ask as ted suggested who remembers vietnam who remembers what happened on the rooftop of the embassy when we were trying to get nobody remembers that the memories of the american public are short they will remember 9 11 and they will forget much of what has come after so i would say on balance this was a war that was worth it martin that s professor gary solis he s a former u s marine company commander he s a longtime professor of the law of war including at georgetown university

summer road trips and a pullback in crude prices have pumped up refineries profits offering brighter prospects for one part of the global oil complex despite rising worries about covid 19 oil prices have grown choppy in recent weeks since china the world s biggest commodities consumer imposed restrictions to contain the delta coronavirus variant a decision by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and the cartel s other partners to pump more oil is also weighing on crude markets prices for west texas intermediate the main grade of u s crude are down more than 10 from their 2021 high trading at 65 46 a barrel the retreat is weighing on shares of energy companies including exxon mobilcorp but is a potential boon for refiners such as marathon petroleum corp refiners stand to gain when gasoline and other products they produce fetch higher prices than the crude they purchase refiners had already benefited from a summer surge in gasoline demand that pushed average pump prices above 3 15 a gallon investors haven t rewarded their share prices however in part because of rising costs for meeting environmental rules refiners play a key role in energy markets processing crude oil into fuels for transportation and heating as well as petrochemical ingredients and products such as asphalt when profits at refiners rise the companies typically crank up production lifting demand for crude one gauge of u s refiners profit margins the gap between the price of gasoline and crude futures stood at 25 58 a barrel wednesday that was close to the highest level for this indicator known as the crack spread on factset data dating back to 2016 refiners have revved up operations in the four weeks through aug 13 they ran at about 92 of capacity according to the u s energy information administration compared with 80 a year before higher gasoline prices came into the spotlight this month when the white house urged opec to open the spigots it also asked the federal trade commission to monitor the u s gasoline market the jump in crack spreads isn t all feeding into refiners bottom lines to varying degrees companies are contending with a leap in the cost of renewable identification numbers which are credits that refiners buy if they don t meet mandates for blending biofuels into transportation fuels that is one reason why refining stocks haven t all rallied in line with crack spreads said dhruv kharbanda an analyst at tudor pickering holt co shares of marathon which has been buying back stock with the 21 billion it earned from selling its speedway gas station division have gained 36 in 2021 phillips 66 on the other hand has fallen 2 6 and executives at the houston based company said higher rin costs contributed to a loss at its refining unit in the second quarter valero energy corp has risen 10 in comparison the s p 500 has gained 17 this year the energy sector is among the best performers on the broad stocks gauge this year having benefited from a vaccine fueled recovery in demand still exxon shares have fallen 15 since mid june as crude prices have turned volatile while chevron corp has shed 12 nonetheless analysts say rising crack spreads are a welcome turn for refiners after a dire year for the industry in 2020 and will likely buttress crude demandin the coming months marathon reported 751 million in profits in its refining and marketing division in the second quarter up from 23 million in the first and a loss of 919 million a year before valero meanwhile posted 361 million in adjusted operating income in its refinery business swinging from a loss of 383 million in the second quarter of 2020 crack spreads will automatically fall in the coming weeks when refiners switch to producing cheaper winter blends of gasoline said nicolas robin a fund manager at columbia threadneedle investments still he expects gasoline demand to remain strong in part due to behavioral changes set in motion by the pandemic there will still be a bias to drive a car as opposed to taking public transport mr robin said write to joe wallace at joe wallace wsj com

two major u s money transfer services have suspended payments into afghanistan and american banks are more closely scrutinizing transactions with afghan counterparts as they await clarity on whether u s sanctions on the taliban apply across the nation now that the islamist group is in control the result could deepen the country s financial crisis in the near term and if sanctions apply more broadly to any business dealings with the taliban controlled nation afghanistan could join north korea and iran as pariahs in the international financial system heightened caution by banks risks slowing flows

flow of overseas payments that are a key source of support for many afghan families earlier guidance by the world s terror finance watchdog organization the financial action task force warned member

including the capital kabul last weekend and taking control of institutions of state markets and key industries finance officials say they are concerned that the sanctions will apply to a much broader array of transactions including payments to afghan entities via the country s commercial banks nobody wants to be in a position where they re in the role of facilitating payments to terrorists for obvious reasons and nobody wants to have a sanctions violation said dan stipano a former top official at the u s office of the comptroller of the currency who now handles compliance issues for banks at the law firm of davis polk the financial industry is pressing the u s treasury department which oversees sanctions policy for guidance but has so far come up empty handed industry officials say bank officials have made multiple calls on the matter to a hotline at the treasury s office of foreign assets control which administers and enforces economic sanctions according to a person familiar with the matter the treasury declined to comment former treasury officials say a decision on whether to apply sanctions more broadly will rely in part on how the taliban governs and will be made at the highest levels of the biden administration by not providing public guidance those people say the u s is using the lack of clarity as a threat of wider sanctions adding to its diplomatic pressure meanwhile banks are seeking to make sure all transactions with afghan entities are vetted as thoroughly as possible to ensure no benefit to the taliban that could constitute a sanctions violation financial institutions that are found to violate sanctions can face steep fines and officials can face criminal charges with the taliban poised to take control of some entities that aren t currently blacklisted such as the central bank and some commercial banks some u s banks have considered adding the names of afghan banks to the screening software they use to flag transactions tied to individuals subject to sanctions or those on lists of high risk people it s just not clear whether the existing sanctions are applicable now the way they were before the collapse of kabul mr stipano

longer facilitating payments to or from afghanistan and that it is monitoring guidance from the u s government as the situation continues to evolve actions by private financial firms threaten to compound afghanistan s economic woes after washington froze billions of dollars in afghan government assets and halted cash shipments to the country as the taliban seized the nation s capital the u s has also largely secured the backing it needs to block the taliban s access to billions in reserves held at the international monetary fund and assistance pledged through the world bank and other donor groups according to people familiar with the matter analysts say heavy reliance on informal money transfer services known as hawalas and relationships with china iran and pakistan afghanistan s biggest trading partners that often operate outside the western controlled financial system could soften the impact the imf warned in a june report that afghanistan faced severe economic hardship even before the taliban takeover an escalation in the armed conflict and failure of the u s backed peace process could trigger capital flight sustained exchange rate pressure falling output and swelling

looking for a gold investment here are three options that might fit the bill but they aren t miners gold has long been viewed as a safe haven investment and with the s p 500 index trading near all time highs it s understandable if you want to add some to your portfolio but how do you go about doing that gold bullion gold miners gold linked etfs actually one of the best ways to get precious metals exposure is with streaming and royalty companies like royal gold rgld 1 14 franco nevada fnv 1 15 and wheaton precious metals wpm 0 06 here s a look at each 1 big on gold royal gold generated roughly 75 of its revenue from gold in fiscal 2021 which ended in june the rest came from silver copper and other metals that gives it the highest exposure to gold of this trio but the interesting thing about this company and the other two names here is that royal gold doesn t mine for gold it gives cash up front to miners in exchange for the right to buy the commodity in the future at reduced rates which is called streaming miners like this arrangement because they can raise capital often for building or expanding mines without tapping the capital markets or going to a bank royal gold likes it because it locks in low metals prices as an example a recent streaming deal pegged the company s costs at 20 of gold s spot price until certain production targets are hit and then 40 thereafter this in turn generally means wide margins for gold in both good times like right now and bad miners tend to see margins nosedive when commodity prices fall because of the relatively fixed nature of their mining costs precious metals themselves meanwhile go up and down with supply and demand dynamics and don t offer growth outside of these price movements miners and streamers can invest in new assets the underlying consistency of royal gold s business model is how it has managed to increase its dividend for 20 consecutive years despite the inherent volatility of commodity markets fiscal 2021 was a very good year for royal gold with record revenue record net income and record cash flow but the future s looking bright too the company has no debt so it has plenty of ammunition for future investments it has one mine investment that has just started producing has recently acquired two new mine investments and has a number of legacy investments that are progressing well in other words royal gold s business is in growth mode right now and investors can get in on that opportunity by adding it to their portfolios today to be fair the stock isn t exactly cheap given the recently strong precious metals markets but it has the lowest price to book value ratio of this trio add in the investments that are starting to bare fruit and it s a compelling option for people looking for a gold investment today 2 the diversified option franco nevada is also a good choice but it does things a little differently gold accounted for around 56 of its revenue in the second quarter with silver and platinum coming in at 13 and 6 respectively other metals were 11 and oil and natural gas investments were 14 that s vastly different from royal gold and wheaton however for conservative investors who want to hedge their commodity linked bets a little bit this diversification could be an attractive attribute franco nevada s diversification doesn t stop there it has 407 investments in its portfolio 58 producing mines 55 producing energy projects 47 advanced mine projects with the remainder made up of development metals mines and energy projects its portfolio is way more diverse than either of its peers and the company has increased its dividend for 14 consecutive years not a bad combination of attributes meanwhile franco nevada expects to see record results in 2021 backed by strong first half results including record second quarter revenue and net income and new investments if you want exposure to gold but also want to hedge your bets a little franco nevada would be a good choice that said it is the most expensive of this trio based on price to book value but it might be worth the price for conservative types 3 sharing the wealth wheaton precious metals is the last name up in the second quarter 49 of its revenues came from gold with silver at 45 the rest of its revenues came from platinum group metals and cobalt stepping back it is probably the best of this group for investors interested in precious metals as opposed to a pure gold investment like the two names above it has been posting record results of late but the most interesting thing here is probably wheaton s dividend royal gold and franco nevada focus on slow and steady dividend growth while wheaton s dividend is variable pegged at 30 of the average cash generated over the trailing four quarters that s not desirable if you prize consistency but it means investors get to benefit directly during the good times if investors flock to precious metals in a market dislocation that could mean higher dividends right when other parts of your portfolio might be struggling the gold silver balance and unique dividend approach together could make this the best option for investors looking to precious metals as a safety play time for a deep dive this trio of large streaming and royalty names all do the same basic thing but they each go about it in notably different ways royal gold will provide the most exposure to the so called barbarous metal franco nevada is by far the most diversified name and wheaton s gold silver balance and variable dividend policy is an interesting option for investors focused on the safe haven nature of these metals if you are looking at gold today one of these three names is likely to tickle your fancy

the biden administration s plans to make covid 19 booster shots available next month has drawn a collective scream of protest from the scientific community as some scientists see it the announcement is rash and based on weak evidence and they worry it could undercut confidence in vaccines with no clear benefit of controlling the pandemic meanwhile more information is needed on potential side effects or adverse effects from a booster shot they say perhaps even worse the announcement has fueled deeper confusion about what americans need to do to protect themselves from covid i think we ve scared people said dr paul offit director of the vaccine education center at children s hospital of philadelphia and an adviser to the national institutes of health and the food and drug administration we sent a terrible message he said we just sent a message out there that people who consider themselves fully vaccinated were not fully vaccinated and that s the wrong message because you are protected against serious illness as of thursday 51 of the u s population was fully vaccinated centers for disease control and prevention data shows biden administration officials citing data from israel a study from the mayo clinic that is not yet peer reviewed and new cdc studies say it s necessary to plan for boosters to prevent a worsening of the pandemic as the delta variant powers a surge in cases and overwhelms hospital intensive care units in essence officials are caught between a rock and a hard place trying to be prepared while simultaneously not undermining messaging about how well the existing vaccines work officials must weigh two unknowns the risks of moving ahead aggressively with booster shots versus the risks of waiting to learn much more about the virus and the power of the vaccines the government s normal path to regulatory approval is by design slow and deliberate the virus has its own schedule fast and unpredictable arguably i think that the federal government is simply trying to stay ahead of the curve said dr joshua barocas associate professor of medicine at the university of colorado but he said i have not seen robust data yet to suggest that it is better to boost americans who have gotten two vaccines than invest resources and time in getting unvaccinated people across the world vaccinated beginning in late september boosters would be made available to adults age 18 and up eight months after they received the second dose of a pfizer biontech or moderna covid vaccine president joe biden said but his plan comes with big caveats it does not yet have the blessing of a cdc advisory panel and the fda has not authorized boosters for all adults the urgent question is whether the vaccines are losing their power against covid we are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease hospitalization and death surgeon general vivek murthy said but many scientists and public health experts say the data doesn t demonstrate a clear benefit to the public in making booster shots widely available and the biden administration s message confuses people about what the covid vaccines were designed to do they re not a force field they don t repel the virus from your body they train your immune system to respond when you become infected with the goal of keeping you out of the hospital said jennifer nuzzo an epidemiologist and associate professor at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health meanwhile questions abound will boosters for fully vaccinated adults make the virus less transmissible that is slower or less likely to spread to others i certainly hope that s the case but the bottom line with full transparency we don t know that right now dr anthony fauci biden s chief medical adviser said wednesday what about side effects it would be nice to understand what side effects people have after their third dose nuzzo said we don t have any reason to believe based on the safety profile of the vaccine itself that we re going to see significant adverse events with booster shots barocas said however those things are just now being studied the concerns are real while serious side effects from covid vaccines have been rare some have caused alarm including mrna vaccines being linked to cases of myocarditis or inflammation of the heart at the individual level we need to know the side effect profile of a 3rd dose especially in younger people until now the benefits of vaccination have far outweighed the potential side effects dr jeremy faust an emergency medicine physician at brigham and women s hospital in boston wrote in a blog post outlining why he was skeptical about a plan to give boosters to everyone even in light of the new cdc studies published wednesday experts say one thing is clear the vaccines still work very well at what they were meant to do which is to protect people against the worst outcomes of getting infected with the virus one study relying on data from 21 hospitals in 18 states found no significant change in the vaccines effectiveness against hospitalization between march and july which coincides with delta becoming the prevalent covid strain another using data from new york also found the vaccines highly effective in preventing hospitalization even as there was a decline in effectiveness against new infections the third evaluating the pfizer and moderna vaccines in nursing home residents saw a drop in how effective they were at preventing infection but the research didn t distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases it s like we re engaged in friendly fire against these vaccines nuzzo said what are we trying to do here are we just trying to reduce overall transmission because there s no evidence that this is going to do it fauci in outlining the case for boosters highlighted data showing that antibody levels decline over time and higher levels of antibodies are associated with higher vaccine efficacy but antibodies are only one component of the body s defense mechanisms against a covid infection when the antibodies decrease the body compensates with a cellular immune response a person who has lost antibodies isn t necessarily completely susceptible to infection because that person has t cell immunity that we can t measure easily said dr cody meissner a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases who sits on the fda s vaccine advisory panel john wherry director of the penn institute of immunology at the university of pennsylvania recently published a study finding that the mrna vaccines provoked a strong response by the immune system s t cells which researchers said could be a more durable source of protection wherry is working on a second study based on six months of data we re seeing very good durability for at least some components of the non antibody responses generated by the vaccines he said for protection against serious disease really all you need is immunological memory and these vaccines induce immunological memory and immunological memory tends to be longer lived offit said federal scientists also are studying t cell response fauci said pfizer and moderna have said they think boosters for covid will be necessary but it s up to the government to authorize them federal officials say they are sifting through new data from the companies and elsewhere as it becomes available there s not a deep playbook for this emergency use authorization or eua of vaccines has been sparingly used the fda has already amended pfizer s prior eua clearance twice first in may to expand the vaccines to adolescents 12 to 15 years old and again this month to allow immunocompromised people to obtain a third dose the fda did not respond to questions about the process for authorizing widespread booster shots pfizer announced in july that it expects 33 5 billion in covid vaccine revenue this year its stock has risen 33 this year closing at 48 80 thursday moderna reported sales of 5 9 billion through june 30 for 302 million doses of its vaccine the company s stock has skyrocketed 236 year to date closing at 375 53 thursday in applying for emergency authorization the fda requires vaccine manufacturers to submit clinical efficacy data and all safety data from phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials as well as two months of safety data from phase 3 studies for full approval the fda requires manufacturers to submit six months of data pfizer this week announced it has submitted phase 1 clinical trial data to the fda as part of an evaluation for future approval of a third dose the company said phase 3 results are expected shortly pfizer said its preliminary trial results showed a third dose was safe and increased antibody levels against the original virus and the delta variant moderna found a third dose had safety results similar to a second dose and produced a strong antibody response typically any distribution of shots would occur after the cdc s advisory committee on immunization practices also developed recommendations but with the biden administration s announcement about boosters public health experts worry the message suggests the outcome is preordained they have completely and unfairly jammed fda and acip they ve left them no choice if there s no booster

american farmers and agribusinesses are positioned to be more competitive in the global economy with the u s senate s aug 10 passage of president joe biden s bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act the nearly 1 trillion plan is intended to rebuild roads and bridges modernize public works systems and expand broadband internet among other improvements the senate also is considering a second 3 5 trillion package that would pay for new family health and education programs the white house anticipates the investments will add on average about 2 million jobs per year within the coming decade the house will eventually consider both packages simultaneously while american farm bureau federation supports the first part of the plan it does not endorse the second one the first phase of the bill would invest 110 billion in u s roads and bridges 65 billion for broadband and 17 3 billion for ports and inland waterways section 23018 of the bill includes an exemption for livestock and insect haulers from hours of service regulations within a 150 air mile radius from their final destination a small but particularly helpful change for virginia livestock producers said ben rowe virginia farm bureau federation s national affairs coordinator we were pleased to see the senate develop a comprehensive infrastructure package while preserving important tax provisions that make it possible for farmers to pass the family business to the next generation he said we urge leaders in the house to follow the senate s lead by leaving tax rates and stepped up basis unchanged afbf president zippy duvall expressed gratitude to the senate for working toward solutions while preserving those tax provisions he said the pressing infrastructure issues facing the nation are too important to ignore particularly in rural communities where modernization is desperately needed farmers and ranchers depend on millions of miles of roadways and waterways to get their products to america s dinner tables and they rely on ports to ship food fiber and fuel to countries around the world duvall said and increased funding to bring broadband to hundreds of thousands of farms that currently have no access to the internet will help farmers meet the demands of a growing world while using emerging technologies to build on climate smart practices
the internet s social media censors have been extremely vigilant at suppressing every tidbit of covid vaccine misinformation that comes their way so as readers might imagine drawing attention to publicly released data about the rare but sometimes deadly side effects associated with both mrna and adenovirus vector jabs has been a challenge hey jack what happens to all those who were banned for warning about this zerohedge zerohedge august 20 2021 but let s back up over the past couple of months health authorities in the us and israel connected rare instances of myocarditis that is inflammation of the heart to the mrna jabs produced by pfizer and moderna after a hurried secret meeting with its advisors in late june the fda reluctantly released a warning about a likely association between incidences of myocarditis and the new side effects and now a new twist on thursday evening the washington post published a report claiming that the moderna coronavirus vaccine may be associated with a higher risk of myocarditis in younger adults than previously believed the report relies on new data from a canadian study that has yet to be released how much more dangerous is the moderna jab than the pfizer well the preliminary data leaked to wapo show the risk of myocarditis might be as much as 2 5x higher for the moderna jab the news represents the latest bump in the road for moderna s high flying stock as patients especially younger men in their 20s and 30s deemed at highest risk to suffer the side effect now have an incentive to prefer pfizer s jab over moderna s if they still have any confidence in the mrna jabs at all that is wapo s sources stressed that the new research hasn t yet been concluded and that there s still plenty of work to be done before the fda decides whether to attach another warning label to the moderna jabs the sources also claimed that the new data are not slam bang the investigation which involves the food and drug administration and the centers for disease control and prevention is focusing on canadian data that suggests the moderna vaccine may carry a higher risk for young people than the pfizer biontech vaccine especially for males below the age of 30 or so the authorities also are scrutinizing data from the united states to try to determine whether there is evidence of an increased risk from moderna in the u s population the two people who described the investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing review because they were not authorized to discuss it one of the people familiar with the review emphasized it is too early to reach a conclusion the person said the agencies must do additional work before deciding whether to issue any kind of new or revised warning or recommendation about the situation in june the fda added a warning label for the pfizer and moderna shots both known as mrna vaccines about increased risk of myocarditis we have not come to a conclusion on this one of the people familiar with the investigation said the data are not slam bang the fda and cdc both said they re looking into the data to be sure wapo notes that the side effects remain extremely rare or at least very uncommon probably the myocarditis side effect is extremely rare and even if it is more likely in people receiving the moderna vaccine it probably is still very uncommon officials want to be careful not to cause alarm among the public especially when officials are trying to persuade more people to be vaccinated amid a surge of cases fueled by the fast moving delta variant so far the fda and cdc s official position is that the threat posed by covid is far worse than any threat posed by vaccine side effects and that all americans over the age of 12 should get the jab but as with any recent scientific judgment there are others in the community who disagree some who believe that the risk of side effects for young people might just outweigh the risk of harm from contracting covid which as we have reviewed before is virtually nil there might be a 2 5 times higher incidence of myocarditis in those who get the moderna vaccine compared with pfizer s vaccine any risk at all for young people under 17 is unacceptable sue cook suec00k august 20 2021 reprinted with permission from zero hedge the best of tyler durden

introduction and summary the 21st century economy is one in which human innovation and creativity are at the center of creating firm value 1 today all levels of a company s workforce contribute to productivity enhancing assets and activities such as digitization of information and processes research and development organizational skills and know how networking of institutions and people marketing advertising brand equity reputation and much more 2 these intangible assets make up more than half of the value of companies today 3 while many corporate leaders frequently declare that employees are their most valuable asset investors and other market participants often have little detailed reliable consistent and comparable information about who comprises that asset and how these employees are cared for and developed this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply at the same time research over the past few decades has revealed some concerns about the nation s workforce such as the large and growing wage differential between the median paid worker and top executives and the lack of gender and racial diversity especially in higher positions 4 despite the value that america s workers bring to their companies they are dramatically undervalued by their employers interestingly however it appears as though the post pandemic reopening has somewhat strengthened the hand of workers and may be modestly improving wages it is not yet clear if this will be a longer reversal of the years long stagnation of real wages or merely a brief adjustment that said the gap between ceo and median worker pay has widened5 as share prices have soared and companies have bought back hundreds of billions of dollars of their own stock put simply workers have not been fully benefiting from the profits they create this is not an accident workers voices have been stifled by the proliferation of anti worker laws in many states while corporations have become increasingly concentrated and powerful human capital management today represents a classic case in which nearly all companies have detailed digitized information about their workforces but very few are making it broadly available to investors credit rating agencies and other market participants or the public yet investors and other market participants as well as policymakers and the public need this information to make informed decisions about companies whether it be to price a company s shares more accurately inform shareholder voting or protect workers from racially motivated or other harmful treatment the u s securities and exchange commission sec has the authority to require companies to disclose information requiring the disclosure of human capital and job quality information would further the sec s mission in fact the case for workforce disclosures is very strong however to date the sec has fallen short on requiring specific workforce related disclosures relying instead on a principles based approach that effectively leaves corporate management in charge of deciding what information companies will share 6 this often leaves investors creditors and other market participants as well as governments and the public with information that is not detailed reliable consistent or comparable enough to use to make informed decisions specific workforce metrics must be developed and used in financial disclosure there are several human capital metric frameworks proposed by various private sector organizations and others that could provide a foundation for federally mandated workforce disclosures the center for american progress recommends that the sec require companies to disclose a core set of quantitative workforce metrics in their financial reports that at a minimum includes baseline numbers of full time part time and contract workers disaggregated by race gender and ethnicity and separately by occupation and pay band job quality indicators such as pay benefits and workplace safety measures of worker voice and empowerment such as union density measures of expenditures on training and recruitment understanding the value and prospects of a company requires understanding how it uses its resources and no resource is more important than a company s people the knowledge education and experience as well as the health diversity and other characteristics affecting productivity of a company s workers will have significant impacts on its value profitability and prospects including its ability to innovate and remain resilient in the long term 7 ultimately by facilitating investment in the nation s workforce transparency around human capital management would benefit the economy more broadly the case for workforce disclosure the sec has broad authority to require disclosures that further its mission to protect investors promote fair orderly and efficient markets facilitate capital formation and protect the public interest 8 the increased importance of human capital management in the success of companies today means that this information is critical to investors but human capital information is also important to other market participants as well as to the public and ultimately transparency about the nation s public company workforce is needed to keep capital markets healthy and fair and the economy productive thus the commission can and should require a core set of line item human capital disclosures if it is to carry out its mission responsibly human capital information is important to investors corporate investments in human capital are strongly associated with increased profitability and performance as well as economic growth more broadly 9 the workforce is an important source of value creation and companies that value their workers more perform better 10 for these reasons institutional and retail investors are increasingly demanding a range of workforce related information to fill in the information gap between what management knows and what is reported to investors and the public 11 countless studies have found a positive correlation between human capital investment and a firm s financial performance a literature review of 92 papers on the subject reported that the majority of studies found positive relationships between workforce training and corporate value 12 research from human resources analyst josh bersin found that training employees saved a company as much as 116 000 per person over three years 13 one 2012 study found that 71 percent of ceos identified human capital as one of the most important sources of economic value within their companies 14 a 2003 multi country survey found a significant positive relationship between employee goodwill and profitability 15 and new research by professors matthias regier and ethan rouen finds that stock markets attribute future value to human capital investments 16 in fact in a review of studies on the subject the sec s investor advisory committee found that high quality human capital management practices were correlated with lower employee turnover higher productivity and better corporate financial performance producing a considerable and sustained alpha over time 17 the committee found that many companies routinely rely on a number of similar metrics and recommended that principles based reporting on human capital be augmented with specific disclosures such as expanded disclosure of the number of employees in a company details around turnover rates and internal hire and promotion rates safety training and diversity data and more 18 in addition to assessing value workforce information and human capital practices help investors assess risks fair treatment of workers across the supply chain enhances reputation just as poor treatment damages it poor human capital management also increases liability risks both directly from worker related lawsuits and indirectly when work product itself is poor the covid 19 pandemic illuminated yet another risk associated with human capital practices vulnerabilities to labor supply across the supply chain 19 many other market participants and the public rely upon human capital information the work of many market participants across capital markets depends upon reliable and comparable information about companies workforce management practices investors brokers dealers and stock exchanges care about how a firm s workforce contributes to its value lenders care about the contribution that a company s workforce makes to its resilience as a borrower and about potential human capital related disruptions to the company s ongoing business the pandemic also highlighted the importance of workforce information along supply chains companies that experienced high numbers of sick employees were unable to maintain operations at normal levels leaving their business customers in the lurch as the economy has begun reopening many companies have experienced supply chain problems again because their suppliers lack employees companies that supply goods to other companies and retained their employees during the pandemic have experienced little workforce disruption and are better able to meet their corporate customers needs but many other companies that did not or were not able to retain their employees are trying to hire new employees as they reopen resulting in some labor shortages20 due to hiring and training delays as well as increased costs that are passed through to their corporate customers how companies manage and treat their employees has a direct impact on their ability to attract and build a strong workforce and navigate the post pandemic economy moreover the pandemic shed new light on the ongoing public discourse over worker treatment including race gender and equity matters 21 social media has accelerated customers awareness of these issues 22 treatment of workers including in sweatshops in other countries was a concern well before the pandemic 23 but now more than ever employees and customers value how companies treat their workers 24 for example companies that failed to protect the health of their workers during the pandemic faced work stoppages and customer boycotts 25 employees across the nation have sparked discussions about racism and barriers at their companies 26 and customers are making it clear that they want companies not just to talk about diversity equity and inclusion but also to actively promote racial justice through their management practices and to advocate for racial justice publicly 27 it is not enough for market participants to rely on the voluntary disclosures of a handful of large companies or the work of investigative journalists 28 standardized public disclosure of core human capital management information that is reliable consistent and comparable would inform a wide range of market participants benefiting companies and the public alike healthy and fair capital markets depend upon human capital disclosures as law professor lily kahng explained in her 2017 paper on the topic intellectual property laws contract and employment laws and other legal and organizational mechanisms enable company owners to reap the returns of their workers economic productivity in the form of capital assets 29 employees at all levels of an organization contribute to the creation of these so called intangible capital assets for example scientists contribute to a firm s research and development and fast food servers contribute to a business customer service reputation yet in accounting for example workers are treated as a cost separate and apart from the value they create such as patents and copyrights not to mention the licensing and royalties resulting from research and development businesses also use mechanisms such as covenants not to compete nondisclosure agreements and trade secrets laws to capture and control the labor of their workers 30 in recent decades this legal landscape has been exacerbated by tax law which today places a much lighter tax burden on capital income than on labor income31 and arguably provides further incentives for firm owners to extract the value created by employees see text box tax code incentivizes firms to turn workforce contributions into capital the tax law generally requires capital expenditures those that create future benefits or permanently increase the value of a business to be capitalized that is deducted over time so that the deductions are matched with the increased value over time that is created by the expenditure although the u s supreme court confirmed the capitalization principle in 1992 32 numerous exceptions to the principle both before and after that decision have been recognized by the courts and in tax regulations today while companies generally must still capitalize acquired intellectual assets such as when a firm purchases another company or a license the tax code provides favorable treatment for companies that create intellectual assets in house such as when they invest in human capital and otherwise incur human capital related expenses in their production of income this occurs for example when a company pays workers to develop a brand name conduct research that results in a new product line or otherwise contribute to the going concern value of the business through their work for this in house created capital the tax law allows most of those costs to be expensed in other words deducted immediately from an economic perspective the deduction of investments in labor effectively eliminates income tax on the return on those investments and thus increases the return to capital owners 33 moreover the returns to labor that actually go to workers their pay are taxed at a much higher effective tax rate than the labor returns that go to capital owners the latter benefit from both a much lower tax rate and the ability to delay tax until the asset is sold known as deferral it is telling that where productivity and worker pay used to rise in tandem in recent decades average worker pay has stagnated even as productivity has continued to increase steadily 34 yet well trained and fairly compensated employees are more important than ever to the creation of intangible assets and hence a firm s ongoing performance and resilience they are essential to the innovation that drives value in the knowledge based service oriented economy figure 1 requiring companies to disclose key metrics about the workers they employ and their human capital management practices is an important step toward reconnecting workforces with the value they create such disclosures would emphasize that workforce investments are an asset rather than a cost as reflected on the balance sheet 35 more reliable consistent and comparable information on human capital would provide the information needed indeed sought by investors to guide their investment decisions and by facilitating and expanding the availability of this important information the sec would enhance the overall efficiency and fairness of the capital markets and help ensure that capital flows to the most valuable firms beyond these benefits an enhanced human capital disclosure regime would help align labor and capital market policies to facilitate the creation of high quality jobs and help renew the social contract between corporations workers and communities 36 it would respond to the emerging consensus among investors companies and workers that enhancing environmental social and corporate governance esg transparency particularly around job quality is important and widely beneficial to all 37 companies already collect a lot of human capital information as a matter of course companies regularly monitor and measure the value of their human capital to assess performance and competitiveness they have the ability to collect and sort data according to explicit factual and quantitative categories such as education level gender identity race experience age and training indeed most companies already maintain data on many common workforce metrics for a variety of purposes to comply with the fair labor standards act covered employers must distinguish between employees and independent contractors and collect data on employee occupation wages age and gender 38 employers collect data on wages and benefits for irs tax reporting purposes covered companies also confidentially report demographic data on employees including race gender and ethnicity to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on the eeo 1 form and human resources departments routinely collect data on employee occupation education and experience for their own internal management purposes unfortunately most of these data including the eeo 1 data on specific companies are not available to investors other market participants or the public worse to the extent information is made available it is often not detailed reliable consistent or comparable enough to be effectively used in business decisions by investors and other market participants public disclosure of basic workforce metrics under a standardized regulatory framework could be more efficient for companies seeking to highlight their best practices without having to establish benchmarking and metrics on their own moreover a detailed reliable consistent and comparable set of disclosures would allow companies to assess the competitiveness of their workforce more readily and perhaps avoid some of the current expenses errors and risks that are inherent in reliance upon third party consultants using nonpublic data while many companies would be better off if they disclosed their workforce metrics without a standardized regulatory workforce disclosure regime there is little incentive for companies to develop such disclosures on their own this fact leads to the situation today in which there is little or no meaningful workforce disclosure 39 to the detriment of investors and other market participants capital markets and the public the imperative for sec mandated human capital disclosure metrics is overwhelming because a strong workforce can be a source of competitive advantage effective workforce management and investment in human capital are measurable organizational assets that can generate future profits as well as contribute to overall growth investors lenders suppliers and other market participants looking to assess a company increasingly want more detailed reliable consistent and comparable information about companies workers from the c suite to the factory floor increased transparency around how companies select and manage their workforces would help investors and other market participants determine which firms are most likely to be profitable and would help make capital markets more efficient and fairer but transparency can only be successful if key workforce factors are standardized so that they can be audited for reliability and compared across firms fortunately the sec can draw from an abundance of existing human capital disclosure frameworks as well as a rich academic literature to determine what those core metrics should be existing human capital disclosure frameworks offer useful building blocks for disclosure u s regulators considering enhanced workforce disclosure requirements can find useful examples of metrics to increase transparency around human capital management in initiatives undertaken in the united states and abroad most are private voluntary initiatives led by nongovernmental organizations but funded in part by issuer connected accounting and consulting firms each has constructed its own framework for describing and measuring the value and quality of human capital in corporations while these frameworks already adopted by some companies serve as useful models when considering federal disclosure requirements they are not replacements for standardized sec mandated line item disclosures 40 the sustainability accounting standards board sasb originally formed in the united states in 2011 and now operating internationally as part of the newly formed value reporting foundation completed its sector by sector sustainability standards in 2018 41 the sasb approach for addressing workforce issues is embedded in its five main sustainability dimensions these are environment social capital human capital business model and innovation and leadership and governance 42 the human capital dimension is further divided into three areas labor practices employee health and safety and employee engagement diversity and inclusion 43 these areas encompass a broad range of metrics including employee turnover collective bargaining diversity wages and recruitment the global reporting initiative gri an international independent standards organization founded in 1997 by ceres a leading sustainability nonprofit and others put its sustainability standards in place in 2016 44 now used by more than 1 000 companies in 100 countries gri uses a slate of human capital measures covering recruitment and retention labor and management relations health and safety training and education and diversity and pay equity 45 california model a good jobs certification in 2021 california controller betty yee d in partnership with the drucker institute proposed a bold plan to incentivize the creation of quality jobs by establishing a certification for high road employers 46 introduced in the california assembly in 2021 by member ash kalra d whose district encompasses san jose this bill would require all private businesses with 1 000 or more employees in the state to disclose a common set of workforce metrics that includes pay hours and scheduling health retirement and paid leave benefits internal advancement turnover worker safety use of contract labor and gender and racial equity 47 these metrics would then be made public in an accessible format easily digestible by workers investors and policymakers alike based on these disclosures the state labor and workforce development agency would determine if the corporation could be certified as a high road employer laying the groundwork for the establishment of incentives for certification including preference in government contracting and tax benefits for certified employers perhaps more important if enacted the california initiative s mandatory workforce disclosures would provide a valuable pilot for a federal workforce disclosure regime and would provide invaluable data for policymakers and researchers interested in improving the working conditions of the jobs being created the international organization for standardization iso which is a standard setting body composed of representatives from 165 national standards organizations 48 offers another approach its standards cover a dizzying array of more than 23 700 technology and manufacturing topics and include accounting tools to measure diversity organizational culture health and safety recruitment and turnover skills and capabilities and more 49 the human capital management coalition hcmc a group of asset owners and institutional investors established in 2013 and co chaired by the united auto workers retiree medical benefits trust and the california state teachers retirement system 50 focuses on corporate practices related to the management of employees including but not limited to hiring and retention employee engagement training compensation fair labor practices health and safety responsible contracting ethics desired company culture and diversity the hcmc developed its balanced approach to reporting including four types of fundamental line item metrics for all companies to disclose number of employees full and part time employees including contingent workers total workforce cost wages benefits and other transfer payments as well as expenses related to employees workforce stability measured by turnover or a similar indicator workforce diversity gender and racial and ethnic diversity across employment bands or employee levels51 several other initiatives in europe also provide useful examples of workforce disclosure metrics for example the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an international forum for governments to work together to promote economic growth prosperity and sustainable development assesses job quality along three dimensions earnings level job security and working conditions indeed concerns about job quality in europe have given birth to a variety of policy initiatives to draw upon including the european union s laeken indicators of job quality the international labour organization ilo decent work agenda and the u n economic commission for europe unece job quality framework 52 the newly proposed eu sustainable taxonomy which categorizes investment activities as sustainable for the purposes of eu recovery funds and other sustainable investment purposes incorporates baseline labor standards into its climate framework under this law investments must meet the ilo core labor conventions the u n guiding principles on business and human rights and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises to be considered sustainable 53 the international financial reporting standards ifrs foundation which oversees the international corollary to the united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap is considering forming a new sustainable standards board that would aim to harmonize the plethora of disclosure standards noted above such as the sasb and the gri 54 finally the european trade union institute job quality index is another international framework that similarly identifies key dimensions of job quality and offers a range of indicators to measure the quality of the working environment 55 in particular it considers the notion of collective interest representation as a dimension among six others to monitor progress in creating more and better jobs the indicators that embody this dimension are collective bargaining coverage trade union density and whether the worker is consulted about changes in work organization while all these standards and frameworks provide excellent ideas for developing human capital management metrics and in many instances include similar metrics their differences in form and substance mean there is a lack of standardization including of underlying data and methodologies across companies and industries in addition in some cases their applicability in the united states is limited due to differences in legal and regulatory environments including both labor law and securities law perhaps most importantly these are all voluntary frameworks and cannot by themselves establish the detailed reliable consistent and comparable information needed by market participants and the public they are not a replacement for a core set of standardized sec line item disclosures the sec has begun to act but it must require more prescriptive disclosures for more than a decade the securities and exchange commission has been acutely focused on just one narrow but important element of human capital management executive compensation adopted in 2010 the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act statutorily directed the sec to require public companies to disclose the ratios of the compensation between their ceos and the median compensation of their employees 56 the purpose of that provision and others related to compensation disclosures was to encourag shareholder engagement in executive compensation matters by among other things increasing the transparency of compensation 57 prior to the enactment of this rule the only information directly related to human capital that federal securities law and sec rules required companies to disclose was the number of people they employed 58 despite the wide swath of information about executives and workers that may be important to investors and other market participants such as retention rates training diversity and skill levels the sec has elected to decline adopting any meaningful line item disclosures other than this very narrow even if informative pay ratio metric rather in 2020 as part of an ongoing initiative to modernize regulation s k which prescribes periodic reporting requirements beyond the financial statements the sec took a principles based approach to human capital disclosures under that rule issuers must provide a description of the registrant s human capital resources including in such description any human capital measures or objectives that management focuses on in managing the business to the extent such disclosures would be material to an understanding of the registrant s business taken as a whole 59 unfortunately the sec s recent revision of regulation s k did not create detailed reliable consistent or comparable disclosure requirements despite many comments seeking detailed workforce disclosures and intervening events highlighting the need for such disclosures 60 the revisions grant public company executives significant flexibility and allow them to tailor their companies disclosures in ways that could obscure information that is important to investors and other market participants 61 the lack of meaningful standardized metrics allows wide disparity in the types and specificity of disclosures 62 according to securities experts anthony hesketh and samantha ross the amended s k rule leaves too much room for cherry picking measures that would make management look good 63 this was borne out in a study of the first 50 10 ks filed after the effective date by the largest sec registered companies with market capitalization greater than 1 billion that study conducted by consulting firm fw cook found that the number of firms disclosing on most key human capital topics was at or well below 50 percent and there were significant differences in the approaches used for disclosure among those that did disclose on a given topic 64 a more recent study published by stanford university reported that 57 percent of the 10 k filings it surveyed contained no quantitative metrics the following example from a recent filing under the latest rules exemplifies the lack of specificity in some disclosures 65 we provide robust compensation and benefits in addition to salaries these programs which vary by country region can include annual bonuses stock based compensation awards a 401 k plan with employee matching opportunities healthcare and insurance benefits health savings and flexible spending accounts paid time off family leave family care resources flexible work schedules adoption and surrogacy assistance employee assistance programs tuition assistance and on site services such as health centers and fitness centers among many others 66 critics of the sec s principles based take on overseeing disclosure requirements contend that without a clear definition of human capital or prescription of specific workforce measures the workforce disclosures will be too flexible to inform investors and other market participants decisions 67 without specific guidance on fundamental metrics common to all companies say hesketh and ross managers have incentives to contrive bespoke human capital metrics that can conceal a multitude of management failures with hidden financial consequences 68 moreover independent assurance to ensure reliability is difficult to do without specific mandatory disclosures thus the principles based disclosure requirement is not rigorous enough to provide meaningful information to investors with respect to human capital management equally important the current disclosure requirements do not permit comparability between corporations because the regulations do not require detailed reliable consistent and comparable information investors and other market participants cannot easily evaluate a company s human capital in relation to that of other companies in the market in fact human capital disclosures in 10 ks filed in 2020 vary wildly in length and detail 69 requiring public companies to make more detailed workforce disclosures is well within the sec s authority yet some federal lawmakers are sufficiently concerned about the sec s current principles based approach that they have introduced legislation to require more specific workforce disclosures in february 2020 sen mark warner d va and rep cindy axne d ia introduced the workforce investment disclosure act which would require all securities issuers to disclose workforce metrics 70 the requirements detailed in the bill encompass turnover diversity and demographics training corporate culture compensation and health and safety crucially this bill contains a backstop that essentially gives the sec two years to finalize rules and if it fails prescribes the use of iso standards in their place in the last congress sen tammy baldwin d wi introduced the reward work act which would have allowed workers to directly elect one third of their company s board a measure that would increase worker voice and presumably make companies more receptive to workforce related disclosures 71 fortunately sec chair gary gensler signaled in may 2021 that the agency will propose a new rule on workforce disclosures 72 the commission has since included the rule as a top priority in its public agenda 73 policy recommendations given the strong and growing call from investors and other market participants for detailed human capital information growing empirical data showing a strong correlation between good workforce practices and firm performance the ease of tracking employment data digitally and the wealth of examples of human capital metrics to draw from the sec should move forward as soon as possible with a panel of line item human capital disclosures accompanied by recommendations for data and methodologies for calculating those metrics the sec must formulate regulations requiring the disclosure of concrete quantitative metrics that provide a complete picture of workforce practices these should be disclosed in the 10 k line item disclosures are less susceptible to deceptive and selective statements and furthermore would be subject to audit to strengthen the value of the audit these line item disclosures should also be subject to the sarbanes oxley act s regulatory requirement that attorneys representing issuers report uncertainties or possible violations to the chief legal officer and ceo for resolution 74 moreover if a reporting company claims that a line item is not applicable to it it should be required to affirmatively demonstrate why finally these prescribed disclosures should be required of all domestic and foreign corporate issuers investment managers and private funds that are subject to sec registration requirements as the sec and congress move to expand workforce disclosure requirements they should require corporations at a minimum to make the following disclosures these disclosures should be refined over time and updated as appropriate but those refinements and updates should not slow the establishment of a core set of disclosures as soon as possible to meet the needs of investors and other market participants demographics while 10 k filers are already required to disclose the number of employees they have this number alone cannot capture the full shape and scope of a company s workforce employee numbers should be more detailed for example by showing the following number of full time employees disaggregated by race ethnicity and gender number of part time employees disaggregated by race ethnicity and gender number of contract workers 75 disaggregated by race ethnicity and gender and separately by occupation and pay band 76 disaggregated by race ethnicity and gender and separately by occupation and pay band summary data on education experience and training of the workforce list of any human capital certifications such as the mlt black equity at work certification77 this is the bare minimum of information that is commonly used to describe and analyze a company s workforce without this level of disaggregation meaningful information can remain hidden for example where a firm has a high level of workers who are women or people of color but the majority of them are employed in lower paid positions job quality much is made of the need to create jobs but the quality of the jobs created is just as important while the dodd frank act already requires the disclosure of the ratio of ceo pay to median salary there are many more important job quality metrics the sec should require disclosure of the following median salaries for full time workers and for part time workers separately minimum wages for workers by job duties or another classification percentage of workers paid overtime human resource organizational structure for purposes of determining compensation incentives and promotions expenditures on employee benefits by job classification race ethnicity and gender broken down into eeo 1 job categories total cost of the company s workforce including wages benefits and other transfer payments and employee expenses disaggregated by race and gender lost time due to injuries illnesses and fatalities occupational safety and health administration violations wage and hour violations and discrimination violations 78 along with the mine safety violations that are already required under dodd frank 79 along with the mine safety violations that are already required under dodd frank percentage of suppliers that were audited for safety and health compliance whether the firm has a policy guaranteeing basic human rights of workers across its supply chain and refrains from doing business with companies that violate workers human rights80 details of this nature reflect a company s values and could signal the potential for workforce disruption or firm liability while job quality may seem difficult to pin down these mostly quantitative metrics make up the building blocks of job quality worker voice study after study has shown that worker power greatly improves productivity and job quality 81 to that end companies should disclose the union density within their workforce and whatever expenditures they make to suppress union organizing the disclosure of third party lawyers and consultants who provide union organizing advice was outlined in the persuader rule proposed by the department of labor during the obama administration and rescinded during the trump administration 82 while reinstatement of the rule by the labor department would have the benefit of forcing private companies to disclose this information the sec could move forward and include this requirement for public company disclosures as well it should include the following percentage of workers who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 83 disaggregated by job classification race and gender disaggregated by job classification race and gender legal fees or consultant services for union avoidance description of outstanding national labor relations board complaints and related legal costs standardized survey measures of employee satisfaction these metrics help translate for investors and others important information that may otherwise be unknowable they provide a window into the ability of workers to maximize their own well being and productive capacity to the betterment of the firm human capital development in an increasingly service based economy driven by technological advancement skilled human capital is one of the most valuable assets a company has while many filers already acknowledge this in their human capital disclosures the following quantitative measures can paint a better picture than the qualitative descriptors provided currently total hours of employee occupational training for new and incumbent 84 workers workers total expenditures on employee occupational training for new and incumbent workers including registered apprenticeship programs types of labor management training partnerships and other trainings for non temporary hires education level and degree attainment among the workforce by occupation recruitment costs voluntary and involuntary turnover internal hire and promotion rates whether the company has a business plan for workforce retention and redeployment of workers whose jobs are eliminated as a result of climate change or the firm s management of the physical and transition risks associated with climate change85 these workforce development metrics demonstrate in a concrete way how much effort management actually puts behind claims it makes about the resilience and strength of its workforce they also reflect the firm s prospects for the future as an ongoing concern most of the above indicators are quantifiable and easy to measure helping paint a clearer picture about the workforce decisions companies make and inform investors about a company s performance on these measures over time these line items are the floor not the ceiling for human capital disclosures and are not a replacement for qualitative descriptions of workforce practices moreover the sec should monitor and refine line item disclosures in this area to ensure that they meet the changing needs of investors other market participants and the public over time though some companies may protest that these requirements are too burdensome the evidence suggests that the cost of compliance is modest the technology to easily collect track analyze and report on these types of data is widely available to businesses of all sizes many of the disclosures listed above can be easily aggregated from numbers already collected internally or compiled for other federal disclosures such as those required by the eeoc in a pilot program of the high road employer certification participating companies reported that compliance posed few challenges 86 moreover 10 ks often include this information already the sec simply should require that these common indicators are reported in a uniform comparable fashion for example half of 10 k filers already include some information on diversity and inclusion albeit rarely in a quantitative form 87 while the proportion of filers currently providing this information is far too low the fact that many do demonstrates the feasibility of such disclosures at a time when technology has the unprecedented capacity to collect organize store and analyze data there is little excuse not to make this information public and freely available when crafting the disclosure metrics and definitions policymakers should ensure that the sec coordinates with other relevant agencies such as the u s department of labor to establish common terms and practices the use of common measures would not only provide cohesion among government agencies on workforce matters but also would be more efficient and benefit firms in need of a supportive infrastructure for sharing workforce data conclusion investors and other market participants need more detailed reliable consistent and comparable information about companies workers and workforce practices to make informed business decisions a wide range of studies and data analysis has shown the importance of human capital management to the profitability and resilience of companies today information that is useful to investors and many other market participants as well as to the public and policymakers concerned about extreme disparities in incomes wealth and treatment of people across races ethnicities and genders yet the current sec mandated disclosures are clearly inadequate effectively consisting of one compensation metric and a principles based regime in which management can determine what and how to disclose but basic workforce information is not an appropriate area for business puffery or alternatively confidentiality nor should the basic disclosures called for above give rise to any serious proprietary concerns and since most companies already track this information there is no reason to force investors and other market participants or the public for that matter to search potentially in vain for this type of information the sec should adopt a disclosure framework for workforce related issues without delay at a minimum it should require detailed demographic and job quality information as well as metrics that illicit how firms encourage and incorporate worker voice and how they ensure that their workers grow and develop skills over time the required disclosures should be accompanied by standardized data and methodologies to ensure that the information is consistent from year to year and comparable across companies transparency around human capital management is a critical first step toward informed investors efficient and fair capital markets and capital formation that achieves the outcomes that investors market participants and the public expect about the authors alexandra thornton is the senior director of tax

the flooding disaster in humphreys county tennessee over the weekend has so far killed at least 21 people including two toddlers with another 45 still missing the flash floods were the result of a storm which dropped 17 inches of rain on the region on saturday evening likely a new state record firefighters work at the scene of forest fire near kyuyorelyakh village at gorny ulus area west of yakutsk in russia thursday aug 5 2021 ap photo ivan nikiforov early imagery shows whole communities devastated with scores of houses simply gone as if a hurricane tornado or wildfire had blown through rescue efforts are currently underway from multiple agencies including the tennessee emergency management agency the state department of transportation the tennessee national guard the tennessee highway patrol and the tennessee department of health the deadly floods in tennessee as well as those that have occurred in michigan are not however just natural disasters as with wildfires hurricanes and polar vortexes floods are becoming more frequent and severe extreme weather events because of human induced climate change this causal relationship was definitely established by the most recent report from the united nations panel on climate change which declared that it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere ocean and land which are in turn connected to observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves heavy precipitation droughts and tropical cyclones the same report also directly linked climate change to specific recent events including floods across europe wildfires in the western united states droughts in various parts of the world and stronger hurricanes such as hurricane henri which made landfall in rhode island on sunday and has caused power outages across new england other recent extreme weather events linked to climate change include a record heat wave in greece which reached 116 8 degrees fahrenheit and which triggered multiple wildfires across the country that have so far killed 2 people injured 20 others burned down several homes and an estimated 482 square miles and forced the evacuation of thousands similar to the un the world meteorological organization has linked the wildfires to the impacts of climate change and global warming mountains in the tizi ouzou region of algeria have been scorched by more than 100 forest fires in the past two weeks with heat from the fires reportedly washing over mountain ranges hundreds of square miles have burned and the towns of larbaâ nath irathen beni douala and aït mesbah have been turned to ash causing more damage than all the fires from 2008 to 2020 combined ninety people have so far died fighting the flames wildfires in bolivia have burned more than 580 square miles of land in the country s amazon and chaco regions the areas include large populations of south america s indigenous peoples as well as a variety of plant and animal life the region is also one of the most important areas on the planet for capturing and storing carbon from the atmosphere one of the many natural processes that reduce the amount of freely circulating greenhouse gases the largest wildfires on earth are currently in siberia where hundreds of fires have burned more than 62 300 square miles of land since the beginning of the year an amount comparable to the catastrophic 2019 20 australian bushfire season the fires have been in part exacerbated by record high temperatures reaching 118 degrees fahrenheit over the summer smoke from the fires has blanketed the sky for 2 000 miles from east to west and 2 500 miles from north to south reaching all the way to ulaanbaatar the capital of mongolia as well as for the first time reaching the north pole heavy rainfall in turkey s black sea region caused flash flooding that has so far killed at least 82 people these deaths follow the july floods in europe during which more than 230 people were killed across germany belgium romania italy and austria further severe and deadly floods have occurred in china the united states india pakistan japan afghanistan and new zealand which have killed thousands and impacted the lives of hundreds of millions in another indication of the world s changing climate rain fell on greenland s summit on saturday for the first time since records began temperatures rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade allowing the abnormal rainfall to occur the rain follows a significant melting event in july when more than 8 5 billion tons of surface ice melted in a single day that rate of melting is similar to what occurred in 2019 when a hot spring and july heat wave caused greenland to lose 532 billion tons of ice in a single year causing global sea levels to permanently rise by 1 5 millimeters many other metrics of the dangers posed by climate change could be mentioned as the geographical breadth of the above examples indicates there is no country that isn t experiencing the deleterious effects of extreme weather events caused by climate change the scope of the disasters also exposes the bankruptcy of capitalism and its complete inability to deal in any meaningful way with the ongoing climate crisis in a 1982 internal memo that was given wide circulation to exxon management it was made clear that global temperatures would increase sharply as more co2 was released into the atmosphere the memo at the time predicted an increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases and global temperatures seen today and also predicted that global temperatures would exceed an increase of 1 5 degrees celsius before the middle of this century and 2 degrees celsius sometime around 2060 similar reports had been shown to the administrations of democrat jimmy carter and republican ronald reagan which warned in the 1980s that the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of burning greenhouse gases and resultant increase in global temperatures would eventually cause catastrophic environmental consequences for the world s population such as glaciers melting sea levels rising and whole coastal regions being submerged under tens of meters of water more recently the 2017 carbon majors report showed that just 100 corporations worldwide now produce about 90 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions each year and are responsible about half of all greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity since the industrial revolution that same presentation also noted that if the trend in fossil fuel extraction and release continues for the next quarter century global average temperatures would be on track to reach an increase of 4 degrees celsius by the year 2100 such a sharp rise in global temperatures for which the world is currently on track would be only the precursors of much more devastating storms longer heat waves dryer droughts and nonstop wildfires along with sea level rise and drowning every coastal city on the planet coral reefs around the world would likely die off eliminating a cornerstone of the food chain and threatening the survivors of the mass flooding with mass starvation there is also the increasing danger that earth s climate will enter a qualitatively different stage one where the positive feedback effects of the current stage of global warming ultimately decouple earth s climate from human industrial activity under these conditions other geophysical processes such as the mass release of methane from permafrost melting threaten to warm the planet far more than even the burning of fossil fuels is capable such a scenario would be exponentially more difficult for modern scientific techniques to contain for the capitalist class however stopping civilization ending cataclysms is far less important than preserving their profits as has been the case for decades exxonmobil bp and other major fossil fuel corporations as well as the hedge funds and wall street banks that own their stocks are most concerned that coal oil and gas continue to be mined and sold to further enrich themselves and their fellow oligarchs if earth will be poisoned and burned in that pursuit so be it a parallel must be drawn to the coronavirus pandemic just as the world s politicians and media figures have either ignored or actively sought to spur on a deadly contagion to protect corporate profits to the tune of at least 4 4 million dead they are actively driving the destruction of the environment the objective need to increase the rate of profits drives the accelerating exploitation of the world s resources and has led directly to the current and future ecological disasters workers and young people must draw the lessons of the sustained inaction that has caused the ongoing crisis the struggle to stop climate change like the struggle against the pandemic and the threat of war must become political it requires the revolutionary mobilization of the international working class against capitalism it requires that workers understand that their social interests are objectively and diametrically opposed to those of the capitalists and the private ownership of the means of production it requires a fight for the socialist transformation of society

though the recent increase in covid infections and deaths in parts of the u s may give powell pause that is in market contrast to the european central bank which is under pressure to add more stimulus

michel martin host it has been a week of painful images and deep soul searching as america s longest war nears its end taking stock of these 20 years at war is going to be a long process but we wanted to spend some time considering what s been gained and what s been lost how is this conflict going to be viewed by history how might this long conflict have changed the country now this is going to be just one of many conversations but today we ve called on three guests who are experienced thinkers on this subject two of them are veterans themselves theodore johnson is the director of the fellows program at the brennan center for justice he is also a retired commander in the u s navy with two decades of service including as a military professor at the u s naval war college theodore johnson thank you so much for joining us theodore johnson thank you martin kathleen belew is a professor of modern history at the university of chicago her scholarship focuses on violence in american life and culture professor belew thank you so much for joining us as well kathleen belew thank you for having me martin and last but not least professor gary solis is a former u s marine company commander and a longtime professor of law of war including at georgetown university and west point professor solis welcome back to you as well gary solis thank you glad to be here martin professor solis let me start with you as we said you ve taught the law of war and conflict and i know that you ve written about and thought a lot about and talked a lot about ethical challenges that we have faced in this conflict over time i want to ask two things like what does this bring up for you and how do you think this war will be remembered solis well it brings up in me memories of past conflicts going back to the u s philippine war in 1899 to 1902 and how history tends to repeat itself and how do i think history will look at this war i would say that it will be reminded of the folly of hubris i think that this war will be remembered as evidence that republic and democracy is seldom a successful export and if one were a cynic one might say that it will be remembered as america s dominion in retreat martin hmm professor belew you are an historian of the modern era and we re still watching events unfold in afghanistan but i wanted to ask if you think we could start by thinking about what this conflict represents in american history 20 years of war ending in this way what are your thoughts about that belew you know the place that i always like to start is thinking about historical continuity and one of the things that i ve studied that s very concerning that is already afoot and likely to increase is a ginning up of activity among violent political extremists at home we ve seen the aftermath of war is the best predictor for klan and other white power kinds of activism and particularly after the vietnam war we saw this reach a fever pitch in the united states now what happens to that effect when we re talking about a prolonged conflict like the one that we are ending in the global war on terror i think we don t know yet but i think that there are some really important parallels between the images of the embassy falling in saigon in 1975 and the images we saw this week in afghanistan martin theodore johnson what about you i know that you served in afghanistan and you were mainly on ship because you were in the navy and you also have a background in intelligence you know as a military adviser to an intelligence agency i want to ask what this brings up for you how this is ending and what that s bringing up for you and also because you ve been writing about this lately what do you think this means for our national identity if there s a sense that this is a war that the u s has lost johnson yeah yeah so that idea that we have lost has tremendous ramifications for our nation s sense of itself as a military superpower so much of the consternation about our presence in afghanistan is not about national security alone but about security in our national identity are we still the nation that makes the world safe for democracy this experience in afghanistan has thrust the american capacity capability and interest in protecting democracy into question martin so theodore johnson stay with me for a minute here do you have a sense of the way how this will affect americans desire to get involved in issues overseas as you saw like during the last presidential campaign there was a debate about what america s responsibility is overseas and how that should be expressed and i m wondering if you think theodore johnson right now that this is affecting that debate in the united states johnson so i think that is putting two things in tension whether or not we have a moral obligation to protect afghans particularly women and children knowing that once we leave there that many of the human rights violations they experienced before we arrived in afghanistan in 2001 will return and that is in tension with the idea that we have national security interests to prevent terrorist organizations from sort of regrouping and mounting an offensive from afghanistan as they did in 2001 if we have a national security interest then we will expend resources and time et cetera in order to keep forces in country and put that threat to bed if we have a moral obligation we will do the same but when the national interest suggests that the threat has been mitigated and that it s time for the troops to come home then that s in tension with the idea that we have a moral obligation to stick around martin professor solis do you mind if i ask because yourself obviously you know you served for such a long time and you have a lot of relationships remaining how are the people that you talk to i m particularly interested in returning service members talking about the end of this conflict and the way it ended solis well i haven t had an opportunity to talk to many people about how it is ending but i am pretty confident that i know what at least the friends that i have are thinking about and they re saying that laughter well i can t you know martin can t use the language they re solis i can t use the words but they re thinking that this is pretty fouled up and well the question of blame is another question entirely and i think that some americans would be surprised at where the blame really should be laid i feel that what has happened at the end of the conflict is a result of poor planning on the part of the military we had a four star general who was there for two years and he left with no plan no plan to get people out the state department on the other hand got all of their people out but they slow rolled visas for those who helped us in the conflict and i think that was another great mistake that does no justice to the righteousness of the war martin hmm professor belew you know after vietnam returning service members were some of the most vocal about social issues here in the u s i mean that whole vietnam generation had a real mark on our politics wouldn t you say belew absolutely martin and i m wondering what your sense is of how returning service members from this conflict will make their mark belew so i think one thing to keep in mind here is that we have in this conversation we ve been talking about war as if it is only fought out there and then the violence of warfare stays where we put it and this is simply not how it works i think that one of the things that the war in vietnam shows us is that different ramifications of political and actual violence come into the home front in a lot of unpredictable ways in the aftermath of war it measures across all sectors of society including nonveterans all of us men women children people who served who didn t everyone is more violent in the aftermath of warfare but the aftermath of vietnam we see the loss we see the outspoken anti war movement largely helmed by veterans we see a movement against that we see white power activism we see paramilitarism and we see a large social reluctance to warfare in the whole of our society but the thing that s different here is the timespan so i teach undergraduates they don t remember a time when we were not at war this has been going on for such a long time and has impacted so many different people and has been a sort of subsumed part of our accepted political reality for such a long time that i think that we all have a lot of coming to terms to do to enter this new moment martin that s fascinating theodore johnson i want to ask you because you are often called upon to comment on sort of current politics you know political issues what effect do you think this has on president biden s domestic agenda those scenes of chaos at the airport and you know chaos in the street does that translate into kind of a lack of confidence in president biden s leadership domestically johnson it remains to be seen but one thing is true americans have short memories so the idea that the pictures we re seeing today will harm democrats in presidential elections in 2024 or even in the midterms next year that s an open question and one that i m not completely convinced of more important in terms of politics not in terms of substance of the matter is the way the exit is framed if this is seen as biden being weak in his leadership sort of losing control of the situation that stigma will stick with him more than the visuals of afghans in the airport trying to be evacuated i think what we ve seen in biden s first eight months is he s deployed the vaccine out across the country and tried to reopen schools and the economy he s gotten an infrastructure bill passed a major one that many previous presidents have failed on and now he s adding a feather in his cap on the exit of afghanistan all things that americans wanted so if he can shape these three major accomplishments in his first eight months as a win i don t know that he pays a political price for the visuals we re seeing today however if the situation in afghanistan worsens if there is an attack somewhere then they will characterize the exit as a lack of planning a lack of strategic thinking a lack of leadership and i think those labels will stick with him in ways that may be politically damaging more so than again the pictures or the video that s coming out of the country today martin professor solis i want to give you the last word was this war worth it in your opinion and what s your sense of whether other americans will think it was worth it solis i don t mean to waffle on you but i think it s a two edged question i think it was a righteous conflict that we got into after 9 11 that we should have gotten into and that the american public are strongly in favor of but things rapidly went downhill we started paying bounties for people to be arrested we ended up with guantanamo and so forth and i think through political misjudgments and ineptitude it became something that it s difficult to be proud of but then i would also ask as ted suggested who remembers vietnam who remembers what happened on the rooftop of the embassy when we were trying to get nobody remembers that the memories of the american public are short they will remember 9 11 and they will forget much of what has come after so i would say on balance this was a war that was worth it martin that s professor gary solis he s a former u s marine company commander he s a longtime professor of the law of war including at georgetown university

us the upcoming week is all about the federal reserve s symposium in jackson hole wyoming a couple months ago this gathering was eyed as a potential time for the fed to formally announce its plan on tapering asset purchases but now it will determine if fed chair powell is ready to join the tapering crowd at the fed or slow them down growth concerns and delta variant jitters now have this symposium as a stop gap until the september fomc policy meeting at best investors expect fed chair powell to give clues on how close the economy is to delivering substantial progress with the labor market recovery and if he can signal a formal taper announcement is coming at the next policy meeting powell may choose to wait to see more data before firmly signaling the fed is ready to begin tapering the 120 billion a month government bond buying program on monday many traders will pay close attention to the flash pmi readings that should show both the manufacturing and service industries

tweaked its mandate to target 2 inflation while allowing for a temporary overshoot divisions in the central bank are clear and possibly more fierce than ever but the overwhelming majority support the ecbs new stance which should ensure the tapering discussion remains some way off euro area pmis along with german gdp and gfk and ifo surveys are among the notable releases next week we ve already

favorable base effects came into play it will rise again in the coming months likely well beyond the boe target but policy makers remain convinced it s transitory and does not warrant any immediate

delta surge emerging markets russia the economy grew 10 3 in the last quarter taking it above its pre pandemic level growth is expected to slow considerably from q2 levels which compared favorably as a result of the april and may lockdowns last year which hasn t been repeated despite high fatality rates and low vaccine rates the central bank recently raised rates to 6 5 and warned that more may follow industrial output on wednesday is the only notable release south africa inflation fell to 4 6 in july very close to the 4 5 midpoint of the sarbs target range which will allow the central bank to be patient with rate hikes the next move will still be up and likely before the end of the year but expectations are being pared back thanks to the lower growth expectations unemployment and ppi inflation data due this week which may further take the pressure off the central bank turkey governor şahap kavcıoğlu remains stuck between a rock and a hard place does he risk higher inflation or the sack the fate suffered by numerous predecessors that didn t share the unconventional view on the link between interest rates and inflation of president erdogan the governor has not been forced to raise interest rates yet and test erdogan s trigger happy nature but with inflation marginally below the 19 interest rate there isn t much wiggle room thankfully inflation is expected to fall between now and year end so the pressure to hike will be replaced by the pressure to cut how he balances those will determine whether he s still in a job come the turn of the year and how the lira will fare

the theme across asia is for further restrictive measures oil prices could remain heavy despite the recent oil price weakness and near collapse to bear market territory a strong reversal may not be

hong kong businesses like to operate in a stable environment with a fair rule of law and a non corrupt and safe operating atmosphere to have comfort thompson said as he welcomed the restoration of stability by the national security law there is no better place in asia to operate the regional office of a multinational than hong kong he said hong kong has always had a very strong heartbeat and that beat remains very strong today said the businessman in 2020 some 9 000 overseas and mainland companies operate in hong kong over 40 percent of which have their regional headquarters or offices here business registrations also grew steadily in the first half of this year adding to evidence of investors confidence in hong kong

michel martin host it has been a week of painful images and deep soul searching as america s longest war nears its end taking stock of these 20 years at war is going to be a long process but we wanted to spend some time considering what s been gained and what s been lost how is this conflict going to be viewed by history how might this long conflict have changed the country now this is going to be just one of many conversations but today we ve called on three guests who are experienced thinkers on this subject two of them are veterans themselves theodore johnson is the director of the fellows program at the brennan center for justice he is also a retired commander in the u s navy with two decades of service including as a military professor at the u s naval war college theodore johnson thank you so much for joining us theodore johnson thank you martin kathleen belew is a professor of modern history at the university of chicago her scholarship focuses on violence in american life and culture professor belew thank you so much for joining us as well kathleen belew thank you for having me martin and last but not least professor gary solis is a former u s marine company commander and a longtime professor of law of war including at georgetown university and west point professor solis welcome back to you as well gary solis thank you glad to be here martin professor solis let me start with you as we said you ve taught the law of war and conflict and i know that you ve written about and thought a lot about and talked a lot about ethical challenges that we have faced in this conflict over time i want to ask two things like what does this bring up for you and how do you think this war will be remembered solis well it brings up in me memories of past conflicts going back to the u s philippine war in 1899 to 1902 and how history tends to repeat itself and how do i think history will look at this war i would say that it will be reminded of the folly of hubris i think that this war will be remembered as evidence that republic and democracy is seldom a successful export and if one were a cynic one might say that it will be remembered as america s dominion in retreat martin hmm professor belew you are an historian of the modern era and we re still watching events unfold in afghanistan but i wanted to ask if you think we could start by thinking about what this conflict represents in american history 20 years of war ending in this way what are your thoughts about that belew you know the place that i always like to start is thinking about historical continuity and one of the things that i ve studied that s very concerning that is already afoot and likely to increase is a ginning up of activity among violent political extremists at home we ve seen the aftermath of war is the best predictor for klan and other white power kinds of activism and particularly after the vietnam war we saw this reach a fever pitch in the united states now what happens to that effect when we re talking about a prolonged conflict like the one that we are ending in the global war on terror i think we don t know yet but i think that there are some really important parallels between the images of the embassy falling in saigon in 1975 and the images we saw this week in afghanistan martin theodore johnson what about you i know that you served in afghanistan and you were mainly on ship because you were in the navy and you also have a background in intelligence you know as a military adviser to an intelligence agency i want to ask what this brings up for you how this is ending and what that s bringing up for you and also because you ve been writing about this lately what do you think this means for our national identity if there s a sense that this is a war that the u s has lost johnson yeah yeah so that idea that we have lost has tremendous ramifications for our nation s sense of itself as a military superpower so much of the consternation about our presence in afghanistan is not about national security alone but about security in our national identity are we still the nation that makes the world safe for democracy this experience in afghanistan has thrust the american capacity capability and interest in protecting democracy into question martin so theodore johnson stay with me for a minute here do you have a sense of the way how this will affect americans desire to get involved in issues overseas as you saw like during the last presidential campaign there was a debate about what america s responsibility is overseas and how that should be expressed and i m wondering if you think theodore johnson right now that this is affecting that debate in the united states johnson so i think that is putting two things in tension whether or not we have a moral obligation to protect afghans particularly women and children knowing that once we leave there that many of the human rights violations they experienced before we arrived in afghanistan in 2001 will return and that is in tension with the idea that we have national security interests to prevent terrorist organizations from sort of regrouping and mounting an offensive from afghanistan as they did in 2001 if we have a national security interest then we will expend resources and time et cetera in order to keep forces in country and put that threat to bed if we have a moral obligation we will do the same but when the national interest suggests that the threat has been mitigated and that it s time for the troops to come home then that s in tension with the idea that we have a moral obligation to stick around martin professor solis do you mind if i ask because yourself obviously you know you served for such a long time and you have a lot of relationships remaining how are the people that you talk to i m particularly interested in returning service members talking about the end of this conflict and the way it ended solis well i haven t had an opportunity to talk to many people about how it is ending but i am pretty confident that i know what at least the friends that i have are thinking about and they re saying that laughter well i can t you know martin can t use the language they re solis i can t use the words but they re thinking that this is pretty fouled up and well the question of blame is another question entirely and i think that some americans would be surprised at where the blame really should be laid i feel that what has happened at the end of the conflict is a result of poor planning on the part of the military we had a four star general who was there for two years and he left with no plan no plan to get people out the state department on the other hand got all of their people out but they slow rolled visas for those who helped us in the conflict and i think that was another great mistake that does no justice to the righteousness of the war martin hmm professor belew you know after vietnam returning service members were some of the most vocal about social issues here in the u s i mean that whole vietnam generation had a real mark on our politics wouldn t you say belew absolutely martin and i m wondering what your sense is of how returning service members from this conflict will make their mark belew so i think one thing to keep in mind here is that we have in this conversation we ve been talking about war as if it is only fought out there and then the violence of warfare stays where we put it and this is simply not how it works i think that one of the things that the war in vietnam shows us is that different ramifications of political and actual violence come into the home front in a lot of unpredictable ways in the aftermath of war it measures across all sectors of society including nonveterans all of us men women children people who served who didn t everyone is more violent in the aftermath of warfare but the aftermath of vietnam we see the loss we see the outspoken anti war movement largely helmed by veterans we see a movement against that we see white power activism we see paramilitarism and we see a large social reluctance to warfare in the whole of our society but the thing that s different here is the timespan so i teach undergraduates they don t remember a time when we were not at war this has been going on for such a long time and has impacted so many different people and has been a sort of subsumed part of our accepted political reality for such a long time that i think that we all have a lot of coming to terms to do to enter this new moment martin that s fascinating theodore johnson i want to ask you because you are often called upon to comment on sort of current politics you know political issues what effect do you think this has on president biden s domestic agenda those scenes of chaos at the airport and you know chaos in the street does that translate into kind of a lack of confidence in president biden s leadership domestically johnson it remains to be seen but one thing is true americans have short memories so the idea that the pictures we re seeing today will harm democrats in presidential elections in 2024 or even in the midterms next year that s an open question and one that i m not completely convinced of more important in terms of politics not in terms of substance of the matter is the way the exit is framed if this is seen as biden being weak in his leadership sort of losing control of the situation that stigma will stick with him more than the visuals of afghans in the airport trying to be evacuated i think what we ve seen in biden s first eight months is he s deployed the vaccine out across the country and tried to reopen schools and the economy he s gotten an infrastructure bill passed a major one that many previous presidents have failed on and now he s adding a feather in his cap on the exit of afghanistan all things that americans wanted so if he can shape these three major accomplishments in his first eight months as a win i don t know that he pays a political price for the visuals we re seeing today however if the situation in afghanistan worsens if there is an attack somewhere then they will characterize the exit as a lack of planning a lack of strategic thinking a lack of leadership and i think those labels will stick with him in ways that may be politically damaging more so than again the pictures or the video that s coming out of the country today martin professor solis i want to give you the last word was this war worth it in your opinion and what s your sense of whether other americans will think it was worth it solis i don t mean to waffle on you but i think it s a two edged question i think it was a righteous conflict that we got into after 9 11 that we should have gotten into and that the american public are strongly in favor of but things rapidly went downhill we started paying bounties for people to be arrested we ended up with guantanamo and so forth and i think through political misjudgments and ineptitude it became something that it s difficult to be proud of but then i would also ask as ted suggested who remembers vietnam who remembers what happened on the rooftop of the embassy when we were trying to get nobody remembers that the memories of the american public are short they will remember 9 11 and they will forget much of what has come after so i would say on balance this was a war that was worth it martin that s professor gary solis he s a former u s marine company commander he s a longtime professor of the law of war including at georgetown university

biden s evident incapacity to keep up with events and his belligerent denial of the facts and his responsibility for them have become so evident that even the media which covered for his debility in the 2020 elections and have protected him since have turned on him cnn and the bbc are now fact checking their savior on saturday night abc s jonathan karl bluntly said that what biden is saying simply don t comport with reality advertisement donald trump would never have let this happen he is too vain if trump had gifted blackhawk helicopters and a lifetime supply of humvees to our enemies condemned thousands of our allies to the nastiest of fates and made the united states military and diplomats a laughing stock before the entire world the media and the democrats would be calling for impeachment and dusting off the articles of treason if trump had confused his vice president with a general or fumbled with his cue cards because he couldn t match a scripted question to a scripted answer as biden did at his press conference on thursday or shown the bizarre callousness and failure of short term memory in his that was four days ago five days ago outburst or spontaneously abandoned the policy of strategic ambiguity on taiwan in an interview with abc as biden did with george stephanopoulos on thursday the psychiatrists would be lining up outside the cable stations to explain why the 25th amendment needed to be deployed now

at stake is what has looked like one of the most promising partnerships in the burgeoning world of evs chief executive officer mary barra is betting gm s future on going electric setting a goal in january to sell only zero emission vehicles by 2035 lg energy is pursuing a stock listing after splitting last year from south korea s lg chem ltd and can ill afford to lose such a big customer together with our client and partners lg is actively working to ensure that the recall measures are carried out smoothly the south korean company said in an emailed statement the root cause investigation is being carried out by gm lg electronics inc and lg energy solution lg electronics shares plunged as much as 5 8 in seoul on monday lg chem tumbled as much as 9 5 the most since march 2020 read more ev mania turns battery makers into power brokers gm first recalled about 70 000 chevy bolts from the 2017 through 2019 model years in november a month earlier the u s national highway traffic safety administration had opened an investigation into whether the cars were prone to catch fire when parked gm voluntarily called back the vehicles citing issues with batteries made in ochang south korea the automaker asked bolt owners to take their cars to dealerships for a software upgrade that limited recharging to 90 of full battery capacity as it worked to find a permanent remedy nhtsa issued a statement at the time urging bolt owners to park outside and away from their homes as a precautionary measure saying it was aware of five fire incidents including at least one that ignited a home second recall in july gm recalled the same group of cars again after two vehicles that had been repaired caught fire the company said it would replace battery modules after identifying the simultaneous presence of two manufacturing defects in the same battery cells batteries are very hard greg less technical director of the university of michigan s battery lab said by phone sunday when something goes wrong in a cell the cell goes bad but not always right away early this month gm took an 800 million charge related to the recall which contributed to quarterly profit missing estimates and its shares plunging the most in more than a year barra said cells for the 2020 and later model year bolts were built using improved manufacturing processes so the recall didn t affect the newer vehicles two weeks later gm changed its tune in a statement issued after the close on aug 20 the carmaker said that in rare circumstances batteries supplied for newer bolts may have two manufacturing defects a torn anode tab and folded separator in the same cell that increases fire risk the additional cost 1 billion related the auto industry s race to extinguish costly battery fires working with lg the best information gm had the time that it reported earnings earlier this month was that battery module issues were confined to the lg plant in ochang according to dan flores a spokesman for the carmaker as we continued analyzing battery modules and doing physical teardowns of battery packs we found rare instances of these issues in battery modules from other production lines flores said in an email sunday gm recently confirmed that a fire in chandler arizona involved a 2019 bolt that contained cells from an lg factory in holland michigan flores said a recent battery fire posted to youtube also has been confirmed to involve a 2020 bolt gm has not inspected the vehicle and the video didn t factor in the company s decision to expand its recall he said long relationship the fires and challenges finding a fix are straining a 14 year relationship when gm and lg announced they would join forces on the bolt in 2015 they touted how virtually problem free the battery cells were that lg supplied for the plug in hybrid chevy volt which launched in 2010 that successful early track record is little consolation to tens of thousands of bolt owners waiting anxiously for a resolution elise hurwitz lives in the hills of oakland california in a neighborhood at increased risk for wildfire amid the state s ongoing drought the 2017 chevy bolt parked in her driveway now makes her extremely nervous and uncomfortable i really do not want to be parking my bolt in the oakland hills during fire season waiting for my turn for battery cell replacement hurwitz said i would like gm to take custody of the vehicle until it is safe to park it at my home how do i get rid of my car i don t want it with this risk and i can t sell it customers can be confident that gm is taking steps to make sure its vehicles are safe doug parks the automaker s executive vice president of global product development purchasing and supply chain said in last week s statement we know that building and maintaining trust is critical gm and lg have little choice but to maintain close ties they ve started constructing two battery factories together in ohio and tennessee each costing more than 2 billion and expected to employ more than 1 000 people gm will direct the manufacturing quality processes used at these and other yet to be announced cell manufacturing plants flores said the next generation ultium batteries going into an electric chevy silverado truck cadillac lyric sport utility vehicle and gmc hummer pickup and suv among other models will use a common cell design that gm and lg will manufacture as part of a joint venture called ultium cells llc since gm started receiving complaints of fires from customers last year flores said gm and lg have been reviewing manufacturing data from several facilities and disassembling battery packs to inspect cells there are hundreds of people at both companies that have been working very long hours for months now digging into the data flores said
the highlight of this week is the start of the jackson hole annual symposium which late last friday went from a limited in person programme to a fully virtual event due to the â recently elevated covid 19 health risk in teton county wyoming â the main focus is likely to be on whether we get any detail on discussions on the tapering of asset purchases as we look towards the back half of 2021 â last week european stocks saw their biggest weekly decline since february despite a friday rebound that was prompted by comments from the dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan who suggested any delta setbacks would mean he might adjust his views on a taper a large part of the reason behind last weekâ s change in sentiment was increasing concerns over a slowing global economy as well as increasing angst over rising infection rates and vaccine durability we also had to contend with china looking to pour sand in the wheels of its own recovery story with a crackdown on various sectors including tech and luxury while itâ s been accepted wisdom that discussions on a taper are likely to start soon with a slowdown in purchases starting sometime in q4 it s hard to imagine that the fed would start down that road if the economic outlook deteriorated furthermore talking about a taper is one thing it certainly doesnâ t mean that weâ re about to see the start of one as kaplanâ s friday comments illustrate with us treasury yields also subdued bond markets certainly arenâ t expecting an imminent move in that regard with todayâ s european open expected to be a positive one after fridayâ s decent us close and a positive start to the week in asia this morning itâ s quite likely that weâ ve seen peak pmi for both france and germany despite last monthâ s strong readings from both countries germany rather surprisingly saw strong readings in both services and manufacturing despite the disruptions caused by the flooding as well as the slowdown in the chinese economy both of these are likely to impact economic output and business confidence in august in july german manufacturing rose to 65 9 and services jumped sharply to 61 8 it would be a surprise if either of these came in anywhere close this month given the various shutdowns of production announced by businesses because of supply chain disruptions and parts shortages forecasts are for a slowdown to 65 and 61 respectively both of which come across as a tad optimistic â likewise in france there has been increasing evidence that business activity has been declining with both manufacturing and services both slipping back in july from their june levels and set to do so again in august to 57 2 and 56 3 respectively in the uk the pingdemic has already caused a slowdown in services in july from the may peaks of 62 9 falling back to 59 6 in july largely because of staff shortages and various business disruptions itâ s also important to remember that while services have seen a decent rebound in the last few months certain sectors are still struggling as a result of consumer behaviour which is much more cautious than it would have been pre pandemic which suggests we could see another softer reading of 59 1 one other trend to keep a close eye on will be higher cost prices being reported by businesses as they struggle to source the necessary materials for their various goods and services as far as manufacturing is concerned thereâ s been an increasing disconnect between what the pmi numbers are telling us and what is happening in the ons numbers when it comes to manufacturing and industrial production as well as construction output the pmi numbers do appear to be starting to reflect some of that weakness however they are still coming in at fairly decent levels well above 50 manufacturing activity did slow in july coming in at 60 4 down from 63 9 in june and is expected to weaken further to 59 5 we can also expect to see similar slowdowns in the latest us flash pmis for manufacturing and services bitcoin prices appear to be on the rise again moving above 50 000 for the first time since may pulling other cryptocurrencies along too with ethereum also trading at a three month high eur usd â found some support at 1 1660 last week but needs to overcome the 1 1720 level to reduce the risk of a move towards 1 1600 and last novemberâ s lows a break above the1 1720 level retargets the 1 1830 area gbp usd â while below the 1 3670 area the july lows are the next key support at 1 3570 we need to move beyond 1 3670 to retarget the 1 3725 level which was 61 8 retrace of the 1 3570 1

any delta setbacks would mean he might adjust his views on a taper a large part of the reason behind last weekâ s change in sentiment was increasing concerns over a slowing global economy as well as increasing angst over rising infection rates and vaccine durability we also had to contend with china looking to pour sand in the wheels of its own recovery story with a crackdown on various sectors including tech and luxury while itâ s been accepted wisdom that discussions on a taper are likely to start soon with a slowdown in purchases starting sometime in q4 it s hard to imagine that the fed would start down that road if the economic outlook deteriorated furthermore talking about a taper is one thing it certainly doesnâ t mean that weâ re about to see the start of one as kaplanâ s friday comments illustrate with us treasury yields also subdued bond markets certainly arenâ t expecting an imminent move in that regard with todayâ s european open expected to be a positive one after fridayâ s decent us close and a positive start to the week in asia this morning itâ s quite likely that weâ ve seen peak pmi for both france and germany despite last monthâ s strong readings from both countries germany rather surprisingly saw strong readings in both services and manufacturing despite the disruptions caused by the flooding as well as the slowdown in the chinese economy both of these are likely to impact economic output and business confidence in august in july german manufacturing rose to 65 9 and services jumped sharply to 61 8 it would be a surprise if either of these came in anywhere close this month given the various shutdowns of production announced by businesses because of supply chain disruptions and parts shortages forecasts are for a slowdown to 65 and 61 respectively both of which come across as a tad optimistic â likewise in france there has been increasing evidence that business activity has been declining with both manufacturing and services both slipping back in july from their june levels and set to do so again in august to 57 2 and 56 3 respectively in the uk the pingdemic has already caused a slowdown in services in july from the may peaks of 62 9 falling back to 59 6 in july largely because of staff shortages and various business disruptions itâ s also important to remember that while services have seen a decent rebound in the last few months certain sectors are still struggling as a result of consumer behaviour which is much more cautious than it would have been pre pandemic which suggests we could see another softer reading of 59 1 one other trend to keep a close eye on will be higher cost prices being reported by businesses as they struggle to source the necessary materials for their various goods and services as far as manufacturing is concerned thereâ s been an increasing disconnect between what the pmi numbers are telling us and what is happening in the ons numbers when it comes to manufacturing and industrial production as well as construction output the pmi numbers do appear to be starting to reflect some of that weakness however they are still coming in at fairly decent levels well above 50 manufacturing activity did slow in july coming in at 60 4 down from 63 9 in june and is expected to weaken further to 59 5 we can also expect to see similar slowdowns in the latest us flash pmis for manufacturing and services bitcoin prices appear to be on the rise again moving above 50 000 for the first time since may pulling other cryptocurrencies along too with ethereum also trading at a three month high eur usd â found some support at 1 1660 last week but needs to overcome the 1 1720 level to reduce the risk of a move towards 1 1600 and last novemberâ s lows a break above the1 1720 level retargets
