of thousands of people evacuated to the u s due to the humanitarian crisis there many afghan workers who aided the u s military during the war have sought asylum in other countries fearing for their safety under a taliban regime though the agencies have welcomed a steady flow of refugees since august they are geared up to accept an influx of new people this month as federal officials designated feb 15 as a goal for emptying the military bases that had served as temporary housing according to those working in the resettlement process and reporting from national outlets resettlement agencies still in the process of rebuilding after being whittled down during the trump era are working with nonprofit groups mosques churches private donors and volunteers to bridge the gaps in funding and resources even though the government will support people for a short period of time the funding offered is bare minimum said irshad khan chairman of the council of islamic organizations of greater chicago we are asking our communities to step up because the resettlement agencies are operating at capacity the council of islamic organizations of greater chicago is among the organizations aiding in the efforts these are families who were assisting the u s military in afghanistan they had good jobs said ayesha ahmed board director of development at urban muslim minority alliance who has also been working closely with refugees overnight their lives were just uprooted a high level of need those who work with refugees said their communities are offering money time and translation services

resettlement agencies until they are self sufficient since september the illinois department of human services has provided more than 12 5 million in state and federal funding along with some ongoing rolling funding to the refugee process including funds for emergency housing assistance mental health legal assistance and other aspects of the resettlement process jims porter manager of

in obtaining much needed items her group refugee community connection provides winter apparel pots and pans toiletries and culturally relevant items like afghan rugs the organization also stocks up these items in free stores in rogers park and albany park the resettlement agencies have been operating in crisis mode since the fall and they are doing a little bit better but all are still

affordable housing in chicago and refugees generally come with no credit or rental history refugeeone guarantees rent for the first three months porter said there is a need right now for landlords rental management agencies to open their doors to refugees to start a new life here he said it takes a long time to start over during a friday prayer service days before valentine s day imam hassan

momentum from acquisitions strong performance in the global region and canada improving market conditions in the us and shifts in project mix drove net revenue and project margin previously referred to as gross margin growth in the fourth quarter further progress was also made on the 2023 real estate strategy which remains on track to achieve a 30 reduction in stantec s real estate footprint relative to 2019 for the fourth quarter stantec delivered earnings per share eps of 0 15 and adjusted diluted eps of 0 57 for the full year earnings achieved new records of 1 80 per share and adjusted diluted eps of 2 42 edmonton alberta and new york feb 23 2022 globe newswire tsx nyse stn stantec a global leader in sustainable design and engineering today reported its results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2021 and provided its 2022 outlook unless otherwise indicated financial figures are expressed in canadian dollars and comparisons are to the prior periods ended december 31 2020 stantec s outlook for 2022 reflects growing strength in the macroeconomic environment record backlog and infrastructure stimulus spending across various jurisdictions these factors are expected to drive net revenue growth of 18 to 22 in 2022 with organic net revenue growth in the mid to high single digits and an adjusted net income margin at or above 7 5 of net revenue as a result adjusted diluted eps in 2022 is expected grow by 22 to 26 in addition to achieving record earnings this year several important strategic milestones attained in 2021 position us for accelerated value creation in 2022 and beyond said gord johnston president and ceo the acquisition of cardno along with the five other acquisitions we made in 2021 expand our presence in key business lines such as environmental services and the energy transition and key geographies like the united states and australia that are poised for strong growth looking forward we see a strong multi year cycle ahead for the industry which will support expansion of our record 2021 adjusted ebitda margin and earnings full year 2021 financial highlights full year net revenue was 3 6 billion a 2 6 increase on a constant currency basis compared with the prior year driven by acquisition growth of 3 9 partly offset by a slight organic retraction excluding the impact of the descoped trans mountain expansion project tmep organic growth was 0 3 driven by strong performances in canada and global and offset by a slower us recovery fluctuations in foreign currencies resulted in negative foreign exchange impacts of 3 9 the canadian dollar strengthened considerably relative to the us dollar during the year with the average exchange rate shifting to 1 25 in 2021 from 1 34 in 2020 this reduced 2021 net revenues by 130 7 million stantec further estimates that the impact to adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps was approximately 16 6 million 6 5 million and 0 06 per share respectively project margin increased 32 8 million or 1 7 to 2 0 billion and increased as a percentage of net revenue from 52 4 to 54 0 as a result of strong project execution in all geographies and businesses and shifts in project mix adjusted ebitda from continuing operations was 573 8 million approximating amounts generated in 2020 and increasing as a percentage of net revenue by 10 basis points to a record 15 8 from 15 7 the increase in project margin was partly offset by higher administrative and marketing expenses most notably a 30 3 million increase in share based compensation expense 83 basis points as a percentage of net revenue reflecting the revaluation of incentive plans due to an increase in stantec s share price the 2023 real estate strategy contributed more than 0 18 per share in cost savings to net income 0 15 per share savings to adjusted net income on a pre ifrs 16 basis the cumulative impact from this initiative is estimated to have increased 2021 adjusted ebitda margin by more than 100 basis points as further progress was made on the real estate strategy in 2021 additional leased spaces were identified to vacate and sub let and expectations for sub let opportunities were adjusted to reflect current market conditions and outlook this led to a 24 8 million non cash net impairment of lease assets and related property and equipment and 12 5 million in onerous contract costs being recorded stantec is on track to achieve a 30 reduction in its real estate footprint relative to its 2019 baseline and expects to deliver a further 0 20 to 0 25 contribution to earnings per share by the end of 2023 net income from continuing operations increased 26 1 or 41 6 million to 200 7 million net income margin from continuing operations increased 1 2 from 4 3 to 5 5 and diluted eps increased 26 8 or 0 38 to 1 80 factors contributing to higher net income include project margin growth lower interest and depreciation unrealized fair value gains from equity investments the combined effects of the 2023 real estate strategy and a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased acquisition and integration costs adjusted net income from continuing operations increased 8 4 or 21 0 million to 269 9 million representing 7 4 of net revenue an improvement of 60 basis points and adjusted diluted eps increased 9 0 or 0 20 to 2 42 contract backlog stands at a record 5 1 billion a 17 3 increase from december 31 2020 representing approximately 13 months of work 11 months of work in 2020 year over year backlog grew 11 9 through acquisitions and 6 7 organically with organic growth in all geographies of particular note us backlog achieved 10 2 organic growth with us environmental services recording over 50 organic growth further environmental services backlog across all stantec stands at over 1 billion a new high water mark for this business operating unit net debt to adjusted ebitda was 1 8x at december 31 2021 within the guideline range of 1 0x to 2 0x the ratio increased as a result of additions to net debt from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter operating cash flows from continuing operations decreased 34 1 from 602 6 million to 397 0 million this was mainly due to decreased cash receipts from clients negative foreign exchange impacts and increased payments paid to suppliers days sales outstanding dso was 75 days at december 31 2021 and 2020 well below the expectation of 80 days in 2021 939 482 common shares were repurchased for an aggregated price of 50 7 million under the normal course issuer bid which was renewed on november 9 2021 to allow for the repurchase of up to an additional 5 559 312 common shares on february 23 2022 stantec s board of directors declared a dividend of 0 18 per share payable on april 18 2022 to shareholders of record on march 31 2022 representing an 9 1 increase on an annual basis 2022 outlook targets for 2022 are based on the assumption of a continued gradual global recovery but may not be valid should any of our key geographies experience a severe worsening of the pandemic 2022 annual range targets net revenue growth 18 to 22 adjusted ebitda as of net revenue note 15 3 to 16 3 adjusted net income as of net revenue note at or above 7 5 adjusted roic note above 10 5 other expectations growth in adjusted diluted eps note 22 to 26 net

these targets and guidance an average value for the us dollar of 1 25 and for the gbp 1 73 was assumed see assumptions in stantec s 2021 annual report for more information note adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted diluted eps adjusted roic and net debt to adjusted ebitda are non ifrs measures and dso is a metric discussed in the definitions section of stantec s 2021 annual report net revenue is expected to increase 18 to 22 in 2022 and organic net revenue growth is expected to be in the mid to high single digits weighted to the second half of the year organic growth in the us is expected to be in the high single digits driven by growing momentum as evidenced by stantec s record high us backlog and project opportunities arising from the 1 2 trillion infrastructure stimulus bill after a year of robust organic growth in canada in 2021 high levels of activity are expected to be maintained driving 2022 organic growth in the low single digits organic growth in global is expected to achieve high single to low double digit growth propelled by strong economic growth continued demand and stimulus in infrastructure sectors project margin as a percent of net revenues is expected to be relatively consistent in 2022 compared to 2021 adjusted ebitda margin is anticipated to be in the range of 15 3 to 16 3 reflecting investments in internal resources to support growth and the commercialization of new innovations and technologies and increased discretionary spending albeit not to pre pandemic levels adjusted ebitda margin in q1 2022 will likely be at or below the low end of this range because of the additional effects of regular seasonal factors in the northern hemisphere and the protracted ramp up of us activities and major projects awarded in q4 2021 the higher end of the range is expected to be reached by the second half of 2022 driven by high organic net revenue growth and increased utilization in the us operations adjusted net income is expected to continue to benefit from the 2023 real estate strategy which remains on track to achieve a 30 reduction in real estate footprint compared with a 2019 baseline and a cumulative 0 35 to 0 40 per share by the end of 2023 with 0 15 recognized in 2021 the remaining 0 20 to 0 25 per share is expected to be generated approximately evenly between 2022 and 2023 for 2022 this in conjunction with continued benefits from tax planning strategies is expected to drive an adjusted net income margin of 7 5 or greater as a percent of net revenue as a result adjusted diluted eps is expected to grow 22 to 26 in comparison to 2021 the above targets do not include any assumptions for additional acquisitions given the unpredictable nature of the size and timing of such acquisitions or the unpredictable impact from share price movements subsequent to december 31 2021 and the relative total shareholder return components on stantec s share based compensation programs fourth quarter 2021 financial highlights net revenue on a constant currency basis increased 8 7 or 75 0 million driven by acquisition growth of 6 7 and organic growth of 2 0 including the effects of foreign exchange net revenue increased 54 5 million without the impact of tmep organic growth would have been 4 2 reflecting strong growth achieved in canada and global and organic growth across most business lines with the exception of infrastructure which stayed consistent with the prior period project margin increased 11 3 or 51 6 million and increased as a percentage of net revenue from 52 8 to 55 3 primarily from higher net revenue a shift in project mix and strong project execution adjusted ebitda from continuing operations increased 2 6 or 3 6 million to 142 1 million representing 15 5 of net revenue compared with 138 5 million or 16 1 of net revenue in the prior period the increase in project margin was partly offset by higher administrative and marketing expenses most notably a 13 4 million increase in share based compensation expense 146 basis points as a percentage of net revenue reflecting the revaluation of incentive plans due to an increase in stantec s share price as well 2020 included the recovery of certain claim costs net income from continuing operations increased 11 4 or 1 7 million to 16 6 million net income from continuing operations as a percentage of net revenue increased from 1 7 to 1 8 and diluted eps increased by 15 4 or 0 02 to 0 15 strong project margin lower non cash net lease asset and related property and equipment impairments and adjustments for onerous contract costs from the continued execution of the 2023 real estate strategy and non cash fair value gains on equity investments contributed to a higher net income partly offset by lower utilization in the us and higher amortization of intangible assets and acquisition and integration costs related to recent acquisitions adjusted net income decreased 4 8 or 3 2 million to 63 8 million representing 7 0 of net revenue and adjusted diluted eps decreased 5 0 or 0 03 to 0 57 q4 2020 adjusted net income benefited from the favorable recovery of claim costs and resolution of certain tax matters q4 and full year 2021

t he business pages of newspapers tend to deal with the cut and thrust of competition rather than the cacophony of war but when it comes to vladimir putin s assault on the sovereignty of ukraine there is a company the world s largest gas producer that is right in the thick of it gazprom majority owned by the russian state has mastered the art of furthering the kremlin s interests as well as its own commercial ones that extends to squeezing european gas supplies until the pips squeak on february 22nd it received a dose of its own medicine when germany said it would mothball the nord stream 2 ns 2 pipeline owned by gazprom in retaliation for russia s warmongering in ukraine two days later russia attacked ukraine even those two events may not stop the firm from making mischief and money listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element to understand gazprom it helps to remember it is a child of the cold war born from the soviet union s ministry of the gas industry in 1989 its boss alexey miller has run it since 2001 the year after mr putin took power the two men are cut from the same cloth when america imposed sanctions on mr miller in 2018 he remarked finally i ve been included it means we are doing everything right investors in the west who buy gazprom stock for a spectacular dividend yield lament that it splurges on projects that benefit the state not shareholders a plan to build the world s second tallest skyscraper in st petersburg is a case in point as for mixing politics with commerce its business model relies on a monopoly on the high margin export of piped natural gas in order to cross subsidise cheap gas to russians in a land of frozen winters that is a precious quid pro quo for mr putin the run up to war in ukraine offered a textbook lesson in how gazprom served the government s interests while feathering its own nest for years its efforts to circumvent ukraine an important transit route for its gas led it to construct alternative pipelines into northern and southern europe that were intended to strengthen its bargaining power when its contract with ukraine ended in 2024 these efforts also set european countries that stood to win and lose from the new configurations against each other gazprom s decision to dribble only a bit of surplus gas to europe as demand there soared in recent months had a commercial logic the resulting spike in spot prices translated into record profits however it also sent a message europe should not take gazprom for granted it suits their purposes to keep europeans on their toes says jack sharples of the oxford institute for energy studies a think tank since the cold war western european countries have tended to shrug off this nasty side of gazprom instead they have become overdependent on its gas germany which gets about half of the fuel from russia is in a particularly invidious position some gazprom hangers on like gerhard schröder an ex chancellor who chairs nord stream deserve special ignominy former eastern bloc countries such as poland have no such illusions they know that as well as extending the hand of friendship gazprom can wield the knuckle duster they are also the most exposed observes anna mikulska an expert on russian energy at rice university s baker institute the most extreme case is ukraine where gazprom provided cheap gas and other benefits then turned them on and off as punishment for the country s westward drift recently moldova has suffered similar treatment russia s war against ukraine paints gazprom s geopolitical thuggery in stark relief it sent prices of brent crude soaring above 100 a barrel their highest level since 2014 it caused a surge in prices of natural gas of which russia is the world s second biggest producer the so called brotherhood network running through ukraine used to be the main transit route for gazprom s gas into europe though supplies have dwindled recently nonetheless fears that vital pipelines will be destroyed are likely to keep gas prices elevated so will concerns that mr putin could turn off the taps as part of his war effort though he may prefer european cash pouring into his coffers while gazprom continues to supply europe high prices are good for it germany s decision to halt the approval process for ns 2 a 9 5bn 10 7bn underwater pipeline running from russia to germany does not change much it had already been suspended for legal reasons in germany the bigger question is whether sanctions will be imposed on gazprom before the attack the betting was that given how dependent on gazprom europe remained the firm would not suffer much russia s potential eviction from the swift interbank payments system which some western politicians are calling for would probably not entirely sever gazprom s links with its european customers who still need a way to pay for its energy an idea suggested by ms mikulska among others to sideline gazprom with a gaslift of liquefied natural gas lng a maritime version of the airlift that overcame russia s blockade of berlin in 1948 49 looks like a long shot put that in your pipeline at a time of war gazprom s fealty to the kremlin is unlikely to be shaken being a loyal servant has won it the support it needs from the regime as other presidential pets such as rosneft an oil giant try to wrestle away its monopoly on piped gas exports the conflict will do grave damage to gazprom s reputation nonetheless it is a wake up call to european countries that they should invest in more terminals to import lng and further build up their renewables capacity to reduce dependence on russia it will be studiously watched in china where gazprom has pivoted in recent years in order to diversify its gas customers away from europe china is likely to be less bothered by mr putin s belligerence but even the communist party in beijing has good reason to care about gazprom s trustworthiness as it watches the squeeze on europe the python may yet end up tying itself in knots for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to money talks our weekly newsletter read

real estate continues to be a great vehicle for building generational wealth in large part due to the power of 1031 exchanges said matthew vitlin mba a financial advisor it is a nuanced topic but in short 1031 exchanges allow for a smaller initial investment in an investment property to be rolled into a larger investment property without having to pay income taxes at that time vitlin further broke down the concept saying you buy a building for 250k and sell it for 500k and you don t have to pay taxes on the 250k in profit so long as you invest that money in another building soon after this means that you can continually punt the tax bill down the road as long as you are alive if done correctly and for long enough you can start with a 4 6 figure investment that has turned into a 7 8 figure investment decades down the line and once you pass the value of the property is brought up to the value as of the day you died potentially wiping out millions of income tax liability though

for calendar year 2020 we continue providing petrobras with excellent service throughout 2021 and into 2022 we re proud of the hard work and dedication our crews on the petrobras 10 000 deepwater mykonos and deepwater corcovado displayed over the last two years in brazil over to norway we added a one well extension to the transocean s spitsbergen campaign at a rate of 305 000 per day that occupies the rig through september 2022 the agreement also contains provisions for additional work at escalating rates through 2023 according to the commencement period and finally in the uk the paul b loyd secured a one wheel contract with uk independent serica energy at a day rate of 160 000 per day commencing this summer as we look toward upcoming opportunities for 2022 we re encouraged by the market and industry trends we observed developing throughout the past year oil prices while volatile remain highly supportive of steadily increasing onshore activity defying uncertainties brought by new covid variants indeed now in the 90 per barrel range prices remain substantially above most offshore field breakevens numerous factors have contributed to the rise in commodity prices cheaply the industry is separate from structural underinvestment and reserve replacement a metric that affects future production capabilities of capital that would have been allocated to traditional sources of energy is increasingly being returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases are directed to green energy initiatives such as wind and solar according to the international energy forum global oil and gas discoveries fell to a 75 year low in 2021 as upstream investment declined a staggering 23 from pre pandemic levels additionally recent energy consumption levels have proven resilient as vaccines became more readily available and various restrictions continue to be eased oil demand bounced back in 2021 and is expected to exceed pre pandemic highs this year at greater than 100 million barrels per day finally opec production discipline last year kept supply in check is the group committed to stay with its gradual production plan despite pressures from large consumers like the united states for further increases further there s growing uncertainty and evidence of opec ability to even meet production levels while oil balances and prices have displayed some volatility due to the markets concerns about demand and inflation the majority of indicators point toward a sizable bullish inventory imbalance in the next 12 to 24 months in january many analysts revised their oil price forecasts up from prior projections for later this year and next we re now seeing a growing number of projections ranging from around 90 per barrel which we ve already achieved to more than 100 per barrel between now and the third quarter the positive outlook for energy markets is also becoming clearer for offshore drilling particularly in the regions in which we ve concentrated our fleet from january 2021 to january 2022 the number of floaters on contract globally increased to 114 rigs up from 98 this trend should continue with industry analysts project global demand measured in rig years will increase approximately 6 per year on average through 2026 we anticipate as demand continues to strengthen the upward trajectory of day rates will accelerate as utilization is driven higher to that point active utilization for sixth and seventh gen drillships has surged to over 90 globally up from the low mid 80s toward the latter half of last year many of these high specification assets are concentrated in the u s gulf of mexico where we continue to see them significant growth in day rate trajectory throughout 2021 we observed a pronounced increase in day rates of the ultra deepwater fleet with rates in the gulf climbing from the low 200 000s to well over 300 000 per day historically the gulf of mexico has served as a barometer for the offshore deepwater drilling industry and we are excited to see the healthy progression of day rates we are also observing a considerable uptick in direct negotiations to secure ready to work assets in the region with the active fleet contract through the better part of 2022 we anticipate supply will remain tight several rigs are planned to enter the region of the next year including our two new drills the deepwater atlas and the deepwater titan however these floaters will arrive already contracted for various programs looking at other markets brazil accounted for approximately 34 of floater awards in 2021 absorbing the majority of the active fleet in the region consequently floaters from other areas will be required to meet additional demand which should remain strong over the next several years as the number of project approvals is expected to double in 2022 from 2021 levels and remain generally low robust through 2026 in addition to the many petrobras prospects on the horizon medium to long term opportunities with iocs and other indices including ecuador shell petronas and totalenergies are expected to commence in 2023 given our experience and operational track record in brazil we believe we are very well positioned for these incremental opportunities in west africa while regional demand and utilization levels continue to lag the u s gulf and brazil we remain encouraged by the number of opportunities surfacing in the area bloated demand is anticipated to be between 12 and 15 rig years annually through 2025 with a substantial portion of demand driven by angola and ghana if this demand materializes we will expect the number of rig years required for opportunities in the region will reach pre pandemic levels later this year in norway the norwegian petroleum directorate recently confirmed that 2021 was a record breaking year for the country with the highest oil and gas revenues in history driven by a combination of higher production of oil and gas robust demand and strong commodity prices the npd anticipates production in norway will continue to increase over the next two years with new discoveries and field development projects coming online this outlook matches broader expectations for stronger norwegian market from 2023 as a record level of sanctioning is expected by year end due to the expiring tax incentives in fact one projection estimate a 255 increase in project sanctioning on the norwegian continental shelf from 2021 to 2022 in summary we are very excited for a stronger 2022 and our outlook remains as positive as it did when we spoke at the end of the third quarter in fact our outlook has been further reinforced by recent fixture trends in various indicators including customer conversations industry analyst reports and market projections for commodity supply demand balances we re also encouraged by the additional consolidation of our competitors including the planned merger of maersk and noble announced in november and the ongoing restructuring of the cedral group we anticipate these transactions will further enhance the overall health of the industry as our recent picture suggests customers value the access assets expertise and consistency of performance that transition provides in the context of a steadily rising market we will continue to manage our portfolio of rigs very prudently to attain the optimal combination of a rate and term this also applies to potential reactivations of the market demands if the market ultimately supports reactivations it s important to note that transition currently has 13 sixth and seventh gen stacked or idle rigs therefore we are best positioned to capitalize on the uptick in demand we will evaluate these opportunities on a case by case basis ensuring that the financial return results and value creation for all stakeholders as day rates increase the substantial cash generating capability of our fleet will contribute meaningfully to the strength of our balance sheet and as we have consistently demonstrated our team will also execute deleveraging and liquidity enhancing actions when appropriate ensuring we conduct transactions in the right way the recent court of appeal dismissal of a challenge to our successful exchange transactions in 2020 is a clear example that underscores our ability to effectively implement sound strategies in the best interest of the company and our shareholders we will continue making prudent use of our capital and other options available to best position the company moving forward in conclusion it is increasingly clear that the strategic rationalization of our fleet over the past seven years has created a competitive advantage for transocean when combined with our experienced crews and shore based support teams we remain the logical choice for our customers most challenging environments and we are proud to position ourselves as a clear leader in ultra deepwater and harsh environment drilling our industry leading 6 5 billion backlog provides us with the visibility to future cash flows to continue invest in our people the maintenance of our assets and new technologies which we continue to deploy across our fleet and with all signs pointing toward a continually improving market characterized by the increasing scarcity of the most capable rigs and related increases in day rates we are growing increasingly confident that the recovery will progress as anticipated we expect increasing utilization of our fleet and we ll continue to execute on our strategic priorities to further strengthen our position as the industry leader in offshore drilling mark mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jeremy good day to all during today s call i will briefly recap our fourth quarter results and then provide guidance for the first quarter as well as an update of expectations for the full year 2022 lastly i ll provide an update on our liquidity forecast through the first half of 2023 as reported in our press release which includes additional detail on our results for the fourth quarter of 2021 we reported a net loss attributable to controlling interest of 260 million or 0 40 per diluted share after certain adjustments as stated in yesterday s press release we reported adjusted net loss of 126 million highlights for the fourth quarter include adjusted ebitda of 250 million reflecting generally good performance despite unexpected downtime on the pontus cash flow generated from operating activities during the fourth quarter was approximately 185 million up from 140 million in the previous quarter largely due to the timing of interest payments and reduced income tax payments free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter was 114 million looking closely at our results during the fourth quarter we delivered adjusted contract drilling revenues of 671 million an average day rate of 352 000 this is consistent with our guidance and reflects strong revenue generation across the fleet that offset downtime for an operational event previously discussed operating and maintenance expense for the fourth quarter was 430 million this is above our guidance primarily due to the identification of certain excess materials and supplies that resulted in a 28 million non cash charge in the period turning to cash flow and balance sheet we ended the fourth quarter with total liquidity of approximately 2 7 million including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately 975 million approximately 370 million of restricted cash for debt service and 1 3 billion from our undrawn revolving credit facility let me now provide an update on expectations for the first quarter and full year financial performance before we get to the guidance let me address the omnipresent inflation concerns we are seeing pressure on costs as follows both offshore and onshore labor costs have increased some of these as a result of our annual collective bargaining negotiations while in non unionized countries were provided compensation increases for the first time since a downtime downturn started in 2014 the cost of materials and supplies are also increasing but manageable rates logistics costs in the country are lower in 2022 than we experienced in the second and third quarter of 2021 most importantly our long term contracts provide us with the opportunity to recover most of these costs from our customers and with new contracts with day rates rising we can offset the inflationary impacts and finally all increased costs are included in our forecast for the first quarter of 2022 we expect adjusted contract earning revenue of approximately 600 million based upon an average fleetwide revenue efficiency of 96 5 this is lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 largely due to the day rate decrease for the deepwater skyros and deepwater conqueror rolling off their legacy high day contracts coupled with low activity on a development rig three the nautilus and the paul b loyd jr in the first quarter of 2022 there s some offset from increased activity on a transocean barents transocean norge and discoverer inspiration for the full year we anticipating adjusted revenue to be approximately 2 7 billion also based on 96 5 revenue efficiency we expect the first quarter o m expense to be approximately 425 million the slight quarter over quarter decrease is attributable to the non cash materials and supplies charge taken the fourth quarter partially offset by the increased activity on the barents norge and inspiration in the first quarter for the full year we are anticipating o m expense to be approximately 1 7 billion we expect g a expense for the first quarter to be approximately 44 million and ranging between 175 and 180 million for the full year net interest expense for the first quarter is forecasted to be approximately 104 million this includes capitalized interest of approximately 15 million for the full year we re anticipating net interest expense of approximately 402 million including capitalized interest of approximately 71 million capital expenditures including capitalized interest for the first quarter are forecasted to be approximately 121 million this includes approximately 92 million for our newbuild drillships under construction and 30 million of maintenance capex cash taxes are expected to be approximately 9 million for the first quarter and approximately 30 million for the year our expected liquidity on june 23 2023 including our current 1 3 billion revolver that matures on that date is forecast to be between 1 4 and 1 6 billion including restricted cash of approximately 275 billion shipboard financing for our first eighth generation drillship deepwater atlas and anticipated secured financing of our second eighth generation drillship deepwater titan this liquidity forecast includes an estimated 2022 capex of 1 3 billion and the first half of 2023 capex expectation of 130 million the 2022 capex includes 1 2 billion related to our newbuilds and 100 million for maintenance capex with fixed supply and demand currently well balanced we anticipate beginning to reactivate cold stacked rig soon as always we will be disciplined when assessing these opportunities to ensure that all costs are supported by the duration and day rates associated with any new drilling contracts in conclusion in addition to the safe reliable and efficient operation of our rigs we will maintain our focus on optimizing cash flow generation through both revenue enhancements as the market continues to improve and cost control initiatives as we demonstrated in 2021 through various liability management transactions strengthening our balance sheet and improving liquidity remains our priority we ll continue to actively monitor and pursue opportunities to delever and extend liquidity runway through a variety of actions using all appropriate tools available in the market this concludes my prepared comments i ll now turn the call back over to cale cale dillingham treasury lead analyst thanks mark cynthia we re now ready to take questions and as a reminder the participants limit yourself to one initial question and one follow up question questions answers operator thank you we will take our first question from thomas johnson with morgan stanley please go ahead thomas johnson morgan stanley analyst hey good morning congrats on the strong quarter everyone i guess just to kind of start off here on the harsh side of things the last couple of quarters you guys had highlighted the uk as a potential area of strength kind of moving through 2022 could you guys just kind of give us maybe an update on your outlook for norway versus the uk and maybe how that outlook has changed over the last few months roddie mackenzie executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah hey this is roddie i think what i d take you through on that for the uk what we re seeing now is things beginning to pop up you have to remember that the uk s activity level dropped down to very very low levels so everything from here looks like very good growth so what we re expecting to see is there s more demand coming on by the end of 22 and into 23 the kind of the supply chain issues of having limited availability to wellhead equipment and that kind of stuff has delayed that a little bit but certainly now we re seeing a lot more tenders as jeremy announced there we got closed the contract for the paul b loyd and we re working on several follow on bits of work there so we re feeling pretty good about that and certainly also the p a and decommissioning work that s being pushed through in the uk should see a marked uptick in activity in 23 in terms of norway we continue to see a similar level of activity we have to remember that in norway was the first place to see the recovery so to speak so our uptick in activity over the past couple of years has been particularly good and what we re seeing now is because of the tax scheme that s being put in place and the pdos that are expected to get approvals this year norway is going to be booming in the second half of 23 and 24 and in fact most projections show that we will be at 100 utilization of all assets at that point so it remains to be seen that all of those pdos are approved but certainly the outlook for norway looks particularly strong again delivered by the macro that is fantastic across the world at the moment but also the tax schemes that have been put in place by various jurisdictions so we really think harsh environment has a very positive outlook for 23 and 24 thomas johnson morgan stanley analyst great thank you and then maybe just shifting to the benign side of things recent day rates you guys have shown in the gulf of mexico have been really strong we ve seen kind of operators there start to market those projects as advantageous from just a carbon kind of footprint per barrel basis in the past you guys have spoken about some of the technology that you ve implemented across the fleet to kind of limit emissions and increase efficiencies could you guys just give us an update on kind of how you re seeing emissions and kind of different carbon reduction goals kind of start to make their way into tenders roddie mackenzie executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah so i think we would probably all agree that the pace of the recovery that we ve seen in the drillship side of things has probably exceeded everybody s expectations which is great and certainly when we see the really high level of utilization above 90 and for the real high spec rigs we re essentially at 100 utilization at the moment the question then turns to things as you said like emissions so it s true that it s widely touted that gulf of mexico provides a particularly efficient carbon footprint per barrel and that s one of the reasons that our customers invest in that particular basin but also because the breakevens are particularly good and the size of the developments are profound so it s a very constructive business environment in the u s gulf in terms of specific technologies as you will have heard us say conferences and what have you we do have several initiatives around reducing carbon footprint as far as you possibly can doing so in a safe manner so i m not throwing caution to the wind but certainly exploring always that we can reduce fuel consumption and also produce lower emissions per liter of fuel consumed so we do have several initiatives out there we ve everything from fuel additives to how we manage our power plants but we kind of engage with the customers on an individual basis on those kind of things the reason being that a lot of them involve capital investment they involve upgrades so it s certainly something that benefits everybody but from our point of view we are looking for a partnership on that investment before we push forward whole scale on that simply because the investment has a return period on it that we need to see reasonably long contracts to justify that kind of upgrade but it s a hot topic just now for sure many of the operators engage with us regularly on that and we ve got several more initiatives that you ll see come out over the coming years thomas johnson morgan stanley analyst thanks i ll leave it there operator we will take our next question from karl blunden with goldman sachs please go ahead karl blunden goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks very much for the time roddie made some comments about a very strong outlook for 2023 or second half of 23 and 24 in norway i d just be interested in any color you can provide on how you see contract rates and also length evolving through the first half of 23 and the reason i asked that is you do have some bonds that are coming due in 23 24 that are currently backed by contracts and i m trying to figure out what the right base case assumption should be in terms of how you refinance or address those could that be done backed by contracts again or is another approach more feasible roddie mackenzie executive vice president and chief commercial officer i ll answer the market part of the question and then i ll kick it over to mark for the financing piece of it in terms of the market so there s already a couple of tenders out there that are looking at much longer term so it s true that as the harsh environment has recovered over the past couple of years there s kind of a mix between longer term contracts and some shorter term contracts so as i mentioned before that tax incentive is really kicks in place this year so you ll see the follow on in activity in 2030 and into 24 for that one but yes i think overall that market looks quite well balanced at the moment and certainly looks to be very very strong when you get into that 23 24 time frame mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer yes karl this is mark so as you know each of those ct rigs have four three year options so clearly if those get exercised the ability or the intention to guard and refinanced the balloon payments over those periods would be priority number one however we have other options as well and if you look at our five year plan we actually anticipate paying off that balloons not refinancing them so anything that we do with regard to refinancing against contract backlog wouldn t be a benefit to our liquidity forecast but as i said we have several things we re working on i don t want to get into that right now but just watch the space karl blunden goldman sachs analyst fantastic thanks mark maybe just one quick follow up on liquidity the revolver you mentioned is due in the middle of next year what is the right time frame for addressing that some folks would think sooner rather than later but with the macro improving how does that affect the right timing for looking to extend that mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah karl i think you got it spot on we have been talking about the macro improvement now for a few years the timing couldn t be better so clearly we re waiting to see a few more fixtures get posted to ensure that all markets including the banks see that the market is improving but you can expect us to start this process in the next few months and hopefully get it completed by the end of the year karl blunden goldman sachs analyst thanks very much operator and we will go next to samantha hoh with evercore isi please go ahead samantha hoh evercore isi analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question jeremy you had mentioned on the last call that you re being approached by customers to revisit the business model and maybe figure out different partnerships to survive both the downturn and upturn and clearly we re in an upturn now and with some of the pictures that you posted i m just kind of curious how those dialogues are going and if you could actually share what type of arrangements are being discussed jeremy thigpen chief executive officer yeah i ll hand that one to roddie because he s engaging in those conversations daily but thanks for the question samantha roddie mackenzie executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah hi look i mean as things improve as you might imagine the discussion changes is no longer about trying to find a spot for the rigs and whether we ll be able to keep them busy the discussion for the future is now about what the economics look like so we are heavily engaged in discussions around value proposition so that s not just the day rate so yes you ve seen a really big increase in day rates comparatively speaking over the past 12 months but we also see a lot more kind of value discussions around how is compensation linked to performance so we ve done a fantastic job but hats off to fuel and the operations team for delivering first class performance not only results in really good revenue efficiency but also our bonus capture opportunity so we re in the tens of millions of bonus capture per year so that s something we probably would never have said in years past but i do remember the debate some years ago where its folks weren t really embracing that i think transocean embraced that wholesale and we have a number of contracts that we ve done particularly well in that so there s definitely that performance linked compensation element in addition to that in terms of like long term partnerships we do have partnerships with several of the operators that last for many years very virtual contracts but we re in constant dialogue with them on how to essentially enhance our service delivery how to meet more of their goals and similar to one of the previous questions around esg initiatives and reduced carbon footprint those kind of discussions take place part and parcel with performance with long term contracts and investment in the rigs jeremy thigpen chief executive officer yeah and i ll just add to that samantha that it s not just about the rates or the structure the economic structure it s really around rig availability our now recognize that the availability of active high specification assets is rare and supply is tight and the cost not only the cost but the time to reactivate a rig or bring out a newbuild because of the supply chain challenges we re facing around the world due to covid is really a problem for them and so the partnerships are both around what does the business model look like going forward and how do i access to the best rigs that are currently available and hot samantha hoh evercore isi analyst ok what are some of the sort of leading technologies that operators are looking for now if the conversation is to actually reactivate the rig i think like for example you mentioned managed pressure drilling is kind of they re seeing more and more of that in some rig tenders but beyond just like the low emission technologies and whatnot like what other sort of technologies do you see customers looking for in rate these days roddie mackenzie executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah so other than the ones that you mentioned we re heavily engaged in performance related technologies so for example adt but also more and more drilling automation if you re an avid follower of a linkedin page you would have seen we just posted the robotic riser bolting system which is the first robots to be brought to a drill floor a very interesting technology because it provides a far safer drill floor operation relatively speaking to the traditional means but also provides time savings that s a benefit to the customer s well program so yes we have a list of these things we probably have about 10 key technologies that we re currently discussing with customers we kind of have a package of presentation of all these different techs that we take to the various drilling departments around the world but the uptake was slow during the downturn but we ve seen a marked increase in number of technologies that are being deployed on the rigs and pilots that are kicking off so we re pretty encouraged to see that our customers are now finally getting into that kind of investment jeremy thigpen chief executive officer yeah and i think the key for us has always been has been on technologies that can improve safety reliability uptime and efficiency both drilling efficiency and improving our environmental footprint and so those have been the technologies we continue to invest in despite the downturn and i m proud that we have and we ve continued to develop those and even deploy some and now we re getting to the stage where the customers actually willing to pit for it and so that s the encouraging piece and so if we can get the customers to actually pay for these technologies when they see the value in them then we can deploy more quickly right now it s been a very measured deployment just because of a lack of capital samantha hoh evercore isi analyst that s wonderful thanks guys i ll definitely take a look at but that price bolting system on know your linkedin page operator we will take our next question from aaron rosenthal with j p morgan please go ahead aaron rosenthal j p morgan analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question just wanted to quickly follow up on the liquidity number detailed earlier i think i heard about 1 5 billion at june 2023 if that s correct i just kind of want to verify the prior year end 22 look great to about 1 9 billion was impact maybe you can kind of help us bridge from that figure during the interim six months to the 1 5 billion in june mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer sorry aaron you re very garbled i cannot hear you i think you asked to liquidity in mid 2023 and the range i gave was 1 4 to 1 6 billion including our 1 3 billion revolving credit facility which matures on that date aaron rosenthal j p morgan analyst sorry guys you weren t able to hear me was the 1 4 to 1 6 in june of 2022 or 2023 mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer 23 aaron rosenthal j p morgan analyst ok and then the prior year end 2022 liquidity figure of between 1 8 and 2 billion is that still in place mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it is and obviously the reason why we re giving a specific date in 23 because that s the day that the revolver matures obviously prior to that time we will have either replaced it or extended it so we ll have a better number for you once that exercise is complete aaron rosenthal j p morgan analyst yeah understood there and then i guess in the from year end 22 to call it june of 2023 at the midpoint that s about 400 million or so of liquidity falling can you just kind of elaborate on the bridge there i guess you kind of laid out an initial capex number but if you could just give us some incremental color would be appreciated mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the vast majority of that is debt repayments if you recall the previous question we had on the cat ds we have one of the two cat d bonds maturing in that time period so we re paying that off during the first several months aaron rosenthal j p morgan analyst ok perfect thank you very much and then just one more i guess on the 1q 22 guide i guess can you just elaborate further on the moving pieces there with respect to i guess both downtime and perhaps in the gulf of mexico as well as some of the guided opex figures mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer you re asking about q1 of 2022 aaron rosenthal j p morgan analyst yes sir mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer so the biggest change there is the fact that we ve had two of our high day rate rigs which were long term contracts and the conqueror roll off to lower day rate contracts that s about 13 million you also have two less days in the first quarter because of february being 28 days so that s another 12 million and we re also forecasting less reimbursables for the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and that s about 7 million but as you know that can fluctuate based upon what will we get asked to buy customers during the quarter but those are the three components that drive the difference aaron rosenthal j p morgan analyst perfect thank you mark mey executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator this will conclude today s question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to cale dillingham for any additional or closing remarks cale dillingham treasury lead analyst thank you

acid production revenue was 212 5 million for the fourth quarter representing a 173 increase year over year the increase in nucleic acid production revenue was the result of continued strong demand

million respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 78 8 million and 169 2 million respectively for the prior year financial guidance for 2022 our financial guidance for the full year 2022 is based on expectations for our existing business and does not include the financial impact of potential new acquisitions if any or items that have not yet been identified or quantified this guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties identified in the forward looking statements below total revenue for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 920 0 million to 960 0 million reflecting overall growth of 15 to 20 adjusted ebitda non gaap is expected to be in the range of 630 0 million to 670 0 million adjusted fully diluted eps non gaap is expected to be in the range of 1 70 1 84 per share adjusted fully diluted eps non gaap is based on the assumption that all the units of maravai topco holdings llc paired with the corresponding shares of class b common stock are converted to shares of class a common stock the net income included in the adjusted fully diluted eps non gaap has been adjusted to eliminate the net income attributable to non controlling interest as a result of the assumed full conversion of the units of maravai topco holdings llc paired with the corresponding shares of class b common stock for shares of class a common stock and is further adjusted for certain items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations all such adjustments have been tax effected at the midpoint of an assumed statutory tax rate range of 23 to 25 maravai cannot provide guidance for the most closely comparable gaap measures or reconciliations for the non gaap financial measures included in the 2022 guidance above because we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of certain reconciling items without unreasonable effort this is due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation including net income attributable to noncontrolling interest variations in effective tax rate expenses to be incurred for acquisition activities and the diluted weighted average number of shares of class a common stock outstanding for the applicable period from potential proforma exchanges of outstanding maravai topco holdings llc units paired with shares of class b common stock for shares of class a common stock thus we are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward looking non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forward looking gaap financial measures because such information is not available however 2022 interest expense is expected to be in the range of 22 0 million to 25 0

prop 47 reclassified theft offenses from felonies to misdemeanors including shoplifting it doesn t mean people can steal up to 950 in goods without consequences example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video proposition 47 a law enacted in california in 2014 has been brought back into the public eye following a segment that aired on fox news the proposition reduces the penalties for some non violent drug and petty theft offenses some republican lawmakers in california are now pushing for a bill to repeal proposition 47 while other lawmakers are looking to amend it a recent poll also found that most voters surveyed would support changes to proposition 47 the los angeles times reports we re proposing a pretty radical idea make crime illegal again in california assemblyman kevin kiley r calif who appeared on fox news in support of the bill to repeal proposition 47 wrote in a tweet during his february appearance on fox news kiley said we removed the consequence for stealing and what do you know it caused a lot more stealing under prop 47 you can go into a store and steal up to 950 worth of merchandise and it s not even charged as a felony it s not even a slap on the wrist some social media users have also claimed that the california law permits shoplifting and that shoplifting items worth less than 950 is not a crime the question can you steal up to 950 worth of merchandise in california without consequence under proposition 47 the sources the answer no you can t steal up to 950 worth of merchandise in california without consequence under proposition 47 the proposition reduced the punishment for certain theft crimes but it still classifies shoplifting as a misdemeanor what we found proposition 47 reclassified certain theft offenses from felony charges to misdemeanors according to california courts the proposition created a new misdemeanor offense called shoplifting which is punishable by up to six months in county jail according to california courts attorneys here here and here say shoplifters could also face a fine of up to 1 000 or both a fine and jail time shoplifting is defined under california s penal code as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed 950 before the passage of proposition 47 shoplifters were usually charged under the state s burglary laws which carried felony penalties according to robert helfend a criminal defense attorney in california in california burglary means a person enters an inhabited residence such as a home apartment boat or warehouse with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony the state s penal code says first degree burglary is punishable by up to six years in prison felony probation and or fines a person charged with shoplifting in california cannot also be charged with burglary or theft of the same property michael romano co sponsor of proposition 47 and chairperson of the california committee on the revision of the penal code wrote in an email to verify that the state directs savings from reduced incarceration into services such as mental health treatment and schools opponents of the law say it s led to an uptick in theft incidents but romano says proposition 47 has had no measurable negative impact on crime rates california s property crime rate in 2020 was significantly below what it was in 2000 down by 32 according to the public policy institute of california ppic california however there were statewide increases in property crime in 2012 and 2015 since 2000 california has implemented many criminal justice reforms no research to date has linked any of these reforms to changes in violent crime but they have been found to be contributing factors to coinciding temporary increases in auto theft and larceny the ppic writes in a 2018 research article published in the criminology and public policy journal the authors explain that proposition 47 also reduced other crimes in which the stolen property was less than 950 from felonies to misdemeanors those crimes include grand theft receiving stolen property forgery fraud and writing a bad check prop 47 was intended to impact future convictions and sentencing but also allowed for individuals incarcerated at the time for crimes covered by the measure to petition for resentencing the article says notably prop 47 required thorough review of an individual s criminal history and proper risk assessment before resentencing to ensure public safety charis kubrin ph d professor of criminology law and society at the university of california irvine is one of the article s authors she explained in an email to verify that proposition 47 does allow for the prosecution of shoplifting and other petty theft crimes just as misdemeanors instead of felonies

piloting several gig network solutions including partnering with instacart in several markets with same day diy home delivery and building on the success we gained in the florida and ohio valley regions with our market delivery strategy we completed the conversion of our third geographic area the carolina region during the fourth quarter by way of reminder in the market based delivery model big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers homes this replaces the highly inefficient store delivery model where each store acts as its own distribution and transportation center for these products as we continue to expand our market based delivery model we re freeing up space in our 10 000 square foot store back rooms which on average are considerably larger than our competition and we are testing out different options to drive both greater in store fulfillment and expanded delivery alternatives for both pro and diy customers in a few minutes bill will discuss our

turning to our results in canada where performance lagged the u s the canadian leadership team continues to drive productivity through proven technology and processes that have delivered great results in the u s before i close i d like to share my perspective on the home improvement market as well as our opportunity to continue to win share our outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong supported by a very healthy consumer balance sheet especially for homeowners and continuing home price appreciation persistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment in fact we re encouraged by the strengthening millennial household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years other trends remain favorable including baby boomers increasing preference to age in place and with the extension of remote work for some employees we re expecting a permanent step up in repair and maintenance cycle and as a reminder 50 of the homes in the u s are over 40 years old and will continue to require investments for upkeep and approximately two thirds of lowe s annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity therefore we re encouraged that the macro environment for home improvement remains very supportive as we close the year we continue to give back to the communities where we operate with total donations of 100 million in 2021 well over our pre pandemic levels and we re pleased that our efforts to enhance our brand reputation while supporting our associates and driving

relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate and manage the impact of cost increases across our supply chain before i close i d like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and inventory and supply chain teams along with our vendors for their hard work and continued support thank you and i ll now turn the call over to joe joe mcfarland executive vice president stores thanks bill and good morning everyone i would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for delivering tremendous results in 2021 in recognition of their outstanding efforts we awarded the discretionary year end bonus of 6 000 for assistant store managers 1 000 for department supervisors 800 for full time hourly associates and 400 for part time hourly associates as marvin mentioned the combination of winning together and this discretionary year end bonus will result in a payout of over 350 million for our frontline associates this quarter as someone who started his career in home improvement as an hourly associate i understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition is for our hourly associates at lowe s our people are truly our most valuable asset when it comes to recruiting and retaining top talent we strive to be an employer of choice from the moment that a candidate applies for a position at lowe s we are committed to creating a positive impression we have invested in leading technology that accelerates the hiring process so that we are processing applications in a matter of minutes rather than the weeks that the manual process required as recently as last year we also continue to improve our onboarding process so that our new hires can quickly come up to speed leveraging the technology and product knowledge that is readily available to them on their handheld mobile devices via the lowe s university application as i mentioned on our last call we are also leveraging our new lowe s university in store training labs to provide the ongoing training that our associates need to build their skills and confidence so they can continue to progress in their career over the last three years we have created valuable career opportunities for our associates with the incremental 10 000 department supervisor roles and 1 600 asm positions that we have added since 2018 we have also invested well over 2 billion in incremental wage and equity programs for our frontline associates to ensure that we continue to offer a strong competitive wage and benefit package to our associates i m really pleased to report that our investments to position lowe s as an employer of choice are paying off heading into spring we anticipate being even better positioned than last year from a hiring perspective and we are also confident that we will continue to drive productivity in our operations through our perpetual productivity improvement or ppi initiatives as a reminder this is not a single win it is a series of improvements that are scaling across our stores over time in fact we are working on over 20 different ppi initiatives in our store operations this year to highlight just a few key ppi initiatives we have just launched a new store inventory management system or sims across all of our stores this platform gives store associates real time visibility to inventory in their store this includes inventory in the home bay location as well as product in the top stock and cap off shelf and back stock room this new system will eliminate the countless nonproductive hours associates have been spending looking for product i m also excited about our continuing efforts to eliminate the ancient green screen technology with the launch of our simplified user interface to other selling stations throughout the store first introduced at our front end registers we are beginning to implement this new technology across the sales floor with this new platform we are accelerating the associate training process and facilitating cross training in other departments this new technology will free up our associates to focus on providing excellent customer service while reducing customer wait time while these two initiatives are just a few of the ppi deliverables planned for this year we expect that these two initiatives alone will drive 100 million in productivity this year looking forward we will continue to leverage technology to reduce manual tasking for our associates while also enabling them to deliver better service to our pro and diy customers i would like to close once again by thanking our store associates for their continued hard work and dedication and the great results we achieved together this year with that i will turn it over to dave dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you joe i ll begin this morning with a few comments on the u s economy as it relates to the home improvement sector as marvin indicated the consumer backdrop remains favorable as we are confident that home improvement demand will remain strong despite an uptick in interest rates historically when interest rates have risen against a strong economic backdrop the home improvement sector has delivered solid growth during these periods housing affordability was supported by growth in jobs and personal income which offset the impact of higher borrowing costs today housing affordability remains above the pre pandemic average the market is expecting moderately higher interest rates in the coming quarters but keep in mind rates are increasing off historic lows home equity has increased due to rising home prices and consumer savings are about 2 5 trillion higher than pre pandemic levels positioning consumers for continued residential investments given all these factors we are expecting another strong year of demand in the home improvement market now let me turn to capital allocation we remain committed to be best in class when it comes to our ability to create value for our shareholders through our strong capital allocation program in 2021 we generated 8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results and we returned 15 1 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends during the fourth quarter we paid 551 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 16 million shares for 4 billion this brought the total to 13 1 billion in share repurchases for the year ahead of our expectations of 12 billion this reflected better than expected financial performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders capital expenditures were 597 million in the quarter and nearly 1 9 billion for the full year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to both drive growth and enhance returns across the business our balance sheet remains very healthy adjusted debt to ebitdar stands at 1 98 times well below our long term leverage target of 2 75 times as i mentioned at our december 15 investor update we are planning to return to our leverage target over the next two years driven by our shareholder focused capital allocation strategy with that i d like to turn to the income statement in the fourth quarter we reported diluted earnings per share of 1 78 an increase of 34 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year this increase reflected better than expected sales growth improved gross margin rate and favorable sg a leverage driven by our productivity initiatives in the quarter sales were 21 3 billion reflecting a comparable sales increase of 5 comparable average ticket increased 9 4 and with higher ticket sales in appliances flooring and seasonal and outdoor living and 90 basis points of commodity inflation in both lumber and copper in the quarter comp transaction count decreased 4 4 but on a two year basis comp transactions increased 8 9 we continue to gain traction with our total home strategy as reflected in pro growth of 23 and positive diy comps on top of extremely strong diy growth last year on lowes com sales increased 11 5 in the quarter u s comp sales increased 5 1 in the fourth quarter and 35 2 on a two year basis we saw acceleration in both our pro and our diy comp sales trends from our third quarter performance by month our u s comparable sales were up 8 1 in november up 7 4 in december and down 1 3 in january recall that we cycled over government stimulus in late december and early january of last year but looking at u s comp growth on a two year basis from 2019 to 2021 november sales increased 33 8 december increased 37 4 and january increased 33 9 gross margin was 32 9 of sales in the fourth quarter up 115 basis points from last year product margin rate increased 65 basis points driven by our disciplined pricing and cost management strategies improvements in both shrink and credit revenue benefited gross margin by 50 basis points and 25 basis points respectively these benefits were partially offset by roughly 30 basis points of pressure related to higher transportation and importation costs as well as the expansion of our supply chain network i d like to spend just a moment addressing the recent increase in lumber prices we are confident that we have an effective strategy to carefully manage our inventory and rapidly adjust pricing although we are planning for our lumber margins to be compressed when prices decline we are confident in our outlook for gross margin rate to be up slightly in 2022 turning to sg a we levered 15 basis points versus ly driven by higher sales and our relentless focus on productivity this quarter we incurred 50 million of covid related expenses as compared to 165 million of covid related expenses last year this reduction in these expenses generated 60 basis points of sg a leverage additionally we incurred 150 million of expenses related to the u s stores reset in the fourth quarter of last year as we did not incur any material expenses related to this project in 21 this generated approximately 75 basis points of sg a leverage versus ly these benefits were pressured by 100 basis points related to the discretionary year end bonus of 215 million for our store based frontline associates operating profit was over 1 8 billion in the quarter an increase of 21 versus ly operating margin of 8 7 for the quarter increased 115 basis points over last year largely driven by higher gross margin rate as well as favorable sg a leverage the effective tax rate was 25 3 in the quarter which is in line with prior year at year end inventory was 17 6 billion up 920 million from q3 and in line with seasonal trends and consistent with our effort to land spring products earlier driven by both improved operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy we delivered return on invested capital of 35 for the year up 760 basis points from 2020 now turning to our 2022 financial outlook we closed out 2021 ahead of the expectations that we presented at our december 15 investor update month to date february u s comparable sales trends are in line with our fourth quarter performance on a two year basis and based on the continued momentum that we are seeing in pro sales as well as higher expectations for commodity inflation we are raising our sales outlook for 2022 to a range of between 97 billion to 99 billion for the year representing comparable sales of down 1 to up 1 now please keep in mind that our outlook assumes that lumber pricing will return to a more normalized level in the second half of the year we continue to expect pro to outpace diy in 2022 keep in mind that we are cycling over an estimated 300 basis points of stimulus in the first quarter also as a reminder our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week which equates to approximately 1 billion to 1 5 billion in sales we now expect gross margin rate in 2022 to be up slightly as compared to the prior year with higher projected sales improving gross margin outlook and continued execution of our ppi initiatives we are raising our outlook for operating margin to a range of 12 8 to 13 from a prior range of 12 5 to 12 8 for the full year we are also raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to a range of 13 10 to 13 60 from a prior range of 12 25 to 13 in 2022 we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately 2 billion and share repurchases of approximately 12 billion finally we are raising our outlook for return on invested capital to above 36 from our original outlook of approximately 35 in closing we are off to a great start in 2022 we have significant runway ahead of us to both grow our market share expand operating margins and deliver meaningful long term shareholder value and with that we are now ready for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of kate mcshane with goldman sachs kate mcshane goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for taking our question i wondered if you could maybe talk a little bit more about inflation how you re viewing inflation as part of the comp sales guide for 2022 dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah kate good morning thank you for the question as we think about next year if you look at our guide of down one to up one we would expect units to be modestly down and our average ticket offsetting that almost dollar for dollar kate mcshane goldman sachs analyst ok thank you and based on what you said about february it does seem like there may have been an acceleration from what you saw in january into february on a one year is it right that you re seeing better trends in february than january should we really just be thinking about things on a two year stack dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer kate it is true we are seeing better trends in february than january but on a two year basis you need to think about it our trends in february consistent with the two year trends for the fourth quarter which is really solid kate mcshane goldman sachs analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike baker with d a davidson mr baker your line is live for question mike baker d a davidson analyst hi thanks sorry on the pro side in the past you ve talked about it as being anywhere between 22 and 25 your orange competitor yesterday bumped there talk of what the pro is to 50 they used to say somewhere in the low to mid 40s i understand that it s hard to get the exact number but any update on what you think on an annual basis the pro penetration is and then more importantly what do you think it can get to marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer yes look i think your first statement is directionally correct on what and where the penetration is we just know the business continues to be very strong if you think about 23 comps in the quarter and 54 on a two year basis i mean we feel great about that business and i think you noted we spent quite a bit of time over the last three plus years making not only investments in adding products to our assortment but also our service levels fulfillment and we re very pleased as i mentioned in my prepared comments with the launch of our new pro loyalty program and as i mentioned as well we re seeing a 300 increase in pro sales for pros engaged in our loyalty and credit program and so pro is going to be a significant part of our growth this year and we still feel very encouraged by the progress mike baker d a davidson analyst ok and as a follow up diy you said up on strong gains last year fair to say up in the low single digits slightly up something in that range just what the math suggests dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct we saw expansion in growth in both obviously the pro but importantly the diy as well mike baker d a davidson analyst thank you dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer welcome operator our next question comes from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley please proceed with your question simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst good morning everyone my first question is on ebit margin now that it looks like you could get to 13 in 22 if you look at the model in the out years and i know you haven t really given anything past this is the correct way to think about moving past 13 it s productivity driven meaning it s all throughput as sales per foot keeps rising dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think that is correct simeon we re excited about in december to come back as a complete management team and really outline the building blocks for our progression above and beyond our 13 level as we think about our ebit margins but yes i think about productivity as the main driver of that as we continue to lean into both the pro business as well as healthy growth in our diy business simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst thanks and my follow up is on inventory there s been there s this big divergence in q4 now between you and home depot and if we try adjusting to see if there s a catch up it doesn t look like it s the case and so i guess marvin when you got to lowe s i think it was the first and maybe even the second spring where you put lowe s on the offensive in terms of inventory so the question for you is are you pleased with what you ve bought so far and are you pleased with the visibility of what s coming in for this spring and even for the year marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer short answer is absolutely i give a lot of credit to bill and the merchant team don frieson and the supply chain team for working in a very collaborative fashion to make sure that not only are we fully good about what we have from a product category but also the quality of the inventory and as dave mentioned in his prepared comments the coastal holding facilities that we established on both the east and western coast have given us the ability to land import product early take possession of it which on a temporary basis will elevate inventory levels but we feel that s a prudent thing to do to make sure that we have that product available out of that global supply chain so we can get it to our rdcs and our stores but we do feel good about where we are we feel good about the investments we ve made in job like qualities with pros and we think headed in the spring which as you know is a significant sales period for us we re in really good shape simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst thank you marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of scot ciccarelli with truist securities please proceed with your question scot ciccarelli truist securities analyst good morning guys obviously business is still exceptional but what kind of impact are you projecting from higher interest rates on the housing market and what is your framework for those projections dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah scot kind of in my prepared remarks we talked about that interest rates do have an impact to some degree but if you go back and historically look at periods of time when interest rates have risen at the same time we had really good economic backdrop actually the home improvement sector has benefited from that and i think if you cycle into 22 you see that same kind of economic climate now so we feel like the demand profile of the sector is really healthy number one and number two many of the efforts that we re embarking upon and actually beginning to gain some traction we re going to actually disproportionately take share in the marketplace so we feel like we re really nicely positioned to deliver a really solid 22 and think about the future growth of this business in a really healthy manner marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer hey scot this is marvin just one point to add i do think that home improvement oftentimes gets combined with home building relative to interest rates and obviously the sectors are entirely different and i think that we look at historically that s why i think dave s comments are so important that historical trends will show convincingly that high interest rates combined with other positive macro indicators do not have a negative impact on home improvement now home buying i m sure it s a totally different equation but we want to make sure that there s a line of delineation between the two sectors scot ciccarelli truist securities analyst so just to be clear guys so there at this point there s no assumed degradation in sales trends because of higher interest rates dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct scot ciccarelli truist securities analyst got it thank you dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of chris horvers with j p morgan please proceed with your question chris horvers j p morgan analyst thanks good morning everybody can i just can you just delve into the factors a bit more about what s driving the increase in the comp outlook in 2022 so to what extent are you expecting a higher level of market growth versus what you laid out in december to what extent are you assuming more share gains and then how does that compare to your expectations on price inflation and how lumber will play out dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think there s really three things that are driving our increase in our guide from a top line perspective one is we do think the market is going to perform a bit better and by the way we still think we re going to and believe and plan for us outpacing the market from a growth perspective secondly we are seeing higher levels of commodity inflation than what we planned back in december largely in lumber so that is ticking our sales progression up slightly in the first half of the year and then third we re seeing really strong sustainable performance in our pro business and that demand has been really consistent through q4 and we re leaning into q1 in a very consistent manner in healthy manner from a pro business perspective marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer chris i m going to just add a little commentary on the pro business this is marvin we did a cost survey stated pro that we issued out publicly and just a couple of interesting data points when we talk to pros and diy customers both said that they see continued investment in the home the diy i said at a pace of 50 today we re going to do diy projects and a roughly 50 say they would hire pro and then when you talk to our pro customers we have in detail they continue to let us know that their book of business is more robust than they ve ever seen it they have projects lined out for balance of this year some projects may carry over into 23 and health of that business is very strong and i think all the investments that we made in our merchandise assortments in our service levels in our stores in our supply chain is driving that business again two year comp in pro is 54 that s pretty good chris horvers j p morgan analyst understood and then can you also talk about the gross margin a little bit the shrink and the credit performance were quite strong and gross margin came in better than expected how do these sort of proceed into 2022 and what s elevating your gross margin outlook relative to what you talked about in december thank you dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah listen i think first and foremost we re just extremely pleased with the performance from a shrink perspective i think the store teams and the loss prevention teams have just done an excellent job of managing that and now it s becoming a bit of a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind which was historic i think as we lean into 22 think about a few things happening in general for the full year we expect the gross margin to be up slightly product margin to really lead the charge there as we really manage pricing costs very effectively our shrink and credit programs think about that was largely neutral to our performance versus 22 versus 21 and then we ll have a little bit of headwind as we think about both rates and supply chain and our continued build out in the supply chain ecosystem chris horvers j p morgan analyst thanks very much best of luck dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator next question comes from the line of michael lasser with ubs please proceed with your question michael lasser ubs analyst good morning thanks all for taking my question marvin i think you mentioned earlier today that about half of lowe s sales growth in the second half of last year was due to product inflation home depot mentioned yesterday they got around 800 basis points of comp benefit from product inflation at what point does the consumer start to push back or the industry experience an elastic response from all the inflation that s being passed through especially as there s a return to normalcy mobility increases and the interest in other categories shift on a return to normalcy thank you marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer well michael look i ll give you just a more of a philosophical perspective based on the trends that we see so we are very confident that there are certain trends that will sustain you have millennial household formation trends that are much more robust than any of us had anticipated pre pandemic you re also seeing the investments in the home that will maintain simply because there are so many millions of people working from home permanently that even as we hope and pray the pandemic will dissipate you still will have millions of people who permanently work from home that s going to drive certain investments in repair and maintenance that we think will sustain going past 2022 and the work that the merchants and the finance team has done to drive cost out and to make sure that whatever price increase is driven by inflation we are pushing toward our customers we re still doing that at a very competitive price because we re taking a multitude of actions to ensure that we re trying to drive other factors of cost out look you know this i think we re one of the only large retailers that reported that s reporting an increase in gross margin for the quarter and for the year from a basis points standpoint and also we re guiding that for the balance of 22 we re going to see gross margin rate continue to improve that gives you an indication that we have some degree of confidence we can manage this i ll let dave provide more of the financial specifics on kind of what we ve seen and what we see going forward dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael i would just add that to marvin s comments here we really put in a very robust process and analytical tools around this such that we re measuring and monitoring as we take increases from a cost perspective first we push back on that when appropriate we take a portfolio approach to adjusting our pricing and then we measure and monitor the performance from a unit velocity perspective and we adjust as needed when we need to do that such that we get the best price point from a consumable perspective but importantly what also drives the economic value here at lowe s michael lasser ubs analyst thank you my follow up question is lowe s has some very interesting initiatives that are either in the early stages or just about to launch most notably the supply chain transformation and the launch of the pro loyalty program so could you give a breakdown of the financial impact that you ve seen from both of those programs as you ve tested them and then what you factored in as far as the contribution from each of those in the year ahead dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer well maybe i ll take the contribution just from a planning perspective these programs are well planned and well thought out we have a substantial financial model associated with that we test and learn as we go and so we have a we feel like our plan for 2022 we have a very good line of sight to performance being driven out of those two programs so first and foremost we kind of checked that box and then i ll let marvin chat about the programs you like marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer no look i ll just repeat what i said on the pro we tested a loyalty program all of 2021 we ve made different tweaks to it based on feedback and surveys from our pro customers we feel like we have a program that s going to drive differentiation and adoption and as i mentioned when customers engage in the pro loyalty and our credit program we re seeing a 300 increase in sales and then we think that we re going to see some level of retention and engagement with our pro customers based on the loss that will be happening within the next couple of weeks so again excited about the test and learn environment we ve created and to dave s point i mean we put a lot of robust processing in place to ensure that we have good visibility to what we think each of these programs will deliver michael lasser ubs analyst thanks best of luck marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from the line of steven zaccone with citi please proceed with your question steven zaccone citi analyst great good morning thanks for takin my question i had a question on the diy side of the business so it sounds like most of the guidance raise is contemplated on the pro and then commodity inflation but can you comment if your diy outlook has changed in 2022 and then larger picture on diy there s a thesis we ll eventually see a give back of spending in the category but it seems to still be accelerating as of late and is still strong what are you seeing in terms of purchase activity or project sizes from your customers that gives you confidence in the sustained strength in diy marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer steve thanks for the question our diy sales were very very strong in 2020 so year over year we had tough comparison we were able to grow that business even on top of some really aggressive sales last year one of the things that we re leaning into as part of our total home strategy is private brands and private brands specifically in the core related categories i m going to let bill boltz talk a little bit about what we re leaning in there and how we believe that that s going to give us some level of continued growth and differentiation bill boltz executive vice president merchandising yeah thanks marvin and just a little more color around the diy business i think as we head into spring as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we talked about a couple of key private brands that will play a big role in the spring with the origin 21 which we re excited about that that s a new modern brand so you ll see it introduced in patio you ll see it in some of decor categories in our stores and then allen roth we ve worked really hard over the last 18 months to enhance that brand and so that s more of a traditional style and so that will play a big role as well and then we re really excited about the expansion of stainmaster stainmaster as you know we acquired a year ago it was largely a carpet brand but we have opportunities to use that in other categories in flooring really building off of its characteristics and then along the same lines as we look into the spring season our live goods and nursery business very strong has been on a really nice run over the last couple of years and that plays a large role in our diy business as we go into spring as well so we re really we re optimistic around the diy business as we had in the first half of the year marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer and steve we re students of history and we know that one of the strategic mistakes historically at lowe s was to overcompensate and over penetrate in private brands in pro related categories and so bill and his team have been very very specific to continue to lean in to national brands on the pro side but on the diy side specifically home decor the customers are telling us overwhelmingly that they love our design capabilities of private brand and so we re going to lean into that for differentiation and also for a margin rate benefit and again we think we re off to a great start steven zaccone citi analyst great very helpful thanks guys marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of liz suzuki with bank of america please proceed with your question liz suzuki bank of america merrill lynch analyst right thank you how much market share do you think you ve taken in the last three years and if the supply chain disruptions normalize and some of your smaller competitors are able to get product again do you see some of those share gains moderating marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer liz it s a fair question but i will repeat what i ve said a couple of different times home improvement does not have great market share data that we can glean very specific answers to what i can tell you based on just our on the ground analysis is that we are in fact taking market share it s hard to grow a business this size by over 35 on a two year basis and it s not coming from somebody we also are aware that there are winners and losers in retail based on the efficiency of your supply chain we are fortunate that we are one of the largest importers of containers and we have great supplier relationships that the merchants continue to foster so do we believe that we re winning we do do we think we ll continue to take market share in 2022 as dave said earlier we absolutely believe we will and we think we ll take it across pro and on and diy both in store and online but again it s hard to give you a lot of specificity because the data set is not great dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer and liz but from our internal data we continue to our data suggests that we re performing 200 to 300 basis points ahead of the market pretty consistently and that will be our expectations going forward as well to outperform the market liz suzuki bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you and just i mean how much do you think that the expansion into home decor and new product categories increases your total addressable market marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer it s a great question we can only go by the feedback that we receive from our customers when we do surveys and we do different types of focus groups and what they are telling us is that they are more brand agnostic when it comes to home decor related categories and they are more concerned with quality and good style and price and what bill and his team has done with the launch of origin 21 and with the continued improvement in allen roth as an example gives us a lot of confidence and we re really excited about stainmaster as bill mentioned you re going to see it going into more hard surface flooring but we have some other really exciting ideas that we ll be sharing over the next couple of quarters but we re going to extend this very very recognizable and high quality brand in the other home improvement categories that customers i think will be very excited about liz suzuki bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you so much dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer rob we re going to take one more question please operator the final question will be coming from eric bosshard with cleveland research please proceed with your question eric bosshard cleveland research analyst good morning two things if i could first of all the last two years have been relatively unique in terms of pricing and promotion and mix with a pretty aggressive consumer and pro customer as you think about 22 and it sounds like you think 22 kind of largely feels like the last couple of years is your strategy the same with pricing promotion and mix or do those efforts normalize a bit toward what we had seen historically dave denton executive vice president and chief financial officer eric i think they re going to be fairly consistent our plan is fairly consistent in 22 versus 21 and but i ll let bill comment on that too bill boltz executive vice president merchandising yes eric it s bill and so as you know over the last couple of years we ve been on this journey of getting to more of an everyday competitive price and trying to wind down what has historically been here a very high low approach to marketing and promotion and we ve very successfully been able to do that and that s now given us the runway to continue to provide value in a number of different ways to our consumers both through special buys special values unique offerings and so that s the journey we re on and that s what we re excited about but being able to get off of that what historically high low approach allows us to be in this everyday competitive price in the home improvement business and that s what we wanted to be on eric bosshard cleveland research analyst ok and then secondly within the guide for 22 which i think you spoke to negative units and price offsetting that to get to comp dollar growth haven t had a negative unit plan or outlook in quite some time for your business i m curious how you d marry that up then with your inventory strategy and also with how you manage labor specifically in terms of the investment or the growth in both of those areas in a year where the outlook is reasonably for negative units marvin ellison chairman and chief executive officer so eric i ll take the first part of it and i m going to let joe just talk a little bit about how our new labor system allows us to make real time adjustments by store by department based on ticket and transaction you have to understand that one of the reasons why you re going to see negative units is because the diy customer in the heart of the pandemic made types of purchases that they re not going to make in an era where there is less concern around the virus and less nesting at home we had cleaning purchases that drove a lot of transactions not a lot of ticket we had a lot of garden purchases and drove a lot of transactions not a lot of tickets because people were at home and they were staying busy categories like paint a lot of activity not a lot of ticket and so as we normalize year over year we ve got to see those activities are not sustainable so when we say that the ticket is not as though we believe that we re seeing less customer traffic we re just seeing diy customers have different projects than they had when they were confined to their homes and staying busy with just random different projects around the house and that s the difference so when we look at that we just made it really transparent around how we view the inputs to what s driving sales and we have no concerns that we re having a traffic issue or we have a customer demand issue this is just more normalizing over unique activity in the middle of the pandemic so i ll let joe talk about our labor system and how we can manage it based on all those inputs joe mcfarland executive vice president stores thanks marvin and eric you remember just a few years ago we put together just a topnotch workforce management team and we developed a labor model that is activity based so this labor model has served us well as sales have taken off and exceeded expectations from an appropriate leverage standpoint and does the same in balancing out the ticket and transaction we re very pleased with our staffing and our outlook for 22 eric bosshard cleveland research analyst thank you kate

depreciation and amortization ebitda is considered a non ifrs measure which may not be comparable with similar non ifrs measures used by other entities 2 adjusted ebitda is a non ifrs measure please refer to the full reconciliation of these items in the adjusted ebitda section 3 recurring revenue is comprised of revenue from the service and energy infrastructure formerly rentals product lines which are typically contracted and extend into the future while the contracts are subject to cancellation or have varying lengths the company does not believe these characteristics preclude them from being considered recurring in nature growth in recurring revenue is calculated over the comparative period 4 engineered systems bookings and backlog are considered non ifrs measures that do not have standardized meanings as prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other entities enerflex delivered strong quarterly results compared to the third quarter of 2021 and a fourth consecutive quarter of backlog growth with 324 million in engineered systems bookings this rally in bookings is supported by robust demand fundamentals for natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil we were also able to secure a 10 year extension on a boom asset in the rest of world segment extending these revenues with no new capital expenditures said marc rossiter enerflex s president and chief executive officer on the energy transition front our team is making meaningful progress on ccus infrastructure opportunities we are working closely with a number of carbon emitters and carbon management infrastructure developers enabling the decarbonization of industrial emitters in the usa and canada we booked several hydrogen compression units in the quarter and progressed on the manufacture of some large non fossil fuel based gas projects booked in previous quarters we are also proud to have started building three large ultra low methane emitting electrified rental units for our usa fleet based on strong customer demand the enerflex teams did a good job in the quarter gaining some traction in margin we were also able to mitigate supply chain risks but inflationary pressure on materials delivery delays and freight costs became more significant yet manageable in the quarter we expect our teams will be managing these challenges for the balance of 2022 as we capitalize on improving fundamentals for the oil and gas industry we are pleased with progress made in the regulatory capital structure and integration planning workstreams in preparation for the acquisition of exterran corporation as announced on january 24 2022 enerflex management remains focused on delivering on the strategic rationale of the acquisition including increasing recurring pro forma gross margin to approximately 70 percent of total striving for a sustainable cost structure through synergy realization and providing better capabilities to our global client base quarterly overview bookings totaled 324 million up substantially from 53 million in the same period last year and 191 million in the third quarter of 2021 which mirrors the optimism in the recovering oil and gas sector and is reflected in the increased activity in our engineered systems business comparing the fourth quarter of 2021 to the third quarter the company experienced an improvement in both revenue and operating income driven mainly by higher engineered systems revenue improved gross margins on certain engineered systems projects and lower sg a in the current quarter operating income was lower than the prior year primarily due to competitive margin pressures on engineered systems projects the recognition of large finance leases in the prior year and lower government grants received these decreases were offset by improved engineered systems revenues on stronger opening backlog reduced sg a on lower share based compensation and profit share and the recognition of a finance lease in the current quarter during the quarter the company negotiated an extension of an existing contract on a significant boom asset the extension is accounted for as a finance lease and is similar to the extensions that were signed in the fourth quarter of 2020 but has a lower impact in the current year and is the primary driver for the decrease in recurring revenues for the year sg a was slightly lower due to the lower share based compensation on the decrease of the company s share price during the fourth quarter partially offset by higher compensation costs the company derecognized 45 million of deferred tax assets this non cash event related to unused tax losses and other deductible temporary differences in canada the derecognized tax assets have a finite life and the continued challenging market conditions create uncertainty whether sufficient taxable income will be available to offset these unused tax losses prior to their expiry the company invested 17 million in rental assets the majority used to fund the organic expansion of the usa contract compression fleet enerflex continues to exercise capital discipline and to prioritize capital spending related to executed contracts with customers at december 31 2021 the usa contract compression fleet totaled approximately 400 000 horsepower with an average fleet utilization of 89 percent for the quarter the company has also invested 13 million towards construction of a natural gas infrastructure asset which will be accounted for as a finance lease the company maintained balance sheet strength by managing working capital reducing debt and continuing to exercise capital discipline we exited the quarter financially strong with a bank adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio of 1 00 1 compared to a maximum ratio of 3 1 this leverage ratio excludes the non recourse debt enerflex has substantial undrawn credit capacity and cash on hand subsequent to december 31 2021 the company s board of directors approved its quarterly dividend of 0 025 per share payable on april 7 2022 to shareholders of record on march 10 2022 the board will continue to evaluate dividend payments on a quarterly basis based on the availability of cash flow and anticipated market conditions on january 24 2022 enerflex and exterran corporation nyse extn announced they have entered into a definitive agreement to combine the companies in an all share transaction to create a premier integrated global provider of energy infrastructure upon completion of the transaction which will require shareholder and regulatory approval the combined entity will operate as enerflex ltd subject to all approvals the transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2022 outlook the outlook for exploration production e p capital spending has been steadily improving since mid 2020 when budgets were reset during the covid 19 pandemic commodity prices have risen to a five year high and e p and midstream balance sheets and free cash flow positions have been improving oil and gas demand has been recovering despite some continued effects of the covid 19 pandemic and evolving regulatory risks associated with the curtailment of hydrocarbons at the regional national and international levels as a result enerflex expects customer capex to increase as fundamentals improve in 2022 this trend can be seen in enerflex s bookings which have been trending upward since the third quarter of 2020 although customers continue to show discipline in spending within their cash flow and return money to shareholders we are cautiously optimistic that this trend should continue given the current fundamentals outlook in addition an energy transition towards less carbon intensive energy sources is presenting new opportunities for the company in several regions leveraging the strength of enerflex in providing modularized engineer to order solutions for the energy industry the company is working with existing and new customers to advance projects that 1 decarbonize core operations 2 capture carbon 3 build infrastructure for biofuels and 4 explore new hydrogen opportunities on january 24 2022 the company announced the acquisition of exterran with a transaction value of 735 million usd the transaction will exchange 1 021 shares of enerflex for each share of exterran management expects the deal to close in the second or third quarter of 2022 after shareholder votes for exterran and enerflex respectively regulatory approvals and other conditions customary for the transaction of this type the company will continue to preserve the strength of its balance sheet and maximize cash flow through disciplined capital spending with investments prioritizing higher margin less cyclical businesses with attractive returns once approved and closed the acquisition of exterran will result in accelerated growth of recurring revenues expected to account for approximately 70 percent of the combined entity s pro forma gross margin as well as approximately doubling ebitda leverage will temporarily rise to fund four major in flight projects we expect these projects to be completed in late 2022 or early 2023 and excess free cash flow after completion of these projects will be used to lower leverage ratios enerflex s board of directors will continue to evaluate dividend payments on a quarterly basis based on the availability of cash flow and anticipated market conditions enerflex remains focused on providing a safe working environment for all employees while positioning the company to capitalize on increased industry spending given the current environment the company is carefully assessing project spending with a focus on ensuring future projects provide maximum returns on invested capital in the longer term the company continues to balance the expected impacts of broader market factors such as volatility in realized commodity prices political and economic uncertainty and consistent access to market against the projected increases in global demand for natural gas particularly as an energy transition fuel to support decarbonization enerflex continues to assess the effects of these contributing factors and the corresponding impact on customer activity levels which will drive the demand for the company s products and services in future periods fourth quarter segmented results usa usa segment revenue was 167 million an increase of 66 million from the same period in 2020 engineered systems revenue increased due to higher activity levels resulting from stronger bookings and opening backlog while service revenues continued to improve from increasing volumes of work energy infrastructure revenue was higher than the comparative period with a larger rental fleet and higher utilization sg a was lower than the comparative period due to the mark to market impact on share based compensation and lower profit share partially offset by higher compensation due to the effect of the temporary cost savings measures that were removed in the previous quarter the net impact to ebit was an increase of 4 million driven by higher gross margins on increased revenues and lower sg a versus the comparative period as discussed above rest of world revenue in the rest of world row segment was 99 million a decrease of 45 million from the same period in 2020 with lower engineered systems and energy infrastructure revenues offset by higher service revenues engineered systems revenue declined based on the timing of new bookings which have not yet hit revenue recognition while service revenues increased on higher activity levels in argentina and colombia energy infrastructure revenue decreased in the period despite the revenue recognized on the extension of a boom contract that is now recorded as a finance lease the contribution is lower than the two finance leases recorded in the same quarter last year ebit decreased by 7 million due to lower gross margins from decreased revenues partially offset by lower sg a sg a costs were lower than the comparable period in 2020 due to lower share based compensation on mark to market movement canada the canadian segment recorded revenues of 55 million an increase of 2 million primarily due to higher engineered systems revenue energy infrastructure revenue decreased due to certain rental units being returned service revenue slightly decreased on lower activity levels despite the increase in revenues gross margins were lower due to pricing pressures and project pick ups during the fourth quarter of 2020 that did not repeat in the current quarter sg a increased due to lower government subsidies and higher compensation due to the effect of the temporary cost savings measures that were removed in the previous quarter partially offset by lower share based compensation expenses on mark to market movement the resulting impact to ebit is a decrease of 7 million compared to the same period last year adjusted ebitda the company s results include items that are unique and items that management and users of the financial statements adjust for when evaluating the company s results the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation from ebit or ebitda as determined under ifrs adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for measures prepared as determined under ifrs the items that have historically been adjusted for presentation purposes relate generally to four categories 1 impairment or gains on idle facilities not including rental asset impairments 2 severance costs associated with restructuring activities and cost reduction activities undertaken in response to the covid 19 pandemic 3 transaction costs related to m a activity and 4 share based compensation enerflex has presented the impact of share based compensation as it is an item that can fluctuate significantly with share price changes during a period based on factors that are not specific to the long term performance of the company the disposal of idle facilities is isolated within adjusted ebitda as they are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the company and are idled as a result of restructuring activities the company added an additional adjustment related to government grants most notably the canada emergency wage subsidy in the second quarter of 2020 the canada emergency rent subsidy in the first quarter of 2021 and the hardest hit business recovery program in the fourth quarter of 2021 the subsidies received have been recorded as a reduction in cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with where the associated expenses were recognized enerflex considers this to be a unique item as these temporary grants relate to the recent covid 19 pandemic and are not anticipated to be part of the ongoing financial results of the company management believes that identification of these items allows for a better understanding of the underlying operations of the company based on the current assets and structure canadian millions three months ended december 31 2021 total usa row canada reported ebit 20 6 9 8 11 2 0 4 government grants in cogs and sg a 2 0 2 0

gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap measure is included below in this news release management commentary eddie lehner ryerson s president and chief executive officer said 2021 was a consequential year in all of its dimensions where our phrase cohere and persevere took on new meaning through it all i can only express my deepest thanks and gratitude to the entire ryerson community of stakeholders i want to thank each of my ryerson teammates for delivering a year of record financial performance against the backdrop of repeated disruptions caused by the second year of the covid 19 pandemic its variants and the manyfold knock on impacts including severe global supply chain paralyses throughout i also want to thank our customers and our suppliers as we pulled together to navigate work through and mitigate the barrage of difficulties experienced in 2021 we can all feel good that ryerson has come through these difficult times stronger and mindful of the many challenges that remain while also appreciating the opportunities we have for realizing more of our organization s potential the end of 2021 finds ryerson with a stronger balance sheet and operating model providing a glide path for bettering the customer experience employee experience supplier experience and shareholder experience in 2022 and beyond 2021 company highlights navigated the covid 19 pandemic via our dual mandate of maintaining the health and safety of our employees and ensuring operating performance and recovery capacity transformed the balance sheet with total debt declining to

leasebacks of industrial facilities on favorable terms in proceeds on sale and leasebacks of industrial facilities on favorable terms reinvested proceeds from asset sales into two new state of the art facilities declared our first quarterly dividend in third quarter of 2021 and initiated a 50 million share repurchase program market commentary u s commodity markets experienced a pricing dichotomy during the fourth quarter with flat carbon steel products experiencing a decline in pricing due to shortened mill lead times and increasing availability amidst ongoing demand suppression while bright metals namely aluminum and stainless which remain elevated reflect rising global energy costs and longer term secular demand expectations pricing across carbon steel products began to decrease throughout the fourth quarter 2021 with cru hot rolled prices down 422 per short ton or 22 over the period on the other hand lme aluminum decreased by 2 while nickel prices rose by 15 during the period at this point given underlying supportive demand conditions and gradually improving metals availability ryerson anticipates that carbon prices will gradually decline in the first quarter of 2022 while aluminum and nickel maintain relative strength compared to their historical averages end market performance followed normal seasonal sequential softness whereby many customers reduce production due to the holiday season two additional factors impacted fourth quarter 2021 demand 1 end customers production downtimes were exacerbated by impacts of the omicron variant of covid 19 straining available labor and parts leading to a deferral of demand and 2 due to the rapid decline in hot rolled steel coil prices some customers deferred spot purchases in anticipation of lower pricing in the new year as such ryerson noted sequential shipment declines in most of its end markets in north america in the fourth quarter including metal fabrication and machine shop industrial equipment and ground transportation bucking the seasonal softness trend was ryerson s oil gas sector which again posted quarter over quarter improvement in north american shipments per day due to recovering exploration activity driven by surging energy prices and ryerson s heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac end markets which also posted positive growth due to increased demand from the construction and home building sectors while near term production bottleneck and covid related issues persisted into fourth quarter of 2021 the outlook for 2022 remains optimistic our base case is a lessening of supply chain disruptions and accelerating demand realization as the year unfolds against a backdrop of price bellwethers holding above their ten year averages we acknowledge the potential of inflation policy public health and geo political wildcards fourth quarter results reflecting ryerson s diversified revenue mix by commodity ryerson achieved revenues of 1 53 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 a sequential decline of 2 6 compared to 1 58 billion for the third quarter of 2021 as average selling prices were 6 6 higher partially offsetting seasonal weakness in tons shipped which were lower by 8 7 reflecting typical seasonality plus pandemic related impacts to shipment potential gross margin contracted sequentially to 21 3 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 23 1 in the third quarter of 2021 fourth quarter of 2021 cost of goods sold included lifo expense of 76 million compared to lifo expense of 102 million in third quarter of 2021 excluding the impact of lifo gross margin declined to 26 3 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 29 6 achieved in the third quarter of 2021 against the backdrop of a slight decline in revenue the company maintained solid expense management in the fourth quarter of 2021 as warehousing delivery selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales remained low at 11 8 compared to 11 4 in the third quarter of 2021 net income attributable to ryerson holding corporation for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 106 4 million or 2 71 per diluted share compared to 49 7 million or 1 27 per diluted share in the previous quarter the fourth quarter of 2021 includes a 2 million gain on the sale of assets compared to a 98 million non cash settlement charge related to the annuitization of 206 million of our pension liabilities and a 6 million loss on the retirement of debt in the third quarter of 2021 excluding these one time items and the associated income taxes adjusted net income attributable to ryerson holding corporation for the fourth quarter was 105 million or 2 68 per diluted share and compares to 127 million or 3 25 per diluted share of adjusted net income attributable to ryerson holding corporation and diluted earnings per share respectively for the third quarter closing the year on a strong note ryerson generated fourth quarter adjusted ebitda excluding lifo of 239 million

profit net of 16 million in working capital use the company s cash conversion cycle increased to 84 days from 68 days due to an increase in days of supply as mill lead times and mill past due

chief financial officer said for the second quarter in a row we were pleased to return approximately 4 million to our shareholders via our growing dividend payment and share repurchases the sequentially higher announced 0 10 quarterly dividend and our share repurchases are well supported by ryerson s strengthening balance sheet which saw net debt decline by 45 million quarter over

the brewing crisis is already hurting wallets and analysts warn the economic impact could move well beyond the gas pump example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york although many americans may prefer that the u s stay out of the conflict between russia and ukraine the brewing violence and political fallout are already hurting their wallets gasoline prices which have hit eight year highs could surge even further if the hostilities escalate or if u s lawmakers pass another round of sanctions the economic impact could also move beyond the gas pump wall street analysts warn sanctions or export controls against russia could make current semiconductor shortages even worse while restrictions on wheat or metals could drive the fiercest bout of inflation in decades to climb even higher shock waves across america russia is a major exporter of crude oil accounting for about 12 of the world s supply any disruption to those exports is likely to drive prices at the pump higher for consumers experts said if russia makes a run on ukraine we could see over 100 a barrel next week said patrick dehaan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy adding that average gas prices across the u s are likely to hit 4 a gallon in the weeks or months to come that 4 is something we haven t seen in so long it would cause shock waves across america he said a key factor in how hard the conflict hits the economy will be how russia responds to the u s sanctions that president biden outlined tuesday afternoon mr biden moved to cut off two russian banks and the state s sovereign debt from western financing while individuals will also be targeted russia could retaliate by halting oil and natural gas exports dehaan said that would put pressure on gasoline and natural gas prices in the u s which have already spiked this year the world economy does depend on global energy how does the world sanction russia s economy without russia saying we re going to take the next step for you and not export any more energy he asked if russia s economy is going down the tubes they re going to take the global economy with it the white house is considering another release from the strategic petroleum reserve the washington post reported tuesday and u s officials are planning to divert more natural gas to europe another hit to supply chains although oil is russia s most important export both russia and ukraine are also large agricultural suppliers sending wheat rye barley and other grains to central asia and the middle east disruptions in commodities could send global food prices higher putting pressure on u s consumers russia also produces just under half of the world s palladium and smaller portions of platinum and nickel key elements in complex microchips that are used in everything from electrical meters to sophisticated bmws said rsm chief economist joe brusuelas russia is also a major producer of aluminum ukraine is europe s top producer of uranium and has vast deposits of titanium manganese iron and mercury peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group said in a report because commodity prices are as high as they are any disruptions will really matter he said while the extent of the hit would be uncertain bottlenecks in critical metals could worsen the current semiconductor shortage and further push up prices of cars electronics and other big ticket items along with rising commodity and energy costs that threatens to make today s price increases even worse for many consumers what we re talking about is another round of supply shocks in the developed economies brusuelas said more inflation slower growth rising prices for commodities would leave u s consumers paying more for fuel and other necessities leaving less money for discretionary spending as costly as another european war would be in human and economic terms its economic burden in the united states would fall hardest on the middle and working classes brusuelas said while prices spiked during the coronavirus pandemic consumers were able to weather the shock thanks to enhanced unemployment benefits federal stimulus payments and tax credits from the u s government in the case of a full fledged war in ukraine or harsher sanctions on russia the shock to energy prices and reduced consumption could bring down u s economic growth by 1 brusuelas said should energy prices increase more than our baseline expectation of 20 to say near 40 we will be talking about a premature end of the business cycle he noted jittery stock markets the conflict is also rattling markets around the world wall street analysts expect u s stock indices fresh off record highs last month to remain volatile for the duration of the conflict as today s turnaround in global markets highlights perceptions about the risks around the conflict in ukraine have become an increasingly important factor over the past few weeks jonathan petersen markets economist at capital economics said in a report since the start of february oil and safe haven assets such as gold and us treasuries have appreciated while equities and some currencies e g russian equities and the ruble have come under pressure market upheavals are likely to have limited effect on most americans since only a small portion of the population owns stocks for those who do however especially workers with 401 k s or iras in the stock market the turbulence could put a dent in their portfolios in the short term

million of arr to over 5 000 nonprofits in 52 countries for us it s just the beginning the digital lift initiative is open to all nonprofits across the globe we believe our commitment to esg will pay a large role in shaping the future of monday com our values and our ecosystem in the coming years with that i ll now turn it over to eliran to cover our financial and guidance eliran glazer chief financial officer thank you eliran and thank you to everyone for joining our call today i will review our most recent financial results in detail and provide initial guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2022 we are extremely pleased with the way we finished the year total revenue in the fourth quarter came in at 96 million up 91 from a year ago this brought our fiscal year 2021 revenue to 308 million an increase of 91 from the prior year these results demonstrate our continued expansion within our existing customer base and acquisition of new larger customers we continue to execute against an ambitious hiring plan we ended the year with 1 064 employees globally this represents an increase of 51 from a year ago with the majority of additions coming from r d sales and marketing we continue to have ambitious goal for hiring these categories for the foreseeable future for the reminder of the financial metrics disclosed unless otherwise noted i will be referencing non gaap financial measures we have provided a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financials in our earning release gross margin came in at 90 up from 88 6 in the year ago quarter r d expense was 15 4 million or 16 of revenue we will continue to invest significantly in r d as we position monday com to drive durable growth and win our large addressable markets sales and marketing expense was 69 4 million or 73 of revenue compared to 107 in the year ago quarter the improvement was driven primarily by continued efficiencies as we continue to scale our sales and marketing spend to focus on customers with enterprise customers and 10 plus users which now account for 72 of total arr in q4 g a expense was 11 1 million or 12 of revenue compared to 10 in the year ago quarter reflecting increased cost of being a public company operating loss was 9 9 million and operating margin improved to negative 10 net loss was 11 7 million and loss per share was negative 0 26 moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow on a gaap basis we ended the quarter with approximately 886 million in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was 13 5 million in the quarter adjusted free cash flow was 10 1 million and was driven by strong collections stemming from our continued strong billings adjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less cash used for property and equipment and capitalized software costs excluding non recurring items we are very proud of our achievements during this exceptional year and look forward to carrying the business momentum into 2022 now let s turn to our outlook for fiscal year 2022 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 we expect our revenue to be in the range of 100 million to 102 million representing growth of 70 to 73 year over year we expect a non gaap operating loss of 47 million to 45 million this includes onetime super bowl advertising cost of 8 million for the full year 2022 we expect revenue to be in the range of 470 million to 475 million representing a growth of 53 to 54 year over year we expect a full year non gaap operating loss of 147 million to 142 million and a negative operating margin of 31 to 30 with a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader monday com work operating system platform across their organizations we are committed to investing aggressively in our company we will continue to prioritize growth which we believe is the best interest of our shareholders employees and customers let me now turn it over to the operator for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of kash rangan with goldman sachs your line is open kash rangan goldman sachs analyst hi thank you so much and congratulations on a spectacular finish a strong top line growth rate and also generating free cash flow which is very remarkable a question for the team can you tell us a little bit more about how the breadth of use cases is evolving for the company because we all know that monday com is not about just project management something beyond the concept of work os if you can you elaborate a little bit on the breadth of use cases and also touch upon the competitive environment are you putting away or how do things look from the standpoint of your traditional competitors and i guess on the financial front the disconnect is that you re generating better than expected operating margins better than expected free cash flow which is great but the guidance has not really changed that much for calendar 22 relative to the time you went public with respect to non gaap operating losses so can you help us bridge the tremendous progress you re making on the financials with the very conservative financial outlook for operating margins thank you so much and congrats roy mann co chief executive officer thank you kash so i ll start with the use cases and eliran will continue on the second part so it s true monday has so many different use cases and i think you can look at it in two different ways one is horizontals so we are also a crm as much as the project management tool we are also used as a team for our tool for r d teams to manage their work for marketing teams so that s like a horizontal view but then we have over 130 different business use cases where you see different types of businesses from manufacturing plants that use monday to run their operation to clinical trial research to really any kind of business out there and also 70 of our customers come from non tech segments like not tech companies so we see a really wide spread usage of monday throughout those different verticals and through horizontals so it really is reaching the 1 3 billion information worker that this is our vision to enable them to work better so thank you and eliran can touch on the second part here eliran glazer chief financial officer thank you roy hi kash so truly we had an exceptional year in 2021 and we d like to provide a responsible guidance for 2022 and demonstrate continue to demonstrate hyper growth at scale so a few things that we have to take in mind we are now as we said in q2 we now would like to invest in further grow the business not only in 2022 but also beyond 2022 therefore we took advantage of the fact that we finished the year with cash flow positive much ahead of what we said even in the ipo we have a massive opportunity ahead of us this is the time for us to grab land to increase our market shares and as you saw in the script we are coming with new products innovation and product road map is a big thing for us this year so we said let s take advantage of the fact that we are actually well ahead of what we anticipated or where we anticipated to be and continue to invest and drive hyper growth for the foreseeable future so this is the number one priority for us but we do it with scale and therefore also mindful to the returns that we are doing and other business initiatives that we are currently pursuing wonderful thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brent bracelin with piper sandler your line is open brent bracelin piper sandler analyst thank you and good morning good evening i want to start with the new products you talked about workforms and canvas could you talk a little bit about pricing and then talk a little bit about kind of adoption trends how broadly could these products be cross sold in the installed base thanks eran zinman co chief executive officer yeah thanks brent this is eran so first of all we re very excited to launch these two new products this is the first time for us as a company that we expand our product line adding two new products and basically giving a product suite to our customers currently our focus was to build two new products where feel people start to do their work so people might start a new process or a new project with a form to capture data or to manage internal requests and also people might start with a whiteboard just to organize their thoughts or to start a process we see this as a huge opportunity to capture new markets and new people that might be potential users for the platform over time so those are going to be independent products and we re going to charge for them separately people will be able to use them but we feel that both forms and whiteboards are never the goal they re on the path to achieve something and basically by allowing them to use both of those products and then over time also integrate with monday and continue the work and the process that started in each one of those tools might be a great leverage for us as a platform so we see this as a strategic part of us growing our ecosystem of products and capturing more users more audiences and more people that want to start any kind of work process or a project brent bracelin piper sandler analyst helpful color so it sounds like these are actually going after potential new lands not necessarily new products going out and targeting big cross sell opportunities helpful color there i guess eliran my last follow up for you is just on free cash flow two consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow i guess we can t quite call it a trend yet but a very impressive execution there as you think about the investments you re making in the coming year it is a bit of a departure from what we ve seen in the last couple of quarters walk us through the biggest areas you re investing in is it still largely around sales capacity is it still tied to digital advertising just trying to better understand where you re prioritizing the investments in 2022 year thanks eliran glazer chief financial officer so brent so with regards to your question on free cash flow so we are coming from an exceptional year but we had covid so many things that we plan to do during the year even with q4 we had omicron so getting back to normal we are going to invest in having conferences people will travel to see one another exhibitions company events this is one area that you would like to continue to invest second thing is we accelerated hiring so what we are doing we saw the trend in q4 which we had a massive hiring continue by the way into the fiscal year 2022 so this is a place where we are going to invest significantly in addition to that we are going to do things that relate to new products and new investments to address new markets that we re currently not operating to enhance our existing work operating system and to grab land in versus competition so from our perspective investing in headcount investing in getting back to normal and with the event for example the super bowl event that we did that was an exceptional 8 million these are the things that we are aiming this year very roy mann co chief executive officer it s roy i d love to add to eliran that we see a massive opportunity in our ability to grow this year both in marketing market demand like in a lot of areas and it like makes us confident in investing a lot of money to do that brent bracelin piper sandler analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark murphy with j p morgan your line is open mark murphy j p morgan analyst yes thank you very much and i will add my congratulations as well on just a fantastic free cash flow performance i did want to start roy you had just mentioned i believe the super bowl ad what is your early sense of the effectiveness of that ad that for instance did it drive website traffic did it drive a free tier sign ups and could you boost customer metrics or billings metrics in q1 any kind of insights would be greatly appreciated there and then i have a quick follow up roy mann co chief executive officer sure so thank you for the question so actually we love the super bowl it was amazing and we do like being the data nerd that we are we track everything so we kind of measure ramp up between countries and the website and searches and a lot of different things so we saw a big spike following the ad itself but for us it s mainly an ability to jump to the next level of brand recognition in the world it s a long term play it s not something that we measure on a day to day basis although that was also great and the overall coverage we got for the ad was amazing mark murphy j p morgan analyst ok ok excellent and as a follow up eliran if you drill into the sequential change in billings and i think we understand those numbers can bounce around but i believe it s 15 for q4 the prior couple of years had been 23 to 24 so i m curious just if there was any impact to billings perhaps stemming from duration or timing and any other factors and if you might just have any thought on perhaps on how to model billings if anything is unusual in that setup for q1 eliran glazer chief financial officer sure so with regards to billing just as a reminder our business model based on the arr is 70 or more now actually is coming from annual subscription and 30 ish is coming from monthly subscription so we see some trend toward the annual which obviously we benefit from but this is pretty much the trend as a leading indicator this is one of the reasons why we care about billings but you cannot really forecast the trend over time this is important for us in terms of the health of the business when we look at the return of the spend that we are doing either in performance marketing or sales and marketing or sales by the way then we see the return measure the return then we kind of forecast the billings that we are going to get we have an algorithm to address this and with regards to our growth in the next year this is a main driver of the cash flow and the billings revenue growth this year was 91 obviously drove strong cash collection net dollar retention that was above 120 for all customers and above 135 for temp proof also in driving this the growth in the enterprise customers is also a driver so all of these unit economics are main drivers of our ability to continue and collect and have a very healthy billings model mark murphy j p morgan analyst thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bhavan suri with william blair your line is open bhavan suri william blair analyst great thanks for taking my question team i appreciate it i wanted to touch a little bit on the 50k plus cohort growth there is really really strong i guess i d love to understand a little bit about sort of who are you replacing as you re expanding or landing larger accounts like is there an incumbent or is it still pretty much manual workforces that you re replacing and sort of how sophisticated are these workflows when you get about 50k is it sort of replacing sort of very sophisticated workflows how should we think about what s being done with monday that was not able to do or poorly done with either other products or menu how is that space i d love to talk about that for a minute eran zinman co chief executive officer sure so thank you bhavan for the question this is eran so basically as we scale into the enterprise and again this is right for small businesses but also for the larger companies we see that 70 of the deals we see literally no competition people use spreadsheets and emails and powerpoint and usually we displace those so taking what they used to do offline or using very basic tools and using that and we re taking that with monday so it s not exactly replacing but it s certainly a lot of vacuum that exists within the organization people use a variety of tools and then move and using monday to fill all those gaps all those processes that didn t have a place to be and another thing that monday plays a major role in is to integrate a lot of the tools that are being used already in the organization so whether a company uses a crm software or another project management tool by integrating that into monday you create one place where you can reflect a lot of the data that happens in other departments within the organization connect different people and basically break the silo that exists because different people use different software so it s not really displacing an existing software but more about filling the vacuum and connecting everything else that s being used by the organization roy mann co chief executive officer hey this is roy and sorry i can add to what eran said that yes that the use cases themselves can grow to be really complex and doing a lot of things across departments some stuff customers build like really blows their mind and but it happens gradually the onboard initially everyone use it to track the work and really manage everything and then it grows over time with complexity and our help all the time so that s kind of like the i don t know life cycle of usually most of our customers bhavan suri william blair analyst got it yeah and i agree with eran like email and excel is not automation right so that makes a ton of sense i guess you guys have said earlier you re sort of data nerds and we ve all known each other well i know you are the freemium model is something you guys started we all talked about is that the right way to do it and it s obviously working really well but i d love to get a little more color on how that s impacting the top of the funnel activity and net new customers obviously healthy growth there but i guess what is the early data to tell you about sort of customer awareness and the return you re seeing from the premium strategy i d love to get a little more depth or color there eran zinman co chief executive officer yeah so this is eran again so the free tier that we launched is very successful so far we see significant increase in the amount of people that use the freemium version of monday while not hurting our existing funnel we mentioned that previously but we ab tested that thoroughly and just to make sure it doesn t hurt the funnel but actually add a lot of free tier users what we are seeing and actually seeing this accelerating as a trend is customers from the free tier moving to and becoming paying customers it s kind of a second wave if you like of those kind of customers but we see this growing and accelerating so this is very exciting and also another thing that unfortunately we can measure is the awareness of the brand and people using monday to do other things apart from work so it s kind of hard to measure the effect of this but definitely it has some effect of the brand and the awareness of what monday can do bhavan suri william blair analyst yeah that s good to see that freemium conversion accelerate i appreciate the color guys nice job and thank you for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian thill with jefferies your line is open unknown speaker hi thank you this is john for thill so i was hoping that maybe you could dig in a little bit more on the new products workforms and canvas both being in beta just wondering when you expect those micro ga and then the pricing is a little bit higher i guess the workforms standard is around 29 and wondering about the go to market for those as well as you can shed any light on the pricing for canvas and lastly how to think about contribution within the guidance for this year thank you eran zinman co chief executive officer yeah so this is eran thank you for the question so basically we just launched this product they re now in beta we re actually still experimenting with pricing the pricing also might be different for example we might charge not per user with the forms but use different metrics to price our product so it s still work in progress as i mentioned it s just the beginning these are kind of new seeds of products that we plan it and we will see the results in the future from our perspective we didn t take those projects into account with our guidance and kind of revenues going forward but we see this as a huge potential for the next few years both in user acquisition as i ve mentioned previously but also as a revenue generator over time again it s early days we ll see experimenting we ll change the pricing over time but we re very excited about this we got some great initial feedback from customers it seems like there s a huge need in the market with those kinds of products so we feel there might be a great opportunity with those going forward eliran glazer chief financial officer this is eliran maybe just to add to what eran said also related to a question earlier on where we are going to invest innovation is one of the key drivers within monday and we speak about it a lot so we would like to continue to innovate and add additional products over time as i said not only for 2022 and this is where we do some experiments but also beyond so with regard to the ecosystem this is a place of high focus so far as part of our investment continued investment in r d and adding additional resources unknown speaker thank you eliran glazer chief financial officer thank you operator thank you next question comes from the line of andrew degasperi with berenberg your line is open andrew degasperi berenberg bank analyst thanks for taking my questions first on the nrr progression i mean i noticed it picked up quite a bit in q4 to 120 or above 120 and given this is a trailing metric it sounds like you had a lot of expansion in the quarter can you maybe elaborate on what happened there and what was popular and i have a follow up roy mann co chief executive officer yeah sure andrew thank you so as we said we are driving revenue and arr is being driven by two main things one is adding new customers and as you can see we have now over than 152 000 customers and many of these customers that we add are becoming we start more than 80 of our arr is coming from foreign enterprise deals and what you see basically is that once they are becoming customers of monday there is an expansion process because we already have them as customers and the salespeople actually are expanding inside and you can see that the ease of use of the product the fact that we are already embedded inside the fact that we have multiple champions is a key driver as we continue to go upmarket with customers with 10 plus users now already represent 72 of total arr as well as the expansion within the enterprise account this is basically driving this expansion within this existing customer base andrew degasperi berenberg bank analyst thanks for that and then in terms of large deal activity maybe another way to ask you this question is i think last quarter you mentioned you were approaching seven figure deals i was just wondering if any were booked this quarter or if you re seeing any more activity on that front for this year eran zinman co chief executive officer yeah thanks andrew so this is eran so definitely we see also acceleration in the amount of bigger deals that we managed to close another data point that we can share is that we have several deals over 1 million for the first time so this is also very exciting but it s not a onetime thing we see this as a trend that continues to happen and expand over time so definitely we managed to land bigger deals and to close bigger companies using the product and we see this trend continuing in 2022 as well andrew degasperi berenberg bank analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dj hynes with canaccord your line is open dj hynes canaccord genuity analyst hey thanks guys congrats on the continued momentum here as you think about the evolution to a product suite as you kind of talked about in the prepared remarks how do you envision that impacting the go to market motion i mean should we expect more in terms of kind of bundling and packaging various solutions and i guess what could the implications be on landing asps roy mann co chief executive officer hi thank you it s roy so yeah we see this as a massive go to market for us an additional go to market for us mainly because the need for those tools is separate and an important thing to note is that these are complete stand alone products both forms workforms and canvas and so we expect it to be another addition for different types of customers who may be looking for something else other than a platform such as our work os to join the ecosystem in a separate place and then be exposed to the suite of products and maybe try out other stuff so we definitely see opportunities all around with this approach dj hynes canaccord genuity analyst got it and then a follow up just with respect to kind of your new partnership with kpmg like at what spend level would a partner like kpmg typically start to get involved and i guess do you anticipate that they could bring new customers that start near these levels or is it more about helping you to kind of scale your more mature customers in their use cases roy mann co chief executive officer hey it s roy still so yes so with kpmg it s a special partnership because we see the future together and i feel kpmg we managed to find a way to get into existing practices ok like digital transformations and others and we re very experimenting a lot with like a carbon measurement and a lot of other stuff that i think will be the future for many different practices so i think they see the no code local capabilities we have as a big leverage to solve many big problems and that s where it grew from dj hynes canaccord genuity analyst got it ok thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from the line of derrick wood with cowen and company your line is open derrick wood cowen and company analyst good morning thanks my first question i wanted to touch on the net revenue retention rate a 10 plus cohort up from 119 to 136 that s a 17 increase really impressive so how much of that was improvement in churn and how much of that was just pure expansion and if you looked at the expansion if you think about more viral adoption with better brand awareness or what you guys have done with direct sales and customer success teams i mean which area would you point to having a great impact on it eran zinman co chief executive officer yeah thanks derrick this is eran so basically it s a result of both so we ve both seen less churn with our cohorts and also we see more expansion within existing users the more expansion we can attribute that to our ability to allow larger enterprises to use monday and extend more also product improvement that we introduced and the fact that those companies can use monday across multiple departments so they can expand more and more as they scale the deployment of monday within the company and also tends to be a lot of product improvements that we introduced this year we see all those cohorts having less churn also i think the feature kind of a little bit contributed to that people are able to try the product more and then churn less and kind of have more confidence so a lot of great things that we introduced to the product managed to increase the net dollar retention and as eliran mentioned not only does the net dollar retention itself grew but also the proportion of the 10 plus user population has increased so it s a double kind of increase that we see within our customer base so do great trends that we ve seen and we also see this is going to continue in 2022 derrick wood cowen and company analyst that s very helpful color and maybe eliran a follow up for you on the operating income guide for 2022 obviously you guys and product development r d is going to be a big focus as well as sales and marketing as you invest more in growth but i wanted to unpack that sales and marketing a bit more i mean on the marketing side is there any impacts from idfa that s changing the calculus there and then on the sales side what should we expect kind of continue the headcount growth levels as we saw in 2021 eliran glazer chief financial officer hey derrick so with regard to the idfa this is less of a concern to us it s mostly for the b2c companies we don t see any issue with that in our b2b model with regards to the performance marketing so when you think about our business more than we have a hybrid model just as a reminder we started performance marketing we generate the leads and then there is the salespeople and the customer success and the partners that actually this continued the motion so we are investing in both these categories on one hand continue to invest in performance marketing we have a phenomenal unit economics as you can see by the level of the cash flow by the level of returns and on top of that are bringing additional salespeople to the smb categories to the mid market and to the enterprise and this is a place if you think about the way we plan our headcount growth this year and this is why we said that we are going to accelerate hiring we are front loading expenses in the first quarter and in fiscal year 22 as a whole in order to continue to drive the growth that we are seeing so definitely continue to invest in sales on headcount already increasing the quota bearing significantly also increasing the partners channels in places where we don t have sales people and continue also to expand our customer success management group that is also helping us a lot between you all and supporting the big customers who are becoming more meaningful so investing at all fronts to drive further growth derrick wood cowen and company analyst perfect thank you congrats on a great quarter operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert simmons with d a davidson your line is open robert simmons d a davidson analyst hey guys thanks for taking our questions so i was wondering how much revenue are you expecting from the payment solution in the app marketplace and how much is included in guidance eran zinman co chief executive officer sorry this is eran can you repeat the question please robert simmons d a davidson analyst yeah on the payment solution that you have now in the app marketplace how much revenue how much revenue from that is included in the guidance eran zinman co chief executive officer ok yes so thanks for the question robert so this is basically a new feature that we introduced just recently announced it now as part of the earnings call so it s just early days very insignificant almost none so far and also this year we didn t add this revenue as far as the guidance so again this is for us the beginning of kind of evolution of our marketplace we see more and more developers creating apps within the marketplace already some of them have created their own solution to monetize those apps and we now introduce a way for those developers to easily charge our customers using the enough payment systems which will reduce the friction and allow more developers to charge and build more applications that they can monetize so definitely we re very excited about this but again it s early days and this year it s going to be insignificant as part of our revenue robert simmons d a davidson analyst got it great and then so it looks like both the number of clients and the revenue per client grew quite a bit in the last year how much of the revenue per client growth is coming from kind of seat growth and how much is it coming from other factors besides just the number of paid users roy mann co chief executive officer robert so first of all welcome on board i think this is your first call so when we look at the revenue per client because we have a large and diversified customer base more than 152 000 customers we don t really differentiate between the two but if you want to think about the way the business model works is the combination of what i mentioned earlier we have the new customers and the expansion so there is a certain ratio between the 2 and they basically when we look at the total revenue per client because of the diversity in the client big clients versus small clients the acv is kind of a metric that we look but we don t use as an indicator of our business health derrick wood cowen and company analyst got it great thanks for taking the question guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott berg with needham your line is open john godin needham and company analyst great hey guys this is john godin on for scott berg thanks for taking my question just as far as 2022 goes how should we think about the contribution from the partner channel for this year and how have you seen that kind of evolving over the past couple of years eliran glazer chief financial officer so the partner channel is something that we started very early in the life of monday and we are very proud of it continues to grow quickly as a reminder in places where we don t have the sales people we have 11 offices around the world in latin america in asia pacific in other places in europe we actually have partners they are becoming very meaningful in our contribution of total arr we have more than 150 channel partners globally this is obviously the network with key partner example you can see slack google microsoft salesforce zoom etc but we also continue to hire internally partner channel managers they are becoming also very meaningful in our total headcount so i would say that they are very very significant in our total arr john godin needham and company analyst great and just second on workdocs how are you kind of seeing customers use that functionality the most initially how do you think about quantifying that usage within the broader platform in the near term maybe over the long term as well thanks eran zinman co chief executive officer yeah thanks scott this is eran so basically workdocs we just announced is out of beta we ve made a lot of progress in terms of product innovation we mentioned this earlier but the trend still continues it s one of the fastest building block or feature that we have released with the highest adoption rate more than 60 000 existing accounts already using workdocs and those customers created over 800 000 workdocs to date which they use and engage with so it s a very meaningful part of our platform it becomes it became a meaningful part of what people do with the platform and again the fact that this in terms of retention and usage and revenue we ll see over time but in terms of engagement and usage and value that our customers get from workdocs it s a phenomenal feedback and statistics that we

witherell chairman and chief executive officer thanks tripp good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today by any measure i think 2021 was a very good year for plymouth before i get into the details i want to first thank our entire team in boston as well as the regional offices in columbus memphis and jacksonville for a strong finish to 2021 and for making it possible to report these results i have talked about the next 12 to 18 months as a period of transformation for our company we have an opportunity to continue growing in our markets we have a large percentage of our leases rolling over in a historically strong period of rent growth and we have an opportunity to continue to simplify and strengthen our balance sheet throughout the fourth quarter and to date in the first quarter we have turned those opportunities into reality another recognition that we ve shared as a company was the inclusion in the rmz at the end of november this was a significant milestone for us and should help elevate our visibility within the reit sector it s just a milestone though and we are focused on how we drive growth from here turning to our key operating stats for the quarter we ended up at year end where we had anticipated occupancy was 97 4 cash releasing spreads were 22 1 and 11 1 for the full year with over five million square feet signed during the year for 2021 expirations same store noi on a cash basis was up 7 6 rent collections were 99 9 and core ffo and affo per share were in line with our forecast after factoring in a slightly higher share count in addition to the strong leasing activity we had another record quarter of acquisitions the use of the atm provided us with the capital to fund our completed acquisitions as well as those assumed in our 2022 guidance what we have projected for q1 2022 and early q2 would represent one of our larger starts to the year in recent memory our development program continues to gain momentum with 10 projects currently in various stages of planning and development in four different markets with three of them currently under construction or active development all told we believe these projects will total 1 15 million square feet and represent an investment of approximately 87 million with a resulting yield targeted in the high single digit range in cincinnati at our fisher industrial park we finished installing floors over the open crane pit areas in q4 to create an additional 150 000 square feet at an investment of approximately 4 3 million as of this quarter all of that new space is leased and occupied we have two additional projects currently underway the first project is two separate new buildings totaling almost 330 000 square feet that are under development on additional acreage on the site we re on schedule to break ground with the first by early april and the second building during the summer the second project is a potential third building that could be developed during 2023 at our 7 5 million 70 000 square foot ground up development in portland maine we completed construction of the shell in december and expect to have a certificate of occupancy this quarter half of this building is leased commencing july 1st and we are working on proposals with other prospects for potentially earlier occupancy of the balance of the space we broke ground on a new 13 million 240 000 square foot industrial building in atlanta in q4 and expect to complete construction in q3 of this year there are active proposals being worked with prospects for this building looking to occupy later this year we are under development with another 180 000 square feet on an adjacent site that is likely to begin construction later this year moving to jacksonville there are four buildings in the design phase right now for which we are waiting on final permitting these are all located within two of our existing business parks and will total approximately 175 000 square feet of new space construction should start before this summer and we expect to have these buildings fully leased early to mid 2023 as a reminder the development projects we are currently pursuing are adjacent to existing properties of ours were directly on site all of them are on land we already own and we re included in the original purchase price essentially unlocking value from additional space that was unrealized on our balance sheet we have tightly controlled the size and scope of our new development program so that it complements our acquisitions and market cluster strategy while leveraging the leasing expertise we have within these markets given the amount of investment in projects under construction and projected by year end we do expect this program to temporarily add to our leverage until they are online but we believe the returns more than compensate for that as you ve heard me say before our top priorities with the balance sheet are to ensure that our dividend is well covered that our leverage profile continues to improve and that we have access to multiple sources of capital we did a great job managing those priorities again in 2021 and based on our outlook for improvement in all three areas the board elected to increase our quarterly common stock dividend by 4 8 effective with the first quarter dividend of 2022 even with this increase we continue to have one of the lowest payout ratios in our industry strength of the economy the ongoing challenges to the supply chain and availability of labor continue to hit the headlines every time we look we believe each of these trends is driving the fundamentals within the industrial sector particularly within where we are focused from the first mile to the last mile this is not only the time to own industrial buildings but also the time to own them where we do with strong rent growth at lower relative basis and a team full of real estate operators pen why don t you walk us through our acquisition activity pen white president and chief investment officer thanks jeff good morning everyone in the fourth quarter we closed on 194 5 million of acquisitions totaling 2 9 million square feet across 12 buildings the weighted average initial yield of the acquisitions completed was 6 2 at a weighted average cost of 69 per square foot well below replacement cost this record q4 volume brought our total volume of acquisitions for the full year to 371 million a 52 increase over last year s total this is a testament to the plymouth platform and the talented team members that make the platform work every day we are off to another strong start in 2022 with 22 1 million already closed another 43 million expected to close later this week and 154 million in closings projected by early q2 a couple of fourth quarter transactions i d like to highlight one we acquired a two building two tenant portfolio in st louis in the gateway east submarket totaling 1 1 million square feet for 75 1 million at an in going cap rate of 5 8 near term rollover combined with below market lease rates and a submarket with less than 4 vacancy provides us with the opportunity to sign both tenants to long term leases at current market rates another property we acquired in dayton ohio built just five years ago for 23 5 million or 49 per square foot a single tenant building with over eight years remaining on the lease i d like to say we bought this class a building at class b pricing and add in going cap rate of 6 2 with annual rent increases this accretive acquisition should provide plymouth with additional long term stable cash flow as i mentioned earlier we are off to a strong start for 2022 the competition for industrial properties does remain quite strong as new investment capital both domestic and offshore continues to pour into u s industrial markets which are experiencing low vacancy rates above average rental growth and tenants who are reevaluating their supply chain infrastructures most notably focused on storing or warehousing enough safety stock to ensure rapid delivery to their end customers and consumers but that being said our pipeline remains very robust as we re able to efficiently identify and analyze transactions with attractive return metrics across all of our markets further our deep relationships with brokers our ability to close deals quickly and smoothly and proven track record with multiple seller types often results in us being the preferred buyer we have seen cap rates continued to compress especially with the larger portfolios less so with small to medium sized portfolios and our bread and butter one off transaction deals what i call hitting singles and doubles we re seeing in going cap rates between the high fives and high sixes our deal criteria remains unchanged as we look for the right mix of utilitarian industrial buildings and markets exhibiting positive absorption strong rent growth limited institutional competition and that have the ability for us to efficiently use our regional property management teams to aggressive asset management the properties one of the more important data points we focus on in our markets is projected rental growth analyzing specific submarket growth rates is a key element in our underwriting previously we had mostly underwritten low single digit rent growth on new deals but based on what we re experiencing within our own portfolio we have reason to adjust those expectations to mid to high single digit rent growth over the next few years in fact many of our more recent acquisitions due to significant mark to market deltas pertaining to specific tenants we can expect low double digit rental growth rates one place where this view on rent growth is having an impact is in our ability to pursue new portfolio opportunities while the larger portfolios are transacting in the mid four cap range or lower smaller portfolios should transact around 5 those types much like we discussed last quarter may provide a slightly lower initial yield compared to our average in going cap rates but with a much greater stabilized yield as we drive rents also while most of our acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 for that matter have usually been 90 to 100 leased we will likely see more opportunities in our pipeline that have more vacancy or require near term capex where we can add value through leasing and improving the asset as our pace over the last two quarters and the start to 2022 would indicate we continue to have success in leveraging our concentration in our key industrial markets especially where we have boots on the ground to help source and conduct due diligence for new acquisition opportunities we look forward to reporting our progress next quarter and during the course of the year now i d like to turn it over to jim connolly to walk through the leasing activity and portfolio operations jim connolly executive vice president of asset management good morning at the end of 2021 we had addressed 92 of our leases that expired during the year leases comprised of 5 4 million square feet expired during 2021 including adjustments for acquisitions and early terminations of that amount 2 6 million square feet was renewed 2 4 million square feet was leased to new tenants leaving 385 000 square feet that still needs to be addressed significant progress has been made on leasing this space and many leases are nearing execution in addition we leased 413 000 square feet of space that had been vacant at the start of 2021 during 2021 we saw rental rates increased 11 1 on commencing leases over prior lease rates on a cash basis during q4 rental rate increases were significantly higher at 22 1 portfolio wide occupancy at the end of 2021 was 97 4 up 110 basis points from the end of q3 of the 774 000 square feet of vacancy within our portfolio 82 000 square feet have been leased with tennessee starting in 2022 with another 532 000 square feet categorized as being repositioned at four locations excluding the reposition square footage our occupancy rate would be 98 7 efforts at these locations are showing results with 153 000 square feet leased at the end of 2021 with active prospects for the balance of the reposition vacancy through february 14 we have collected 99 9 of our rents bill during 2021 and 99 2 of the rent for january one small rent deferral was issued during q1 2021 that was fully paid back in december 2021 was a busy year with 140 leases executed related to 2021 expirations and prior vacancies totaling 5 5 million square feet completed by the end of the year an additional 52 leases totaling 2 2 million square feet have been executed for leases expiring after 2021 looking at the current status of the 2022 lease expirations specifically of the 6 1 million square feet scheduled to expire adjusted for acquisitions and early terminations 2 6 million square feet has been leased through february 14 this represents approximately 43 of the 2022 expirations as complete with an 11 5 rental rate increase over expiring rents there was an additional 140 000 square feet of space lease that was vacant prior to 2022 there were seven leases scheduled to expire in 2022 of 200 000 square feet or greater two of these have already been addressed we expect three to renew while the other two are actively being negotiated with solid prospects these numbers exclude the two leases that were terminated early and released in 2021 these results continue to reflect the high level of performance that plymouth asset and property management teams are delivering and show that we are well positioned to meet our leasing and management requirements long into the future at this point i ll turn it over to dan to discuss our financial results dan wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim first i will call your attention to the supplemental information filed earlier which provides more detailed disclosures in addition to those referenced in these prepared remarks looking at our fourth quarter results our key metrics were in line with our full year forecast core ffo was 0 46 up from 0 42 per weighted average common share in units a year ago and 0 43 in the third quarter affo was 0 39 compared with 0 38 a year ago and 0 31 in the third quarter both metrics were up year over year and sequentially on top of an increase in the share and unit counts which demonstrates the continued strength of the portfolio the ability to closely match fund our capital markets activity and the improvement in our cost of capital same store noi excluding early termination income increased 4 4 on a gaap basis with same store noi on a cash basis increasing 7 6 excluding the impacts related to three leases aggregating 900 000 square feet this quarter same store noi brings us to a 2 8 increase for the year to date which was at the high end of our expectations as we look at the balance sheet we have been able to lower our cost of capital with strong execution on the atm program and expanding our unsecured credit facility at attractive terms our debt to total market capitalization was 34 8 at quarter end and net debt to ebitda was 6 6 times both of which were below our targets for the year and benefited from the timing of acquisitions and our atm activities you heard us say before that leveraged is a moment in time and this is certainly one of those as we would expect that the timing of acquisitions and developments in 2022 is having somewhat of an opposite impact as we should operate with slightly higher leverage earlier this year with our net debt and net debt plus preferred likely converging by year end one point to note on this leverage is that we are carrying approximately 11 4 million in investments on the balance sheet at december 31 2021 related to construction and progress associated with approximately 46 7 million in development activity for the projects jeff outlined earlier we have not adjusted our leverage metrics to account for this projected development activity as we bring these projects online they will be a contributor to earnings as well as to net asset value creation as noted in our earnings release and the 10 k subsequent to year end we executed swap agreements on our two unsecured term loans the first one effectively fixed the rate on our 100 million term loan until august 2026 at a maximum rate of 3 24 the second one effectively fixed the rate on our 200 million term loan until february of 2027 at a maximum rate of 3 26 these swaps are baked into our full year guidance we believe given the continued expectation of increase and interest rates that this was the right long term decision to make after factoring in these swaps 95 of our debt is with fixed interest rates at an average of 3 66 and the balance remains floating at a current rate of 1 65 our liquidity position remains strong as we presently have 9 8 million of cash on hand plus an additional 5 million in operating expense escrows and 141 million of capacity on the revolving line of credit now let s turn to our full year 2022 guidance based on the assumptions outlined in our release and supplemental we are expecting year over year growth in core ffo per share of 5 3 to 8 2 i ll briefly touch on several of the underlying assumptions as always the timing of and contributions from acquisitions continue to be a main factor as we continue to add scale in our respective markets after completing 195 million of acquisitions in q4 we closed on an additional 22 million so far in q1 with another 197 million expected to close by early q2 that is a much earlier start to the year than we ve had the past several years in terms of transactions and that is factored into the guidance initial yields is indicated are again based on first year projected noi on an annualized basis for transactions close to date and as pen noted earlier the portfolio transaction should be close to 5 with the balance anticipated to be in the 5 to 6 range we expect another year of strong leasing activity for both renewals and new leases with approximately 4 2 million square feet expiring during the year our same store pool is expected to be a contributor as well with same store noi for the year projected to increase in a range of 3 25 to 4 25 and occupancy to be in the range of 96 5 to 98 g a is up year over year based primarily on the impact of overall compensation for increased headcount reflecting continued growth and market expectations with existing staff an increase stock compensation expense due to the increase in the stock price during the past year as well as higher profession fees as a percentage of revenues g a has continued decline each year and we expect that to continue again this year as noted earlier in my leverage commentary we are expecting higher interest expense year over year due to development activity higher acquisition activity and the impact of fixing rates on our 300 million in term loans a higher weighted average share in unit count from the atm activity now assumes will be at 37 million shares in units on a weighted average basis for the year which is where we are as of today one point worth noting is we are not included in our guidance the conversion of the series b preferred stock to common stock notwithstanding that the conversion threshold for the series b shares has been and continues to be achieved we cannot control the timing of when or if madison might convert their 4 4 million shares or if they would convert their entire position in one transaction or a series of transactions as they are current shareholders and one of our largest for that matter when jeff talks about the importance of the next 12 months to 18 months in the life of plymouth the potential of simplifying our balance sheet with this series b paper working out exactly as intended and the ability to pay off our 51 million of series a preferred stock at a 7 5 coupon in early 2023 are two great examples we re looking forward to being able to take these two series of preferred shares out of our capital stack and i ll turn it back over to jeff jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer thanks dan i want to come back on with one more item of importance and that is to thank dan as many of you know from our announcement in december this is dan s last earnings call as he is stepping down from the cfo position he has been with us since 2014 and i want to personally thank him for everything he s done to get plymouth to this point he s been instrumental in our growth and has created a smooth transition over to anthony as we ve worked on this succession plan over the past year i m also looking forward to him staying on as an advisor to plymouth so we are able to retain his historical knowledge operator we re now ready to take questions questions answers operator our first question today will come from craig mailman with keybanc capital markets please go ahead unknown speaker keybanc capital markets analyst good morning this is on for craig dan thanks for outlining some of the stuff on g a just a quick one as you guys think about sort of how you ve built out the platform how should we expect g a and sort of the investment that you guys make in the platform continue to grow beyond 2022 do you guys think that you ve kind of gotten to a point where you can really achieve the scale that you want or do you think you need to make incremental investments into the platform dan wright executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning and thank you for the question i ll just text real briefly on it and then i ll yield over to jeff i think we ve made great strides and we re have an effective platform to be able to continue to grow expectations would be that as the growth continues certain elements of the overall test structure would increase but at more of the production level if you will as opposed to the senior executive s level jeff jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer yes hey arty appreciate the question on that we have about 13 people right now that are in property management that get baked into the g a there s an offset there that we can you can get into to later about how we handle that but when we have a regional office and we do our own property management the first thing we look for is better service to our clients to our tenants and secondly obviously a savings and so if we put those two together it s a win win for us but the scale it s always just a timing issue you re bringing in people ahead of you can t get behind as a public company so you want to get ahead of it on that but dan answered it we we ve got all the key people we need and it s really just a matter of size adding property management asset management people to manage the assets unknown speaker keybanc capital markets analyst got it thank you and then one more quick one if i could so you guys mentioned that you if i heard this right the 11 5 expected mark to market on leases that you guys have signed that you expect to commence in 2022 is that sort of low double digit low teens kind of a good way to think about how you expect the mark to market on commenced leases to continue through the year jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer yes actually at the beginning of the year is actually we exceeded that a little bit so this numbers should be good unknown speaker keybanc capital markets analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from connor siversky with berenberg please go ahead connor siversky berenberg bank analyst hi everybody good morning thanks for having me on the call i have a broad based question here just kind of thinking out loud as we have this geopolitical situation unfolding over in europe seems the obvious impact may be spiking energy prices for example i mean do you think this has any impact on where you re looking to continue your development pipeline or even within your conversations with tenants and impact on their need for space in the near term jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer hey connor it s jeff this topic has not come up with discussions with our tenants at all i mean we re very active i think in some of the prepared remarks we talked about how our new developments we ve got multiple tours going on proposals going out on those properties so we did we haven t seen any impact on it from that perspective and again from our development we think our development is very focused on land we already own utilities are already on site so we re not taking kind of pioneer risk if you will going out onto the interstate way out building a park bringing in sewer water in a lot of infrastructure so this is development that s very very so called simple for us to execute on so we re going to continue to move forward with the projects that we ve outlined and we re very confident that the demand is there and that we will fill these properties it probably higher rates than we re underwriting connor siversky berenberg bank analyst got it appreciate the color there and then just sticking on development so thinking about the cluster model and apologies if you had mentioned this on the call but do you see the opportunity to purchase more land immediately adjacent to your existing footprint to engage in more of the greenfield projects jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer possibly but remember most of this product that we have is infill product so it s again we re not out in the inter lands right where there s just a lot of developable land so atlanta may be the exclusion but there s a tremendous amount of development in that the cajun area where we are so we always look for that i know we ve made a couple of acquisitions or have some things on a contract now that has additional land that comes with it that we will explore building on but we re always looking for that i just don t think you re going to see a lot of opportunity for us to buy parcels next door down the street that we can just bolt on most of our product is again is in fill connor siversky berenberg bank analyst got it ok thanks for the color jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks operator our next question comes from david rodgers with baird please go ahead david rodgers baird analyst yes good morning everybody pen wanted to start with you just a little bit more on the acquisition pipeline you guys have given guidance obviously just over kind of the first three to four months of the year in terms of acquisition so maybe talk a little bit more about the pipeline what you re seeing because you quoted small cap rates small portfolio cap rates at five and then maybe one offs in the low sixes to high sixes so what is the makeup of that acquisition pipeline today how deep is that and how conservative is the 200 million in the acquisition guide for the year do you think pen white president and chief investment officer yes hey dave now we re pretty confident about in our prepared remarks what we re going to be closing on in the first quarter we typically don t give guidance on acquisitions for the entire year but to the real color here is that our pipeline really its number of been deeper or wider i guess is the best way to put it we re looking at deals that have cap rates in the low fives that i say even some in the high fours and then there s those in the high sixes i mean they re really it s hard to generalize it because cap rates only tell tell a little bit of a story we are obviously focused on in going cap rates cash flow obviously but we re also focused on price per pound and we re very comfortable where our acquisition price per square foot has come in the fourth quarter as well as the overall over the year and that jives very well with our overall investment strategy david rodgers baird analyst thank you and then maybe on the leasing side you have a little more than 3 million square feet it sounds like left to go maybe a third of that renews two thirds of that is new just piecing together your comments earlier curious on how much downtime maybe you ve underwritten in the guidance for the year and how you might be able to overcome some of that what s embedded i guess in that outlook for that remaining kind of three million square feet or so that you have to tackle jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer it s a good question the renewal rate is a little bit higher this year so far so i think it s actually going to probably be the other way around we re going to have more renewals so two thirds of it will renew and maybe one third will be new tenants yes we ve got we had nine large projects this year two of them were done before last quarter with early term the current tenant put new tenants in two other ones have already been leased up and we expect only two of them not to renew and we ve already got replacement for one of them lined up and the other one is got a lot of interest so i don t think there s going to be much downtime a lot of times when tenants are leaving they give us advanced notice and we re able to terminate them early and get the new tenant in there without with overlap so there s no downtime that s that s been something we been doing for the last year and a half david rodgers baird analyst ok thank you for addressing that and i m just going to sneak one more in jeff you mentioned that the option was your partner s option on the preferred b it was under the impression that you guys could force a conversion of that is that not the case jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer we cannot force we can pay it off because it s in the money but we can t force a conversion to stock because of limitations in the agreement to the amount of stock they can own so as we sit here today it s in either or we pay them off for cash or they convert david rodgers baird analyst yes that s helpful thank you operator our next question will come from john kim with bmo capital markets please go ahead john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you first time caller i wanted to ask about funding requirements for the 197 million that you are expected to close on early this year as well as future acquisitions in your guidance you don t have much of a share account increase as you guys noted but you expect us to be funded with an atm or another source jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer so john we already have all the capital allocated for that so between debt and equity that we ve raised and that s why we didn t give out any additional guidance on acquisitions or atm activity so the properties that we ve identified in our release and in this script if you will those are fully funded john kim bmo capital markets analyst with the atm proceeds that you ve done year to date jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer correct john kim bmo capital markets analyst ok and i appreciate you can t or you don t have in your guidance this series b potential conversion but i was just wondering jeff if you could provide some color on what you expect will happen given that that it s already in the money based on your conversations with madison do you expect that something will be filed and announced this year or do you think it could be an event post 2022 jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer right so this my comments will not be based on any conversation and had with madison so that s i ll preface everything with that ok my comments will fact two pieces to my comments the first piece is going to be that next year we can pay them off at the accrual rate so if our stock actually goes down we re going to benefit so we don t want that to happen if not making a prediction here but if our stock goes down we can pay them off next year so that being said if i was madison i would convert this year where the stock price you know where it s in the money and they re in a good position so the reason i will tell you i think they would convert this year is because that s what i would do if i was them is that bridge it for you john kim bmo capital markets analyst yes i mean are you surprised that it hasn t already happened i mean i suppose no one could have known what would happen to share price or reach share prices this year but i m wondering why it hasn t happened yet jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer i can t answer that and i m too old to ever be surprised about too much at this point my life john i m not trying to too silly here but i can t answer why they haven t done it john kim bmo capital markets analyst on the 75 million st louis acquisition i just wanted to clarify is yet is it your anticipation that the tenants will renew at market rents or do you expect to release it and where do you think that would take the yield dan wright executive vice president and chief financial officer so yes we are in negotiations with those tenants so i don t want get too detailed on this but yes they want it they want to stay in place and we re working those rates that s just really all i want to say john kim bmo capital markets analyst and those are 2022 expirations dan wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes they re in the third quarter john kim bmo capital markets analyst ok thanks for color thank you jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator next question comes from anthony hau with truist please go ahead anthony hau truist securities analyst good morning guys what do you think market rank growth will be in 2022 for your target markets pen white president and chief investment officer hey anthony pen here a good question i m not going to go market by market but in general we re looking at a kind of a mid single digits again kind of depending on the market we ve seen that in the last 12 months to 18 months we re seeing it much better than that in our own portfolio in our existing assets within those markets so i think we can defend that mid single digit growth projection pretty well and maybe we ll be surprised anthony hau truist securities analyst got it and we keep hearing that lot supply will be coming online in 2022 and 2023 for your target markets especially columbus and indiana can you give us an overview on where supply is today for your markets and sub markets jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer yes and there is new supply coming on but you can also make the argument that that it s still not keeping up with demand i mean if you look at the numbers the overall leasing numbers for 2021 and i mean across the board coast to coast over 430 million square feet were absorbed last year still didn t keep up with a demand that s an 80 increase over 2020 you had rental rates now that on average exceed exceeded 9 per square foot for the first time ever so the demand is there we re seeing it in all markets not just the ones that that we happen to be in but all that being said we really focus on acquiring existing properties we own a lot of class b properties as our rental rates are 9 our average rental rate across the board is just over 4 so there s a significant delta between the national average and what our average is and that i think that benefits us in many ways so most of our tenants never say never but highly unlikely that they re going to move from one of our buildings into a brand new class a 40 foot clear property that is opens its doors right down the street tomorrow charging 8 a square foot it just haven t seen it happen i don t know if we will but that s well we obviously monitor it because we hope these rental rates for brand new product keep going north that only helps us anthony hau truist securities analyst got it and one last question for me what is the mark to market on the portfolio today can you share that on a gaap and cash basis pen white president and chief investment officer on a cash basis we ve got to measure out at 12 5 through february 14th we had been 11 5 increase on our rents it s been if we add in what s happened since then it s actually quite a bit higher so there s plenty of room to grow jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer and we don t typically disclose gaap basis anthony hau truist securities analyst got it thanks guys jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jeff witherell for any closing remarks jeff witherell chairman and chief executive officer

canada s housing bubble along with increasing sale and rental prices has led to calls for building more housing however the housing crisis will not be solved by building more of the same like condos and suburban homes for single families but alternatives to housing as commodity could offer a partial solution to the bubble and housing inequality more broadly one underlying reason for calls for more housing supply is the notion of private property and its historical connection to citizenship early canadian legislation divided and granted land to white settlers as private property to encourage occupation another reason is financial home ownership is seen as a means of wealth accumulation and government policies and actions like low mortgage interest rates fuel this vision read more housing is both a human right and a profitable asset and that s the problem neoliberalization since the 1980s and financialization since the 2000s have created the current conditions of housing

even more difficult along with issues of race the pandemic has spotlighted another crucial housing inequality issue homelessness the issue has been exacerbated by the pandemic as people experiencing homelessness avoided shelters because of overcrowding and fears of contracting the virus the summers of 2020 and 2021 were marked not only by outcries about housing prices but also by the struggles of homeless people who claimed their rights to be housed on public spaces through tent encampments the housing crisis is affecting canadians across the income spectrum driving up costs and making it out of reach for some and more difficult for others i experienced the heated market first hand last summer when i was outbid on multiple homes i have moved five times in the past decade even while having steady and secure employment as a professor and being part of a dual income family housing cost me not only a good portion of my income but also considerable time this is a standard story but why should it be architecture and decommodified housing my experiences with the housing market motivated me to study the architectural history of a number of decommodified housing options conceived at the end of the 1970s that are still in operation in providence r i and in montreal my paper on montreal cases called empowerment through design housing cooperatives for women in montreal will be published in may the projects i studied had benefited from a shift in national housing policy around 1973 when governments moved from direct supply in the form of public housing projects to funding non profit and for profit suppliers of low income housing in the united states and non profits and co ops in canada in both contexts i noted that having access to affordable housing adequate space public services and schools allowed residents to invest in other areas of their lives and in their families it helped a lot if the architectural designs were attuned to the residents lives and needs in apartment layouts the providence based women s development corporation provided eat in kitchens comfortably large enough for children to study and play in while working parents prepare dinner in addition to a separate more formal living room along with lots of storage space the plans came about after participatory design workshops with future users who were single mothers the history of co op housing canada has had many experiments in collective ownership and decommodified housing co op housing is one of the better know experiments the first generation of co ops were intended for private property acquisition members of these building co operatives would not only contribute payments but also sweat equity where households would provide construction labour to bring down the costs the building co op would typically dissolve once the buildings were ready for occupation and titles were distributed to the owners in denser urban areas such as montreal higher land prices and the inability of families to contribute sweat equity made such projects more difficult to realize through the 1960s the co op sector moved away from a model of private property to one of social property to continuing co operatives continuing co operatives offered their members control over their living conditions and environments in dense areas such as in montreal s urban core co ops such as milton park which remains one of the largest renovated housing co op developments in north america with 616 co op units organized in 15 distinct co ops have helped renovate existing housing stock and contributed to historic preservation and inner city regeneration through collective ownership such co ops helped curb appreciation of property values from the mid 1980s the canadian government started withdrawing its support and by 1992 had cancelled its co op housing programs yet co ops are still being built with provincial and municipal funding schemes and new challenges like increased inner city land prices alternative housing solutions from the transformation of single room occupancy sro hotels into affordable apartments for young people sro revitalization in vancouver to the conversion of alexandra park public housing to the atkinson housing cooperative in toronto to cohabitat in quebec city there are ongoing efforts to provide alternative housing and living models across canada beyond our borders there are also examples from around the world such as vienna austria where government interventions serve a range of income groups not just low income people they have achieved this through high levels of government support and legislative frameworks that support a combination of non profit and limited profit housing co operatives which invest profits back into housing if housing is indeed a right could it not be re imagined like health care or education regardless of one s income one can choose to send their children to the public school system and theoretically access the same resources similarly one can also choose to use publicly funded health care services because they are better and trustworthy regardless of income societal investment in housing would decommodify a significant portion of the housing market and could help create a more equitable diverse and happy future society for all of us we can move beyond our current housing crisis and engage in collective

non gaap financial measure in this press release constant currency calculations show reported current period revenues as if the foreign exchange rates remain the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period pulmonx uses results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate its performance pulmonx calculates constant currency by calculating current year results using foreign currency exchange rates from the applicable comparable period in the prior year pulmonx generally refers to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange or being on a constant currency basis reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure is set forth in the tables below pulmonx believes the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand its operating results and evaluate its performance in comparison to prior periods pulmonx generally uses constant currency to facilitate management s financial and operational decision making including evaluation of pulmonx s historical operating results non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company s operations that when viewed with gaap results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting pulmonx s business this non gaap financial measure should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap because non gaap financial measures exclude the effect of items that increase or decrease the company s reported results of operations management strongly encourages investors to review when they become available the company s

meanwhile centrist politician and retired general benny gantz a member of israel s war cabinet and former defense minister said that we will build a regional coalition and exact the price from iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us israel and its allies intercepted the vast majority of hundreds of drones and missiles launched by iran overnight loud explosions and flashes of light could be seen in the sky above many parts of israel in the early morning hours of april 14 as the country s air defenses tried to shoot down incoming drones and missiles that iran launched just hours after

than 200 drones and missiles including more than 10 cruise missiles were intercepted before impact the iranian attack was foiled israeli military spokesman rear admiral daniel hagari said early on

forces took part in shooting down the incoming projectiles intercepting some over the iraq syria border area as they made their way toward israel iranian president ebrahim raisi warned israel against reckless behavior following the strike saying tehran s response to retaliation would be decisive and much stronger iran s military earlier said its strikes had achieved all its objectives and been completed successfully iranian armed forces chief of staff major general mohammad bagheri speaking on state television warned israel not to retaliate saying tehran s response will be much larger than tonight s military action he also said u s assets would be targeted if washington assisted israeli in any retaliation our operations are over and we have no intention to continue them bagheri said the united states had contact with iran through swiss intermediaries both before and after tehran s mass drone and missile attack on israeli territory overnight a senior biden administration official said on april 14 the official declined to provide details on the contact saying only that washington and iran had a series of direct communications through the swiss channel asked about comments by iran s foreign minister that tehran had given regional countries 72 hours notice of the attacks the official said that was not true they did not give a notification the official said iran informed turkey in advance of its planned operation against israel a turkish diplomatic source told reuters on april 14 adding that washington conveyed to iran via ankara that its operation must be within certain limits earlier iranian foreign minister hossein amir abdollahian said tehran s regional allies were informed about its aerial attacks on israel in advance we naturally informed our friends in regional countries 72 hours before the operation that iran s response in the form of a legitimate defense is definite and certain he said without specifying which regional allies israel called on the united nations security council to convene an emergency session in new york on april 14 to discuss the attack which israeli un ambassador gilad erdan described in a post on x as a serious threat to global peace and security u s president joe biden on april 14 convened g7 allies to discuss the situation in the middle east and coordinate a response with the group reiterating support for israel biden also

white house national security council spokesman john kirby told nbc tv on april 14 that we don t want to see this escalate we re not looking for a wider war with iran other western countries also condemned the attack with france warning that iran is risking a potential military escalation britain described the attack as reckless while germany called on iran to stop it immediately european

bloc s foreign policy chief josep borrell said following the iranian attacks against israel i have called an extraordinary meeting of eu foreign affairs ministers borrell wrote on x formerly twitter our objective is to contribute to de escalation and security of the region iran s foreign ministry on april 14 meanwhile summoned the ambassadors of britain france and germany to question what it referred to as their irresponsible stance regarding tehran s strikes on israel the semiofficial iranian labour news agency reported tehran accused the three countries of double standards as they opposed earlier this month a russian drafted un security council statement that would have condemned israel s attack on iran s embassy compound the russian foreign ministry issued a statement calling on all sides to show restraint we are counting on the regional states to solve existing problems with political and diplomatic means it said turkey does not want further escalation of tension in the region after iran s drone and missile attack against israel foreign minister hakan fidan told his iranian counterpart in a phone call on april 14 pope francis speaking to pilgrims on st peter s square in rome made a heartfelt appeal for a halt to any action that could fuel a spiral of violence that could lead to a wider conflict israel said early on april 14 that it had reopened its airspace for commercial traffic and that airports had resumed operations the intelligence directorate of iran s islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc on april 14 warned citizens against posting pro israeli sentiments on social media iranian state media reported israel and iran have been bitter enemies for decades but this was the first direct attack by one on the other s soil instead of through proxy forces or by targeting each other s assets in third countries so far we ve intercepted the vast majority of incoming missiles hagari said of the attack launched by the irgc in what it said was retaliation for a deadly april 1 drone strike thought to be carried out by israel on iran s consulate in damascus syria the launch came amid heightened tensions between iran and the west over the continuing war in the gaza strip and the strike in syria iran called the attack which tehran named operation honest response on israel a response to the zionist regime s aggression against our diplomatic premises in damascus however iran also appeared to be taking a cautious approach to keep the strikes from broadening conflict in the region with its mission to the united nations saying that the matter can be deemed concluded the iranian attack was immediately condemned by many governments around the world while united nations secretary general antonio guterres said he was deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region wide escalation the middle east is on the brink now is the time to defuse and de escalate guterres told a security council meeting called on april 14 earlier on april 13 iranian state media reported that irgc forces seized a container ship near the strait of hormuz claiming the vessel was linked to israel following that event israel said it was putting its military on high alert and canceling school activities on concerns of a possible attack it accused iran of piracy and said tehran will bear the consequences of escalating tensions

closely with the relevant authorities to ensure their well being and safe return of the vessel israel s retaliatory war in gaza was sparked by a raid on israeli territory carried out by hamas which rules gaza and is designated as a terrorist group by the united states and european union on october 7 the raid left 1 200 people dead and hundreds of people were taken hostage the ensuing israeli invasion of the gaza strip aimed at destroying hamas has killed more than 33 000 palestinians according to the palestinian territory s hamas run health ministry since the war began tehran has openly supported militant groups and proxies targeting israel that are part of iran s axis of resistance against israel and the west leading to concerns of a broader middle east conflict involving archenemies iran and israel the security firm ambrey said late on april 13 that yemen s huthi rebels had also launched multiple drones at israel in coordination with iran in addition to strikes launched against israel by iranian proxy lebanese hizballah the iranian backed huthis have attacked israeli territory as well as international and israeli shipping in the red sea on april 14 israeli

as part of a busy meeting tuesday night the burlington vermont city council voted to restrict short term rentals public comments focused on a proposal to revise the city s short term rental ordinance vermont short term rental alliance member julia marks was among the majority expressing opposition to the measure our assessment is that this highly restrictive ordinance will cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue and economic activity and diminish the amount of capital investment being added to burlington s aging housing structures from the beginning our primary recommendations toward regulating short term rentals have been to implement a registration and monitoring system first marks continued it is disappointing that this does not seem to be the direction the council s going to take banning short term rentals will be ineffective towards the goal of creating more housing south district democrat joan shannon says the intent of the resolution is to preserve the city s long term housing and restore unpermitted illegal short term rental units to the housing stock the main requirements are that your short term rentals have to be within your primary residence that you can t rent more than three rooms and you have to register the property shannon explained the amendment that was offered with my motion also allows for a short term rental in a duplex or multi unit building where you have a section eight rental you may then offset that section eight rental with one short term rental mayor miro weinberger a democrat said the city needs stricter short term rental regulations but he threatened a possible veto if amendments failed the unamended version of the ordinance would be one of the most restrictive short term rental ordinances in the country it goes too far and is too intrusive and i do believe it will have significant negative community and economic consequences as written it s going to be very challenging for me to sign off on an unamended version of this ordinance two amendments failed on 6 6 votes the council then passed the short term rental restriction ordinance on an 8 4 vote city leaders also decided not to extend an indoor mask mandate that expires on march 3rd weinberger s office announced last week that the first and only director of its racial equity inclusion and belonging department would leave her position on march 10th to pursue other opportunities during city council general affairs reports progressive council president max tracy who ran against mayor weinberger last year implied the mayor is to blame for her departure this is just a tremendous loss for our city what we re hearing and what actually happened there s a significant discrepancy doing this kind of work is not easy it s unfortunate that we ve come to find out and we know that this work was made more difficult by the obstruction she experienced during her time working in and with this administration tracy is not seeking re election on town meeting day next month

canada s housing bubble along with increasing sale and rental prices has led to calls for building more housing however the housing crisis will not be solved by building more of the same like condos and suburban homes for single families but alternatives to housing as commodity could offer a partial solution to the bubble and housing inequality more broadly one underlying reason for calls for more housing supply is the notion of private property and its historical connection to citizenship early canadian legislation divided and granted land to white settlers as private property to encourage occupation another reason is financial home ownership is seen as a means of wealth accumulation and government policies and actions like low mortgage interest rates fuel this vision read more housing is both a human right and a profitable asset and that s the problem neoliberalization since the 1980s and financialization since the 2000s have created the current conditions of housing inequality in canadian cities and beyond spotlight on housing inequality people lacking intergenerational wealth are more likely to be newcomers racialized or marginalized making accessing housing even more difficult along with issues of race the pandemic has spotlighted another crucial housing inequality issue homelessness the issue has been exacerbated by the pandemic as people experiencing homelessness avoided shelters because of overcrowding and fears of contracting the virus the summers of 2020 and 2021 were marked not only by outcries about housing prices but also by the struggles of homeless people who claimed their rights to be housed on public spaces through tent encampments the housing crisis is affecting canadians across the income spectrum driving up costs and making it out of reach for some and more difficult for others i experienced the heated market first hand last summer when i was outbid on multiple homes i have moved five times in the past decade even while having steady and secure employment as a professor and being part of a dual income family housing cost me not only a good portion of my income but also considerable time this is a standard story but why should it be architecture and decommodified housing my experiences with the housing market motivated me to study the architectural history of a number of decommodified housing options conceived at the end of the 1970s that are still in operation in providence r i and in montreal my paper on montreal cases called empowerment through design housing cooperatives for women in montreal will be published in may the projects i studied had benefited from a shift in national housing policy around 1973 when governments moved from direct supply in the form of public housing projects to funding non profit and for profit suppliers of low income housing in the united states and non profits and co ops in canada in both contexts i noted that having access to affordable housing adequate space public services and schools allowed residents to invest in other areas of their lives and in their families it helped a lot if the architectural designs were attuned to the residents lives and needs in apartment layouts the providence based women s development corporation provided eat in kitchens comfortably large enough for children to study and play in while working parents prepare dinner in addition to a separate more formal living room along with lots of storage space the plans came about after participatory design workshops with future users who were single mothers the history of co op housing canada has had many experiments in collective ownership and decommodified housing co op housing is one of the better know experiments the first generation of co ops were intended for private property acquisition members of these building co operatives would not only contribute payments but also sweat equity where households would provide construction labour to bring down the costs the building co op would typically dissolve once the buildings were ready for occupation and titles were distributed to the owners in denser urban areas such as montreal higher land prices and the inability of families to contribute sweat equity made such projects more difficult to realize through the 1960s the co op sector moved away from a model of private property to one of social property to continuing co operatives continuing co operatives offered their members control over their living conditions and environments in dense areas such as in montreal s urban core co ops such as milton park which remains one of the largest renovated housing co op developments in north america with 616 co op units organized in 15 distinct co ops have helped renovate existing housing stock and contributed to historic preservation and inner city regeneration through collective ownership such co ops helped curb appreciation of property values from the mid 1980s the canadian government started withdrawing its support and by 1992 had cancelled its co op housing programs yet co ops are still being built with provincial and municipal funding schemes and new challenges like increased inner city land prices alternative housing solutions from the transformation of single room occupancy sro hotels into affordable apartments for young people sro revitalization in vancouver to the conversion of alexandra park public housing to the atkinson housing cooperative in toronto to cohabitat in quebec city there are ongoing efforts to provide alternative housing and living models across canada beyond our borders there are also examples from around the world such as vienna austria where government interventions serve a range of income groups not just low income people they have achieved this through high levels of government support and legislative frameworks that support a combination of non profit and limited profit housing co operatives which invest profits back into housing if housing is indeed a right could it not be re imagined like health care or education regardless of one s income one can choose to send their children to the public school system and theoretically access the same resources similarly one can also choose to use publicly funded health care services because they are better and trustworthy regardless of income societal investment in housing would decommodify a significant portion of the housing market and could help create a more equitable diverse and happy future society for all of us we can move beyond our current housing crisis and engage in collective social dreaming for new possible housing futures author ipek tureli associate professor of architecture canada research chair mcgill university

medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announces that the first patient has been successfully dosed in the phase 1 first in human clinical trial of its proprietary cd73 antibody development code ibi325 in patients with advanced solid tumor the open label dose escalation phase 1a 1b study nct05119998 will evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of ibi325 as a single agent and in combination with sintilimab in patients with advanced solid tumors the recommended dose for further clinical studies will also be determined cd73 is an ecto enzyme expressed on stromal cells and tumors that converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine adenosine binds adenosine a2a anda2b receptors on immune cells and inhibits immune responses directed against tumors ibi325 as a differentiated humanized antibody against cd73 is expected to relief the immunosuppressive tumor micro environment and to work in combination with other cancer therapies such as pd 1 or pd l1 antibodies a complete inhibition to cd73 both soluble and on cell surface has been well demonstrated in preclinical studies and the anti tumor activities of ibi325 were observed in various tumor models professor jinming yu member of the chinese academy of engineering and president of shandong cancer hospital institute stated cd73 is one of the most important targets in the adenosine pathway preclinical studies and preliminary clinical data from drugs in the same class has demonstrated the modulation effect of anti cd73 in immune microenvironment this new clinical trial will further evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of ibi325 alone and in combination with anti pd 1 antibody and other immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced tumors our preclinical data suggested that ibi325 could completely inhibit the activity of cd73 molecule with no hook effect compared with the other candidates in the same class an outstanding synergistic effect of combination with ibi325 and sintilimab was also demonstrated said dr zhou hui senior vp of innovent ibi325 has the potential to become

menafn globenewswire nasdaq toronto feb 23 2022 globe newswire hudbay minerals inc hudbay or the company tsx nyse hbm today released its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and annual production and cost guidance all amounts are in u s dollars unless otherwise noted fourth quarter and full year operating and financial results consolidated copper production of 99 470 tonnes and consolidated gold production of 193 783 ounces increased by 4 and 55 respectively in 2021 as compared to 2020 achieved 2021 consolidated copper gold and silver production guidance while zinc production fell short of the 2021 guidance range peru copper production met 2021 guidance with strong operating performance in the fourth quarter aided by the continued ramp up of pampacancha manitoba zinc production was below 2021 guidance primarily due to higher dilution and mine plan limitations at the 777 mine as it approaches closure record quarterly consolidated gold production of 64 159 ounces in the fourth quarter an increase of 18 compared to the third quarter of 2021 due to higher grades at pampacancha and the commissioning of the new britannia mill generated record quarterly revenue of 425 2 million operating cash flow before change in non cash working capital was 156 9 million and adjusted ebitdai was 180 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to higher realized base metals prices and higher gold and copper sales volumes partially offset by lower zinc sales volumes full year consolidated cash cost and sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi of 0 74 and 2 07 respectively achieved 2021 guidance as inflationary cost pressures were offset by strong by product credits consolidated cash cost and sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi for the fourth quarter of 2021 were 0 51 and 1 95 respectively a decrease of 18 and an increase of 1 respectively compared to the third quarter of 2021 fourth quarter net loss and loss per share were 10 5 million and 0 04 respectively after adjusting for an impairment charge related to a revaluation of our flin flon environmental obligation due to declining long term discount rates amongst other items fourth quarter adjusted net earningsi per share was 0 13 executing on growth initiatives new britannia achieved commercial production on november 30 2021 december mill throughput averaged 1 200 tonnes per day with gold and silver recoveries in line with metallurgical models throughput and recoveries are expected to achieve design rates in the second quarter of 2022 published an initial mineral resource estimate for copper world on december 15 2021 which contained a higher grade near surface zone that has the potential to be mined earlier in the mine life and is composed of both sulphide and oxide mineralogy the company remains on track to complete a preliminary economic assessment of copper world in the first half of 2022 results from the constancia norte underground scoping study are expected to be incorporated into the annual mineral reserve and resource update for constancia in march 2022 commenced a winter drilling program in manitoba in january 2022 to test high priority targets near lalor and 1901 for potential reserve and resource expansion and support the completion of a preliminary economic assessment of the flin flon tailings reprocessing opportunity 2021 was a year of execution for hudbay as we invested approximately 250 million in our brownfield growth projects at pampacancha and new britannia said peter kukielski president and chief executive officer we began to see increased cash flows from these short payback high return investments in the fourth quarter and we are now at an inflection point where we anticipate meaningful copper and gold production growth along with significant ebitda and cash flow growth 2022 will be a year in which we start to reap the rewards from our disciplined growth strategy while we advance our high quality pipeline of copper growth assets including our newly discovered copper world project in arizona which we believe will generate significant value 2022 annual guidance and outlook consolidated copper production is forecast to increase by 17 to 116 000ii tonnes in 2022 and by 34 to 133 500ii tonnes in 2024 compared to 2021 with higher copper grades expected from the pampacancha deposit in peru consolidated gold production is forecast to increase by 28 to 247 500ii ounces in 2022 and by 59 to 307 500ii ounces in 2024 compared to 2021 due to higher production from the new britannia mill and pampacancha introduced 2022 cash cost guidance by business unit with peru cash cost of 1 10 to 1 40 per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi and manitoba cash cost of 300 to 550 per ounce of gold produced net of by product creditsi 2022 unit operating costs are expected to increase by approximately 7 ii in peru and 15 ii in manitoba compared to 2021 as a result of expected higher input costs due to industry wide inflation in each region and the transition of operations in manitoba consolidated cash cost guidance of 0 60 to 1 05 and consolidated sustaining cash cost guidance of 1 60 to 2 25 in each case per pound of copper produced net of by product credits is expected in 2022 total capital expenditures are expected to decline by 17 year over year as major growth investment programs in peru and manitoba were completed in 2021 and lower sustaining capital spending is expected in peru offset by higher growth spending on technical and economic studies for copper world exploration spending of approximately 65 0 million in 2022 reflects plans to continue drilling activities at copper world and test promising targets in peru manitoba nevada and chile summary of fourth quarter results consolidated copper production in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 28 198 tonnes a 21 increase compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher throughput and copper grades in peru consolidated gold production was 64 159 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2021 another quarterly record for hudbay and an increase of 18 versus the third quarter primarily due to higher gold production in snow lake with the commissioning of the new britannia mill in the fourth quarter consolidated zinc production in the quarter increased by 11 versus the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher zinc grades at 777 and lalor consolidated silver production in the fourth quarter increased by 18 compared to the third quarter as higher grades and recoveries in manitoba offset lower grades in peru in the fourth quarter of 2021 consolidated cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi was 0 51 compared to 0 62 in the third quarter of 2021 this 18 decrease was mainly a result of higher copper production and higher gold by product revenue sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi slightly decreased to 1 95 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 1 97 in the third quarter primarily due to the same factors affecting cash cost offset by higher sustaining capital expenditures and royalties operating cash flow before change in non cash working capital was 156 9 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 reflecting an increase of 53 4 million compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily the result of higher realized base metal prices and higher gold and copper sales volumes net loss and net loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 10 5 million and 0 04 respectively compared to a net loss and net loss per share of 170 4 million and 0 65 respectively in the third quarter of 2021 fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by a revaluation of the environmental obligation due to lower long term discount rates since the middle of the year and a corresponding increase to flin flon s property plant and equipment pp e as the closure of the 777 mine and flin flon operations is expected to commence within several months an impairment charge was made to pp e resulting in a loss of 46 2 million the quarterly financial results were also negatively impacted by 13 3 million in mark to market net losses arising from the revaluation of the gold prepayment liability revaluation of certain other financial instruments share based compensation and a 3 4 million flin flon restructuring charge adjusted net earningsi and adjusted net earnings per sharei in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 32 7 million and 0 13 per share respectively after adjusting for the impairment charge related to the revaluation of the environmental obligation in flin flon among other items this compares to adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share of 0 9 million and 0 00 per share in the third quarter of 2021 which were recalculated as a result of the company s year end 2021 tax provision calculation review see non ifrs financial performance measures fourth quarter adjusted ebitdai increased to 180 3 million compared to 119 3 million in the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher copper and gold sales volumes and higher realized prices partially offset by higher exploration and selling and administrative expenses as at december 31 2021 hudbay s liquidity includes 271 0 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as undrawn availability of 346 9 million under its revolving credit facilities the company s liquidity position was further enhanced in october 2021 through the renegotiation of its credit facilities to increase available borrowings to 450 0 million and extend the maturity to 2025 summary of full year results on a consolidated basis hudbay s copper gold and silver production met 2021 guidance however production of zinc and molybdenum fell short of the 2021 guidance ranges production of gold in peru exceeded the top end of the guidance range due to strong gold grades from pampacancha production of gold and silver in manitoba fell below the 2021 guidance range primarily due to higher than expected grade dilution at the 777 mine during the fourth quarter and prioritizing base metal rich zones in the fourth quarter at lalor while deferring some gold rich ore for future processing at new britannia to achieve higher gold recoveries zinc production was impacted by higher dilution and mine plan limitations as the 777 mine approaches the end of life consolidated cash costs per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi for 2021 was 0 74 and consolidated sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi for 2021 was 2 07 in line with the company s 2021 guidance range operating cash flow before change in non cash working capital increased to 483 9 million from 241 9 million in 2020 the increase is the result of higher realized base metal and molybdenum prices and higher sales volumes of gold and copper partially offset by lower zinc sales volumes net loss and loss per share for 2021 were 244 4 million and 0 93 respectively compared to a net loss and loss per share of 144 6 million and 0 55 respectively in 2020 contributing to the 2021 net loss was an impairment charge of 193 5 million related to an updated closure plan reflecting higher estimates for closure activities in flin flon full year results were also negatively impacted by charges related to the refinancing of the 2025 senior notes including a write off of the non cash embedded derivative of 49 8 million connected with the exercise of

19 health statistics throughout 2021 peru operations did not encounter any major covid 19 interruptions during the year however with the recent emergence of the omicron variant in peru the company has continued to maintain stringent covid 19 measures and controls to ensure the safety of hudbay s workforce and this has contributed to elevated unit operating costs during the fourth quarter of 2021 the constancia operations produced 22 856 tonnes of copper 17 917 ounces of gold 578 140 ounces of silver and 275 tonnes of molybdenum copper production was 26 higher than the third quarter due to an increase in throughput and recovery at both constancia and pampacancha gold and silver production increased by 2 and 11 respectively due to the increased throughput and higher grades this was another record quarter for gold production in peru full year 2021 copper production increased by 6 year over year to 77 813 tonnes within the annual guidance range full year 2021 gold production increased by 306 year over year to 50 306 ounces and exceeded the 2021 guidance range due to increased throughput higher grades from pampacancha and higher gold recoveries full year 2021 production guidance was met for all metals except molybdenum which was in line with the mine plan published in march 2021 total ore mined during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by 19 from the third quarter of 2021 as mining levels were optimized for mill throughput ore mined at pampacancha in 2021 was 5 1 million tonnes exceeding the four million tonne threshold required to receive an additional 4 million deposit from wheaton precious metals under the amended constancia streaming agreement the proceeds of this deposit were received in december 2021 and were accounted for as an increase in the deferred revenue balance ore milled during the fourth quarter of 2021 was 15 higher than the previous quarter due to a scheduled semi annual mill maintenance program affecting third quarter ore milled milled grades for copper were higher than the third quarter due to higher grades from the constancia pit milled grades for gold were consistent with the most recent quarter while milled silver grades were lower but consistent with the mine plan copper recoveries in the fourth quarter increased over the third quarter of 2021 due to lower oxide levels in the constancia ore recoveries of gold in the fourth quarter of 2021 were lower than the third quarter due to variability of the pampacancha volume being treated and the increased presence of zinc while silver recoveries slightly increased compared to the third quarter due to variable metallurgical characteristics of the earlier ores from pampacancha and slightly lower silver head grades combined mine mill and g a unit operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 10 47 per tonne a 10 improvement versus the third quarter of 2021 covid related costs in peru were 4 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 combined unit operating costs in the fourth quarter were 9 96 per tonne excluding these covid related costs full year combined unit operating costs were 20 higher than the same period in 2020 due to inflationary pressures on consumables and

news release during the fourth quarter of 2021 manitoba operations produced 5 342 tonnes of copper 46 242 ounces of gold 321 573 ounces of silver and 23 207 tonnes of zinc copper production was relatively in line as compared to the third quarter and gold and silver production increased by 11 and 33 respectively due to the ramp up at new britannia full year copper production achieved 2021 guidance however zinc gold and silver production for the year fell short of the company s guidance ranges zinc production was predominantly impacted by higher than planned dilution at the 777 mine as it nears the end of life gold and silver production were below guidance due to higher dilution at the 777 mine in the fourth quarter and the deferral of some higher gold content ore for future processing at new britannia to achieve higher gold recoveries during the fourth quarter of 2021 the new britannia mill continued to ramp up with the flotation circuit starting in october new britannia processed 109 242 tonnes of ore during the fourth quarter and achieved commercial production in november triggering the start of depreciation for the mill in december new britannia throughput averaged 1 200 tonnes per day with gold and silver recoveries in line with the metallurgical model a number of optimization initiatives are underway to improve the mechanical availability of grinding leaching and tailings circuits it is anticipated that the throughput and recoveries will achieve full design rates in the second quarter of 2022 lalor production processes to separate gold and base metal ores are now fully established to optimally provide feed for both the new britannia and stall mills at the end of 2021 snow lake ore stockpiles were at normalized levels with approximately 26 000 tonnes of gold ore and approximately 24 000 tonnes of base metal ore on surface a production ramp up strategy to achieve 5 300 tonnes per day at lalor by the end of 2022 is underway that includes advancing development for new mining fronts additions to the mine equipment fleet transition of workforce from the 777 mine upon closure and expansion of change house and office facilities the 777 mine is within months of closure and the focus continues to be on mining out the remaining reserves by completing the necessary ground rehabilitation to access remnant and pillar stoping blocks challenging ground conditions have caused delays in the production sequence and resulted in higher dilution than planned these challenges are expected to continue until the end of mine life in june 2022 pre closure activities are underway in mined out areas to decommission stationary equipment of value for redeployment at lalor although there was less feed to the stall concentrator in the fourth quarter as gold ore was directed to new britannia the combined snow lake mills processed a significantly higher volume of ore in the fourth quarter of 2021 and stall recoveries were consistent with the metallurgical model for the head grades delivered new britannia recoveries continued ramping up during the fourth quarter the flin flon concentrator consumed the available ore feed from the 777 mine in the fourth quarter of 2021 and recoveries were consistent with the metallurgical model for the head grades delivered combined unit operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by 14 compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher milling costs in snow lake with the ramp up of the new britannia mill in the quarter partially offset by higher tonnes processed full year combined mine mill and g a unit operating costs were 17 higher than the prior year due to the same factors as the fourth quarter variances full year combined unit operating cost was within the 2021 guidance range manitoba s cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product credits in the fourth quarter of 2021 was negative 2 77 lower than the third quarter primarily due to higher by product credits as gold revenues increased offsetting operating cost increases as noted above manitoba s sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product credits in the fourth quarter of 2021 was negative 0 23 lower than the 0 75 achieved in the third quarter due to the same factors affecting cash costs starting in the first quarter of 2022 the company intends to disclose cash cost per ounce of gold produced net of by product credits as gold revenue grows to become the most significant contributor to total manitoba revenue for the foreseeable future covid 19 business update hudbay is maintaining covid 19 measures and controls to ensure the safety of its workforce partners and communities this has contributed to increased operating costs beyond levels initially budgeted for 2021 despite the maintenance of these stringent measures the company continues to experience intermittent operational supply chain travel labour and shipping disruptions with periodic waves of covid 19 cases new britannia commercial production achieved the construction of a new copper flotation facility at new britannia was completed in october 2021 followed by a brief commissioning period that was completed ahead of schedule the new britannia mill achieved commercial production on november 30 2021 after reaching the required recoveries and throughput in the copper and gold circuits the ramp up of throughput recoveries and metal production at new britannia achieved best in class timelines as represented by widely recognized ramp up curves the new britannia mill is expected to average 1 500 tonnes per day in 2022 with continued ramp up activities and rod mill liner maintenance scheduled during the first quarter full design throughput rates and recoveries are expected to be achieved in the second quarter of 2022 a mere six months after commissioning average annual gold production from lalor and the snow lake operations is expected to increase to over 180 000 ounces at an average cash cost and sustaining cash cost net of by product credits of 412 and 788 per ounce of gold respectively during the first six full years of new britannia s operation advancing the copper world discovery on december 15 2021 hudbay released a national instrument 43 101 ni 43 101 initial mineral resource estimate for the recently discovered copper world deposits in arizona the 100 owned copper world project is located in close proximity to the 100 owned rosemont deposit with mineralization closer to surface than rosemont the copper world project consists of seven deposits extending over seven kilometres including bolsa broad top butte copper world peach elgin south limb and north limb copper world s initial mineral resource estimate includes global indicated mineral resources of 272 million tonnes at 0 36 copper and inferred mineral resources of 142 million tonnes at 0 36 copper the global resource estimate includes near surface higher grade indicated mineral resources of 96 million tonnes at 0 57 copper and inferred mineral resources of 31 million tonnes at 0 71 copper with the potential for this higher grade resource to be mined earlier in the mine life resources comprise both sulphide and oxide mineralogy and are potentially amenable to flotation and heap leach processing methods respectively the company has increased the number of drill rigs at site to six to conduct infill drilling and to support future economic studies the technical studies for copper world are well advanced and the results will be incorporated into a preliminary economic assessment pea contemplating the development of the copper world deposits in conjunction with the rosemont deposit the pea is also expected to reflect preliminary expectations of potential synergies between copper world and rosemont hudbay is on track to publish the pea results in a ni 43 101 technical report in the first half of 2022 an updated three dimensional visualization of copper world including the location of the deposits drilling completed in 2020 and 2021 historical mine sites and the updated mineral resource estimates can be found at the following link the company continues to await a decision from the u s court of appeals for the ninth circuit relating to the appeal of the unprecedented rosemont court decision other exploration updates peru regional exploration hudbay continues drilling and scoping studies to evaluate the underground potential at constancia norte and the results are expected to be incorporated into the annual mineral reserve and resource update for constancia in march 2022 the company also continues to progress exploration agreement discussions with nearby communities on prospective properties near constancia drilling continues at the llaguen copper porphyry target in northern peru near the city of trujillo and in close proximity to existing infrastructure the confirmatory phase of the drill program has totaled over 7 000 metres in 16 holes with two drill rigs presently turning at site assay results have been received for five holes with all holes intersecting mineralization pending positive results from this initial drilling phase a second phase of the project will aim at defining an initial inferred mineral resource estimate for llaguen to be completed in the third quarter of 2022 snow lake regional exploration the company is actively conducting surface and underground winter drilling activities in the snow lake area primarily focused on testing down plunge extensions of the copper gold rich feeder zone at the 1901 deposit the drilling gap between 1901 and lens 17 at lalor and a high priority geophysical target located immediately north of lalor in addition hudbay continues to compile drilling results from the 2021 program at lalor and 1901 which are expected to be incorporated into the annual mineral reserve and resource estimates to be published at the end of march 2022 flin flon reclamation obligations and tailings reprocessing opportunity in early january 2022 hudbay commenced a confirmatory drill program on the tailings facility in flin flon to support the completion of a pea on the tailings reprocessing opportunity by the first quarter of 2023 the company is also conducting engineering and test work throughout 2022 to support the pea this opportunity could utilize the flin flon concentrator with modifications after the closure of the 777 mine creating operating and economic benefits to the flin flon community it could also provide the opportunity to redesign the closure plans increase metal production defer or reduce certain closure costs and reduce the environmental footprint of the tailings facility 2022 key objectives and annual guidance hudbay s key objectives for 2022 are to deliver meaningful copper and gold production growth to generate positive cash flow and strong returns on invested capital accelerate drilling economic studies and permitting activities for the recently discovered copper world deposits and identify synergies with rosemont to unlock value execute the third phase of the company s snow lake gold strategy by optimizing the new britannia mill preparing for the ramp up to 5 300 tonnes per day at lalor and initiating the stall mill recovery improvement program progress constancia s leading efficiency metrics by applying smart technologies to continuously improve operating performance including sensor based ore sorting and milling flowsheet enhancements reach a community agreement to explore the prospective properties near constancia transition the flin flon operations through orderly closure while further exploring the potential to reprocess tailings in flin flon conduct brownfield and greenfield exploration programs in the snow lake region peru arizona nevada and chile for new mineral discoveries define greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets to further enhance the company s esg objectives and evaluate growth opportunities that meet the company s stringent strategic criteria and allocate capital to pursue those opportunities that create sustainable value for the company and its stakeholders hudbay s annual production and operating cost guidance along with its annual capital and exploration expenditure forecasts are discussed in detail below as a result of the covid 19 global pandemic the company has experienced intermittent operational supply chain travel labour and shipping disruptions and it may continue to experience similar disruptions in the future given the uncertainty of the duration and magnitude of the impact of covid 19 the social and political tensions in peru and the mine plan limitations at the 777 mine given its pending closure the company s 2022

gold and silver and peru s gold production exceeded the top end of the guidance range due to strong gold grades from the pampacancha satellite deposit zinc production was below the guidance range primarily due to higher grade dilution and mine plan limitations experienced at the 777 mine in manitoba late in the year as the mine approaches the end of its life molybdenum production was below guidance but was consistent with the range published in the constancia mine plan released in march 2021 in 2022 consolidated copper production is forecast to increase by 17 ii compared to 2021 levels primarily as a result of higher expected copper production in peru with higher planned copper grades from both the constancia and pampacancha pits more than offsetting lower copper production in manitoba consolidated gold production in 2022 is expected to increase by 28 ii year over year due to significantly higher gold grades and recoveries expected in both manitoba and peru in manitoba gold production is expected to increase by 17 ii in 2022 due to the first full year of production at the recently refurbished new britannia gold mill in peru gold production is expected to increase by 59 ii in 2022 as the first full year of pampacancha is incorporated year over year zinc production is expected to decline by 36 ii as a result of the expected closure of the 777 mine in june 2022 and the mining of the gold rich zones at lalor in connection with the startup of the new britannia mill which will result in mining less of the zinc rich base metal zones at lalor peru s 2022 production guidance assumes copper grades remain consistent with the higher grades seen in the fourth quarter of 2021 for a majority of the year before significantly increasing in the fourth quarter of 2022 peru s production guidance reflects regularly scheduled semi annual mill maintenance shutdowns at constancia during the first and third quarters of 2022 the guidance also assumes mining continues in the harder ore areas of the pits in 2022 with slight impacts on mill throughput but improving ore hardness is expected in 2023 and beyond manitoba s 2022 production guidance reflects continued strong production from the lalor mine operating at a throughput rate of 4 650 tonnes per day and ramping up to 5 300 tonnes per day by 2023 the new britannia mill is expected to average 1 500 tonnes per day in 2022 with continued ramp up activities and rod mill liner maintenance scheduled during the first quarter and full design rates expected to be achieved in the second quarter 2022 production assumes lower mining rates at the 777 mine as the mine approaches closure in june 2022 the low end of the production guidance ranges reflects reduced output from the 777 mine to capture the potential for

gold production from 777 after its closure in mid 2022 peru s three year production guidance reflects the incorporation of pampacancha into the mine plan with higher copper and gold grades from 2022 and beyond the mine plan has been re sequenced since the publication of the march 2021 constancia technical report resulting in higher gold grade areas in the pampacancha pit being moved from 2022 to 2023 which is expected to lead to a 41 ii increase in gold production in 2023 from 2022 levels manitoba s three year production guidance reflects an increase in lalor s mine throughput from 4 650 tonnes per day in 2022 to 5 300 tonnes per day starting in 2023 due to technical and operational improvements and the allocation of mining resources from the 777 mine after its closure in 2022 the low

growth spending in manitoba in 2022 sustaining capital expenditures in peru are expected to decrease from 2021 levels primarily due to lower costs associated with heavy civil works after completion of a tailings dam raise in 2021 this is expected to be partially offset by higher capitalized stripping expenditures in 2022 due to changes in the sequencing of mining phases in 2021 and the deferral of some capitalized stripping costs into 2022 sustaining capital expenditures in manitoba are expected to be higher than 2021 primarily due to accelerated underground development and equipment spending at lalor in connection with the ramp up to 5 300 tonnes per day and the introduction of new britannia sustaining costs partially offset by lower capital development at 777 as the mine approaches

2023 these low capital brownfield growth projects are expected to generate attractive returns and are part of hudbay s continuous improvement efforts manitoba s growth capital spending of 50 0 million in 2022 includes approximately 25 0 million for the completion of the stall mill recovery improvement project which is expected to involve several flow sheet enhancements to increase copper gold and silver recoveries starting in 2023 approximately 15 0 million is budgeted for the expansion of the surface facilities in snow lake to support the transition to 5 300 tonnes per day at lalor by 2023 approximately 5 0 million has been allocated to engineering studies to advance the development of the 1901 deposit ahead of the current 2026 production start timeline the spending guidance excludes approximately 20 0 million of tailings investments in manitoba as hudbay completes the improvements on the legacy flin flon tailings impoundment area in 2022 a program that was initiated in 2019 to ensure compliance with higher industry wide standards for tailings dam safety these expenditures are associated with the decommissioning and restoration liability and therefore will be accounted for

processing harder ore in the constancia pit copper cash costs in peru are expected to decline by 19 ii in 2022 versus 2021 primarily due to higher gold by product credits and higher copper production

the new britannia mill which is expected to result in higher milling unit costs compared to the flin flon and stall mills as disclosed in the snow lake operations mine plan released in march 2021 manitoba unit costs also reflect the closure of the 777 mine in june 2022 and the transition of a portion of the workforce to snow lake gold cash costs in manitoba are expected to be 300 to 550 per

sedar at non ifrs financial performance measures adjusted net earnings loss adjusted net earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda net debt cash cost sustaining and all in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced and per ounce of gold produced and combined unit cost are non ifrs performance measures these measures do not have a meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under ifrs other companies may calculate these measures differently hudbay believes adjusted net earnings loss and adjusted net earnings loss per share adds additional context through the company s performance for the current period and provide insight into its expected performance in future periods these measures are used internally by the company to evaluate the performance of its underlying operations and to assist with its planning and forecasting of future operating results as such the company believes these measures are useful to investors in assessing the company s underlying performance the company provides adjusted ebitda to help users analyze its results and to provide additional information about the company s ongoing cash generating potential in order to assess its capacity to service and repay debt carry out investments and cover working capital needs net debt is shown because it is a performance measure used by the company to assess its financial position cash cost sustaining and all in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced and per ounce of gold produced are shown because the company believes they help investors and management assess the performance of its current and future operations including the margin generated by the operations and the company combined unit cost is shown because the company believes it helps investors and management assess the cost structure and margins that are not impacted by variability in by product commodity prices in addition during 2021 there were non recurring adjustments for manitoba operations including severance past service pension costs write downs of certain machinery and equipment and inventory supplies write downs as well as non cash impairment charges related to an updated flin flon closure plan and long term declining discount rates none of which management believes are indicative of the ongoing operating performance and have therefore been excluded from the calculations of adjusted net earnings loss and adjusted ebitda as part of the company s year end 2021 tax provision calculation a review of all previous tax impacts on adjusted earnings was completed during the course of the review hudbay determined that the tax impact related to the impairment charge for the environmental obligation for the third quarter of 2021 had been understated this impacted its calculation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share as a result the previously disclosed adjusted net earnings of 38 2 million for the third quarter of 2021 has been recalculated to an adjusted net earnings of 0 9 million and the adjusted net earnings per share of 0 15 has been recalculated to an adjusted net earnings per share of 0 00 this recalculation of the adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share does not impact hudbay s financial statements and has been included in the full year adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share tables disclosed in this news release in the first half of 2020 a government imposed shutdown of non essential businesses led to a temporary suspension of our constancia mining operations similarly in the fourth quarter of 2020 a shaft incident led to a production interruption at 777 in manitoba fixed overhead production costs incurred during these temporary production disruptions were directly charged to cost of sales these costs did not contribute to production of inventory and were therefore excluded from the calculations of

on track to complete a preliminary economic assessment of copper world in the first half of 2022 results from the constancia norte underground scoping study are expected to be incorporated into the annual mineral reserve and resource update for constancia in march 2022 commenced a winter drilling program in manitoba in january 2022 to test high priority targets near lalor and 1901 for potential reserve and resource expansion and support the completion of a preliminary economic assessment of the flin flon tailings reprocessing opportunity 2021 was a year of execution for hudbay as we invested approximately 250 million in our brownfield growth projects at pampacancha and new britannia said peter kukielski president and chief executive officer we began to see increased cash flows from these short payback high return investments in the fourth quarter and we are now at an inflection point where we anticipate meaningful copper and gold production growth along with significant ebitda and cash flow growth 2022 will be a year in which we start to reap the rewards from our disciplined growth strategy while we advance our high quality pipeline of copper growth assets including our newly discovered copper world project in arizona which we believe will generate significant value 2022 annual guidance and outlook consolidated copper production is forecast to increase by 17 to 116 000 ii

net of by product creditsi was 0 51 compared to 0 62 in the third quarter of 2021 this 18 decrease was mainly a result of higher copper production and higher gold by product revenue sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi slightly decreased to 1 95 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 1 97 in the third quarter primarily due to the same factors affecting cash cost offset by higher sustaining capital expenditures and royalties operating cash flow before change in non cash working capital was 156 9 million during the fourth quarter of 2021 reflecting an

silver production met 2021 guidance however production of zinc and molybdenum fell short of the 2021 guidance ranges production of gold in peru exceeded the top end of the guidance range due to strong gold grades from pampacancha production of gold and silver in manitoba fell below the 2021 guidance range primarily due to higher than expected grade dilution at the 777 mine during the fourth quarter and prioritizing base metal rich zones in the fourth quarter at lalor while deferring some gold rich ore for future processing at new britannia to achieve higher gold recoveries zinc production was impacted by higher dilution and mine plan limitations as the 777 mine approaches the end of life consolidated cash costs per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi for 2021 was 0 74 and

respectively in 2020 contributing to the 2021 net loss was an impairment charge of 193 5 million related to an updated closure plan reflecting higher estimates for closure activities in flin flon full year results were also negatively impacted by charges related to the refinancing of the 2025 senior notes including a write off of the non cash embedded derivative of 49 8 million connected with the

increase in throughput and recovery at both constancia and pampacancha gold and silver production increased by 2 and 11 respectively due to the increased throughput and higher grades this was another record quarter for gold production in peru full year 2021 copper production increased by 6 year over year to 77 813 tonnes within the annual guidance range full year 2021 gold production increased by 306 year over year to 50 306 ounces and exceeded the 2021 guidance range due to increased throughput higher grades from pampacancha and higher gold recoveries full year 2021 production guidance was met for all metals except molybdenum which was in line with the mine plan published in march 2021 total ore mined during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by 19 from the third quarter of 2021 as mining levels were optimized for mill throughput ore mined at pampacancha in 2021 was 5 1 million tonnes exceeding the four million tonne threshold required to receive an additional 4 million deposit from wheaton precious metals under the amended constancia streaming agreement the proceeds of this deposit were received in december 2021 and were accounted for as an increase in the deferred revenue balance ore milled during the fourth quarter of 2021 was 15 higher than the previous quarter due to a scheduled semi annual mill maintenance program affecting third quarter ore milled milled grades for copper were higher than the third quarter due to higher grades from the constancia pit milled grades for gold were consistent with the most recent quarter while milled silver grades were lower but consistent with the mine plan copper recoveries in the fourth quarter increased over the third quarter of 2021 due to lower oxide levels in the constancia ore recoveries of gold in the fourth quarter of 2021 were lower than the third quarter due to variability of the pampacancha volume being treated and the increased presence of zinc while silver recoveries slightly increased compared to the third quarter due to variable metallurgical characteristics of the earlier ores from pampacancha and slightly lower silver head grades combined mine mill and g a unit operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 10 47 per tonne a 10 improvement versus the third quarter of 2021 covid related costs in peru were 4 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 combined unit operating costs in the fourth quarter were 9 96 per tonne excluding these covid related costs full year combined unit operating costs were 20 higher than the same period in 2020 due to inflationary pressures on consumables and energy costs and higher covid 19 expenditures offset in part by additional tonnes milled peru s cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product credits in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 1 28 relatively in line with the prior quarter peru s sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product credits in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased to 2 46 compared to 2 31 in the

news release during the fourth quarter of 2021 manitoba operations produced 5 342 tonnes of copper 46 242 ounces of gold 321 573 ounces of silver and 23 207 tonnes of zinc copper production was relatively in line as compared to the third quarter and gold and silver production increased by 11 and 33 respectively due to the ramp up at new britannia full year copper production achieved 2021 guidance however zinc gold and silver production for the year fell short of the company s guidance ranges zinc production was predominantly impacted by higher than planned dilution at the 777 mine as it nears the end of life gold and silver production were below guidance due to higher dilution at the 777 mine in the fourth quarter and the deferral of some higher gold content ore for future processing at new britannia to achieve higher gold recoveries during the fourth quarter of 2021 the new britannia mill continued to ramp up with the flotation circuit starting in october new britannia processed 109 242 tonnes of ore during the fourth quarter and achieved commercial production in november triggering the start of depreciation for the mill in december new britannia throughput averaged 1 200 tonnes per day with gold and silver recoveries in line with the metallurgical model a number of optimization initiatives are underway to improve the mechanical availability of grinding leaching and tailings circuits it is anticipated that the throughput and recoveries will achieve full design rates in the second quarter of 2022 lalor production processes to separate gold and base metal ores are now fully established to optimally provide feed for both the new britannia and stall mills at the end of 2021 snow lake ore stockpiles were at normalized levels with approximately 26 000 tonnes of gold ore and approximately 24 000 tonnes of base metal ore on surface a production ramp up strategy to achieve 5 300 tonnes per day at lalor by the end of 2022 is underway that includes advancing development for new mining fronts additions to the mine equipment fleet transition of workforce from the 777 mine upon closure and expansion of change house and office facilities the 777 mine is within months of closure and the focus continues to be on mining out the remaining reserves by completing the necessary ground rehabilitation to access remnant and pillar stoping blocks challenging ground conditions have caused delays in the production sequence and resulted in higher dilution than planned these challenges are expected to continue until the end of mine life in june 2022 pre closure activities are underway in mined out areas to decommission stationary equipment of value for redeployment at lalor although there was less feed to the stall concentrator in the fourth quarter as gold ore was directed to new britannia the combined snow lake mills processed a significantly higher volume of ore in the fourth quarter of 2021 and stall recoveries were consistent with the metallurgical model for the head grades delivered new britannia recoveries continued ramping up during the fourth quarter the flin flon concentrator consumed the available ore feed from the 777 mine in the fourth quarter of 2021 and recoveries were consistent with the metallurgical model for the head grades delivered combined unit operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by 14 compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher milling costs in snow lake with the ramp up of the new britannia mill in the quarter partially offset by higher tonnes processed full year combined mine mill and g a unit operating costs were 17 higher than the prior year due to the same factors as the fourth quarter variances full year combined unit operating cost was within the 2021 guidance range manitoba s cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product credits in the fourth quarter of 2021 was negative 2 77 lower than the third quarter primarily due to higher by product credits as gold revenues increased offsetting operating cost increases as noted above manitoba s sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product credits in the fourth quarter of 2021 was negative 0 23 lower than the 0 75 achieved in the third quarter due to the same factors affecting cash costs starting in the first quarter of 2022 the company intends to disclose cash cost per ounce of gold produced net of by product credits as gold revenue grows to become the most significant contributor to total manitoba revenue for the foreseeable future covid 19 business update hudbay is maintaining covid 19 measures and controls to ensure the safety of its workforce partners and communities this has contributed to increased operating costs beyond levels initially budgeted for 2021 despite the maintenance of these stringent measures the company continues to experience intermittent operational supply chain travel labour and shipping disruptions with periodic waves of covid 19 cases new britannia commercial production achieved the construction of a new copper flotation facility at new britannia was completed in october 2021 followed by a brief commissioning period that was completed ahead of schedule the new britannia mill achieved commercial production on november 30 2021 after reaching the required recoveries and throughput in the copper and gold circuits the ramp up of throughput recoveries and metal production at new britannia achieved best in class timelines as represented by widely recognized ramp up curves the new britannia mill is expected to average 1 500 tonnes per day in 2022 with continued ramp up activities and rod mill liner maintenance scheduled during the first quarter full design throughput rates and recoveries are expected to be achieved in the second quarter of 2022 a mere six months after commissioning average annual gold production from lalor and the snow lake operations is expected to increase to over 180 000 ounces at an average cash cost and sustaining cash cost net of by product credits of 412 and 788 per ounce of gold respectively during the first six full years of new britannia s operation advancing the copper world discovery on december 15 2021 hudbay released a national instrument 43 101 ni 43 101 initial mineral resource estimate for the recently discovered copper world deposits in arizona the 100 owned copper world project is located in close proximity to the 100 owned rosemont deposit with mineralization closer to surface than rosemont the copper world project consists of seven deposits extending over seven kilometres including bolsa broad top butte copper world peach elgin south limb and north limb copper world s initial mineral resource estimate includes global indicated mineral resources of 272 million tonnes at 0 36 copper and inferred mineral resources of 142 million tonnes at 0 36 copper the global resource estimate includes near surface higher grade indicated mineral resources of 96 million tonnes at 0 57 copper and inferred mineral resources of 31 million tonnes at 0 71 copper with the potential for this higher grade resource to be mined earlier in the mine life resources comprise both sulphide and oxide mineralogy and are potentially amenable to flotation and heap leach processing methods respectively the company has increased the number of drill rigs at site to six to conduct infill drilling and to support future economic studies the technical studies for copper world are well advanced and the results will be incorporated into a preliminary economic assessment pea contemplating the development of the copper world deposits in conjunction with the rosemont deposit the pea is also expected to reflect preliminary expectations of potential synergies between copper world and rosemont hudbay is on track to publish the pea results in a ni 43 101 technical report in the first half of 2022 an updated three dimensional visualization of copper world including the location of the deposits drilling completed in 2020 and 2021 historical mine sites and the updated mineral resource estimates can be found at the following link the company continues to await a decision from the u s court of appeals for the ninth circuit relating to the appeal of the unprecedented rosemont court decision other exploration updates peru regional exploration hudbay continues drilling and scoping studies to evaluate the underground potential at constancia norte and the results are expected to be incorporated into the annual mineral reserve and resource update for constancia in march 2022 the company also continues to progress exploration agreement discussions with nearby communities on prospective properties near constancia drilling continues at the llaguen copper porphyry target in northern peru near the city of trujillo and in close proximity to existing infrastructure the confirmatory phase of the drill program has totaled over 7 000 metres in 16 holes with two drill rigs presently turning at site assay results have been received for five holes with all holes intersecting mineralization pending positive results from this initial drilling phase a second phase of the project will aim at defining an initial inferred mineral resource estimate for llaguen to be completed in the third quarter of 2022 snow lake regional exploration the company is actively conducting surface and underground winter drilling activities in the snow lake area primarily focused on testing down plunge extensions of the copper gold rich feeder zone at the 1901 deposit the drilling gap between 1901 and lens 17 at lalor and a high priority geophysical target located immediately north of lalor in addition hudbay continues to compile drilling results from the 2021 program at lalor and 1901 which are expected to be incorporated into the annual mineral reserve and resource estimates to be published at the end of march 2022 flin flon reclamation obligations and tailings reprocessing opportunity in early january 2022 hudbay commenced a confirmatory drill program on the tailings facility in flin flon to support the completion of a pea on the tailings reprocessing opportunity by the first quarter of 2023 the company is also conducting engineering and test work throughout 2022 to support the pea this opportunity could utilize the flin flon concentrator with modifications after the closure of the 777 mine creating operating and economic benefits to the flin flon community it could also provide the opportunity to redesign the closure plans increase metal production defer or reduce certain closure costs and reduce the environmental footprint of the tailings facility 2022 key objectives and annual guidance hudbay s key objectives for 2022 are to deliver meaningful copper and gold production growth to generate positive cash flow and strong returns on invested capital accelerate drilling economic studies and permitting activities for the recently discovered copper world deposits and identify synergies with rosemont to unlock value execute the third phase of the company s snow lake gold strategy by optimizing the new britannia mill preparing for the ramp up to 5 300 tonnes per day at lalor and initiating the stall mill recovery improvement program progress constancia s leading efficiency metrics by applying smart technologies to continuously improve operating performance including sensor based ore sorting and milling flowsheet enhancements reach a community agreement to explore the prospective properties near constancia transition the flin flon operations through orderly closure while further exploring the potential to reprocess tailings in flin flon conduct brownfield and

gold and silver and peru s gold production exceeded the top end of the guidance range due to strong gold grades from the pampacancha satellite deposit zinc production was below the guidance range primarily due to higher grade dilution and mine plan limitations experienced at the 777 mine in manitoba late in the year as the mine approaches the end of its life molybdenum production was below guidance but was consistent with the range published in the constancia mine plan released in march 2021 in 2022 consolidated copper production is forecast to increase by 17 ii compared to 2021 levels primarily as a result of higher expected copper production in peru with higher planned copper grades from both the constancia and pampacancha pits more than offsetting lower copper production in manitoba consolidated gold production in 2022 is expected to increase by 28 ii year over year due to significantly higher gold grades and recoveries expected in both manitoba and peru in manitoba gold production is expected to increase by 17 ii in 2022 due to the first full year of production at the recently refurbished new britannia gold mill in peru gold production is expected to increase by 59 ii in 2022 as the first full year of pampacancha is incorporated year over year zinc production is expected to decline by 36 ii as a result of the expected closure of the 777 mine in june 2022 and the mining of the gold rich zones at lalor in connection with the startup of the new britannia mill which will result in mining less of the zinc rich base metal zones at lalor peru s 2022 production guidance assumes copper grades remain consistent with the higher grades seen in the fourth quarter of 2021 for a majority of the year before significantly increasing in the fourth quarter of 2022 peru s production guidance reflects regularly scheduled semi annual mill maintenance shutdowns at constancia during the first and third quarters of 2022 the guidance also assumes mining continues in the harder ore areas of the pits in 2022 with slight impacts on mill throughput but improving ore hardness is expected in 2023 and beyond manitoba s 2022 production guidance reflects continued strong production from the lalor mine operating at a throughput rate of 4 650 tonnes per day and ramping up to 5 300 tonnes per day by 2023 the new britannia mill is expected to average 1 500 tonnes per day in 2022 with continued ramp up activities and rod mill liner maintenance scheduled during the first quarter and full design rates expected to be achieved in the second quarter 2022 production assumes lower mining rates at the 777 mine as the mine approaches closure in june 2022 the low end of the production guidance ranges reflects reduced output from the 777 mine to capture the potential for

and beyond the mine plan has been re sequenced since the publication of the march 2021 constancia technical report resulting in higher gold grade areas in the pampacancha pit being moved from 2022 to 2023 which is expected to lead to a 41 ii increase in gold production in 2023 from 2022 levels manitoba s three year production guidance reflects an increase in lalor s mine throughput from 4 650 tonnes per day in 2022 to 5 300 tonnes per day starting in 2023 due to technical and operational improvements and the allocation of mining resources from the 777 mine after its closure in 2022 the low

associated with the copper world and rosemont projects total capital expenditures are expected to decline by 17 year over year primarily due to lower expected sustaining capital in peru and lower growth spending in manitoba in 2022 sustaining capital expenditures in peru are expected to decrease from 2021 levels primarily due to lower costs associated with heavy civil works after completion of a tailings dam raise in 2021 this is expected to be partially offset by higher capitalized stripping expenditures in 2022 due to changes in the sequencing of mining phases in 2021 and the deferral of some capitalized stripping costs into 2022 sustaining capital expenditures in manitoba are expected to be higher than 2021 primarily due to accelerated underground development and equipment spending at lalor in connection with the ramp up to 5 300 tonnes per day and the introduction of new britannia sustaining costs partially offset by lower capital development at 777 as the mine approaches closure peru s growth capital spending of 10 0 million in 2022 includes costs associated with mill recovery improvement initiatives targeted to increase copper and molybdenum recoveries starting in 2023 these low capital brownfield growth projects are expected to generate attractive returns and are part of hudbay s continuous improvement efforts manitoba s growth capital spending of 50 0 million in 2022 includes approximately 25 0 million for the completion of the stall mill recovery improvement project which is expected to involve several flow sheet enhancements to increase copper gold and silver recoveries starting in 2023 approximately 15 0 million is budgeted for the expansion of the surface facilities in snow lake to support the transition to 5 300 tonnes per day at lalor by 2023 approximately 5 0 million has been allocated to engineering studies to advance the development of the 1901 deposit ahead of the current 2026 production start timeline the spending guidance excludes approximately 20 0 million of tailings investments in manitoba as hudbay completes the improvements on the legacy flin flon tailings impoundment area in 2022 a program that was initiated in 2019 to ensure compliance with higher industry wide standards for tailings dam safety these expenditures are associated with the decommissioning and restoration liability and therefore will be accounted for

copper world and a planned initial drill program at the mason valley skarn properties in late 2022 unit cost and cash cost guidance hudbay is introducing cash cost guidance in 2022 for each of its operations copper remains the primary metal produced in the peru operations and therefore the company has presented cash cost per pound of copper produced in manitoba recognizing that with the new

material properties as filed by us on sedar at www sedar com non ifrs financial performance measures adjusted net earnings loss adjusted net earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda net debt cash cost sustaining and all in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced and per ounce of gold produced and combined unit cost are non ifrs performance measures these measures do not have a meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under ifrs other companies may calculate these measures differently hudbay believes adjusted net earnings loss and adjusted net earnings loss per share adds additional context through the company s performance for the current period and provide insight into its expected performance in future periods these measures are used internally by the company to evaluate the performance of its underlying operations and to assist with its planning and forecasting of future operating results as such the company believes these measures are useful to investors in assessing the company s underlying performance the company provides adjusted ebitda to help users analyze its results and to provide additional information about the company s ongoing cash generating potential in order to assess its capacity to service and repay debt carry out investments and cover working capital needs net debt is shown because it is a performance measure used by the company to assess its financial position cash cost sustaining and all in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced and per ounce of gold produced are shown because the company believes they help investors and management assess the performance of its current and future operations including the margin generated by the operations and the company combined unit cost is shown because the company believes it helps investors and management assess the cost structure and margins that are not impacted by variability in by product commodity prices in addition during 2021 there were non recurring adjustments for manitoba operations including severance past service pension costs write downs of certain machinery and equipment and inventory supplies write downs as well as non cash impairment charges related to an updated flin flon closure plan and long term declining discount rates none of which management believes are indicative of the ongoing operating performance and have therefore been excluded from the calculations of adjusted net earnings loss and adjusted ebitda as part of the company s year end 2021 tax provision calculation a review of all previous tax impacts on adjusted earnings was completed during the course of the review hudbay determined that the tax impact related to the impairment charge for the environmental obligation for the third quarter of 2021 had been understated this impacted its calculation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share as a result the previously disclosed adjusted net earnings of 38 2 million for the third quarter of 2021 has been recalculated to an adjusted net earnings of 0 9 million and the adjusted net earnings per share of 0 15 has been recalculated to an adjusted net earnings per share of 0 00 this recalculation of the adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share does not impact hudbay s financial statements and has been included in the full year adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share tables disclosed in this news release in the first half of 2020 a government imposed shutdown of non essential businesses led to a temporary suspension of our constancia mining operations similarly in the fourth quarter of 2020 a shaft incident led to a production interruption at 777 in manitoba fixed overhead production costs incurred during these temporary production disruptions were directly charged to cost of sales these costs did not contribute to production of inventory and were therefore excluded from the calculations of adjusted net earnings loss adjusted ebitda and cash costs the following tables provide detailed reconciliations to the most comparable

politics government new ca bill taxes extreme wealth may raise 22 billion a year california democrats reintroduced legislation to tax extreme wealth and would affect households with a net worth of 50 million or more california democrats reintroduced legislation to tax extreme wealth a measure that would affect households with a net worth of 50 million or more shutterstock sacramento ca california democrats have introduced legislation that would tax what the measure calls extreme wealth in california proposed feb 16 assembly bill 2289 would apply to households worth more than 50 million that represents about 0 07 percent of the state or about 15 000 families researchers at uc berkeley and uc davis in 2021 said such legislation would raise about 22 3 billion a year starting in 2023 about half of that money would come from the roughly 170 or so billionaires who call california home the wealth tax would increase tax revenue improve tax justice and help reduce wealth concentration the researchers wrote in the study the tax would be delayed until 2025 for implementation though the billionaire tax would be applied in 2023 a david binder poll last year found that californians overwhelmingly support a wealth tax assemblyman alex lee of san jose said in a news release nearly 70 percent of residents polled supported a wealth tax on californians worth at least 30 million while some worry such a tax could lead the state s wealthiest residents to leave for greener less expensive pastures lee disagreed while some say california is driving away higher income residents the opposite is true we ve actually been losing lower and middle income residents that are being priced out while continuing to gain higher income residents lee said in a statement with a tax on the ultra wealthy who pay a lower effective tax rate than the bottom 99 we can invest in our schools tackle homelessness expand needed services and much more california s share of millionaires and billionaires has increased over the last decade even as the state increased its millionaires tax 10 years ago california is home to 12 percent of the country s population but a quarter of all american billionaires now live in the state as do 17 percent of all the country s millionaires the study said income and wealth is more concentrated in california than in the united states overall and this concentration has been growing faster how tax friendly is california californians will be the first to bemoan the state s high taxes but a new analysis found the state is more tax friendly than many might think in a recent analysis by the personal finance site moneygeek researchers looked at which states are most and least tax friendly moneygeek analyzed tax costs for each state to measure those with the lowest tax burden considering sales income and property taxes california received a b grade to assess each state s tax friendliness moneygeek estimated the state taxes paid by a married couple making the median national income of 82 852 with one child and who own their 349 400 home the authors found that such a couple would pay an estimated 6 600 in taxes or 8 percent of their income that s good for the 17th lowest share in the country in wyoming the same family would pay an estimated 3 300 in taxes or 4 percent of their income that state saw the lowest share in the country and received an a grade meanwhile the same family would expect to pay about 13 900 or a whopping 16 8 percent of their income in illinois with the highest share in the nation illinois received a failing grade but lee the san jose democrat said that while california s income tax is successful at taxing most californians it s not as effective at taxing the ultra wealthy the richest californians such as mark zuckerberg sergey brin or larry page can avoid the state s income tax as long as they don t sell their stocks this is the main weakness of the ca tax system the study found the wealth tax directly remedies this injustice by taxing all wealth whether this wealth has been realized as income or not the researchers added with the wealth tax billionaires would have to pay between 1 and 1 5 of their wealth in wealth taxes even if they do not sell their assets just like homeowners have had to pay annual property taxes based on the value of their homes lee told the los angeles times they want the obscenely ultra rich to pay their fair share there s a whole other category of wealth where you just own things and can leverage more wealth out of your existing wealth and we ve seen how that can be evaded he told the times teachers support extreme wealth tax taxpayers group opposes other california democrats support the bill including assemblymembers wendy carrillo d los angeles ash kalra d san josé luz rivas d san fernando valley and mark stone d monterey bay all co authored the legislation rivas said it s time that top earning millionaires and billionaires pay a fairer share of taxes to maintain government services this is not a hypothetical conversation on the federal level alone jeff bezos and elon musk paid absolutely no taxes he said the legislation also earned the support of one of california s largest teachers unions jeffery freitas president of the california federation of teachers said in a statement that california billionaires grew their wealth astronomically since the beginning of the pandemic as working families struggled to pay their bills his union is proud to sponsor the bill which he said could help address water wildfire education and housing problems it s time we took care of each other and not just watch billionaires fly into space freitas said the california taxpayers association however opposed the bill and said it could push some of the wealthiest residents to move out of state hindering the amount of revenue the state collects major hurdles given the bill s history and the status of the state legislature the bill is unlikely to pass lee proposed similar legislation in 2021 that never made it to a committee hearing to boot should it pass voters would have to sign off on circumventing the state s 0 4 percent tax rate limit

photo ap published wed 23 feb 2022 11 05 pm ukraine declared a state of emergency on wednesday and told its citizens in russia to flee while moscow began evacuating its kyiv embassy in the latest ominous signs for ukrainians who fear an all out russian military onslaught shelling intensified at the line of contact in eastern ukraine where russian president vladimir putin recognised the independence of two moscow backed rebel regions this week and has ordered the deployment of russian troops as peacekeepers but there was still no clear indication of whether he plans to follow that up with a massed assault on ukraine involving the tens of thousands of troops he has gathered near his neighbour s borders the uncertainty and a mostly incremental first volley of sanctions on russian interests by washington and its allies have roiled financial markets oil prices reversed earlier losses on wednesday however global stocks broke a four day slide and demand for safe haven assets waned as western leaders and ukraine awaited putin s next move predicting what might be the next step of russia the separatists or the personal decisions of the russian president i cannot say ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskiy said the 30 day state of emergency could restrict the freedom of movement of conscripted reservists see curbs imposed on the media and lead to personal document checks according to a draft text that needs to be approved by parliament the restrictions would come into force from thursday the ukrainian government has also announced compulsory military service for all men of fighting age ukrainian government and state websites which have experienced outages in recent weeks blamed by kriv on cyber attacks were again offline on wednesday ukraine s parliament cabinet and foreign ministry websites were affected moscow denies planning an invasion and has described warnings as anti russian hysteria but it has taken no steps to withdraw the troops deployed along ukraine s frontiers on wednesday it took down flags from its embassy in kyiv having ordered its diplomats to evacuate for safety reasons washington has described russia s actions as the start of an invasion but along with allies has so far unveiled mostly incremental sanctions while making clear they were keeping tougher measures in reserve in case of a full scale invasion european union sanctions approved on wednesday will add all members of russia s lower house of parliament who voted to recognise the separatist regions in ukraine to a blacklist freezing their assets and banning travel eu leaders will also hold an emergency summit on thursday to discuss what to do next britain announced new restrictions banning russia from the issuing of new bonds in its security markets and called for its broadcasting regulator to investigate russia s rt international television news channel as a propaganda outlet there will be even more tough sanctions on key oligarchs on key organisations in russia limiting russia s access to the financial markets if there is a full scale invasion of ukraine british foreign secretary liz truss said the steps follow measures announced on tuesday including freezing the approval of a new russian gas pipeline by germany and imposing new u s sanctions on russian banks but none of the measures announced so far directly targets putin himself or is expected to have serious medium term consequences for moscow which is sitting on more than 630 billion in international reserves the rouble fell but not by much western countries have been warning for weeks about the possibility of the bloodiest war in europe for decades that has not materialised but the apparent threat remains leaving policymakers to struggle with calibrating their response fresh troops deployed ukraine s military said one soldier had been killed and six wounded in increased shelling by pro russian separatists using heavy artillery mortar bombs and grad rocket systems in the two breakaway areas over the previous 24 hours new satellite imagery showed several fresh troop and equipment deployments in western russia and more than 100 vehicles at a small airfield in southern belarus which borders ukraine according to us firm maxar for months russia has presented the crisis mainly as a dispute with the west demanding security guarantees including a promise never to allow ukraine to join nato but the recognition of the separatist regions was accompanied by much stronger language against ukraine including personally from putin in a tv address on monday putin rambled across centuries of history to characterise the ukrainian state as an artificial construct wrongly carved out of russia by its enemies some who saw the speech said they now feel menaced by a leader making decisions which no longer appear rational in the case of putin this is not a struggle for money or power it s about pride which means the mind is switched off he can t stop and he can t be stopped said lilia 72 a pensioner in the kyiv suburb of brovary also read german foreign minister annalena baerbock said russia was heading down a path that would make it a global pariah urging it not to completely isolate yourself worldwide diplomacy has now faltered u s secretary of state antony blinken and french foreign minister jean yves le drian cancelled separate meetings with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov a summit between u s president joe biden and putin floated by france at the start of the week now seems unlikely putin said he was always open to

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video prop 47 reclassified theft offenses from felonies to misdemeanors including shoplifting it doesn t mean people can steal up to 950 in goods without consequences proposition 47 a law enacted in california in 2014 has been brought back into the public eye following a segment that aired on fox news the proposition reduces the penalties for some non violent drug and petty theft offenses some republican lawmakers in california are now pushing for a bill to repeal proposition 47 while other lawmakers are looking to amend it a recent poll also found that most voters surveyed would support changes to proposition 47 the los angeles times reports we re proposing a pretty radical idea make crime illegal again in california assemblyman kevin kiley r calif who appeared on fox news in support of the bill to repeal proposition 47 wrote in a tweet during his february appearance on fox news kiley said we removed the consequence for stealing and what do you know it caused a lot more stealing under prop 47 you can go into a store and steal up to 950 worth of merchandise and it s not even charged as a felony it s not even a slap on the wrist some social media users have also claimed that the california law permits shoplifting and that shoplifting items worth less than 950 is not a crime the question can you steal up to 950 worth of merchandise in california without consequence under proposition 47 the sources the answer no you can t steal up to 950 worth of merchandise in california without consequence under proposition 47 the proposition reduced the punishment for certain theft crimes but it still classifies shoplifting as a misdemeanor what we found proposition 47 reclassified certain theft offenses from felony charges to misdemeanors according to california courts the proposition created a new misdemeanor offense called shoplifting which is punishable by up to six months in county jail according to california courts attorneys here here and here say shoplifters could also face a fine of up to 1 000 or both a fine and jail time shoplifting is defined under california s penal code as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed 950 before the passage of proposition 47 shoplifters were usually charged under the state s burglary laws which carried felony penalties according to robert helfend a criminal defense attorney in california in california burglary means a person enters an inhabited residence such as a home apartment boat or warehouse with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony the state s penal code says first degree burglary is punishable by up to six years in prison felony probation and or fines a person charged with shoplifting in california cannot also be charged with burglary or theft of the same property michael romano co sponsor of proposition 47 and chairperson of the california committee on the revision of the penal code wrote in an email to verify that the state directs savings from reduced incarceration into services such as mental health treatment and schools opponents of the law say it s led to an uptick in theft incidents but romano says proposition 47 has had no measurable negative impact on crime rates california s property crime rate in 2020 was significantly below what it was in 2000 down by 32 according to the public policy institute of california ppic california however there were statewide increases in property crime in 2012 and 2015 since 2000 california has implemented many criminal justice reforms no research to date has linked any of these reforms to changes in violent crime but they have been found to be contributing factors to coinciding temporary increases in auto theft and larceny the ppic writes in a 2018 research article published in the criminology and public policy journal the authors explain that proposition 47 also reduced other crimes in which the stolen property was less than 950 from felonies to misdemeanors those crimes include grand theft receiving stolen property forgery fraud and writing a bad check prop 47 was intended to impact future convictions and sentencing but also allowed for individuals incarcerated at the time for crimes covered by the measure to petition for resentencing the article says notably prop 47 required thorough review of an individual s criminal history and proper risk assessment before resentencing to ensure public safety charis kubrin ph d professor of criminology law and society at the university of california irvine is one of the article s authors she explained in an email to verify that proposition 47 does allow for the prosecution of shoplifting and other petty theft crimes just as misdemeanors instead of felonies

to 102 8 million in q4 2020 net profit for q4 2021 was 10 6 million q4 2020 net loss of 22 3 million major factors causing the increase to net profit for 2021 relative to 2020 were higher industry activity levels due to stronger commodity pricing continued focus on maintaining a lower cost structure and recognition of a 22 3 million impairment of non financial assets in 2020 adjusted ebitda for q4 2021 was 28 0 million which includes recognition of 1 1 million from the cews canadian emergency rent subsidy cers and together with cews ces programs q4 2020 6 5 million q4 2020 adjusted ebitda was 16 1 million fourth quarter 2021 vs third quarter 2021 sequential overview revenue from continuing operations gross profit and adjusted ebitda for q4 2021 was 156 4 million 12 5 and 28 0 million respectively a slight decrease compared to the q3 2021 results of 164 5 million revenue from continuing operations 19 8 million gross profit and 32 1 million adjusted ebitda net profit of 12 1 million in q4 2021 was slightly higher than the 9 0 million net profit in q3 2021 overall activity levels in the fourth quarter were slightly lower than the third quarter due to customers budget exhaustion and the usual christmas slowdown in the second half of december fortunately trican was able to secure modest price increases in all three of our operating divisions combined with strong cost control particularly related to the management of personnel third party charges and equipment maintenance the company continued to produce positive financial results the company also recognized a total of 1 1 million q3 2021 0 3 million from canadian government covid 19 ces subsidy programs in the quarter volumes of proppant pumped by the fracturing division decreased by 41 sequentially q4 2021 291 000 tonnes compared to q3 2021 497 000 tonnes as the company s core customers were less active with their completion programs due to budget exhaustion which reduced customer capital spending in q4 2021 activity levels decreased as we moved through the end of the quarter as a result of seasonal holiday break and extreme cold weather the company maintained six hydraulic fracturing crews throughout q4 2021 utilization of dual fuel pumpers was prioritized through the quarter supporting customer esg and cost control objectives through a reduction in the amount of diesel used in favour of cleaner burning less expensive natural gas the cementing job count decreased by 8 sequentially as the company s cement jobs skewed towards larger jobs in q3 2021 as a result of primary work compared to more surface level work in q4 2021 which are smaller jobs tonnage pumped decreased approximately 4 in line with the change in job type coiled tubing operating days increased 27 sequentially driven by first call work for a number of core customers market overview trican s 2022 full year outlook remains positive as commodity prices remain high and the industry activity is expected to be robust as we move through q1 2022 and look forward into the second half of 2022 the demand for energy continues to fluctuate in reaction to macroeconomic forces such as geopolitical tension opec deliberations and continued concerns related to covid 19 however we believe that the supply and demand fundamentals for both oil and natural gas will provide support to pricing and lead to continued improved industry activity and subsequent oilfield service utilization as we move through 2022 the canadian rig count has not increased as rapidly as expected in early 2022 in the context of strong commodity pricing as customers experienced a variety of weather labour supply and covid 19 related delays in the field they also remain very disciplined in their capital allocation strategies with a continual focus on improving their balance sheets and returning capital to shareholders however the financial returns our customers are experiencing should ensure that budgets and associated industry activity will be higher in 2022 compared to 2021 our customers are recognizing that the canadian market is tightening and are actively looking to secure equipment and crews to ensure the success of their 2022 capital programs availability of labour continues to be a top focus for all service providers and we are keenly focused on retaining existing staff and attracting new talent pricing for our services trican has been vocal about the need for higher pricing in the pressure pumping sector the oilfield sector has been challenged by successive years of weak or negative returns on capital creating an environment that is not sustainable a sustainable pressure pumping industry needs to earn reasonable returns on capital in order to reinvest in their asset base and allow for development of technologies that help customers meet their goals trican was successful in 2021 in achieving some pricing gains which at this point have largely gone to offsetting continuing inflationary pressures which continue to become more acute we are experiencing inflationary pressure in all of our major cost categories including fuel proppant parts and labour as the industry seeks to ramp up activity continued price improvement is essential to support a strong industry and we will continue to work with our customers to achieve a level of pricing that delivers a sustainable return to trican shareholders while meeting our customers needs for safe efficient and environmentally conscious pressure pumping services capital expenditures and divestitures capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 53 9 million 12 8 million for the year ended december 31 2020 related to growth capital maintenance and infrastructure capital capital expenditures were funded from cash flows from continuing operations of 73 9 million for the year ended december 31 2021 in early 2021 the company successfully completed a field trial of tier 4 dgb engine technology the tier 4 dgb engine displaces up to 85 of the diesel used in a conventional pumper with clean burning natural gas combined with trican s idle reduction technology these upgrades result in lower overall fuel consumption and in turn reduce carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions in 2021 the company successfully completed the upgrade of its first set of existing pumping equipment with tier 4 dgb engines which were deployed in q4 2021 underpinned by a long term contract in q3 2021 the company announced that it would be upgrading a second fleet bringing trican s total tier 4 dgb fleet to 84 000 hhp the upgrade program was undertaken in late 2021 with deployment of the equipment anticipated in the second half of 2022 tier 4 upgrades are a key component of trican s esg strategy and commitment to improving the sustainability of our operations reduce environmental impacts and supporting our key customers to further advance their esg goals customer response has been favourable and the company is prepared to commit additional capital to the conversion of existing duel fuel diesel powered fleets to tier 4 dgb engines if internal capital return metrics can be achieved on the capital investment required the cost of the upgrade for the second low emissions fleet is expected to be approximately 28 million approximately 11 million was spent in 2021 with 17 million in capital to be spent in 2022 accordingly the company s preliminary 2022 growth maintenance and infrastructure capital budget has been set at 65 million the capital budget is expected to be fully funded from available cash resources and free cash flow generated through the year we will continue to manage our balance sheet prudently ensuring financial returns are commensurate with any balance sheet risk assumed our ability to generate strong operating cash flows and our financial flexibility will provide required capital to allow for selective investments that meet our return hurdle rate including ongoing participation in our recently renewed ncib program hydraulic fracturing fleet trican s hydraulic fracturing equipment is specifically designed to meet the demands of the higher intensity regions of the wcsb including the montney duvernay and deep basin formations these regions account for approximately 80 of the required hydraulic horsepower demand in canada additionally trican s fleet also includes an industry leading 170 000 hhp of conventional dual fuel engine fracturing pumps which displace higher particulate diesel fuel with cleaner burning natural gas the existing dual fuel fleet will be complemented by trican s tier 4 dgb fleet of 84 000 hhp when the second fleet has been deployed in the second half of 2022 these investments reflect trican s commitment to becoming an industry leader in esg practices by reducing the environmental footprint of our operations the company s fleet of hydraulic fracturing pumps at december 31 2021 is presented in the table below at december 31

you knew this was coming democrats are trying to steer blame for ukraine invasion to trump joe biden who said he d tolerate a minor incursion into ukraine by putin got one now he s all lathered up democrats however were not about to let biden take the blame for his own weakness msnbc political analyst elise jordan who apparently was in the same line as kamala harris when brains were being passed out had this to say on morning joe host mika brzezinski asked political analyst elise jordan about the idea elise jordan some on the right are criticizing or or really using this as an opportunity to point out that russia did not invade or threaten ukraine during the trump presidency but has in other presidencies before and after what do you make of this assessment jordan proceeded to credit brzezinski for leading her to the conclusion that putin didn t need to invade because trump was his puppet well richard and i were just talking about this off camera and i was asking him if he thought that the madman theory had done anything to deter putin but you pointed out putin already had whatever he wanted from trump so he didn t necessarily feel threatened if that sounds stupid it s because it is stupid putin wanted ukraine he didn t get it under trump he didn t even try then the atlantic s anne applebaum was eager to display her ignorance as well i think it is also important to remember going back to something that we talked about earlier that putin you know has made various efforts to undo western military support for ukraine including during the trump administration and if you remember this the the argument over trump s first impeachment was about trump refusing to give military aid to ukraine because he imagined he could get some dirt on joe biden from the ukrainians trump began sending javelin anti tank missiles to ukraine in 2017 ben shapiro skewers the washington compost via not the bee putin invades ukraine eugene robinson man putin probably would have invaded ukraine if biden weren t here ben shapiro benshapiro february 22 2022 all of this is ridiculous at face value let s rev up the wayback machine it was back in 2014 when russia invaded crimea and part of donbas you might remember that barack obama was president in 2012 he hammered mitt romney for saying russia was geopolitical threat and he added the 80s called they want their foreign policy back you might also remember who vice president at the time was poroshenko then ukraine president asked obama for weapons and instead got blankets you might also remember that not long after taking office obama withdrew the poland missile shield in a bow to putin in 2016 politico described obama s ukraine policy as a shambles you will also note that between the years of 2017 and 2021 putin did not invade anyone you might also remember who the president was the weakness that pervaded the obama administration was passed on to the feckless biden regime biden has brought back the shambles donald trump says that he and putin spoke about ukraine and told putin not to invade ukraine i said you can t do it you re not gonna do it trump said but i could see that he wanted it i used to ask him we used to talk about it at length putin did not invade ukraine while trump was in office he waited for a weakly democrat to take office he waited for a namby pamby mentally addled geriatric to make a move of course biden has reason to want to save ukraine preserving hunter biden s financial interests not many people know this russia has had troops in donbas for almost a decade technically they re adding to their stocks the class clown of the senate tim kaine also made a pathetic effort to smear the gop senator tim kaine d va said tuesday on msnbc s all in that the upcoming vote in congress to sanction russia for their invasion into ukrainian territory will expose if republican lawmakers are appeasers of russian president vladimir putin that s some funny stuff given that it was his president who lifted sanctions on the russians it was also his president who dismantled the eastern europe missile shield to appease putin so let s recap 2012 obama d says russia is no threat the cold war is over 2014 russia annexes crimea obama d sends blankets 2017 2021 nothing happens trump r sends lethal weapons to ukraine 2022 putin moves on two ukraine provinces when biden d is in office 2022 biden is a poltroon them s the facts 0 0 votes article rating
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video prop 47 reclassified theft offenses from felonies to misdemeanors including shoplifting it doesn t mean people can steal up to 950 in goods without consequences proposition 47 a law enacted in california in 2014 has been brought back into the public eye following a segment that aired on fox news the proposition reduces the penalties for some non violent drug and petty theft offenses some republican lawmakers in california are now pushing for a bill to repeal proposition 47 while other lawmakers are looking to amend it a recent poll also found that most voters surveyed would support changes to proposition 47 the los angeles times reports we re proposing a pretty radical idea make crime illegal again in california assemblyman kevin kiley r calif who appeared on fox news in support of the bill to repeal proposition 47 wrote in a tweet during his february appearance on fox news kiley said we removed the consequence for stealing and what do you know it caused a lot more stealing under prop 47 you can go into a store and steal up to 950 worth of merchandise and it s not even charged as a felony it s not even a slap on the wrist some social media users have also claimed that the california law permits shoplifting and that shoplifting items worth less than 950 is not a crime the question can you steal up to 950 worth of merchandise in california without consequence under proposition 47 the sources the answer no you can t steal up to 950 worth of merchandise in california without consequence under proposition 47 the proposition reduced the punishment for certain theft crimes but it still classifies shoplifting as a misdemeanor what we found proposition 47 reclassified certain theft offenses from felony charges to misdemeanors according to california courts the proposition created a new misdemeanor offense called shoplifting which is punishable by up to six months in county jail according to california courts attorneys here here and here say shoplifters could also face a fine of up to 1 000 or both a fine and jail time shoplifting is defined under california s penal code as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed 950 before the passage of proposition 47 shoplifters were usually charged under the state s burglary laws which carried felony penalties according to robert helfend a criminal defense attorney in california in california burglary means a person enters an inhabited residence such as a home apartment boat or warehouse with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony the state s penal code says first degree burglary is punishable by up to six years in prison felony probation and or fines a person charged with shoplifting in california cannot also be charged with burglary or theft of the same property michael romano co sponsor of proposition 47 and chairperson of the california committee on the revision of the penal code wrote in an email to verify that the state directs savings from reduced incarceration into services such as mental health treatment and schools opponents of the law say it s led to an uptick in theft incidents but romano says proposition 47 has had no measurable negative impact on crime rates california s property crime rate in 2020 was significantly below what it was in 2000 down by 32 according to the public policy institute of california ppic california however there were statewide increases in property crime in 2012 and 2015 since 2000 california has implemented many criminal justice reforms no research to date has linked any of these reforms to changes in violent crime but they have been found to be contributing factors to coinciding temporary increases in auto theft and larceny the ppic writes in a 2018 research article published in the criminology and public policy journal the authors explain that proposition 47 also reduced other crimes in which the stolen property was less than 950 from felonies to misdemeanors those crimes include grand theft receiving stolen property forgery fraud and writing a bad check prop 47 was intended to impact future convictions and sentencing but also allowed for individuals incarcerated at the time for crimes covered by the measure to petition for resentencing the article says notably prop 47 required thorough review of an individual s criminal history and proper risk assessment before resentencing to ensure public safety charis kubrin ph d professor of criminology law and society at the university of california irvine is one of the article s authors she explained in an email to verify that proposition 47 does allow for the prosecution of shoplifting and other petty theft crimes just as misdemeanors instead of felonies
french pharmaceuticals giant sanofi and its british partner glaxosmithkline gsk will seek regulatory authorisation for a new covid 19 vaccine in the united states and the european union sanofi said on wednesday its vaccine had delivered positive results after phase 3 trials involving thousands of people the trials indicated that the vaccine was 100 per cent effective against severe covid disease and hospitalisation sanofi said in a statement it was also more than 50 per cent effective against all symptomatic covid the statement added sanofi vice president for vaccines thomas triomphe said the data was similar to the recent clinical data from authorised vaccines mr triomphe also emphasised no other phase 3 study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern including omicron the announcement of the positive trials which have not yet been released as is normal practice puts the vaccine on the last hurdle before a possible market launch sanofi s share price rose nearly 1 5 per cent on the paris stock exchange at midday the french pharmaceutical giant sanofi announced on february 23 positive results on a large scale for its anti covid vaccine developed with the british company gsk picture joel saget afp wounded french pride if the vaccine receives authorisation it will mark the end of sanofi s long struggle to develop a covid vaccine following numerous setbacks the french firm originally hoped to announce such results by mid 2021 but the date was pushed back by six months due to a dosing error then late last year was delayed again after difficulties finding people who had never been infected with covid to take part in the trials the delays and the renowned pasteur institute abandoning plans to develop its own vaccine in early 2021 dented the pride of a country that considers itself a leader on pharmaceutical technology sanofi also abandoned a previous vaccine project based on the mrna technology used by its quicker rivals pfizer biontech and moderna whose jabs have formed the backbone of vaccination efforts in many countries sanofi is now focused on a vaccine using a slightly less innovative technique based on recombinant protein technology also seen in the novavax jab there are hopes that sanofi s jab could appeal more to unvaccinated people who remain sceptical of mrna technology despite the reams of evidence on its effectiveness glaxosmithkline vaccines head roger connor said in the statement that the jab uses a well established approach that has been applied widely to prevent infection with other viruses including pandemic flu the eu has already pre ordered millions of doses of the vaccine and sanofi is likely to play a role in booster campaigns around the world and with many countries particularly in the developing world struggling to vaccinate their population there is likely still a market for newer vaccines

financial markets in moscow plunged on thursday as investors sold russian stocks and bonds ahead of what are expected to be increasingly severe u s and european sanctions in response to russia s invasion of ukraine the rts stock market fell more than 40 percent an astonishing decline that rolled back roughly 13 years of gains the yield on russia s 2 year government bond soared to 15 7 percent a one day jump of 4 5 percentage points markets are basically imploding jonas goltermann a senior economist for capital economics said on a client webinar just the threat of sanctions is doing the job global risks from the european conflict drove u s and european markets down as well in new york the dow jones industrial average dropped 2 5 percent or more than 800 points at the open germany s dax was off almost 5 percent while markets in paris and london also dropped advertisement the wild price swings come as president biden is consulting with leaders of the group of 7 democracies on plans to punish russia for attacking its neighbor the u s president is scheduled within a few hours to make public details of additional sanctions on russia including expected blows to the nation s most important financial institutions on tuesday biden s initial response to russia s military thrust into eastern ukraine was to cut off two major russian banks from u s financing and to bar american investors from buying russian government bonds yet the two banks veb and promsvyazbank are almost entirely domestically focused and funded and the russian government has little immediate need to raise money from foreign investors whose role in moscow s financial system has been ebbing advertisement they don t have a deficit to finance they re not desperate for money said elina ribakova deputy chief economist for the institute of international finance iif the banking system is very liquid they have extra cash sloshing around the biden administration s opening salvo this week drew swift criticism from some republicans who said it fell short of what was needed to deter a further russian plunge into ukraine even after the president added additional measures on wednesday targeting the company behind a controversial russian gas pipeline yet investors expect russia s 1 5 trillion economy smaller than new york state s to incur increasing damage if the crisis persists on wednesday one market gauge forecast russia s benchmark interest rate in 12 months spiking well into the double digits which could plunge the economy into recession according to iif data advertisement another measure of market jitters the cost of insuring against a russian default has doubled in one week an investor now would need to spend 431 000 to insure 10 million in russian government bonds against a failure by moscow to repay its debt the highest price in more than seven years biden s latest action reversing a position he adopted last year also imposed sanctions on nord stream 2 ag the company that is building an 11 billion pipeline to deliver russian natural gas to germany the project is wholly owned by a subsidiary of russia s gazprom the world s largest natural gas producer the growing financial fallout including declines in all three major u s stock markets on wednesday is largely a bet on further russian military action and american financial retaliation the market tumult also reflects the biden administration s determination to levy tougher penalties in response to wednesday s russian move against ukraine than the obama administration did in 2014 when russian president vladimir putin seized control of the crimean peninsula advertisement at that time u s officials restricted russian financial and energy companies access to u s capital markets and prohibited russian oil giants from obtaining the most advanced exploration technologies for use in arctic offshore or shale formations but the united states acting with its european allies also tried to minimize the impact of financial penalties on existing commercial relationships share this article share though the sanctions failed to convince russia to abandon the crimea they did take a toll since 2014 the russian economy has grown at an average annualized rate of less than 1 percent compared with more than 4 percent in the previous decade even as the united states imposed additional sanctions over alleged russian interference in the 2016 u s elections and what it called the state sponsored poisoning of opposition leader aleksey navalny putin moved to reduce his vulnerability to american pressure he learned quite a lot from his experience in 2014 economist desmond lachman of the american enterprise institute said advertisement russia almost doubled its foreign currency reserves and bulked up on chinese and japanese holdings at the expense of its dollar and euro assets moscow also has all but eliminated its stockpile of u s treasury securities selling all but 4 billion of a 97 billion stake it held in 2016 in what he described as the first tranche of u s sanctions biden this week barred american investors from buying russia s sovereign debt but after years of government budget restraint and with oil prices well above the level needed to balance government accounts moscow has only a limited need to issue the debt that the united states on tuesday sanctioned jp morgan chase analysts last month said russia will need this year to issue just 30 billion in ruble bonds foreign fund managers also hold just 20 percent of russian government bonds with american and european investors off limits russian authorities will probably lean on domestic banks to buy more government debt the banks have plenty of resources to do that and ultimately are backstopped by the russian central bank and its 630 billion war chest advertisement still new limits on the resale of russian bonds in the secondary market could further erode global appetite for moscow s debt securities it is a sort of time bomb said andrew shoyer a partner at sidley austin who advises corporations on sanctions it seems underwhelming at first but if other things start to have an impact it could bite biden s initial move against russia s financial system also targeted two state owned banks with links to the country s national security complex veb and promsvyazbank rather than commercial institutions that serve russian retail customers the domestic development bank veb finances major infrastructure projects such as railways and petrochemical facilities and may be best known for its role in funding the 50 billion sochi olympics in 2014 the bank s close ties to the russian government were illustrated in 2016 when evgeny buryakov a russian intelligence official who had been working undercover in the veb s manhattan offices pleaded guilty in federal court in new york to conspiring to act as an agent of the russian federation without notifying the attorney general he was sentenced to serve 30 months in federal prison and to pay a fine of 10 000 before being deported to russia in 2017 advertisement promsvyazbank finances the russian defense industry including by providing mortgages to russian military officers and operates as part of a scheme to assist the government in avoiding new sanctions according to the u s treasury department on wednesday promsvyazbank said it had prepared for the imposition of sanctions and was continuing to operate as usual to really make sanctions sting biden will need to hammer more prominent institutions like sberbank which processes more than half of russian wages and pensions

photo by h armstrong roberts classicstock getty images h armstrong roberts classicstock as a child growing up in the 1960s i remember hearing so many black families talking about their employee pensions all they understood was that when they retired their employer would continue providing paychecks for life this is what attracted many black families to the steel mills of northwest indiana as well as the us post office you also didn t need a college education to figure out how to receive those retirement benefits most people however are very unaware that most employers hire insurance companies to run their payouts for their defined benefit or pension plans about the defined benefit plan pension a defined benefit plan pension means that the company defines how much money the person will receive upon retirement this is similar to the calculations made by the social security administration with defined benefit planning the employee and employer add money and someone else figures out how to create the income payments as an employee your decision is really based on when you decide to claim your benefit so then in the 1980s employers began moving away from defined benefit plans aka pensions into defined contribution plans such as the 401 k and its siblings 403 b 457 and tsp in defined contribution plans how much money you can save annually in tax deferred accounts is actually determined by the united states congress in terms of lifetime income you are left to figure out how much monthly benefit you want to create through your savings investing and withdrawal strategies at retirement you can either spend it as you want or decide to receive a lifetime income by annuitizing your money you can do the same on your own but your contract is one on one with the insurance companies rather than being pooled through an employer defined contribution strategy typically an employer hires an actuary to forecast what your income will be in the future and manages the payout accordingly let s say that they will give you 60 of the average of your last three years of salary and that average is 100 000 in that case they would be targeting 60 000 per year most white households have not been exposed to these inner workings much less black families who have traditionally been underexposed to financial planning it s common to hear financial influencers extoll either saving to get the employer match or saving to the max i don t hear that tied to how much monthly retirement income that will create besides those who make less money may be fine living on social security alone how much you need to save depends on a host of factors most importantly it s really about how much you want to live on actuaries don t worry about that and simplify by targeting a percent replacement of income you may also find that works well for you too creating pension like income my mom is 93 years old and has been receiving paychecks since she was in her 60s those checks will continue coming to her until she dies side note her life expectancy was not 93 she s now the oldest living person in her family who knew my mom went to college to become a teacher soon after i started grade school a popular brand name amongst educators is tiaa it is an acronym for teachers insurance and annuity association i have heard many people extol the tiaa but also bemoan the word annuity tiaa is also a line on the tax return right next to its cousin the pension people will often reject things that they are unfamiliar with rather than decide to learn more by the way the word annuity and the annuity industry has been around far longer than words like amazon tesla and crypto if you want to make sure that you do not run out of money then you will want to purchase a single premium immediate annuity spia with some or all of your savings here s an example of a few companies and the lifetime income amounts that you would get upon investing in them i used the cannex database the monthly amounts are based on a 70 year old female she is single life using 401 k or ira money a 250 000 premium purchased on 2 22 2022 and income starting 3 2 2022 company 1 monthly income 1 289 21 company 2 monthly income 1 262 99 company 3 monthly income 1 256 06 company 4 monthly income 1 237 85 company 5 monthly income 1 207 04 remember the pension i mentioned above that my mother gets that is also considered as taxable income just like if it was a 401 k or ira back in the 1960s many black spouses usually women either never worked outside of the home or made that much money in comparison to their spouses they relied primarily on their husband s income like my mom that made receiving pension checks based on their spouses work record very important if they outlived their spouse the good news is that this feature can be added to a private annuity contract too this will however reduce current income if the payout was only for one life however all these are like the choices offered with pension contracts it is comforting to know that your retirement needs and expenses can be covered by income sources such as pensions social security and spia pension like income if you saved beyond what is necessary to cover those expenses through an annuity then you have great options some options include leaving money invested in the stock and bond markets tax on less investment risk spend it or save it for future generations closing thoughts you too can have pension like income similar to black families of the greatest generation and baby boomers i just know that as long as my mother lives her pension income will never run out maybe you d like the same benefit there are many variations of these instruments available to you seek out a qualified professional to help you understand and choose the option that s best for you and your family

how does gender equality affect the number of children a household chooses to bring to this world and their education this question is implicit to any policy initiatives that wish to empower women for example bhalortra et al 2021 find that mandating women s representation in parliament yields a decline in fertility and an increase in schooling in developing countries thus women s political power affects households and children in a recent paper hazan et al 2021 we examine how women s economic power affects households and children in one of the most dramatic shifts of economic power in human history common law countries such as australia canada england and the us began giving economic rights to married women in the second half of the 19th century the history of these rights is discussed in an interview here on vox doepke 2008 before this women s liberation married women were subject to the laws of coverture coverture had detailed regulations as to which spouse had ownership and control over property and income granting the husband virtually unlimited power within the household indeed so great was the husband s power that a common saying was that man and wife are one but the man is the one williams 1947 indeed eliminating coverture by granting women economic rights was perceived by legislatures to be so great a change to households that the main argument against reform was that whole social relations would be changed the husband was and ought to be lord of his household the regulator of its concerns and the protector of its inmates which if this bill passed he would no longer be mp beresford hope 1870 in order to examine the impact of coverture s demise on households we use the complete count us census from 1850 to 1920 we employ two separate identification strategies the first is to use an event study design to compare contiguous county border pairs between states that gave women economic rights at different times for example ohio gave rights before pennsylvania our methodology studies the effects of women s rights on people living in border counties in ohio which gave women rights before pennsylvania to their neighbours right across the state border in pennsylvania who are culturally and economically virtually identical while we constantly adjust our maps for an ever expanding us during this period figure 1 shows our county border pairs in 1920 at the end of our sample figure 1 the us in 1920 showing counties bordering states we find that women s rights led to a decrease in the probability of married white women age 20 40 giving birth by about 1 percentage point the effect increases over time and can be seen in figure 2 this implies a decline in fertility of about 0 2 children similarly we find an increase in the probability that a child went to school of about 5 7 interestingly the effect was the same for sons and daughters figure 2 the dynamic impact of women s rights on fertility event study analysis our second identification strategy exploits the fact that economic rights were not granted retroactively that means that couples married right before rights were granted and those married right after had very different experiences the 1900 and 1910 us censuses asked for the duration of current marriage which allow us to compare such couples our findings are very similar to those from the event study people married after rights were granted reduced their fertility by 0 2 children and increased the probability their children were in school as compared to people in the same county married before rights were granted thus it is plausible that couples married after rights were granted can account for our findings from the event study economic rights indeed give women power but why should women have different opinions than their husbands as to the number of children and their education doepke and tertilt 2009 summarised in doepke and tertilt 2008 argue that women for a variety of reasons prefer educating their children more than men do more education makes kids costlier which reduces fertility while we do not discount this mechanism we provide evidence for an alternative complementary story maternal mortality risk was large during this time with mothers dying during nearly 1 of live births and being horribly injured as a matter of course albanesi and olivetti 2016 this naturally made women prefer fewer children than their husbands as is well documented in modern developing countries ashraf et al 2020 we find that following the granting of women s rights states with higher maternal mortality risk saw dramatically greater reductions in fertility than states with lower maternal mortality risk we make a few more observations to conclude that increased women s power at home can indeed account for our findings first couples who were married after rights were granted and thus were subject to the new laws and changes in household power can quantitatively account for the changes we document in the event study second lawmakers at the time were concerned about this change in power as can be seen in both the quote above and griffin 2003 finally household wealth data in 1860 and 1870 allow us to see that wealthier households decreased their fertility by more after rights were granted this is consistent economic rights should affect women with wealth more than other women we also note that people were aware of the changes the new york times covered the evolution of women s economic rights across the country coverage included not only legal changes but important court cases and discussions by legal scholars other potential mechanisms to account for our findings make less sense one natural candidate would be that women s rights increased women s labour force participation rates increasing the time cost of children and thus reducing fertility however only about 5 of married women during this period worked and our analysis finds that this number did not change following the granting of women s rights similarly such a story might imply an increased desire to invest in a daughter s education since she might go out to work eventually we do not find a differential impact on daughters compared with sons our previous work on this topic hazan et al 2019a 2019b finds that women s economic rights led to deeper financial markets and more growth in general economic growth tends to lead to reduced fertility and increased education of children however this economic mechanism should affect all households and not just those married after rights were granted empowering women has been a policy theme of recent decades as discussed in djankov and greenberg 2021 yet women s economic rights are not universally respected our findings suggest that expanding these rights should increase women s power at home causing a household revolution of decreased fertility and more education which in turn promote growth and development thus in addition to being a moral imperative women s rights make good economic sense references albanesi s and c olivetti 2016 gender roles and medical progress journal of political economy 124 3 650 95 ashraf n e field
