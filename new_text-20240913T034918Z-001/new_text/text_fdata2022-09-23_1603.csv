financial advisors who shun esg products due to political backlash opaque sustainability criteria or supposed lack of client interest are missing out according to experts advisors can t afford to ignore the esg data now showing up in corporate financial disclosures or a movement of institutional and retail investors that now spans 35 trillion worldwide including 17 trillion in the u s alone said speakers at this week s association of african american financial advisors quad a vision conference in atlanta allan boomer an advisor who is the managing partner of new york based momentum advisors malik sievers head of esg strategy with charles schwab s asset management arm and morgan du plessix a relationship manager with impact investing technology firm ethic each dispelled notions suggesting that environmental social and governance criteria apply only to certain political bents or that clients don t care about sustainable investing boomer acknowledged that people s eyes glaze over when advisors with his firm raise the subject with clients or prospects in the end though the firm s focus on esg has allowed us to win a lot of business that we would ve otherwise not won by placing the industry jargon in a broader context he said we never use the word esg boomer added we never use the words socially responsible investing we speak to our clients about what do they want their money to say about them what should their portfolio say to the world from left to right morgan du plessix of ethic allan boomer of momentum advisors and malik sievers of schwab asset management spoke in a panel at this week s association of african american financial advisors vision conference tobias salinger the growing political noise surrounding esg belies the range of products available to clients of any religion or ideology and the sheer amount of the sector s assets between 2018 and 2020 u s assets invested in products classified as sustainable soared by 42 according to the global sustainable investment alliance a coalition of financial firms and advisors many planners and asset managers may be deceiving themselves if they think that clients view esg products as a distraction research firm cerulli associates found in a report last year and a purported lack of investor demand that soured advisors in a survey didn t hold true with clients based on our research advisors generally underestimate the demand their clients have for esg and should not interpret lack of proactive questions as a lack of client interest says cerulli senior analyst matt belnap said in a statement indeed sievers said esg is here to stay and advised the audience of advisors and other wealth management professionals that due to interest among younger investors in particular it s in everyone s best interest to really understand dig in here he and the other panelists responded to questions from advisors who said their clients would reject sustainable investing out of hand one advisor said esg is verboten among his clients because he s from texas and much of the practice s base comes from the energy sector while another said he works with law enforcement personnel who aren t drawn to social justice criteria used in many impact investing funds sievers grouped clients into three categories those who want to focus their portfolios around their own customized goals exploratory customers who may be looking for a couple of mutual funds or etfs based on specific themes and clients who ask for an esg screen in one area of a portfolio but not in another it s a dial not a switch sievers added this isn t an on off thing you have to basically as everyone s saying talk to clients figure out how much they want incorporated the reality is if you take a look at initially what clients are holding many of them have so called good esg characteristics and don t even know it ethic which closed a series c funding round this month of 50 million from investors including ubs venture and innovation arm offers other potential answers to clients qualms the firm uses direct indexing and separately managed accounts that mimic the returns of the benchmark stock index of advisors choice to enable them to create portfolios using any criteria ethic works with a couple of advisors practices based in texas already du plessix said advisors can tweak screens that exclude companies discuss the value of risk mitigation or simply remind clients of the importance of their particular faiths to them she said these companies are starting to realize that these issues are affecting them directly it s affecting their bottom line and if they don t start tightening up it s going to start affecting their financial productivity and therefore their investors portfolios as well du plessix said you can get creative with it how esg started and how a lot of investors still leverage esg is through faith based strategies so focusing on strategies that are specific around catholic values for example and making sure that they re not invested in companies that don t align with their religious values from wrongfully incarcerated to esg funds invested in prisons those conversations can lead in many different directions boomer related the story of a client who invested a lump sum wrongful conviction payment after spending 30 years in prison for a crime the customer didn t commit the client was appalled to find out that a previous advisor had invested part of his portfolio in a bond issue financing correctional facilities without ever discussing the asset boomer said the same client also told boomer he had mixed feelings though considering he had once worked the highest paying job available to incarcerated people building car parts for an auto manufacturer the client didn t want to threaten those opportunities for others who might then be forced to accept a job sweeping floors for a fraction of the pay boomer said it is complex and this is not about our view fully boomer said it s more about the client s view and so that client says ok i definitely don t want to own the prison bond but i might be okay depending on what aspect in which they re

the canadian press toronto the canadian dollar slid lower again thursday hitting lows not seen in more than two years a day after the u s federal reserve raised its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point the loonie briefly fell below 74 cents us in early trading according to xe com after crossing the 75 cent us threshold at the start of the week under a trio of closely linked pressures said rahim madhavji president of knightsbridge foreign exchange inc at a high level flight to safety rising u s interest rates and poor performing stock markets are kind of the key drivers that are making funds go into the u s dollar versus the loonie these pressures have been around for much of the year to chip away at the canadian dollar which has fallen from higher than 80 cents us in march but the downward slide has accelerated in recent weeks as optimism over how quickly rising rates might tame inflation fades said madhavji what s happened in the market is in the last month or two people have said hey we thought this was going to work by raising rates and now what they re saying is it isn t working we think they re going to have to get more extreme the prospect of further rising rates was indicated wednesday by federal reserve officials who forecast they would further raise their benchmark rate to roughly 4 4 per cent by year s end a full point higher than they had envisioned as recently as june the potential for higher rates in the u s makes the greenback more attractive by paying better returns while putting pressure on stock markets that these days account for about 80 per cent of the movement in the canadian dollar said madhavji the close link to equity markets means that the loonie hasn t seen the benefit it otherwise might have from the bank of canada also raising rates and commodity prices still being relatively high said shaun osborne chief foreign exchange strategist at scotiabank the cad has become quite attached to the sort of global risk backdrop and that s kind of overshadowed what should have been for the canadian dollar this year a pretty positive story about commodity prices he said he s been surprised that the loonie hasn t gotten more of a boost or held up better against the u s dollar from the bank of canada moving faster than the fed while the break with commodity prices not only oil but agriculture lumber and metal prices as well has also been hard to explain canada s currency has however held up better than many others sliding the least out of other major currencies against the u s dollar this year the higher dollar means that exporters and people like freelance contractors being paid in u s dollars will be happy while importers or those maybe shopping for a second home in florida will not a lower loonie might also make it harder for the bank of canada to stem inflation said osborne with the prospect of continued rising rates and pressure on economic growth madhavji said he expects things to get worse before they get better but that longer term after an economic reset he expects the canadian dollar to be back to trading around 80 cents us osborne said that the loonie s fate will be tied closely to what happens with global rate trends with no clear sources of near term recovery it s a little difficult at the moment seeing if we re not responding to commodity prices we re not picking up any advantage from relatively stronger growth and somewhat higher interest rates what will turn the canadian dollar around this report by the canadian press was first published sept 22 2022

effective as of august 1 2022 the delaware legislature adopted an amendment to section 102 b 7 of the delaware general corporation law dgcl that permits a delaware corporation to implement a provision in its certificate of incorporation to eliminate or limit the personal liability of certain officers of the corporation for monetary damages to the corporation or its stockholders for the breach of the fiduciary duty of care an exculpation provision prior to such amendment and since 1986 section 102 b 7 of the dgcl was only available to exculpate directors of a corporation from personal liability for the breach of the fiduciary duty of care but remained unavailable to corporate officers the delaware general assembly originally enacted section 102 b 7 to address a perceived crisis in the market for directors and officers liability insurance this article will address 1 key considerations concerning newly amended section 102 b 7 including among other things the limitations placed on exculpation the types of claims subject to exculpation the remedies that remain available with respect to exculpatory claims the types of corporate officers to which exculpation may apply and temporal requirements concerning the effectiveness of an exculpation provision in a corporation s certificate of incorporation and 2 a model exculpation provision including a discussion of its common features and the various terms and conditions to consider when drafting such a provision key considerations concerning newly amended section 102 b 7 a delaware corporation itself does not owe fiduciary duties to its stockholders and cannot be sued by its stockholders for breach fiduciary duties are owed by the directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders and therefore they are personally liable for any such breach section 102 b 7 of the dgcl allows a delaware corporation to include an exculpatory provision in its certificate of incorporation that eliminates or limits the personal liability of an officer to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty subject to the following conditions and limitations 1 only applicable to the fiduciary duty of care officers of delaware corporations owe a fiduciary duty of care and such duty is the same as that owed by directors of a delaware corporation if officers actions qualify for the presumptions of the business judgment rule the standard for a finding of a breach of the duty of care is gross negligence therefore delaware courts have held that in essence section 102 b 7 given the other limitations on exculpation set forth in subsections i ii and iv of section 102 b 7 discussed below permits a corporation to protect its officers for duty of care violations only that is liability for gross negligence 2 not applicable to the fiduciary duty of loyalty including bad faith conduct and obtaining an improper personal benefit section 102 b 7 i provides that exculpation provisions may not apply to officer for any breach of the duty of loyalty generally speaking the duty of loyalty requires officers to act in good faith for the benefit of the corporation and its stockholders not for their own personal gain further the duty of loyalty requires officers to refrain from engaging in conduct that could harm the corporation and its stockholders so that the duty may be applicable to conduct that involves a conflict of interest or involves bad faith on the part of an officer for that reason and in support and augmentation of the exclusion of duty of loyalty claims from exculpation pursuant to subsection i of section 102 b 7 subsections ii and iv of section 102 b 7 also prohibit exculpation provisions from applying to officer for acts or omissions not in good faith and to officer for any transaction from which the officer derived an improper personal benefit respectively thus officers may still be found personally liable for monetary damages for breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty 3 not applicable to intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law section 102 b 7 ii provides that exculpation provisions may not eliminate or limit the liability of officer for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law these categories of exemptions attempt to distinguish between wrongful conduct that involves officer intent and conduct that is the result of an officer s lack of due care 4 only eliminates or limits monetary damages not equitable relief or related claims the plain language of section 102 b 7 makes it clear that the statute applies to the elimination of an officer s monetary liability only and does not exculpate the underlying breach of the fiduciary duty therefore under delaware law officers continue to be subject to the fiduciary duty of care and an officer s conduct is still subject to equitable remedies including rescissory and injunctive relief as a practical matter however the unavailability of monetary damages against officers may effectively eliminate any real remedy when a stockholder has no knowledge of the corporate action of the officers until after such action is taken subject to any derivative claims that remain available as discussed in item 7 below further because the breach of the duty of care is not eliminated notwithstanding an exculpation provision a third party advisor such as an attorney accountant or financial expert can also be held liable for aiding and abetting an officer s breach of the fiduciary duty of care even if such officer is exculpated pursuant to section 102 b 7 5 only applies to certain corporate officers section 102 b 7 provides that the term officer shall mean only a person at the time of an act or omission as to which liability is asserted is deemed to have consented to service of process pursuant to 3114 b of title 10 in practice this means that the officer must have been at the time of the act or omission a president chief executive officer chief operating officer chief financial officer chief legal officer controller treasurer or chief accounting officer of the corporation or is or was identified in the corporation s public filings with the sec as a highly compensated executive officer of the corporation or is a person who has consented in writing to be identified as an officer for purposes of accepting service of process all other officers employees or agents of a delaware corporation are not entitled to the protection of an exculpation provision adopted pursuant to section 102 b 7 6 not self executing considerations when adopting including rationale for adoption and proxy advisory firm positions section 102 b 7 of the dgcl is an enabling provision only and it is not self executing in order for a delaware corporation to provide for the limitation of liability authorized by section 102 b 7 corporate action must be taken to affirmatively adopt an exculpation provision in its certificate of incorporation or an amendment thereto when a corporation is being formed or if it is going public via an initial public offering a de spac business combination a spin off or similar transaction the organizer can consider including an exculpation provision in the initial or in the case of an ipo a de spac business combination a spin off or similar transaction the new surviving public corporation s certificate of incorporation that includes both directors and officers if a delaware corporation is already in existence and is not going public then it should consider amending its certificate of incorporation to expressly include officers if there is already a director exculpation provision in effect which may require both board and stockholder approval depending upon its organizational and governance documents if the corporation is public this may also involve a board sponsored proposal in the proxy statement to be filed with the sec which would subsequently be approved by the stockholders after obtaining approval of any certificate of incorporation or certificate of amendment containing an exculpation provision such charter or charter amendment must be filed with the delaware secretary of state s office in order for the exculpation provision to become effective given that board and stockholder approval will likely be required for both private and public companies including companies anticipating going public to adopt or extend the protections of an exculpation provision to officers of a delaware corporation the board seeking this adoption or extension would want to present to the stockholders the rationale behind such action and why it is in the best interests of the corporation to make such changes the board would also need to address any potential objections thereto boards may want to emphasize that the amendment to section 102 b 7 of the dgcl partially remedies the inconsistent treatment of directors and officers both of whom have fiduciary duty obligations additionally the desire to recruit and retain the talent of a corporation and the protection from personal financial liability due to claims against officers would further support the board s proposal to adopt such a provision in the certificate of a corporation or amend it to reflect the same while it is unclear whether d o insurance carriers will give companies any credit on their premiums for including such a provision it is expected that the adoption of the officer exculpation provision would help temper insurance premiums which can be expensive and therefore might not be available to all companies however some stockholders may deem it unnecessary to extend exculpation protections to officers others may claim that officer exculpation could lead to careless behavior at the officer level which would hinder the development of a company s esg risk management and oversight existing public companies would also want to consider how proxy advisory firms such as institutional shareholders services iss and glass lewis co llc glass lewis view the change at the time of this writing neither has published a position on this topic however based on the 2022 u s proxy voting guidelines published by iss where the general voting guideline is to vote proposals on officer indemnification and liability protection on a case by case basis iss recommends voting against proposals that would liminate entirely directors and officers liability for monetary damages for violating the duty of care in light of that if iss updates its 2023 proxy voting guidelines to reflect the officer exculpation we may see iss either oppose officer exculpation and recommend against a related proposal to include such a provision or adopt an unfavorable policy with respect to the same however given that section 102 b 7 v prohibits exculpation provisions from eliminating personal liability of an officer for the breach of the duty of care if a litigation claim is derivative see the discussion in item 7 below then iss may not voice its opposition the 2022 u s proxy voting policy guidelines published by glass lewis takes a relatively mild position on this matter although it strongly believes that directors and officers should be held to the highest standard when carrying out their duties to shareholders some protection from liability is reasonable to protect them against certain suits so that these officers feel comfortable taking measured risks that may benefit shareholders and therefore find it appropriate for a company to provide indemnification and or enroll in liability insurance to cover its directors and officers so long as the terms of such agreements are reasonable still we would not be able to tell how glass lewis would weigh in on this topic in any case if the proxy advisory firms support the proposals to extend the protections of an exculpation provision to officers of a delaware corporation we would expect most public companies will pursue the charter amendments in their next stockholder meeting not necessarily in the upcoming proxy season and typically in their next annual general meeting of stockholders in addition to proxy advisory firms the board would also want to assess the view of large institutional investors 7 only applies to direct claims including class actions and not to derivative claims against officers subsection v of section 102 b 7 provides that exculpation is not available to n officer in any action by or in the right of the corporation i e a derivative claim this is a litigation claim brought by a stockholder on behalf of the corporation against its directors or officers typically alleging breach of fiduciary duty fraud or mismanagement generally harm to the corporation or to all stockholders pro rata in proportion with their ownership gives rise to a derivative claim while harm to the stockholders independent of any harm to the corporation gives rise to a direct claim unlike directors who may be exculpated for derivative claims under section 102 b 7 subsection v makes this protection unavailable to corporate officers however any damages from a successful derivative claim accrue to the corporation rather than to the stockholders so it is less attractive to stockholder plaintiffs than direct claims 8 exculpation of claims may not be retroactive exculpation provisions under section 102 b 7 are only available to corporate officers as of august 1 2022 further section 102 b 7 provides that no shall eliminate or limit liability of officer for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes effective i e when the certificate of incorporation or charter amendment is approved by the stockholders and then filed and accepted by the delaware secretary of state therefore any amendment will have a prospective effect only and shall not affect acts or omissions occurring prior to the effectiveness of the exculpatory provision however and as also discussed in the next section below exculpatory provisions may also be drafted in such a way so that any amendment or repeal of an effective exculpation provision in a corporation s certificate of incorporation by subsequent stockholder or legislative action shall not affect exculpation of personal liability of an officer for any acts or omissions occurring prior to the date of such amendment or repeal in this way corporations cannot retroactively weaken or eliminate protection for officers for otherwise exculpatory claims that already occurred 9 not applicable to other laws a section 102 b 7 exculpation provision cannot limit or eliminate liability if an officer is liable for an infraction of a federal law this limitation would include damages under without limitation the federal securities laws the antitrust laws or the racketeer influenced and corrupt practices act common features of an exculpation provision set forth below is an example of a standard exculpation provision that may be included in the certificate of incorporation of a delaware corporation limitation of liability a director or officer of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or to its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer v of an officer in any action by or in the right of the corporation per officer to the fullest extent permitted by law clause in some cases the board of directors and the stockholders of the corporation may elect to adopt an exculpation provision that essentially tracks the current language of section 102 b 7 so that they are relatively confident in the parameters and limitations of the exculpation applicable to the directors and officers in other cases as used in the model language above an exculpation provision may be proposed providing for elimination of liability in much broader language such as to the fullest extent permitted by the dgcl by doing so it would permit the corporation to not only exculpate officers and directors from personal liability for the matters currently set forth in section 102 b 7 but also any permissible limitations on liability embodied in future amendments of the dgcl conversely to the extent that limitations on liability are culled back in section 102 b 7 or elsewhere in the dgcl by future legislative action this would automatically become effective and would limit directors and officers use of the exculpation provision as a defense subject to the no amendments or modifications clause discussed below corporations may not be comfortable with this uncertainty given that such changes to the exculpation provision would automatically become effective upon any amendment to the dgcl elimination vs limitation of personal liability depending upon the preference of the board of directors the stockholders or both a corporation may seek to eliminate the personal liability of the corporate officers entirely or instead opt to partially limit such personal liability examples of ways to limit personal liability pursuant to an exculpation provision without eliminating all liability include instituting a dollar cap per corporate officer applying an aggregate dollar cap to the entire slate of corporate officers who were in office when the claim arose making exculpation applicable to only certain corporate matters but not others or a combination of these options in the example above there is bracketed language that places a dollar cap per officer on the amount of the limitation of personal liability for monetary damages further limitation or elimination of liability could be conditioned upon corporate officer action in connection with specific matters as provided in the model language above as a matter of practice it seems that the vast majority of delaware corporations have adopted provisions that entirely eliminate personal liability rather than partially limit it no amendment or modification clause the last sentence of the model exculpation provision provides that future amendments to the provision cannot be retroactively applied to impose monetary liability on a director or an officer for acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment as discussed above this provision attempts to protect directors and officers against the uncertainties of a future stockholder or legislative action if a director only exculpation provision is already in effect corporations with existing director only exculpation provisions might consider adopting a stand alone officer exculpation provision that is customized for the specific limitations and conditions applicable to a corporate officer under section 102 b 7 of the dgcl given its disparate treatment of

japan to lift covid 19 restrictions on foreign tourists from october new york united states japan announced thursday that it will lift tough covid 19 restrictions on foreign tourists reopening the borders after two and a half years speaking at the new york stock exchange prime minister fumio kishida said the pandemic had interrupted the free flow of people goods and capital that had helped the nation flourish but from october 11 japan will relax border control measures to be on par with the us as well as resume visa free travel and individual travel said kishida who is in the city for the united nations general assembly japan along with china has been a holdout in continuing tough restrictions on visitors as much of the world has moved on from the pandemic but unlike china japan never imposed a strict lockdown during the crisis tourists who come to japan will enjoy a weak yen which has plummeted so low against the dollar that the finance ministry intervened in the currency market thursday for the first time since 1998 the return of the visa waiver program suspended in march 2020 will restore the ease of access that saw a record 31 9 million foreign visitors to the country in 2019 since june japan has allowed tourists to visit in groups accompanied by guides a requirement that was further relaxed to include self guided package tours the cautious approach to reopening has been deliberate said james brady japan analysis lead at us based consultancy teneo kishida took office a year ago knowing that perceived mishandling of the pandemic had been a key factor in undermining public confidence in his predecessor s government brady told afp he has been extremely careful not to repeat those mistakes japan has recorded around 42 600 coronavirus deaths in total a vastly lower rate than many other countries and 90 percent of residents aged 65 and over have had three vaccine shots there is no law requiring people to wear masks but they are still near ubiquitous in public places like trains and shops with many japanese willing to sport masks when ill even before the pandemic while the return of mass tourism should give a slight bump to japan s economy the benefits are likely to be limited by china s zero covid policy brady said much of the economic benefit pre pandemic came from high numbers of chinese visitors coming and spending lots of money on tech products cosmetics he explained but currently chinese citizens face their own travel restrictions at home and won t be traveling to japan in large numbers there is pent up demand for travel to the country however according to olivier ponti vice president of insights for travel analytics firm forwardkeys searches for travel to japan reached their highest point this year at the end of august and while flight bookings were just 16 percent of 2019 levels in early september we d expect bookings to jump when the visa rules are scrapped ponti said demand from europe may still be subdued due to the increase in the cost of living in europe caused by the russian ukraine crisis plus the rising fuel costs driving up air travel costs said liz ortiguera ceo of the pacific asia travel association
new york a rare bear market in bonds hasn t gotten much attention but it may be inflicting more pain on investors than the downturns for stocks cryptocurrencies and other investments investment grade bonds those issued by governments and corporations with good credit ratings have fallen more than 20 from their peak in january 2021 that may not sound like a big deal when large u s stocks tumbled 20 within roughly six months and bitcoin halved in value this year alone but bonds are supposed to be the safe part of any portfolio investors expect them to offer stability when stocks and other risky investments take one of their notoriously sharp swings now even this part of investors portfolios is taking on water global bonds have entered the first bear market in a generation ubs strategists wrote in a recent report this year s returns for the widely followed bloomberg global aggregate index of high quality bonds look to be the worst since its 1990 inception it could be one of the worst years ever for bonds if not the worst bond prices around the world have been falling as central banks rush to raise interest rates in hopes of beating back the high inflation damaging economies globally sweden s central bank this past week more than doubled its key interest rate to 1 75 for example the european central bank recently raised its key rate by a record amount three quarters of a percentage point in washington the federal reserve announced its third such hike of the year this past week when interest rates rise they knock down prices for older bonds already sitting in investors portfolios that s because the older bonds yields suddenly look less attractive than what newer bonds are offering some bonds are protected from such price swings such as i bonds issued by the u s government but access to them is limited rates have risen quickly this year with the fed hiking its benchmark overnight rate up to a range of 3 to 3 25 from virtually zero at the start of the year that s helped yields hit their highest levels for two year treasurys since 2007 and for 10 year treasurys since 2011 the widespread expectation is that the fed and other central banks will keep raising rates which should maintain pressure on bonds many professional investors say that despite these challenges bonds should still be a safe part of any portfolio that s because other options look even more risky rising rates can hurt stock prices even more than bonds if corporate profits don t grow quickly and analysts are now slashing their forecasts for upcoming profits gold s price is also falling because of rising rates unlike bonds gold doesn t pay its investors any interest plus many investors hope the sharpest rate hikes may now be in the past and if a recession does indeed hit which some economists are predicting bonds could hold up better than other investments as investors shift money into them and out of stocks they have a reputation for safety after all

l a schools supt alberto carvalho on thursday announces a plan to stock campuses with the overdose reversal drug naloxone in the aftermath of a student s death at bernstein high school carolyn cole los angeles times los angeles public schools will stock campuses with the overdose reversal drug naloxone in the aftermath of a student s death at bernstein high school putting the nation s second largest school system on the leading edge of a strategy increasingly favored by public health experts the move which will affect some 1 400 elementary middle and high schools is part of the district s newly expanded anti drug strategy quickly assembled in response to student overdoses officials on thursday said nine students had overdosed across the district in recent weeks including seven linked to the bernstein campus and hollywood high school the response plans will also include expanded parent outreach and peer counseling the death of 15 year old melanie ramos who died in a school bathroom last week after ingesting a pill that she bought from another student has left the campus community reeling and touched off concern among parents throughout the 430 000 student district the pill contained fentanyl an opioid that is deadly in small doses naloxone is highly effective at reversing opioid overdoses if administered quickly by a nasal spray or injection l a unified will be using the nasal version which is as easy to use as any other nasal spray naloxone won t harm someone if that person is overdosing on drugs other than opioids so it s always better to use it in the case of a suspected overdose according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention the medication has a limited but highly effective way of reversing that condition allowing individuals to restore breathing said l a schools supt alberto carvalho adding that this safe solution lasts 30 to 90 minutes providing first responders and medical professionals the opportunity to care for a student we have an urgent crisis on our hands carvalho said research shows that the availability of naloxone along with overdose education is effective at decreasing overdoses and death and will save lives we will do everything in our power to ensure that not another student in our community is a victim to the growing opioid epidemic the extent of the crisis should not be underestimated said dr brian hurley an addiction psychiatrist and the medical director of the county health department s division of substance abuse prevention we are now in the worst overdose epidemic in the united states history and the worst overdose epidemic in los angeles county history hurley said and a lot of that is attributable to this high potency opioid fentanyl that s found its way into illicitly manufactured pills and to other drugs of abuse california law permits k 12 schools to provide and administer naloxone but does not require it michigan has adopted similar rules rhode island requires all schools to have naloxone and it can be administered by any trained nurse teacher without fear of liability school employees also can decline to administerthe medication new york state offers four free doses of naloxone to every high school but they don t have to accept it currently new york city schools do not have a policy to keep it in stock a district spokesman said some california colleges and universities are required to have the drug in stock under a bill signed into law by gov gavin newsom in august at least two other large school districts in the state have it on hand too although widespread use among the state s more than 1 000 districts appears to be uncommon san diego unified the state s second largest school system after lausd stocks naloxone at schools with students in sixth grade or higher since 2020 elk grove unified a large district in northern california has provided naloxone to school security officers and their supervisors in l a county the palos verdes peninsula unified school district recently had a local physician train all the district s registered nurses on how to administer naloxone and it is available to them at that district s high schools said supt alexander cherniss los angeles unified school nurses and school police would learn to administer naloxone but so could other staff carvalho cited the example of an assistant principal who had been a military medic he can do it he has the training carvalho said in an interview i think we ve maintained a pretty myopic view of who can do this the training is really not that difficult the decision to distribute naloxone makes sense said dr gary tsai director of substance abuse prevention and control for the county health department which issued an alert last week about the growing danger of illicit opioid pills obviously the best tool is prevention tsai said but the recent death of the bernstein student in and of itself would demonstrate the need to have naloxone on hand tsai said it tells you that students have been exposed in one way or another and the likelihood that they might be exposed on campus bringing counterfeit pills or come into contact with counterfeit pills on campus that clearly is a risk it s necessary and appropriate for schools to have naloxone on campus the county health department is providing naloxone at no cost to the district which also is receiving support in this effort from the los angeles trust for children s health and children s hospital los angeles initially the district will have a total of 300 packages each containing two doses school police patrols about 80 cars will get a package there will be enough packages for all high schools and likely all middle schools carvalho said he is committed to taking on purchase costs as necessary training for district staff in the use a naloxone will begin in early october providing naloxone at schools can be controversial frances esparza the former el rancho unified superintendent said she tried to move forward with naloxone training for staff but unfortunately the board majority stated that there was not a drug epidemic in high schools some parents could interpret naloxone s availability as a school district giving up on educating students on how to reject drug abuse some may fear it will even encourage drug use said annette anderson deputy director of the johns hopkins center for safe and healthy schools but she said parents need to keep in mind what she called an explosion in the level of risk noting that law enforcement reported an increase in the number of illegal opioid pills seized from 300 000 in 2018 to about 10 million in 2021 research suggests that students already were facing a mental health crisis prior to the covid 19 pandemic which made things worse such trends underscore the need for additional steps beyond making naloxone available she said we re seeing an unprecedented number of violent events happening in schools anderson said i think that this is all part of a trend where our young people are struggling with what it means to cope in modern society we as the caring adults need to be more intentional about how we are connected with our young people to help them to learn how to problem solve mediate conflict basically it s youth development all of these issues just really point to how covid and covid school closures in particular put a pause on our young people s growth and social development the l a unified announcement also emphasized mental health and preventive approaches the health information project organization will be brought in to train high school juniors and seniors to teach health education to their freshmen peers there is nothing better than a student peer to explain the consequences associated with fentanyl to other students carvalho said parents awareness about how to recognize and deal with drug abuse in their children will become a major focus of parent education efforts carvalho said the school system already provides drug abuse education at all grade levels and it was updated to include the risks of fentanyl such course materials and strategies undergo ongoing review officials said another element of the district response is mapping out where overdoses are occurring and focusing law enforcement resources in those areas said l a school police chief steven zipperman officials noted that lexington park near bernstein high was a location where the pills containing fentanyl were beingsold the new rules for higher education require that california community colleges and cal state campuses supply campus health centers with naloxone they also require colleges and universities to provide educational materials on preventing overdoses during student orientation the law which also requests similar action from the university of california board of regents goes into effect in january the legislation empowers students to prevent any more needless deaths and ensures that maybe one less parent receives a terrible phone call that will change their lives forever said state sen melissa hurtado d sanger who introduced the measure in a statement after the bill was signed times staff writers debbie truong and alejandra reyes velarde contributed to this story this story originally appeared in los angeles times

ripple labs ceo brad garlinghouse says a judge not a jury will ultimately decide the cryptocurrency trial of the century in an interview with fox business on thursday garlinghouse whose company has been locked in a widely publicized legal battle with the securities and exchange commission for nearly two years said he expects the case will not go to trial because he believes the judge has enough evidence to rule from the bench last weekend both parties filed motions for summary judgment in the southern district of new york asking district judge analisa torres to make a ruling based on the facts presented in the respective briefs the decision now rests with torres to rule in favor of one of the parties or let the case go to trial district judge calls out sec for hypocrisy in ripple lawsuit but garlinghouse is confident the latter won t occur because the facts of the case are not in dispute judges often remand cases to juries when there s a disagreement over the facts this is different both sides agree that the court can decide the case because what is primarily in dispute is the application of the law not a dispute about the facts there is no dispute that ripple sold xrp over the years and there is no dispute that ripple s customers use xrp to facilitate cross border payments over ripple s platform the disagreement involves whether xrp is a special type of security known as an investment contract that falls under the jurisdiction of the sec ripple contends that it never entered into any contract for an investment with any purchaser of xrp the sec argues that ripple s sales of xrp should have been registered with the sec based on court precedent trials and juries are really to determine if there s uncertainty about facts he said during an interview with the claman countdown the facts aren t in dispute here the law is in dispute lawyers close to the case tell fox business that judge torres likely won t make a ruling on the summary judgment motions until next year regulatory riddle an investigation into the sec v ripple case and its consequences for crypto the latest filing of the summary judgment motions could mark a crucial milestone in the case that s dragged on for nearly two years in december 2020 the sec sued ripple and its two chief executives brad garlinghouse and chris larsen for failing to register xrp with the commission thus putting the tokens in violation of federal securities laws the price of xrp fell dramatically when the lawsuit was announced and despite a rally during the 2021 bull run and a recent spike traders are of the opinion that the price remains suppressed by the lawsuit the sec continues to argue that because ripple used the profits from sales of xrp to build out its platform buyers of the xrp token were relying on the efforts of ripple to turn a profit thus satisfying a key requirement of the so called howey test that 1946 supreme court case is the precedent that determines whether an investment is a security and falls under sec oversight or whether it s a commodity like bitcoin and thus does not require sec registration the commission also alleges that by buying the token investors of xrp had entered into an investment contract with ripple similar to the purchase of stock meeting another requirement of the howey test ripple contends it has done nothing wrong and that sales of xrp on the secondary market are not influenced by the company and that no investment contract ever existed between itself and holders of the crypto token ripple s legal team has been vocal on its belief that the sec particularly its chairman gary gensler is trying to overstep his authority by assuming that all cryptocurrencies constitute securities crypto issues not just idiosyncratic to the space industry expert argues the sec has lost its way said garlinghouse congress gives the sec power the sec can t just take power once it s resolved the case could have far reaching implications for the crypto industry a ripple win could mean the sec and gensler may be forced to take a more measured approach to regulation possibly ceding some of its regulatory jurisdiction to the commodities futures trading commission which provides front line oversight of non securities such as commodities an sec win could see the agency expand its regulation of crypto well beyond xrp some industry experts say the sec could launch a similar case against ether the native token of the ethereum blockchain and the second most valuable crypto after bitcoin the ethereum platform was partially financed by selling unregistered tokens known as an initial coin offering in 2014 click here to read more on fox business since taking office gensler has noticeably sidestepped questions on whether he believes ether to be a security despite the token being deemed free from sec oversight under former sec chairman jay clayton earlier this month gensler signaled he would support the cftc having regulation over bitcoin which he has said is likely a commodity the sec had no comment

this story has been updated to clarify that torri jacobus is the former head of the city of albuquerque s civil rights office las cruces fewer than seven weeks until the nov 8 elections this is the season for political ads by candidates political committees and party organizations it is hard to miss them in print online or in one s mailbox one of the major themes in advertisements paid for by the republican party of new mexico is crime hitting democratic candidates including gov michelle lujan grisham and their party for past votes on measures which the gop argues were too soft on crime hindered law enforcement or coddled people convicted of serious offenses one negative advertisement in particular drew denunciations thursday for appearing to darken one of two figures in a stock photograph in a manner one community leader called blatantly racist the ads follow a similar provocative style using somber colors and stark fonts among tinted or filtered images from prison booking photos or featuring obscured and menacing figures the ad copy alludes to pieces of legislation supported in past sessions by local representatives often presenting them as favoring criminals over other citizens a postcard targeting democratic lawmakers in several districts including some in albuquerque las cruces and silver city shows a light skinned child in a barber s chair getting a haircut only the barber s hands are in view large in comparison to the child s head and with dark skin the text over the image conveys menace claiming the lawmaker voted to allow convicted sex offenders to receive professional licenses for activities such as cutting hair or working as a nail technician leaving unsuspecting women and children vulnerable to predators the claim is based on a 2022 amendment to new mexico s statute governing licenses for barbers and cosmetologists the change removed habitual drunkenness or habitual addiction to the use of habit forming drugs and conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude from a list of reasons to deny or revoke a professional license under the act photo tinted hands darkened the image of the boy getting a haircut is an image licensed for use via getty images istock service for a fee in the original image the hands of the barber appear to be those of a white man the hands are significantly darker in the republican party s advertisement while the child remains light skinned this doctored ad is a shameful attempt to stoke fear and division the rev charles e becknell state president of the southern christian leadership conference said in a statement digitally darkening the skin tone of the person in this ad while suggesting they are a sexual predator is blatantly racist and completely inexcusable torri jacobus former head of the city of albuquerque s civil rights office and now a community advocate said this ad relies on centuries old racist stereotypes in an attempt to instill fear in new mexicans and divide us alison riley a spokesperson for the state house democratic campaign committee likened it to historical use of blackface in performances and cartoons as a way of mocking the appearance of people of color state house majority leader javier marti nez an albuquerque democrat called it one of the worst dirty tricks i have ever seen from a political campaign gop says image supposed to resemble grim reaper in turn republicans accused democrats of crying racist and deflecting from their voting record the house republican whip rod montoya of farmington said the figure in the ad was gray not black and called any racial inference ridiculous what this mailer does depict is the danger in which democrats voted to put our children he continued citing a floor amendment to the measure that had been submitted by state rep stefani lord r sandia park lord s amendment which died on the floor would have restricted sex offenders from obtaining professional licenses charges of racism are simply a smokescreen to distract attention from progressives voting records which put the interests of convicted criminal over the safety of law abiding new mexicans montoya continued in a statement returning to the thesis of the ad campaign yet the party admitted to altering the colors of the image and darkening the hands state gop spokesperson mike curtis wrote in a text message it was darkened to a gray to resemble a grim reaper so as not to be interpreted as any race a true menace the grim reaper is a centuries old figure of death dating to the black death in europe and traditionally portrayed as a skeletal figure in a cowl and carrying a scythe riley said complaints from voters in several districts allegedly characterizing the flyers as racist themselves first drew the ad to their attention we re

odu economics professor bob mcnab says the federal reserve is raising interest rates to try to decrease demand and lower inflation as a result example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video norfolk va let s face it no one really likes to see interest rates continuously rise wednesday the federal reserve sharply raised its key short term rate by three quarters of a point for a third straight time even as its previous rate increases are being felt by households at all income levels the fed s latest move has raised its benchmark rate to a range of 3 to 3 25 the highest level in 14 years now more hikes are almost surely coming norfolk resident jeanne bowers said the increase is not a big deal to her but she did feel the impact recently it s done some damage with the loss of the stock market to my retirement accounts said bowers others like andrew lee from virginia beach call it a double edge sword saying we will have to budget ourselves more carefully old dominion university economics professor bob mcnab said it s a way to drive down demand to help lower inflation he said the average consumer will see changes in the stock market mortgage rates auto loans and even credit card use mcnab said there are ways to help alleviate the pain starting with remaining calm during financial stress when markets go into new territory and they correct it s usually three to four years before they regain the value they lost so if you panic now over the next six months and take all your money out of the stock market you re actually locking in your losses mcnab explained he said another thing to pay attention to is how you pay off your credit card debt are you carrying a balance because now that balance is going to create higher and higher interest said mcnab reducing what you spend getting out of debt if possible and watching your pocketbook are all things we can do in the short term to get through this period of economic uncertainty

tampa fla the inflation rate is causing pain to the wallets of millions of hard working americans but the recent hike in rates could be turned into a positive if you make sound investments the inflation fight has turned the s p 500 into a nightmare roller coaster ride sending stocks rising and falling with each interest rate increase but jon wax the president and ceo of waller and wax advisors said long term investors shouldn t worry pointing out the retirement part is important because for a lot of people who work they have the ability to put money into a corporate retirement plan like a 401 k and you re making that deferral with every paycheck wax said and if you continue to do that or even elevate the amount of money you re putting in now you re buying at lower prices and you will consistently be buying abc action news reporter michael paluska talked to wax via zoom we ve been doing many of these stories on inflation and people can t afford fuel and food or buy a home is there good news for our viewers that are middle class or lower middle class is there something that you can tell them about where we re headed the good news in this is that the federal reserve is very aggressive in dealing with this inflation problem and it s not something being overlooked or ignored in a way that it really can run off like crazy wax said we are probably going to have to deal with some pain in different areas as we deal with this he continued but this is the fallout for how much stimulus and how loose the money flows have been for the last two plus years and even longer so the upside is that people can focus in the areas where they need to be spending money and maybe delay the things that were excess luxuries that they really don t need to be doing right now according to the bureau of labor statistics the consumer price index rose 8 3 over the past year as of august a slight slowdown from 8 5 in july some prices have already fallen significantly though for example gas prices dropped 10 6 in august the bureau said meanwhile rate increases appear to have slowed critical sectors of the economy sending mortgage rates higher and slowing the construction of new homes wax said the increased rate is necessary to normalize the market and urges people to remain calm and weather the storm in the world of investing you think about retail markets and if you walk into a retail store you want to look for a sale yet whenever the stock market falls or goes on sale it s as if people think their instinct is to run out the door and wait for things to be higher wax said these are the kinds of times we rely on the wisdom of someone like warren buffett who says to be fearful when others are greedy or be greedy when others are fearful and he has a second one you make the most money in a bear market you just don t know it at the time
what does jerome powell chair of the federal reserve understand that vladimir putin doesn t ok i know that may sound like a trick question or a desperate effort to offer a counterintuitive take on recent events we may say that the fed has gone to war against inflation but that s just a metaphor russia s war on ukraine unfortunately is all too real leading to tens of thousands of deaths among both soldiers and civilians yet the fed and the putin regime have this in common both took major policy actions this week the fed raised interest rates in an attempt to curb inflation while putin announced a partial mobilization in an attempt to rescue his failed invasion both actions will inflict pain one important difference however aside from the fact that powell is not as far as i know a war criminal is that the fed is acting to maintain its credibility while putin seems determined to squander whatever credibility he might still have

story produced by manchester ink link a member of photos by stacy harrison manchester nh on a hot and humid august afternoon rachel jones and her husband glen are sitting on a bed in their air conditioned room at the comfort inn it has been home for them and their 11 year old granddaughter for nearly two months ever since their new landlord hiked their rent and then evicted them for renovations they don t know how long they will be in the hotel the new hampshire emergency rental assistance program nherap through southern new hampshire services snhs is covering the cost snhs is the community action program cap for hillsborough county where the state s two largest cities manchester and nashua are located they are not alone she said there are about 70 other people at the hotel who were evicted as well we re all in the same boat she said the pandemic and hot new hampshire real estate market has disproportionately affected the state s very low income who are being ousted from their homes by current landlords citing the need to renovate the aged housing stock in some cases the buildings are redone in others not so much but the bottom line is apartment dwellers are left scrambling to find suitable and affordable places the squeeze on housing has left about 600 households 750 to 900 people residing in motels with the federal government footing the bill at a cost of millions of dollars a month those funds doled out through the emergency assistance rental program are expected to run out by the end of the year experts say when that happens they say local welfare departments across the state will be inundated with people seeking help by law welfare departments have to help the poor and cannot run out of money renovation eviction an alarming trend todd marsh president of the new hampshire local welfare administrators association and director of rochester s welfare department said renovation evictions are happening statewide people in rochester approach the welfare office almost daily asking for a list of landlords with affordable housing we will give them some landlord numbers knowing that a lot of them have changed because it s hard to keep up with buildings being sold he said we ll give them what we think we have but then there s that look in their eyes they don t know where to go even people with two people working in the household making what used to be good money who no matter how much they shuffle their money around they can t afford the rent they ve never been there before late in august he said all of rochester s motels were full but he didn t know how many of the guests were there because they had been evicted that is because those costs are being covered by federal funds through the temporary erap the federal emergency program enacted to help tenants affected by the covid 19 pandemic when the funds run out however he expects welfare offices across the state will be inundated with requests for help grace lessner director of communications and marketing for nh housing which distributes the erap funds said there were 600 households one or more persons staying in motels statewide at the end of july many of those individuals like the joneses became homeless after being evicted because they couldn t pay skyrocketing rents and or their building was sold and the new landlord wanted them out so they could renovate the place affordable housing is hard to come by when new hampshire has a vacancy rate of 5 percent elliott berry managing attorney of the manchester office of new hampshire legal assistance and director of the housing project estimates those 600 households translates into 750 to 900 people in hotels motels that s alarming he said jessica margeson hosts a tenants clinic each wednesday afternoon at the granite state organizing project 1045 elm st suite 201 manchester which sponsors the clinic in july snhs had 400 households on a waiting list for motels she said by sept 12 they no longer tally it by households i was just told last week it s a 10 month waiting list now margeson said they are not even going by how many households are on it she said hillsborough county applications for federal assistance are growing as well assistance applications went from an eight week backlog to closer to 15 to 16 weeks she said and while a request for the precise cost of hotel vouchers was not answered for this story margeson said the cost for a room at the comfort inn is 120 per night which is about 3 600 per month and when multiplied by 600 households as much as 2 16 million per month new hampshire s hot housing market margeson estimates the hot real estate market and the subsequent ever increasing rent hikes has eliminated 75 percent of affordable housing in the state s largest city over the past year manchester and concord have topped realtor com s hottest markets list nationwide manchester held the top spot for nine out of 12 months and concord ranked no 1 in june 2022 manchester with an abundance of 100 plus year old multi family buildings was just what investors were seeking rundown apartment buildings which are affordable for those with low income fueled the housing rush for investors many of whom after buying the properties upped rents by the hundreds and or served long time tenants with renovation evictions marsh said many renters are unable to move money around to cover the increased monthly rents tenants report rents being doubled sometimes 1 500 a month or more many who have never been behind in their rent in their lives quickly fall behind and are served eviction notices once evicted they have an even harder time finding a home because many landlords will not consider someone who has an eviction on their record no matter the reason most tenants opt to fight the evictions because they discover there is nowhere to go any apartment they can afford they are told has a years long waiting list the pricier ones have a waiting list of up to four years according to lee ann blanchard 59 another motel resident blanchard won t say why she was evicted from her nashua apartment in the cotton mill 30 front st where she had resided in a subsidized unit for about six years a former hair stylist blanchard is medically disabled and receiving supplemental social security she said she decided not to fight the eviction but at the time she had no idea it would be impossible to find another affordable place after being evicted she initially stayed in her parents finished basement arriving with trash bags full of clothes and two broken arms the result of a fall weeks earlier that didn t work out and she found herself on the streets calling snhs for help she was given a voucher for the manchester hotel room i m a happy go lucky woman but this is tough she said i m a 60 year old handicapped woman facing homelessness for the first time as a single mom who raised three kids on her own here i am now having everybody else pretty much dote on me or help me i don t like it both jones and blanchard say they are fortunate to have hotel accommodations their rooms are bright and come with a television desk small refrigerator microwave and air conditioning they also may use the motel s workout room swimming pool and sauna they also have access to a function room where they can host birthday parties or other special events the hotel also includes maid service although blanchard was quick to help the employee making her king size bed marsh said people with the lowest incomes are the ones being hurt the most by renovation evictions say someone s income on ssi supplemental security income is 850 a month there was a time that 850 a month could house and feed someone it s no longer the case said marsh who has been rochester s welfare director for 20 years he said people are approaching the welfare office because they were struggling previously to pay the rent and now they can t afford it and for those who can he said one major car repair bill or some other unexpected expense is enough to set them on a path to an eviction and homelessness no legislative relief in nh in new hampshire there is no limit on how much a landlord can raise a tenant s rent tenants also have no recourse when a landlord goes to court and swears under oath that the occupants need to vacate the apartments in order for them to make extensive renovations however there is no penalty if a landlord does no renovations or merely paints the kitchen calls it a day and brings in a new tenant at a markedly higher rent in the last legislative session there was an attempt to give tenants 90 days to find another place when being evicted in the senate the number of days was reduced to 60 days and then passed in the house however it was defeated nh state rep pat long said legislation introduced in the last session failed in part because the landlord lobby is so strong we were trying to get a 60 or 90 day extension for evictions because when eviction is not due to lack of payment you have to give them time long said but then it died the landlord lobbyists are very strong and also what is an issue in manchester is not necessarily an issue in rural parts of the state yet we know that there are people from all over coming to manchester for services until the state municipalities and landlords collaborate on amenable solutions this issue will keep on devastating our citizens while they continue as workers in our economy which by the way will eventually hurt our economy he said erap has provided the lifeline those displaced tenants need lessner said the nherap new hampshire erap program has been a critical tool in providing nh households a lifeline by providing rental and utility assistance to individuals and families suffering impacts from the pandemic over 190 million has been provided to benefit over 20 000 households statewide in addition the state has also committed 100 million to impact the availability of affordable housing through the investnh program she said caps community action programs around the state are using the nherap funds to assist households get families housed and provide support services recognizing that at some point the federal government will no longer be providing this important resource she said in some instances individual caps contract with motels hotels for ease of payment at the end of two months those lucky enough to get the vouchers must reapply for it and prove they have been searching for an apartment stressful and depressing the joneses say while the accommodations are nice it isn t home they pay out more than 400 to store their household goods and daily they go online searching for an apartment the situation is stressful and depressing rachel said glen suffered a minor stroke and is struggling with a bout of depression rachel was born and raised in manchester while glen moved here from massachusetts when he was 15 settling into the 191 beech st apartment he called home for 24 years rachel joined him 15 years ago both worked until they became disabled he worked construction she worked in manufacturing their rent was low 750 a month with utilities included but glen was the handyman for the landlord charles king of hudson taking care of what he calls stupid stuff a tenant loses his keys and can t get into his apartment minor repairs that sort of thing he said he was a nice guy rachel said of king but he wanted to retire to florida to be with his mother who is in her late 80s or early 90s she said the new owner rnc llc which is owned by richard keyes of new boston made king an offer he couldn t refuse glen said king who bought the six unit building in 2000 for 126 000 sold it to rnc in september 2021 for 478 000 once the sale went through rachel said their rent was raised to 1 100 a month and they were handed an eviction for renovations the new landlord also installed electric meters for each unit so they also were required to pay the utilities rachel said they asked the new owner if they could return to their apartment once it was renovated and was told no they wanted fresh tenants rachel said wouldn t a landlord want someone like them who always paid the rent and took care of the building as well they just kick you out the door like you re a piece of trash she said when asked about the joneses keyes said the renovations to the building were necessary after he purchased the century old building at 191 beech st he spent about 125 000 on renovating it which included new electrical heating flooring appliances doors windows paving etc keyes said ledgeview commercial properties his management company notified all the tenants of their intention to renovate the building which he said was infested with bed bugs since the renovations were complete keyes said he re rented the units for 1 250 each plus utilities all the units are occupied asked if the joneses were told they wanted fresh tenants when they asked if they could return once the apartment was renovated keyes said he didn t know if that was what they were told but said that isn t a term he uses but he did say that there were three adults and a child living in the small one bedroom apartment it really was just too small for that many people he said keyes 58 said after years of work first in the u s army then in the computer field and in sales decided to find something else to invest in other than the stock market after it crashed in 2008 he initially bought two small buildings in manchester sold them and then bought others he now owns a total of eight buildings seven in manchester and one in milford with a total of 47 apartments now retired keyes said he lives comfortably from the income the rental properties generate i do think there are a lot of people taking advantage he said it s out of control stephanie savard chief external relations officer with families in transition and director of the new hampshire coalition to end homelessness said she does not know how many people are being left without a home because of evictions but she said just hearing from providers it s out of control she said nh housing is helping people hang on to their units but they are being asked to leave it s impossible to find apartments she said the pandemic rent increases substance abuse mental health all just became this perfect storm it s the tip of the iceberg she said it all began with the lack of affordable housing before the pandemic it s frightening she said especially with winter coming and the cost of oil gas and especially electricity all increasing savard who has worked in the housing field for 26 years said she never saw a vacancy rate so low we ve had increases in homelessness but undoubtedly this is the worse i ve ever seen fit she said has no plans to add beds for the homeless because they have no room to expand their focus she said is on affordable housing they have 138 beds at the 199 manchester st shelter with 131 to 135 filled each night at this time of year but which will be at capacity as soon as the weather cools they have another 11 units available for families which are full marsh said the board of directors of nhlwaa are in contact with lynn lippitt director of housing services at new hampshire housing concerning what is happening as of july he said nh housing saw no end date to erap nh housing at the time had received another 30 million in federal funds and was expecting more he wrote the state s welfare directors on july 19 2022 he said nh housing is monitoring the program closely and will provide a reasonable notice when they determine funds will be fully expended housing advocates expect that will be before the year ends unless more funding is procured should the funds run out marsh said people are expected to turn for help to their local welfare offices he said the state s welfare laws are among the oldest and are modeled after the poor laws established during the elizabethan era circa 1600 in england which provided for the elderly poor and those unable to work the state welfare association he said has approved an ethics agreement under which erap assisted households in emergency housing are to be referred to their municipality of origin when seeking local welfare assistance that means when the funds run out a person from derry being housed in a motel in manchester will be referred to the derry welfare office for assistance not manchester so where local welfare offices caught a break because of the erap funds that may soon come to an end under state law marsh said no welfare office can run out of money in the 1970s elliott berry managing attorney of the manchester office of new hampshire legal assistance and housing project director led the nhla s effort to try and implement rent control it failed and as he contemplates his retirement at the end of this month after spending his entire career in these trenches for tenants rights berry calls it the biggest failure of his career

abe s expensive state funeral divides taxpayers a man wrapped in a poncho with an anti abe placard joins a march against the government s funding for the funeral of late prime minister shinzo abe on monday afp in a country where voters are increasingly opposed to a state funeral for shinzo abe support for the event remains high among younger japanese who see themselves as having benefited from his economic policies during his record run as premier for many voters in their 20s abe s name is synonymous with a soaring nikkei stock average and almost full employment under his abenomics programme for older people revelations about his links with a religious sect whose founder was convicted in the united states of tax fraud rekindled memories of suspected graft and favouritism scandals that clouded his government i want to take pride in the fact that abenomics became known around the world said koharu yano a 20 year old student at a university in tokyo even if there were some flaws it s important to emphasise the positive aspects japan s longest serving premier was shot dead in july by a gunman who authorities said targeted abe for his ties to the unification church which he blamed for bankrupting his family the incident exposed embarrassing associations between the ruling liberal democratic party ldp and the religious group which has a long list of court rulings against it over its fundraising methods that caused sentiment to shift against the taxpayer funded event the first of its kind for a former premier since 1967 it even led a man setting himself on fire near the prime minister s office on wednesday with police saying he left a note saying he opposed the state funeral kyodo news reported the man was in his 70s and conscious when taken to a hospital it added a poll conducted by the asahi newspaper between sept 10 and yesterday found 58 of those aged 18 29 approved of the memorial service with the percentage sliding to 26 among those 70 or above surveys by public broadcaster nhk last month and this month found similar trends by age group the most common reason for backing the event was respect for his achievements the paper said current prime minister fumio kishida has seen his support fall to its lowest level in several polls since he took office nearly a year ago with many respondents saying they don t think he is doing enough to cut ties between the unification church and the long ruling ldp i m against the state funeral said hiroshi kanda 76 a retired trading company employee living in kanagawa prefecture near tokyo i ve supported the ldp for a long time but abe s scandals put me off the state funeral for queen elizabeth ii the united kingdom s first since pm winston churchill s memorial in 1965 has further fuelled debate in japan over whether abe deserves similar honours in britain there s a generational divide on support for the monarchy with older residents viewing the crown with more favour than younger people surveys showed mr kishida has prioritised efforts to ease the economic disparities he said were a side effect of abenomics in an implicit criticism of his former boss his policies initially brought him support from middle aged and older voters in contrast with abe who was more popular with the young koji nakakita a politics professor at hitotsubashi university in tokyo said much of the political gulf between generations can be put down to the times in which they grew up people are deeply influenced by the political thinking and phenomena of their youth dr nakakita said meaning that those who grew up under neoliberal administrations are more likely to support abe the senior generation came up under moderate policies and tend to like mr kishida s centrist position he said tokyo graduate student misaki onodera s childhood was overshadowed by the collapse of her father s real estate business in the early 2000s which left both her parents working two jobs to pay off debts she grew up hearing her father talk about abenomics and how the economy seemed to be improving her parents eventually found their feet again i have been able to go to university and on to graduate school the 24 year old said i m not saying that s all down to abe but politicians who find fault with the way a person s funeral is held are cruel while opinions on abe s economic legacy are divided the nikkei stock average more than doubled between 2012 when he took office and 2020 when he resigned citing ill health unemployment fell from more than 4 in 2012 to less than 3 in 2017 and stayed there for years the funeral may have cost mr kishida the confidence of some older voters whose support buoyed him earlier this year so far he has little prospect of relying on the young far less numerous and less likely to vote to make up the difference i had high expectations for kishida because i thought he would be good at listening unlike abe said yoshinori marukawa a 70 year old retired employee of a car manufacturer living in hiroshima prefecture that makes me all the more disappointed over the state funeral problem it shows the ldp s arrogant attitude hasn t changed since abe s time bloomberg

technology sectors to avoid regulatory discord in future several cyber policy experts told us they said the potential overlap between certain provisions in the newly announced draft indian telecommunication bill 2022 released on wednesday and the existing it act the digital india act that s in the pipeline and the upcoming personal data protection pdp bill was a matter of concern the new telecom bill includes over the top ott communication services such as whatsapp telegram and signal under its ambit the proposed it regulations are also expected to include provisions that will govern these companies they said as the government is drawing up both telecom and it laws afresh it needs to decide which of the two regulators the telecom regulatory authority of india trai or the proposed data protection authority dpa under the pdp bill will have oversight of these companies they added currently apps such as whatsapp are regulated under the it act while provisions under the it rules notified last year have also increased oversight of significant social media firms such as whatsapp including provisions pertaining to traceability of messages the newly released draft telecom policy expands the definition of telecommunication services to include ott communication services which means these companies will also be regulated under the new law ott services are already being

san diego officials are proposing new cannabis regulations that would allow more dispensaries to open and would close a loophole that allows some existing dispensaries to avoid city scrutiny of their operations the city council s land use and housing committee unanimously approved both proposed rule changes thursday and forwarded them to the full council for final approval this fall advertisement newsletter get our essential investigative journalism sign up for the weekly watchdog newsletter for investigations data journalism and more enter email address sign me up you may occasionally receive promotional content from the san diego union tribune leaders of the local cannabis industry praised the proposals as sensible updates to city regulations but critics of cannabis legalization say the changes would be another example of san diego being too accommodating to businesses they say damage public health the first change is a reaction to san diego s once a decade re drawing of boundaries for the city s nine council districts based on population and demographic changes reflected in the 2020 u s census advertisement twelve of the 27 dispensaries with city permits will shift from one council district to another under the new boundaries which take effect in november that significant upheaval matters because current city regulations allow no more than four dispensaries per council district the proposed rule change would allow council districts to have more than four if the re drawn boundaries are the cause of such an increase only north coastal district 1 would see an increase to five permitted dispensaries increasing the maximum number of dispensaries allowed citywide from 36 to 37 advertisement but redistricting will also redistribute existing openings for additional dispensaries there will be an increase in the number of dispensaries in districts 3 4 and 9 limiting opportunities there but the shift of dispensaries into those districts creates new openings for dispensaries to emerge in three council districts that reached the cap of four dispensaries several years ago districts 2 6 and 8 the re drawn boundaries will open two slots in district 2 and one each of districts 6 and 8 and new applicants are already seeking to fill those slots advertisement but perhaps more importantly applications submitted in anticipation of the re drawn boundaries may raise the number of approved dispensaries to well over 30 of the 27 that have already been approved 24 have begun operations the second change would close a loophole that lets dispensaries with expiring permits apply for a five year extension but only passively pursue the process of securing that extension to avoid the scrutiny that comes with that process advertisement when a dispensary applies for an extension city officials evaluate how well the business has adhered to city rules and regulations that includes whether the dispensary has paid all the city cannabis tax it owes people find loopholes and that s unfortunate said phil rath leader of a group of city dispensaries called the united medical marijuana coalition i think it s smart to close this loophole and ensure that permit holders are coming back in for accountability and having their permits reviewed on a five year cycle city officials said delays securing extensions which sometimes can last more than a year also make it harder for aspiring dispensary owners to enter the industry by keeping potentially available slots unavailable advertisement staff has significant equity and due process concerns with these extended amendment periods and how they can function as holding a spot said travis cleveland a project manager in the city s cannabis business division rath said both proposed changes make sense these are both common sense fixes he said advertisement scott chipman leader of an anti legalization group called san diegans for safe neighborhoods called the proposals the latest in a series of misguided efforts to boost a harmful industry chipman said city officials in recent years have softened rules on how far away cannabis businesses must be located from places like schools and residential areas he also said the city has tightened the definition of what a park and a youth oriented facility are to allow more dispensaries this city has bent over backwards for an industry that thrives on addiction impairment and harming people chipman said advertisement other legalization opponents said allowing additional dispensaries because of redrawn boundaries would break the promise the city made to residents in 2014 that no council district would have more than four dispensaries

luxury home sales are down across the nation and in san diego pictured beachfront homes in del mar in january 2020 san diego luxury home sales are down by more than half as the high end market sees its biggest drop in at least a decade out of the 50 most populated metro areas san diego had the fourth highest drop in luxury sales from june to august said a report from redfin released thursday the number of sales was down 55 3 percent from the same time last year advertisement this story is for subscribers we offer subscribers exclusive access to our best journalism thank you for your support the markets with the biggest drops were oakland down 63 9 percent san jose down 59 6 percent and miami down 55 5 percent the lowest drops were in kansas city down 10 4 percent and indianapolis down 7 5 percent redfin defined luxury housing as the top 5 percent of the highest priced homes for sale so what is considered luxury differed greatly across metro areas for example the median price of a luxury home in cleveland was 629 000 compared to 3 3 million in san diego metro which includes all of san diego county rising mortgage rates are cited as the main reason for the entire housing market slowing down redfin also said economic uncertainty and a tepid stock market also were dampening sales advertisement redfin chief economist daryl fairweather wrote in the report that luxury buyers are more likely to pay cash for homes but some do use mortgages as an investment strategy the thinking is even if the buyer could pay cash taking advantage of low interest rates to finance a multi million dollar house allows an affluent buyer to use other funds in the stock market or for some other investment however fairweather wrote that higher interest rates cut into that strategy someone who was in the market for a 1 5 million home last year may now have a maximum budget of 800 000 thanks to higher mortgage rates she wrote luxury goods are often the first thing to get cut when uncertain times force people to reexamine their finances advertisement the study used a three month average ending aug 31 so it captured the summer as the stock market was hit hard and there was growing concern over the global economy redfin said national sales of luxury homes fell 28 1 percent annually its biggest ever decline since it started keeping records in 2012 it surpassed the 23 2 percent drop at the start of the pandemic when there was an initial flight from real estate a red hot housing market for much of the pandemic still means luxury housing is more expensive than it was a year ago the median price for a san diego luxury property 3 3 million was up 23 6 percent from last year that compares to the regular san diego market with a median sale price of 860 000 up 16 2 percent in a year redfin said it isn t just affluent buyers who are skittish about the housing market it s potential sellers too the number of luxury home listings in san diego county was down 32 9 percent from june to august redfin said oakland had the biggest drop at 40 7 percent advertisement san diego luxury real estate agent brett dickinson with compass said a lot of potential sellers own their homes outright and are well off enough that they don t feel pressure to put their homes on the market right now financially it doesn t make sense for them he said they are taking a wait and see approach price reductions at the luxury level tend to be quite high here are a few examples advertisement 2681 idle hour lane this nine bedroom mansion in la jolla was listed for 23 5 million in january it has had its price reduced several times and is now listed for 18 9 million 13985 old el camino real this five bedroom mansion in carmel valley on an 18 6 acre lot went on sale for 19 9 million in late february it is now listed for 16 million 16701 camino sierra del sur this 10 bedroom mansion in rancho santa fe was first listed for 23 9 million in july it is now on the market for 14 8 million dickinson s view was that the luxury market was fine and going back to normal after a particularly crazy pandemic buying season for example he said there were about 45 single family homes for sale in la jolla about two months ago but there are now around 90 dickinson said it s easy to freak out that inventory is shooting up but it ignores that there are normally around 150 to 200 homes for sale around this time he argued that san diego s luxury market was better positioned to weather the storm than other markets because of tech companies like apple increasing their footprint here as well as the strong biotech industry advertisement biggest luxury home sale drops by metro year over year comparison by redfin from june to august oakland down 63 9 percent san jose down 59 6 percent advertisement miami down 55 5 percent san diego down 55 3 percent seattle down 52 percent advertisement las vegas down 50 percent san francisco down 49 6 percent anaheim down 49 3 percent advertisement sacramento down 48 3

america s relationship with the right of the people to keep and bear arms has seen the sale of legal firearms skyrocket over recent years making the united states one of the most heavily armed countries in the world this marks perhaps only the start of the great gun buying boom and its billowing full steam ahead since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic gun sales have increased almost doubling since 2019 according to figures provided by the federal bureau of investigation and small arms analytics monthly gun sales were up from 1 million per month in 2019 to more than 2 million per month by 2020 get the full ray dalio series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on ray dalio in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more the surge in sales marked a new dawn of american gun ownership even as lawmakers in the largely democratic federal government push to enact stricter laws that could make the legal purchasing of guns even more stringent the numbers are outstanding annual sales are also up between 2010 and 2019 an average of 13 million firearms were legally sold each year by 2020 and the later part of 2021 this number skyrocketed to more than 20 million despite the ongoing boom in sales with an estimated 393 million firearms legal and illegal floating around the country the relationship americans have with guns and firearms has challenged modern society and political systems even further commercial sales aren t the only side of the legal firearms market that has experienced significant growth in recent years a report released by the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf found that nearly 170 million firearms have been produced in the u s over the past three decades smaller handheld guns such as pistols accounted for almost 50 of all the firearms produced in the u s by 2021 in 2001 that figure was closer to 21 embedded in the social fabric of the nation the relationship americans have with guns and firearms has become an increasing challenge in modern day society the nation has been arming itself to the teeth with guns and firearms while the reasoning behind the soaring sales varies from self protection to hunting and recreational purposes the gun and ammunition store market is set to bring in more than 15 5 billion in revenue this year alone an annual increase of 3 6 according to the latest statistical figures these numbers paint a statistical portrait that is both amusing and certainly shocking regardless of which side of the political aisle you may be sitting gun sales are up across the market amid a surge in mass shootings and gun related crime an enclave of action groups and democratic leaders in the biden administration have been working to pass new laws that would make it harder for civilians to legally purchase firearms while there is currently no government or national database of gun sales the fbi currently holds records of pre sale background checks in march 2021 the fbi reported close to 4 7 million background checks a jump of 77 from march 2019 this marked the highest of any month since the agency started keeping records more than two decades ago looking deeper the lines have become increasingly blurred on why americans have been purchasing firearms at an alarming rate currently u s gun ownership totals around 120 civilian owned guns per 100 residents the highest among any country in the world growth in retail firearms sales there are currently around 10 gunmakers in america that collectively manufacture and distribute around 70 of total production while sales have climbed non stop in recent years top gunmakers have also been producing more to keep up with surging demand the most dominant firearm category in recent years has been pistols 36 and rifles 35 being the most commonly produced firearm in the u s today most firearms cost between 400 and 800 while smaller carry pistols such as those mentioned above retail on average around 500 hunting rifles and firearms used for recreational purposes cost between 600 and 750 these prices exclude an additional magazine cleaning solution and oil or licenses gun enthusiasts have had an ongoing debate on whether a handgun rifle or shotgun is perhaps the best defense weapon though production numbers reveal that smaller pistols and handheld guns are becoming increasingly popular ammunition accessories demand remains steady it s safe to say that while the sales of firearms have grown across the board the demand for ammunition and accessories has also increased while there is limited data available on the growth of sales regarding ammunition and accessories tighter regulations have not halted many americans who are emptying gun shops across the country various gun retailers and sellers have stated that gun prices will only increase in the coming years under new proposals by the biden administration to tighten the regulations on legal gun ownership moreover the widespread price and performance challenges have filtered throughout the sector in the recent months gun related accessories such as holsters protective wear among other items have experienced a share increase in retail purchases the shift in consumer interest is widely present both for online and in store purchases some experts in the commercial and retail firearms market have also laid claim that if any current proposals do end up passing through the market could soon become flooded with ghost guns or illegally privately homemade firearms between 2016 and 2021 law enforcement agencies recovered more than 45 000 suspected ghost guns from crime scenes from this figure around 20 000 were traced and recovered in 2021 alone while it s not yet clear how proposals will potentially impact the price of ammunition and firearm accessories or the availability thereof we re still seeing significant growth in retail purchases throughout the market states leading the gun buying boom while every state regulates the purchase and ownership of firearms several states texas florida california and pennsylvania experienced the biggest jump in annual gun sales throughout 2020 with an estimated one million firearms sold reporting on the sales of guns will be different in every state due to the differences in how some states report local sales to the national instant criminal background check system nics according to most recent estimates based on figures provided by the fbi background check system several states kentucky illinois utah and indiana reported having the most gun sales per 1 000 people between january and july 2022 for this period kentucky saw roughly 542 3 gun sales per 1 000 people up from 444 7 for the same period in 2021 the state with the lowest number of reported gun sales per 1 000 people was hawaii which reported 7 7 in 2022 up from 6 9 in 2021 besides hawaii the district of columbia currently holds the lowest percentage of legal gun sales per capita in 2020 d c reported roughly 6 5 per 1 000 inhabitants the common understanding here revealed how larger states with more residents had higher rates of gun sales per capita as opposed to smaller regions in the country who owns america s guns the percentage of americans that own a firearm has remained marginally unchanged according to a 2020 gallup report the metrics in this report have been tracked since 2007 and most recent estimates revealed that roughly 32 of american adults cited they personally own a gun when breaking this down into smaller demographics we see that gun ownership among men is the highest 45 while only 19 of women say they personally own a gun more so gun ownership was reported to be higher among white individuals 38 while non white americans 18 and eastern residents 21 had lower percentages of owning a gun politically republicans 50 held the highest category of gun ownership with democrats 18 coming in behind those who identify as independent 29 regardless of their political classification ethnicity or even level of income americans are keeping strong to the underwritten notion that owning a gun or bearing arms will forever be part of their modern culture the names producing america s firearms americans have been purchasing their beloved firearms from several well known gun manufacturers that have locally been producing a collective 70 of current firearm stockpiles manufacturing of guns and ammunition are set to bring in more than 21 1 billion in 2022 while the overall market has grown by 6 7 between 2017 and 2022 according to most recent estimates smith wesson nasdaq swbi and strum ruger co nyse rgr are the only two publicly traded gun manufacturers that produce more than one third of american firearms other big names include sig sauer 7 7 freedom group 6 4 0 f mossberg sons 4 7 taurus international manufacturing 4 2 and wm c anderson 3 8 that currently produces some of the most widely purchased firearms although these big names have been fueling the american firearms industry in a recent pbs newshour correspondence companies including smith wesson and strum ruger co have come under media scrutiny over how they market new guns and other offerings to consumers many of these companies have claimed that their practices are within a common understanding of consumer demand and are done so by directing media and marketing efforts directed towards target audiences despite their influence in the market and how much leverage they have they are only a small but fragile piece of the bigger puzzle that makes up the american firearms industry the bottom line guns and gun ownership will forever be a topic that rivals conversations on both sides of the political sphere despite the push coming from the white house to introduce sweeping gun reforms the years ahead could see the firearms industry only experience expansive growth as many more americans look to withhold their civil right to bear arms amid the heating social concern that surrounds gun ownership

more than 1 500 people are or have been homeless in jackson county missouri so far this year ahead of the winter months the kansas city council could soon enact a five year strategic plan that works to lower those numbers the city s houseless task force and the housing and community development department announced on thursday a plan called zero kc which aims to end homelessness in the city one of its main goals is to create 200 new rapid rehousing units for households with children and 300 new housing units for unhoused people in permanent supportive housing programs rayana parks shaw fifth district council person and chair of the houseless taskforce said the city will also be able to better coordinate services for people experiencing homelessness many organizations are doing great work by themselves but because they have limited resources and they continue to work in silos they don t necessarily get the overall support that they need parks shaw said what zero kc the strategic plan will do for us is allow those organizations to stop working in silos together we will see the success that we haven t seen before because they ve all been working individually the plan also commits to preserving all affordable housing stock for extremely low income residents the success of increasing the housing supply relies in part on the passage of a bond initiative that if passed will allow the city to invest up to 50 million in creating and preserving affordable housing that initiative will be on the nov 8 ballot mayor quinton lucas said the housing trust fund will also be used to create more than 350 housing units whether you re folks who are looking for more workforce housing in kansas city whether you re folks who are looking for housing and you ve been living on the streets whether there s somewhere in between that s something that we ll continue to work with lucas said however the city s commitment to creating affordable housing for extremely low income people has been called into question by some advocates an ordinance passed by the city council last month amended the city s affordable housing policy and alters who qualifies for affordable housing under the new policy developers must make 20 of their units affordable to households making 60 or less of the median family income instead of the old policy s requirement that at least 10 of the units be for extremely low income individuals advocates say the new policy doesn t ensure an adequate supply of extremely affordable housing but lucas said the city remains committed to creating more housing under the new policy we are channeling our highest incentives our greatest support as a city to those that are providing and building housing for those who are experiencing housing insecurity or experiencing homelessness he said savannah hawley kcur 89 3 councilperson rayana parks shaw chair of the houseless taskforce said the city will be able to better coordinate resources to serve unhoused people under the zero kc plan another of the plan s top priorities is decreasing public encampments but not through camp sweeps instead the zero kc implementation includes coordinating nonprofits and community groups to address the needs of unhoused people and connect them to social services and healthcare with the ultimate goal of moving them to permanent housing limiting camp sweeps without first conducting in depth outreach work could conflict with a new missouri law the legislation which went into effect in late august makes it a class c misdemeanor for unhoused people to sleep on state owned land under the law the missouri attorney general can sue local governments that don t enforce regulations on unauthorized public camping cities that don t abide by those bans could lose all state and federal funding for housing and homeless services lucas said he isn t worried about the state law hindering the city s homeless outreach efforts he called the new law heinous and cruel and said it is in violation of missouri s hancock amendment because it would increase the city s responsibility in this case the kansas city police department s responsibility to sweep camps without an adequate increase in funding i believe none of us here believe that the city will be exposed to substantial liability by not just clearing encampments at the earliest opportunity as the state law dictates lucas said at a press conference i think we ll be vastly more productive in terms of how we get people housing services careers healthcare and beyond he said rather than the state approach which is just looking to push people from place to place and continue to make missouri a difficult place for people to live the mayor also said the city will continue to evaluate other ways to work with the state to help people find housing beyond the zero kc plan the city launched a program this week to employ 15 people experiencing homelessness through the public works department the department will pay the workers employed through hope faith ministries and creative innovators 15 an hour to clean neighborhoods and conduct snow removal they will work between 25 30 hours per week and receive job training bank accounts ids and other necessary services while zero kc is a strategic plan meant to guide further action parks shaw said she is optimistic about the plan s implementation which will redirect locally available federal funds towards the effort the first step we will do is seek council overall approval but then establish an implementation team that will work to establish the milestones parks shaw said it s a five year plan so most of the action happens in the first three years we know that we will have to continue to update this living and breathing document to adjust to the needs of the city the houseless taskforce will hold three public listening sessions on the plan 9 11 a m sept 24 9701 marion park drive 5 7 p m sept 26 at 5340 ne chouteau

frankfurt washington global central banks continued raising interest rates on thursday following the us federal reserve in a fight against inflation that is sending shockwaves through financial markets and the economy japan the outlier among major developed economies kept interest rates steady on thursday only to be punished as traders pushed the yen to a record low against the dollar prompting the first intervention by japanese authorities to support the currency since 1998 it was a potential sign of a massive adjustment to come as the world adapts to us interest rates rising to levels not seen since the global financial crisis 15 years ago prompted the fed to slash its policy rate to zero and unleash massive rounds of bond buying end of an era that era of cheap liquidity which lasted through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic and until inflation became a prominent risk is now ending us interest rates and the us dollar serve as reference points for borrowing costs around the world and federal reserve officials have now flagged not just plans to continue tightening monetary policy but to keep it tight for years to come in what may for many countries amount to a fresh financial shock and a broad repricing of bonds stocks and other financial instruments the value of the dollar is soaring helping ease inflation in the united states even as it raises the costs of many dollar priced imports for other countries a factor that may have figured into japan s intervention some analysts feel more is bound to follow inflation shock intervening in markets tends to result in less optimal economic outcomes than would otherwise result rsm chief economist joe brusuelas wrote after japan s action but the current inflation shock may outweigh this reluctance we may be entering an era of intervention in foreign exchange markets in the aftermath of the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis central bankers often accused each other of waging currency wars to cheapen local money to promote exports an accusation levelled pointedly at the fed inflation may now prompt a similar tension in the other direction u s treasury officials who monitor global currency policies closely for signs countries are intervening to gain an advantage took note of japan s move on thursday as an effort to reduce recent heightened volatility in the yen but stopped short of endorsing it u s treasury secretary janet yellen asked in july about the yen s substantial depreciation said currency intervention was warranted only in rare and exceptional circumstances though many countries are battling a common inflation outbreak in the aftermath of the covid 19 pandemic the fed s response has stood out both because of the dollar s global role and the aggressiveness of the u s central bank spillovers fed chair jerome powell asked about the risks of major central banks shifting monetary policy in unison said that while the fed tries to estimate the impact of policy spillovers between countries he and his colleagues had to remain focused on local economic conditions we are very aware of what s going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us and vice versa powell said at his press conference on wednesday after the fed approved its third consecutive unusually large 75 basis point rate increase but he said u s officials have a domestic mandate domestic objectives of stable u s inflation and maximum employment chorus of rate hikes the actions by the fed along with those of other major central banks have formed the backdrop for early warnings from international officials and analysts that rising rates for currencies like the dollar and the euro could tighten global financial conditions so much it leads to a global recession along with the fed s action on wednesday its fifth interest rate increase since march a half dozen central banks from indonesia to norway followed suit with their own rate increases and often with guidance that more would follow they are fighting inflation rates ranging from switzerland s 3 5 to nearly 10 in britain the result of a rebound in demand since the pandemic subsided accompanied by sluggish supply especially from china and rising prices for fuel and other commodities in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine central bankers were adamant that curbing runaway price growth was their main task at present but they were bracing for their actions to take a toll as rising borrowing costs typically dampen investment hiring and consumption we have got to get inflation behind us powell told reporters after fed policymakers unanimously agreed to raise the central bank s benchmark overnight interest rate to a range of 3 00 3 25 i wish there were a painless way to do that there isn t the fed said it expected the economy to slow to a crawl and unemployment to rise to a degree historically associated with a recession a prospect looming ever larger in the euro zone too and seen as highly likely in britain england turkey south africa philippines the bank of england raised rates and said it would continue to respond forcefully as necessary to inflation despite the economy entering recession for borrowers this will mean significantly higher costs yet again and yet still no real control on the soaring cost of living emma lou montgomery an associate director at fidelity international said meanwhile turkey s central bank continued with its unorthodox policy on thursday by delivering another surprise interest rate cut despite inflation running at more than 80 sending the lira to an all time low against the dollar south africa s central bank on thursday raised its benchmark interest rate by a hefty 0 75 percentage points again as it battles to control inflation the south african central bank s decision mirrors a similar 0 75 point hike in july that was the highest in a decade brings the rate to 6 25 percent close to its pre covid pandemic level

even before you set foot inside the elegant vieux carré style interiors of brennan s of houston you get a sense that you ve arrived at a special place founded in 1967 as a sister restaurant to the legendary commander s palace in new orleans brennan s of houston is in the houston culinary world as legendary as its famed predecessor within the walls of the handsome dining room completely rebuilt

pesce his eponymous holley s and now davis street at hermann park brennan s gave me a road map to excel and perform holley says it also shaped his pan asian creole style of cooking which you ll find in dishes like his famous whole fried thai snapper served with kimchi collards hoppin john and thai barbecue sauce image joel kimmel joe cervantez pier 6 san leon joe cervantez s kitchen at pier 6 in san leon serves upward of 1 000 guests on weekends that s no small feat for any restaurant let alone one with about 200 seats but cervantez was more than prepared for the task having spent several years at brennan s first as a banquet chef then as their executive chef you ll see the brennan s influence here and there with dishes like crawfish empanadas and redfish on the half shell but pier 6 s

as noted in a recent blog post last week the inflation reduction act ira primarily uses carrots not sticks to incentivize reductions in carbon emissions the inflation inflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets the same paycheck covers less goods services and bills it is sometimes referred to as a hidden tax as it leaves taxpayers less well off due to higher costs and bracket creep while increasing the government s spending power reduction act creates or expands tax a tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local state and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services goods and activities credits for various low or no emission technologies rather than imposing a generalized penalty for emissions such as a carbon tax a carbon tax is levied on the carbon content of fossil fuels the term can also refer to taxing other types of greenhouse gas emissions such as methane a carbon tax puts a price on those emissions to encourage consumers businesses and governments to produce less of them however there are three small energy related tax increases in the bill one tax increase is a true emissions reduction policy while the others focus on ameliorating localized pollution issues rather than global climate change methane fee while the inflation reduction act avoided any carbon pricing mechanism the law includes a fee on a different greenhouse gas methane methane emissions are small relative to carbon emissions but methane is much more potent responsible for about 11 percent of climate changes related to greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2026 the inflation reduction act introduces a fee on methane emissions the fee would begin at 900 per ton and rise to 1 500 per ton after two years according to the congressional budget office s cbo analysis this would raise 6 35 billion over the next decade in some ways this policy is an encouraging step away from the tax subsidies and top down regulations that defined environmental policy for decades but it falls short of an optimal pigouvian tax a pigouvian tax named after 1920 british economist arthur c pigou is a tax on a market transaction that creates a negative externality or an additional cost borne by individuals not directly involved in the transaction examples include tobacco taxes sugar taxes and carbon taxes approach in significant ways the fee is targeted solely at methane emissions from the oil and gas industry even though the agricultural sector is the largest source of methane emissions in the united states additionally the fee potentially duplicates not substitutes methane regulations coming from the environmental protection agency epa as the congressional research service noted the bill contains an exemption from the tax if future epa regulations equivalent to or stronger than the set of methane regulations proposed in 2021 are adopted this uncertainty undermines a main advantage of emissions pricing over regulation superfund tax the inflation reduction act also reinstates the superfund tax on domestic and imported petroleum and raises the tax rate from the original 9 7 cents per barrel last imposed in 1995 there is some confusion on this front as the infrastructure investment and jobs act of 2021 already reinstated the superfund tax on the transport of 42 hazardous chemicals but did not reinstate the tax on petroleum the superfund tax is focused on addressing localized pollution issues rather than global climate change companies that transport potentially hazardous chemicals pay a relatively low tax that pays for superfund the program responsible for addressing various kinds of chemical leaks think of superfund as a hazardous spill insurance policy that oil producers must purchase the rate is set at 16 4 cents per barrel of petroleum which may sound high but in the context of gas prices is near a rounding error there are 42 gallons of oil in a barrel meaning the tax equals 0 39 cents per gallon of petroleum then crude oil is only around half of the cost of retail gasoline the rest is refining marketing distribution and existing federal and state taxes the 0 39 cents per gallon of petroleum tax translates to a roughly 0 2 cents per gallon increase in retail gas prices clearly swamped in either direction by the major fluctuations of the past year there are reasonable trade offs to consider with superfund taxes superfund taxes ensure companies that risk significant industrial pollution pay for cleanup efforts however the total revenue amount is quite small relative to the administrative costs when tax foundation analyzed the reintroduction of the superfund tax on petroleum we found small economic costs and a small amount of revenue raised reinstating the superfund tax has small revenue economic impact change in gdp

durante cody kallen huaqun li william mcbride and garrett watson details and analysis of the inflation reduction act tax provisions tax foundation aug 12 2022 permanent increase in coal excise tax an excise tax is a tax imposed on a specific good or activity excise taxes are commonly levied on cigarettes alcoholic beverages soda gasoline insurance premiums amusement activities and betting and typically make up a relatively small and volatile portion of state and local and to a lesser extent federal tax collections the last notable inflation reduction act energy tax increase is a permanent increase in the excise tax rate on coal this higher excise tax funds benefits for former coal miners with black lung disease in cases where mine operators are unable to pay before the inflation reduction act the tax was either 0 50 per ton of coal from underground mines and 0 25 per ton of coal from surface mines or 2 percent of the sale price of coal whichever was lesser the ira raised those rates to the lesser of 1 10 per ton of underground coal and 0 55 per ton of surface mine coal or 4 4 percent of the sale price of coal while technically a tax increase this change is more a reversion to the norm for most years since 1986 coal has been taxed under the new rates it is also a small provision an order of magnitude smaller than the superfund tax raising only 1 16 billion over 10 years according to the cbo this policy poses a conundrum on the one hand a tax on coal production to cover harms from coal production makes sense and the fiscal outlook for the black lung disability trust fund looks to get worse over the next several years justifying a tax increase but on the other the program s poor outlook is driven by the projected decline of coal production and the projected growth in former miners owed benefits meaning the government may need to consider using general revenue to provide benefits in the future as the tax base the tax base is the total amount of income property assets consumption transactions or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority a narrow tax base is non neutral and inefficient a broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates of coal production shrinks all told the inflation reduction act s energy related taxes are relatively small scale and though they have policy justifications they also feature some design issues note this the second part of our blog series on the green energy tax provisions in the inflation reduction act breaking down the

covid like virus lurking in bats deep in russian caves could jump to humans virologists warn and it s completely resistant to vaccines russian government affiliated experts only acknowledged khosta 2 last may yet never before seen pathogen was detected in bats swabbed in early 2020 khosta 2 is classified as a sarbecovirus a branch of the coronavirus family tree a covid like virus lurking in russian bats could jump to humans scientists warned today american virologists who carried out experiments on the pathogen called khosta 2 fear it is completely resistant to vaccines deployed during the pandemic they found it was able to latch onto human cells with ease in the same way as the covid virus russian government affiliated experts only acknowledged khosta 2 s existence last may yet the never before seen pathogen was detected in bat samples collected between march and october 2020 virologists trusted to carry out experiments on the pathogen called khosta 2 fear it is completely resistant to vaccines deployed during the pandemic stock researchers based at the gamaleya national research centre a branch of moscow s ministry of health said they were carrying out ongoing surveillance of bats living in sochi national park the 480 000 acre park home to hundreds of caves sits on the outskirts of the city with the same name which hosted the 2014 winter olympics khosta 2 is classified as a sarbecovirus a branch of the coronavirus family tree other than being a distant relative of sars cov 2 the strain behind covid barely anything is known about it washington state university researchers decided to carry out tests on the virus in hope of learning more dr stephanie seifert and colleagues also experimented on khosta 1 an extremely similar virus detected in the same original samples tests showed khosta 2 was able to infect human cells in a near identical fashion as sars cov 2 using a spike like protein on its surface the virus hooks onto an entry enzyme found on the exterior of human cells called ace 2 the process is often likened to a key being inserted into a lock researchers based at the gamaleya national research centre a branch of moscow s ministry of health said they were carrying out ongoing surveillance of bats living in sochi national park what do we know about the virus when did scientists discover it russian government affiliated experts only acknowledged khosta 2 s existence last may yet the never before seen pathogen was detected in bat samples collected between march and october 2020 where is it found researchers based at the gamaleya national research centre a branch of moscow s ministry of health said they were carrying out ongoing surveillance of bats living in sochi national park the 480 000 acre park home to hundreds of caves sits on the outskirts of the city with the same name which hosted the 2014 winter olympics what type of virus is it khosta 2 is classified as a sarbecovirus a branch of the coronavirus family tree other than being a distant relative of sars cov 2 the strain behind covid barely anything is known about it can it infect humans there s no proof that it s infected any human yet however tests showed khosta 2 was able to infect human cells in a near identical fashion as sars cov 2 using a spike like protein on its surface the virus hooks onto an entry enzyme found on the exterior of human cells called ace 2 the process is often likened to a key being inserted into a lock advertisement despite being able to latch onto human cells this way experts concluded it wasn t as efficient at doing so as sars cov 2 which some scientists believe has evolved to become more contagious than measles experiments also tested whether covid vaccines or drugs could destroy it if it were ever to jump to humans a process known as zoonosis it was completely resistant to one antibody medication made by eli lilly khosta 2 was also appeared resistant to two doses of both the moderna and pfizer jabs laboratory work revealed dr seifert and colleagues said however that it was still possible that natural covid immunity or potentially even that acquired through vaccines could beat off the virus results of the experiment were published in plos pathogens writing in the journal the team acknowledged that the majority of the hundreds of sarbecoviruses discovered are not capable of infecting humans but they added their findings demonstrate that they pose a threat to global health and highlight the urgent need to develop universal coronavirus vaccines zoonotic spillover of sarbecoviruses has led to the emergence of highly pathogenic human viruses academics wrote they pointed to sars cov 2 as an example given it was behind the largest global pandemic in modern history researchers around the world are ramping up the pace of viral discovery efforts expanding the sequence databases with new animal sarbecoviruses in circulation while some experiments have been performed with the new viruses several remain untested and thus their ability to transmit to humans is unknown dr seifert and team added sars cov 2 can infect a wide range of species and has now
