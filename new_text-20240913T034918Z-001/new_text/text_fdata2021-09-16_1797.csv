more coverage occupy wall street s impact continues to grow the rise of occupy wall street the movement moment that revived the u s left contested ground 9 11 occupy wall street the future of america what s the best way to make change disruptive street protests build alternative institutions get elected in hopes of changing government from the inside sandy nurse has done it all over the past decade nurse led protests at occupy wall street she later turned her focus to her community in bushwick a working class predominantly people of color neighborhood in north brooklyn where she co founded mayday space a community center and grassroots organizing hub she also launched bk rot new york city s first bike powered food waste hauling and composting service last year she helped organize occupy city hall the week long protest encampment outside the seat of city government drew hundreds of participants who demanded that their representatives cut 1 billion from the nypd s budget and use the money to fund community services the measure failed next year nurse will be voting on the city s nearly 100 billion annual budget as the new representative for council district 37 where she trounced a machine backed incumbent by 30 points in the june democratic primary with the support of dozens of progressive politicos labor unions and community based organizations her district covers bushwick cypress hills east new york and ocean hill brownsville it s kind of crazy she chuckled as we began to discuss her journey over the past 10 years and how she plans to co govern with her constituents when she takes office the indypendent what drew you to occupy wall street how did you get involved sandy nurse i followed occupy on facebook that summer after returning from haiti where i was working with the world food program there was a lot of very potent powerful energy happening around the world where people were just at their end and were congregating in public spaces like tahrir square in egypt i was feeling pretty depressed about the political culture in the united states on top of outright corruption there was the existential threat of climate change and our inability to take meaningful action around that because of all the special interests in our political system a friend and i went down to zuccotti park on the first day and there were assemblies in the park park with hundreds of people it was incredible to watch and participate in they were looking for people to stay the night my friend got some blankets from home and that kicked it off for me what was it like being an organizer with the direct action working group within a day or so of starting to camp at the park someone said hey we re going to have this huddle for anybody who wants to do direct action i went over and was like yeah i m here to do stuff i don t want to sit in the park all day so we went over to a corner and started planning marches then it became the direct action working group we met twice a day we would do marches to wall street coinciding with the opening and closing bell of the stock market to get people up and moving and to give people something to participate in when they got off work things really took off when we planned the march across the brooklyn bridge and 700 people got arrested on the bridge when the media coverage really kicked off it became just an influx of people who wanted to participate so much was happening every day felt like a week it must have been both exhilarating and exhausting occupy required a tremendous amount of energy mental and physical energy and the space was hard to manage it became a place where people who needed food and shelter were seeking refuge also there were real needs with mental health and people struggling with drug use that couldn t be met by people in the park we were also infiltrated by undercover cops who sought to create chaos which took its toll on people people got exhausted and were no longer interested in pushing the broader message about the 99 vs the 1 what are the memories from occupy that stand out for you there were all sorts of bizarre little moments at one point we were threatened with being kicked out of the park for being unclean and there was this massive cleaning effort i remember one of the ringleaders of the sanitation working group furiously sweeping the park while shirtless in the rain for quirky moments i m also thinking of the direct action working group meeting in the graveyard next to trinity church twice a day to plan protests also it was just the haphazard way everything came together you would wake up and there s a library that wasn t there the night before one of the weirdest moments for me was when rev jesse jackson came through the park and we gave him a tour it was really late at night and we walked to a nearby office and there was this roundtable conversation about how the energy of this movement could be captured for broader electoral movements a bunch of us pushed back saying this movement isn t about getting people elected why did you shift to community organizing i wanted to do stuff at the hyper local level and focus on long term institution building i m deeply concerned about the climate crisis i wanted to experiment at the neighborhood level with how we could actually impact that while creating systems that allow people to take action with bk rot we put into practice some of the thinking of environmental justice movements about using mitigation and adaptation projects as opportunities to create direct benefits for the people who ve been living in communities that have environmental racism we created mayday because we need space for our movements i see mayday as like zuccotti park in a building it s all of the same types of activities cooking and big events big assemblies celebrations it s art making political education and all of the things that were happening at zuccotti but in a space that s clean and safe for people how did you gravitate toward local politics with the mayday space we don t get public funding our model was built on being sustained by the groups who use it with bk rot we have teenagers on bikes collecting trash and processing raw waste for many years we engaged around trying to have access to public land to house this project that involved our community board and different land use advocates and the strong support and participation of councilmember antonio reynoso and his staff who made calls to different city agencies to help us get access to public land that opened my mind to opportunities to work with the state i continue to be a street activist and do direct actions and train folks who want to do that i also like building positive spaces for people to work together and improve our neighborhood this jump is a part of a longer unexpected trajectory but at this time we really need people who are highly energized proactive who want to be out there thinking about how we move new york city into the 21st century how will you strike a balance between being an outsider aligned with social movements and an insider who will have to work with 50 other city council members and the mayor there s always going to be an inherent tension in this the way i m thinking about it is to not navigate it alone we have to build alliances among the left there are movement groups focused on pushing agendas in our local government there are groups who don t believe in electoral politics but they are out there all the time pushing everybody to look at the problem we all have a role to play the best i can do is be as transparent as possible and create as many opportunities for participatory decision making as possible we need people to come with solutions with ideas with the energy to think it through because that s what is required at this moment to address the challenges we face please support independent media today now celebrating its 20th anniversary

for the first couple of weeks after the pandemic hit algiers singer franklin james fisher was distraught but within short order the musician started to get his bearings embracing the newfound free time created by the concert freeze as an opportunity to recharge and focus on the act of creating something for which the band s usually hectic touring schedule previously left little time slowly i realized that we would have access to things like unemployment said fisher who was visiting atlanta when the pandemic hit and ended up spending a majority of 2020 living with his sister there before returning to new york city having your own space and time and money and food all of these things that you don t always have the same access to when you re touring it keeps you grounded and then you re able to do other things like write for each algiers album fisher has adopted a different approach toward his lyrics with the process playing a large part in shaping the themes for each respective album on the underside of power from 2017 fisher wrote a handful of the songs in a rush while the band was in the studio which informed the record s political ripped from the headline nature in contrast the musician kept a journal in the months and years leading up to the recording of there is no year released in 2020 and those songs are far more intimate a majority colored by the end of a romantic relationship more feature interview algiers at the basement when we did underside would do things like send me to my room literally in the afternoon and be like go write the lyrics to this song and then come back and be ready to sing them after dinner and that was super stressful and even though we got good results out of it i realized i didn t particularly enjoy working that way said fisher who will join his bandmates in concert at rumba cafe on friday sept 17 dante foley drummer for cleveland based mourning blkstar will sub on this round of dates for algiers drummer matt tong who is currently at home with a newborn son get news and entertainment delivered to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter by keeping a journal prior to the making of there is no year fisher assured there would be no last minute scramble while incidentally turning his focus inward i think 10 of the songs on that record were about my ex girlfriend he said we d broken up and i was lovelorn where i didn t know if i d ever hear from her again we kind of had this no contact policy to respect her boundaries so i wasn t reaching out to her but i figured maybe i could reach her at some point if she ever picked up the record this sense of ache endures throughout the album fisher singing i m moaning on the floor for your forgiveness and i wish i could say that one day it ll all be ok everything starts to fade under the weight of silence released just months before covid 19 reached u s shores the record s themes have been given new weight by the pandemic reiterating the ways that personal pain and public hell can be intrinsically linked i guess we re all experiencing that right at least to some degree fisher said regardless coming off of politically charged album the underside of power fisher said some struggled with the inward shift referencing reviews where critics responded to his lyrics with confusion their critique was what kind of call to arms is this fisher said and it wasn t that at all aren t i allowed to be human too aren t we as a band allowed to be human we haven t been commissioned by any political party to make songs to wave your banner to fisher addressed the weight of expectation and more on can the sub_bass speak released in august 2019 a song that covers everything from ongoing questions surrounding the band s shapeshifting sound soul punk soul rock doom soul what is this fusion to the racist asides the singer has been subjected to during interviews with some members of the media nah you you don t really talk like a black guy moving forward fisher envisions the band remaining similarly difficult to typecast including on its next album which algiers finished writing during covid and will begin recording in earnest at some point after these coming tour dates about six months into quarantine i took stock of what i d written and gave the songs to the fellows and fortunately everybody liked it it feels like a return to form for us said fisher who traced his love of language to his seventh grade english class for me with the initial songwriting process this time i was just doing it for the pure joy it was taking time to discover and letting the art reveal itself to you

apple unveiled its next iphone line up including a model that offers twice the storage available in earlier versions and other modest upgrades to last year s editions that proved to be a big hit among consumers devouring the latest technology during the pandemic the pre recorded video event streamed tuesday gave apple a chance to present a polished story following a turbulent few weeks the recent bumps included a hastily patched security vulnerability that could let hackers secretly take control of iphones and other apple devices a backlash to the company s plans to scan iphones for images of child sex abuse and a federal judge s ruling that chipped away further at the competitive barrier apple built around its app store which generates billions of dollars in profits each year as has been the case since apple s late co founder unveiled the first iphone in 2007 apple executives talked reverently about the latest model even though it isn t dramatically different from the version apple released nearly a year ago like last year s model the new iphone 13 will come in four different designs with prices starting from 700 to 1 100 they re scheduled to be in stores september 24 it s an incremental upgrade said gartner analyst tuong nguyen some of the new features are impressive but most of them are not noticeable or practical for most users possibly the most notable change in the latest high end iphone 13 will be an option for a full terabyte of storage that s 1 000 gigabytes on the device up from its previous maximum of 512 gigabytes that s enough storage to accommodate roughly 250 000 photos or about 500 hours of high definition video having a massive amount of storage could become more important to many consumers with the advent of ultra high definition video and ultrafast wireless 5g networks that will make downloading content faster and easier nguyen said apple is also promising better cameras on the iphone 13 including an improved ultrawide lens a cinematic like video feature and technology for better nighttime pictures the latter mirrors a feature google has long offered in its line of pixel phones which haven t been big sellers yet as usual the latest iphones are supposed to have longer lasting batteries too we keep making the iphone more capable apple ceo tim cook boasted these kinds of incremental upgrades have become routine for apple and other device makers in recent years as the pace of smartphone innovation slowed even while prices for some phones have climbed above 1 000 that trend has prompted more consumers to hold on to their older smartphones for longer periods but the release of last year s iphone 12 unleashed one of apple s biggest sales spurts since 2014 possibly because the pandemic helped make homebound people realize it was time to get a newer and better model than what they had been using through the first six months of this year apple s iphone sales have surged by nearly 60 from the same time last year that boom has helped push apple s stock price near its all time highs recently giving the company a market value of about 2 5 trillion more than twice what it was before the pandemic began 18 months ago apple s shares dipped 1 tuesday in a sign that that investors weren t excited by what they saw in the new iphones although the iphone is still by far apple s biggest moneymaker the company has been trying to supplement its success with peripheral products such as its smartwatch the cupertino california company used tuesday s showcase to provide a preview of its next apple watch which will feature a thinner more rounded and brighter display credit associated press ap photo credit ap

g eorge soros has thrown a public hissy fit over the fact that he can t make the kind of easy money off china that he was able to make when the soviet union was carved up and privatized on september 7 2021 in his second mainstream editorial in a week george soros expressed his horror at the recommendation by black rock the world s largest asset manager that financial managers should triple their investment in china claiming that such investment would imperil u s national security by helping china mr soros stepped up his advocacy of u s financial and trade sanctions china s policy of shaping markets to promote overall prosperity instead of letting the economic surplus be concentrated in the hands of corporate and foreign investors is an existential threat to america s neoliberal priorities he spells out president xi s common prosperity program seeks to reduce inequality by distributing the wealth of the rich to the general population that does not augur well for foreign investors to neoliberals that is heresy criticizing china s abrupt cancellation of a new issue by alibaba s ant group in november 2020 and banishment of u s financed tutoring companies from china mr soros singles out blackstone s co founder stephen schwarzman and former goldman sachs president john l thornton for seeking to make financial returns for their investors instead of treating china as an enemy state and looming cold war adversary the blackrock initiative imperils the national security interests of the u s and other democracies because the money invested in china will help prop up president xi s regime congress should pass legislation empowering the securities and exchange commission to limit the flow of funds to china the effort ought to enjoy bipartisan support the new york times published a prominent article defining the biden doctrine as seeing china as america s existential competitor russia as a disrupter iran and north korea as nuclear proliferators cyberthreats as ever evolving and terrorism as spreading far beyond afghanistan against these threats the article depicts u s strategy as representing democracy the euphemism for countries with minimal governments leaving economic planning to wall street financial managers and infrastructure in the hands of private investors not provided at subsidized prices nations restrict monopolies and related rent seeking are accused of being autocratic the problem of course is that just as the united states germany and other nations grew into industrial powers in the 19th and 20th century by government sponsored infrastructure progressive taxation and anti monopoly legislation the post 1980 rejection of these policies has led them into economic stagnation for the 99 percent burdened by debt deflation and rising rentier overhead paid to the finance insurance and real estate fire sectors china is thriving by following precisely the policies by which the former leading industrial nations grew rich before suffering from the neoliberal financialization disease this contrast prompts the article s thrust summarized in its summary of what it hopes will become a congressionally supported biden doctrine of escalating a new cold war against non neoliberalized economies juxtaposing u s sponsored liberal democratic imperialism against foreign socialism last month mr blinken warned that china and russia were making the argument in public and in private that the united states is in decline so it s better to cast your lot with their authoritarian visions for the world than with our democratic one mr soros had seen the ending of the cold war open the path for him and other foreign investors to use shock therapy to provide easy pickings in russia followed by the much broader asian crisis of 1997 as a grab bag opportunity to buy up the most lucrative rent yielding assets he is upset that president xi is not emulating boris yeltsin and letting a client kleptocracy emerge in china to carve up russia s economy which made russia s stock market the world s darling for a few years 1995 97 right after the asia crisis bill clinton s administration admitted china to the world trade organization giving u s investors and importers access to low priced labor able to undersell u s industrial labor that helped stop u s wage gains while china used foreign investment as a means of upgrading its technology and labor to become economically self reliant it has not let its monetary system or social organization become financially dependent on markets functioning as vehicles for the u s control that mr soros hoped would occur when he began investing in china china recognized from the beginning that its insistence on maintaining control of its economy steering it to promote overall prosperity not to enrich a client oligarchy fronting for a foreign investor class would create political opposition from u s cold war ideologues china therefore sought allies from wall street offering profit making opportunities for goldman sachs and other investors whose self interest has indeed led them to oppose anti china policies but china s success has creating so many billionaires that it is now moving to curtail exorbitant wealth that policy has sharply cut prices for the leading chinese stocks prompting mr soros to warn u s investors to bail out his hope is that this will bring china to heel and reverse its policy of raising living standards at the expense of sending its economic gains to u s and other foreign investors the reality is that china does not need u s or other foreign money to develop the peoples bank of china can create all the money that the domestic economy needs while its export trade already is flooding it with dollars and pushing up its exchange rate john mccain characterized russia as a gas station with atom bombs neglecting to acknowledge that it is now the world s largest grain exporter no longer dependent on the west for its food supply thanks largely to u s sponsored trade sanctions the corollary image is the united states as a financialized and monopolized economy with atom bombs and cyber threats in danger of becoming a failed state like the old soviet union but threatening to bring the entire world economy down with it if other countries do not subsidize its debt ridden new cold war economy presenting itself as the world s leading democracy despite its financial oligarchy at home and its support of client oligarchies abroad the united states has consolidated financial power in the wake of the 2008 junk mortgage and bank fraud policy making and resource allocation have passed out of the hands of meaningful electoral politics into those of the finance insurance and real estate fire sector and what ray mcgovern has called micimatt the military industrial congressional intelligence media academic think tank complex including the major foundations and ngos these institutions seek to concentrate income and wealth in the hands of a fire sector oligarchy just as the roman senate blocked reform with veto power over popular legislation and europe s upper houses of parliament such as britain s house of lords used similar chokehold power to resist government control in the public interest the rise of u s sponsored neoliberalism means that the 19th century s fight to free markets from predatory finance sponsoring rentier parasitism and has failed this failure is celebrated as a victory for the rule of law democracy property rights and even free markets over the authority of public power to regulate private wealth seeking integrating the global economy along unipolar lines enabling u s financial interests and those of allied nato economies to appropriate the most profitable and highest rent yielding assets of foreign countries is idealized as the natural evolution of civilization not as the road to neoliberal serfdom and debt peonage embodied in what u s officials call the rule of law what is the rule of law the united states refuses to join the world court or any international organization in which it does not have veto power and it simply withdraws from international treaties and agreements that it has signed if its vested interests believe that these no longer serve their interests this always has been u s policy from the many treaties with native american tribes broken by andrew jackson and his successors down through the u s soviet agreements ending the cold war in 1991 broken by bill clinton to the treaty removing sanctions on iran broken by donald trump this policy has introduced a new term into the world s diplomatic vocabulary to describe u s diplomacy non agreement capable the evangelistic neocon administration of george w bush effectively run by his vice president dick cheney followed the principle that we re an empire now and when we act we create our own reality to impose this reality on other countries u s intelligence is selected invented or censored to give the appearance of whatever reality is deemed to serve u s interests at any given moment of time past and present reality is redefined at will to provide a guide for action whatever u s diplomacy dictates is claimed to reflect the rule of law giving the united states the right to definite what is legal and what is not when it imposes economic and military sanctions against countries that do not follow pro american policies the resulting dictates laying down the law are always wrapped in the rhetoric of free markets and democracy what is a free market to the classical economists the objective of 19th century reform was to replace the rentier class s political power with democratic power to create state policies to either tax away land rent and other economic rent or to take return land natural resources and natural monopolies such as transportation communications and other basic infrastructure needs to the public domain a free market was defined as one free from economic rent the land rent imposed by heirs of the feudal warlord landlord class whose economic role was purely extractive not productive natural resource rent was said to belong to the public domain as national patrimony and monopoly rent was to be prevented by keeping natural monopolies in the public domain or firmly regulating them if privatized the 20th century s anti classical reaction has inverted the concept of a free market orwellian doublethink style to create one free for rent seekers to carve out free lunch rent income the result is a rentier economy in which land natural resources and natural monopolies are privatized and in due course financialized to turn rent into a flow of interest payments to the financial sector as the economy is driven into debt to afford the rentier overhead and debt financed asset price inflation for rent yielding assets the freedom of such markets is freedom from governments to tax away economic rent and regulate prices to limit rent extraction an exponential growth of unearned rentier income and wealth in the hands of a sector diverts income away from the real production and consumption economy as for free trade the united states also retains the right to impose tariffs at will euphemized as fair trade and levy fines and sanctions to prevent companies from being free to sell technology to china the aim is to concentrate technological monopolies in u s hands any proliferation of technology which is treated much like nuclear weaponry as a national security issue is deemed to be unfair and antithetical to u s freedom to control the world s trade and investment patterns in its own interest the move toward democratic political reform in the late 19th and early 20thcentury was supposed to create rent free markets but the dynamics of political democracy have been managed in a way that blocks economic democracy the very meaning of democracy is degraded to mean opposition to the government s power to act against the oligarchic rentier one percent on behalf of the 99 percent this attempt to promote free markets and fair trade is defended by u s claims to protect democracy against autocracy and to intervene throughout the world to promote free world members defined ipso facto as being democratic simply by virtue of being u s allies today s new cold war is all about maintaining and extending such a captive u s oriented free market by force from henry kissinger s coup in chile to impose chicago style free markets to hillary clinton s coups in ukraine s maidan and honduras and her nato backed destruction of libya and assassination of qadhafi what is democracy aristotle wrote that many constitutions appear superficially to be democratic but actually are oligarchic democracy always had been the deceptive euphemism for oligarchy making itself into a hereditary aristocracy democracies tend to evolve into oligarchies as creditors expropriate debtors the rule of law guaranteeing a hierarchy of property rights with creditor claims at the top of the legal pyramid the move toward democratic political reform in the late 19th and early 20thcentury was supposed to create rent free markets but the dynamics of political democracy have been managed in a way that blocks economic democracy the very meaning of democracy is degraded to mean opposition to the government s power to act against the oligarchic rentier one percent on behalf of the 99 percent the resulting travesty of a democratic free market serves to block political attempts to use public power to promote the interests of the wage earning population at large and indeed of the industrial economy itself to avid financial asset stripping and debt deflation of markets in the language of international diplomacy democratic has become a label for any pro u s regime from the baltic kleptocracies to latin america s military dictatorships countries using state power to regulate monopolies or to tax rentier income are denounced as autocratic even if they have elected heads of state in this new orwellian rhetoric of international diplomacy boris yeltsin s kleptocratic russian regime was democratic and the natural move to stop the corruption and depopulation was called autocracy what are autocracy and authoritarianism foreign moves to defend against u s financial takeovers and sponsorship of client oligarchies are denounced as authoritarian in the u s diplomatic vocabulary autocracy refers to a government protecting the interests of its own population by resisting u s financial takeover of its natural resources basic infrastructure and most lucrative monopolies all successful economies throughout history have been mixed public private economies the proper role of government is to protect economies from a rentier oligarchy from emerging to polarize the economy at the expense of the population at large this protection requires keeping control of money and credit land and natural resources basic infrastructure and natural monopolies in the hands of governments it is oligarchies that are autocratic in blocking reforms to overrule their rent seeking by keeping basic needs and infrastructure in the public domain to confuse understanding rome s oligarchy accused social reformers of seeking kingship much as greek oligarchies accused reformers of seeking tyranny as if their reforms were merely for personal gain not to promote general prosperity the resulting orwellian doublethink is woven into the rhetoric of neoliberalism what is neoliberalism neoliberalism is an exponentially expanding financial dynamic seeking to concentrate the world s most profitable and highest rent yielding resources in the hands of financial managers mainly in the united state and its client oligarchies that act as proconsuls over foreign economies the liberal mass media academia and think tank lobbying institutions policy foundations and ngos sponsor the above described rhetoric of free markets to create vehicles for capital flight money laundering tax evasion deregulation and privatization and the corruption that goes with emerging kleptocracies neoliberal doctrine depicts all public moves to protect general prosperity from the burden of rentier overhead as being authoritarian autocracy interfering with property rights what are property rights in today s financialized economies property rights means the priority of creditor rights to foreclose on the housing land and other property of debtors in antiquity that included the personal freedom of debtors condemned to debt bondage to their creditors the world bank has promoted such creditor oriented property rights from the former soviet union to latin american indigenous communities in order to privatize hitherto communal or public property including land occupied by squatters or local communities the idea is that once communal or public property is privatized as individual rights it can be pledged as collateral for loans and duly forfeited or sold under economic duress the effect is to concentrate property in the hands of the financial sector that in turn leads inevitably to a failed austerity ridden economy what is a failed economy economies fail because of the rising power of vested interests primarily in the finance insurance and real estate fire sector that control most of the economies assets and wealth a failed economy is one that cannot expand usually as a result of becoming burdened by rising rentier overhead in the form of land rent natural resource rent and monopoly rent as the financial sector replaces democratically elected governments as central planner and resource allocator the fire sector is a symbiosis between finance and real estate along with insurance its business plan involved a highly political dimension seeking to centralize control of money and credit creation in hereditary private hands and to turn this economic rent free from taxation public collection or regulation into a flow of interest the effect of lending primarily to buyers of assets which are pledged as collateral for loans is not to create new means of production but to inflate asset prices for property already in place the resulting finance capital gains have become the easiest way to acquire fortunes which take the form of rent extracting claims on the economy not new means of production to support real economic prosperity and rising living standards financialized economies are doomed to become failed states because the exponentially growing expansion path of debt accumulating at compound interest plus new credit creation and quantitative easing far exceeds the economy s underlying growth rate of producing goods and services to carry this burden these financial dynamics threaten to doom the u s and its satellite economies to become failed states the underlying question is whether western civilization itself has become a failed civilization given the roots of its legal system and concepts of property rights in oligarchic rome rome s polarized economy led to a dark age which recovered by looting byzantium and subsequently the east and new conquest of the new world and east and south asia for the past twenty years it has been china s socialist growth that has primarily sustained western prosperity but this dynamic is being rejected denounced as an existential threat precisely because it is successful socialism not neoliberal exploitation in times past there always was some part of the globe to survive and carry on but super decadence occurs when the whole world is being dragged down together with no region able to resist the polarizing and impoverishing rentier dynamics imposed by the militarized imperial core following the u s lead the west is cutting itself off from survival rejection of neoliberalism by china and other members of the shanghai cooperation organization sco is met by u s trade and financial sanctions whose self defeating effect is to drive them together to create a state regulatory system autocracy to resist dollarization financialization and privatization that is why they are being isolated as an existential threat to the dynamics of neoliberal rentier decadence the alternative it does not have to be this way of course china is defending itself not only by the productive industrial and agricultural economy its socialist government has sponsored but by a guiding concept of how economies work china s economic managers have the classical concepts of value price and economic rent that distinguish earned from unearned income and productive labor and wealth from unproductive and predatory financial and rentier fortunes these are the concepts needed to uplift all society the 99 percent rather than just the one percent but the post 1980 neoliberal reaction has stripped away such concepts from the western economic vocabulary and academic curriculum the present economic stagnation debt burden and locked in zero interest rates are a policy choice by the west not a product of inevitable technological determinism notes george soros blackrock s china blunder wall street journal september 7 2021 helene

by farah master hong kong reuters if investors in china s biotech industry needed one more sign that the sector is coming of age then a major licensing deal remegen co ltd struck last month with seattle based seagen inc fits the bill the agreement to co develop cancer treatments using a remegen antibody drug conjugate is regarded as one of the biggest of its kind between a chinese biotech and a western firm it provides for up to 2 4 billion in milestone payments in addition to 200 million upfront as well as royalties if approved it is also at least the fifth out licensing deal potentially worth more than 1 billion clinched by a chinese biotech nearly all were signed in the past year underscoring china s still small but growing role in developing innovative cancer drugs that will be used worldwide china is clearly already an important and integral part of the global biopharma industry not a separate ecosystem said franck le deu senior partner at consultancy mckinsey in hong kong china s government has made cancer treatments a top priority for the industry the world s most populous nation last year accounted for 30 of cancer deaths globally and 24 of newly diagnosed cases according to one study supportive policies for the sector over the past five years are also now bearing fruit and western firms have come knocking at chinese biotech doors for seagen the remegen deal will allow it to directly challenge breast cancer treatments from roche holding and astrazeneca daiichi sankyo the antibody also shows promise in tackling bladder and stomach tumours other notable deals include a novartis ag agreement worth up to 2 2 billion for a beigene ltd drug the two are co developing an antibody similar to keytruda from merck and opdivo from bristol myers squibb which help the immune system attack several different types of cancer and which have reaped billions of dollars in sales abbvie has also partnered with i mab to co develop a monoclonal antibody for several types of cancer in a deal worth up to 1 9 billion flourishing on funding chinese biotechs have proliferated in a relatively short amount of time a key catalyst being the return of overseas trained chinese scientists dubbed sea turtles that began a decade ago and who have become increasingly attracted by domestic opportunities as the government pushes to develop the industry more recently china in 2017 and 2018 aligned regulatory standards with international norms rapidly speeding up the review system for new drugs the sector also has seen a surge in funding after hong kong s stock exchange changed its rules in 2018 to allow listings of biotechs that have yet to earn revenue success in the west is still fledgling just three drugs developed in china which include beigene s brukinsa for a type of non hodgkin s lymphoma have been approved by the u s fda investors are also concerned about frothy valuations and it remains unclear how many firms will succeed due to the lengthy process of drug discovery and the massive costs involved that said there appears to be more than enough funding to propel the industry we are looking at a turning point because of the capital supply and the regulatory approval regime said simone song founding partner of healthcare venture capital fund ori capital nineteen chinese biotechs made their trading debuts last year mostly in hong kong raising a combined 5 2 billion up from 13 raising around 2 billion in 2019 refinitiv data shows so far this year 20 have listed raising 4 6 billion and the hong kong bourse has flagged nearly 30 more in the pipeline according to mckinsey s le deu the combined market value of chinese biotechs listed in hong kong on shanghai s star board and on the nasdaq was some 180 billion as of may which compares to just 1 billion in 2016 global ambitions the number of large out licensing pacts for chinese biotechs is only set to grow industry experts say i mab innovent biologics junshi biosciences and legend

abigail spanberger d va 07 and john katko r ny 24 have introduced bipartisan legislation to improve seniors access to legal and social services in healthcare settings and help protect them from elder abuse recent studies have found that approximately one in 10 seniors have experienced some form of abuse in the last year including psychological abuse financial abuse and neglect the bipartisan linking seniors to needed legal services act would create a grant program for individual states to develop medical legal partnerships to establish improve or maintain linkages between health and social services for vulnerable seniors in healthcare settings these linkages would help meet vulnerable patients social and legal needs that can be detrimental to overall health when unmet such as housing food education and access to care specifically this bill would also require states to fund the development and expansion of legal assistance hotlines to identify seniors who could benefit from access to these services these hotlines would help connect more vulnerable patients to professionals who can best address seniors social determinants of health and combat neglect isolation and exploitation the u s population is aging and our seniors deserve the resources required to make informed decisions about their care however seniors and vulnerable patients cannot always determine when they require legal aid in addition to medical treatment and in many cases may not be aware of the large array of resources that are available to them said spanberger when vulnerable seniors have access to social workers and legal expertise at healthcare sites the likelihood of meeting the whole of their needs and finding solutions to their challenges greatly increases elder abuse is a silent epidemic in the united states and the linking seniors to needed legal services act would give our seniors valuable tools to prevent abuse before it happens i am proud to lead this bipartisan legislation to make sure our seniors can access the care and resources they need and i thank representative katko for joining me in this effort i m glad to introduce the linking seniors to needed legal services act alongside rep spanberger said katko during the pandemic we unfortunately saw increased rates of elder mistreatment and neglect as well as a rise in scams aimed at our nation s senior population the linking seniors to needed legal services act aims to combat these trends by providing funds to expand the availability of legal and social services within medical facilities serving older adults doing so would allow more patients to have access to trained advocates dedicated to preventing abuse and fraud and ensuring housing food education and healthcare needs are met we thank rep spanberger for her leadership on behalf of vulnerable older americans said edward f ansello ph d director virginia center on aging virginia commonwealth university this legislation recognizes that some older adults are at a preventable risk of poor health and living conditions mistreatment and exploitation appropriate multidisciplinary teams have been shown to be effective means of responding to these risks both in prevention and care state based medical legal partnerships would marshal the most appropriate resources to help such vulnerable older adults the elder justice coalition commends reps spanberger and katko for introducing the linking seniors to needed legal services act and fully support its inclusion in the elder justice reauthorization and modernization act of 2021 said bob blancato national coordinator elder justice coalition by supporting the services of medical legal partnerships and expanding the work of senior legal hotlines underserved older adults will be able to reach legal supports many for the first time as advocates for elder justice we too often hear of older adults who are unable to gain access to the justice system this bill would help solve that problem on behalf of the more than 6 million americans living with alzheimer s we are grateful to rep spanberger for introducing the linking seniors to needed legal services act of 2021 people living with alzheimer s are at heightened risk for experiencing elder abuse and this new bill would seek to address through the creation of medical legal partnerships to ensure a holistic and inclusive approach to care and improve vulnerable elders access to legal and social services said robert egge chief public policy officer alzheimer s association executive director alzheimer s impact movement social security works applauds representative abigail spanberger for her important leadership in sponsoring the linking seniors to needed legal services act of 2021 said nancy altman president social security works social security and medicare are essential for economic security and so are services to ensure that people can access the medical legal and other support they need rep spanberger understands this her visionary approach will bring together interdisciplinary teams in every state to ensure that seniors can get their needs met at a single location there is no question that this important legislation will improve all of our economic security the linking seniors to needed legal services act would directly appropriate 125 million for each of fiscal years 2022 through fy 2025 to fund these programs as part of the elder justice act the spanberger katko legislation would also require states to report to the secretary of the u s department of health and human services for evaluation and a report to congress from the secretary every four years click here for the full bill text

support us gearjunkie may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article learn more i recently read an article about affordable cars under 50 000 and had to laugh you can get a great vehicle for less money these are some of the best adventure vehicles under 10 000 is setting a 10 000 spending cap a fair objective most certainly but it requires some patience and discipline to stay within budget fortunately the used auto market is full of awesome cars trucks and vans that with a little elbow grease will show you great times and provide reliable transportation for years to come a word on our selections we chose these cars for their availability to the masses and practicality to get you out to the fun and no it s not the end all be all list of best adventure vehicles under 10 000 these are some of our favorites that leave money in the bank for other equally important tools and toys honda element 2003 2011 during the element s 9 year production run it has proved itself a reliable daily driver for many who needed a dependable practical vehicle if you can score one with all wheel drive the roads less traveled immediately become accessible today the honda element fulfills the workhorse role for the budget conscious only try to avoid the 2003 model year as the first year of production had the most complaints and reported issues as explained by copilot and motoraudit price the choice models will fetch prices in the neighborhood of 12 to 15 large shop around for a well maintained roller and prices become reasonable somewhere at 8 500 or below if you re not afraid of taking on a project it s not uncommon to find one for around 3 000 or less the good honda has a robust reputation for reliability and build quality its high ground clearance makes traversing backroads and trails a breeze having a rugged plastic interior and no carpeting doesn t elevate the element in any way except when it comes to cleaning honda engineers knew the outdoors would make its way inside the cabin and prepared their boxy utility vehicle for easy cleanup you can even hose it down with soap and water for major cleanups the bad it only seats four isn t the fastest pony in the stable and the gas mileage isn t too good why element the honda element is still a fan favorite for those who enjoy the active lifestyle or need a penny wise work mule aside from its below average fuel economy the small yet spacious element will hold its value moreover it ll last well over 200 000 miles has space to fit full sheets of plywood if you take out the back seats and is economical to own toyota sequoia xk30 xk40 2001 2007 the toyota sequoia which shares many parts with the tundra is a roomier version of the land cruiser and a sturdy towing vehicle emphasis is placed on creature comfort and less on its off road capabilities than the land cruiser price in 2005 the sequoia got a facelift and healthy power increase from 240 to 282 horsepower and 325 pound feet of torque when toyota upgraded the 4 7l v8 with variable valve timing vvt i the average selling price for the 2005 2007 xk40 model years is around 8 500 moderately better deals exist for the 2001 2003 xk30 sequoias if the midcycle upgrades aren t important to you the good 128 cubic feet equate to lots of cargo space for carrying your gear drivers and passengers will appreciate the refined creature comforts available second row captain chairs and third row seating the sequoia has a pleasing driving experience for its size and strong towing capability build quality and reliability meet toyota standards and reputation a burly max towing capacity of 6 200 pounds makes the sequoia a first class mule for hauling your recreational toys the bad slow and go traffic deals a heavy blow to fuel economy freeway speeds show its thirst for gas long drives are hampered by a 26 gallon gas tank interior plastics are known for brittleness in early models factory brakes are not entirely up to spec for an suv weighing more than 5 000 pounds consider a brake upgrade if towing or you re a driver who regularly drives above the posted speed limit why sequoia often overlooked as an option for a full size suv the sequoia s steady resale value is a testament to its safety record reliability and build quality toyota prius 2nd gen 2004 2009 it s easy to see why several toyotas were chosen but how did a prius make itself onto an adventure vehicle list well the little fuel sipper has some hidden talents space efficiency is one component where it excels along with its low cost of ownership price a second gen prius will ring up roughly in the 5 000 range most prius car batteries will work effectively for 8 to 10 years or anywhere between 100 000 and 150 000 miles when it s time for a new hybrid battery pack the replacement cost falls in the realm of 2 500 to 4 400 the good toyota s reputation for reliability doesn t falter with the prius it scores highly in u s news cars rankings and has an excellent value rating by intellichoice for its predicted 5 year total cost of ownership compared to other vehicles in its class phenomenal fuel economy an impeccable safety record and an efficient interior layout that offers a lot of passenger and cargo room are more reasons why the prius is an intelligent choice because of its enduring popularity an abundance of aftermarket add ons and upgrades abound the bad a lackluster ride quality cramped rear seats and boring acceleration bring down the prius a notch however a good set of kyb shocks will solve the soft suspension ride build quality is commendable except for the 2010 and 2016 models that had some major mechanical problems and interior accessory concerns why prius when converted to van life the back seat folds opening up enough space to stretch out and sleep think the prius can t handle the roads less traveled a simple upgrade of shocks and a 1 5 inch lift kit will set up the japanese hatchback to take on the washboard and bumps of gravel and access roads when heading out to remote locations factor in its admirable reliability rating and the prius is unlikely to break down when venturing far from home jeep cherokee xj 1984 2001 the jeep cherokee is a classic american off roader with lots of upgrade options a buddy once purchased a stock model for 3 000 with just 125 000 miles after adding a lift kit and tires his final bill was about 6 000 price its iconic status and heavy activity in the pre owned automotive market over the past several years have moved the average price to about 12 000 nevertheless there s still a fair chance of finding the right one with fewer than 140 000 miles below 10 000 and having money left over for add ons and repairs the good stock cherokees are easy to come by and easy to upgrade a 4 inch lift installed by a good mechanic costs just under 1 000 add some good tires and other mechanical fixes and you ve got a great vehicle many used models are already lifted and ready for the trail the bad old cherokees take a lot of wrench time and tend to have lots of small issues that can lead to headaches o2 sensors dashboard lights check engine lights and oil leaks are some common problems why cherokee if you want a tough looking adventure vehicle with few frills that can go damn near anywhere the cherokee delivers ford ranger xlt 1998 2011 when i bought my 2000 ford ranger in late 2014 it had 130 000 miles a bright red check engine light a dinged side panel and crappy tires and 3 000 later it was a great truck that dragged me all over the rocky mountains in all sorts of weather all in 6 500 price rangers vary widely depending on age but a savvy buyer should be able to get into a decent early 2000s model for around 7 000 lower mileage will cost a lot more the good the ford ranger xlt was made in massive quantities so it s easy to find it s also easy to find cheap parts and work on these smallish trucks the bad you will probably spend some time with a wrench as high mileage fords aren t the most reliable adventure vehicles under 10 000 on the road i ve put a fair bit of work into this truck but it s still 20 000 cheaper than buying new why ranger if you want a pickup that easily fits into a normal parking spot this is one of just a few midsize options chevy silverado 1999 2007 the silverado was named motor trend s truck of the year four times since its introduction in 1999 and has two distinct generations before and after 2007 the new models are nice but nearly impossible to find in a 4 4 under 10 000 the ubiquitous full size chevy is available in many trims and configurations that should fit any taste in a backroad explorer price nice enough silverados under 150 000 miles are relatively easy to find between 5 000 and 10 000 newer models under 10 000 will likely have super high mileage some issues to contend with and body damage the good silverados are big trucks but they re pretty easy to drive and are remarkably comfortable inside this is a full size truck and thus a 4 4 model will get you anywhere you should need to go feeling frisky beef it up with a lift and go get weird want a camper slap on a topper and toss in a mattress boom the bad well they re kind of huge you won t enjoy parallel parking in downtown denver and filling the tank ouch why silverado if you re looking for a full size pickup this is one great choice that s easy to find at a good price on the used market toyota 4runner 1995 2009 the 4runner is a reliable and capable suv and with thousands of used models on the road they are possible to find with moderate mileage for under 10 000 this date range covers the third and fourth generations of this model price some may think that scoring a 150 000 mile or less 4runner or tacoma in a respectable condition for less than 10 000 is like hunting for that elusive unicorn however a quick search of craigslist brings up dozens of choices with some dipping well below the 10 000 mark the good the 4runner is a long running reliable adventure vehicle that s comfortable for four adults it s a good around town car is comfortable on long drives and is capable off road the bad interior storage is somewhat small for such a large vehicle they also come with a toyota price tag so expect to pay a fair chunk of change even for vehicles with high mileage while they re ok off road clearance is not spectacular and approach angles are limited why 4runner although many suvs have gone the way of cars the 4runner has a body on frame design meaning fair off road performance subaru outback 2004 2014 it s been called the state car of colorado idaho and pretty much everywhere else that gets lots of snow with full time all wheel drive the subaru outback is a solid performer on modest off road terrain and absolutely amazing on snow it s also spacious efficient and runs forever price these have been around for a long time so the range is vast you should be able to find a third or fourth gen subie with moderate mileage for around 8 500 these things dependably run up to 300 000 miles or more so don t be afraid of miles just expect some significant maintenance bills the good at the grand canyon for an ultramarathon a local called it a mud sled while my crew was discussing the condition of fire roads they needed to drive to reach aid stations these things really are rugged especially for a car they have decent clearance and rip around fire roads with aplomb inside they are as roomy as most suvs yet they sit lower and get respectable gas mileage not to mention they are very reliable the bad you may be branded a tree hugging hippie why well if you ve ever driven through boulder colorado you ll know if you re cool with this or just don t give a hoot what others think the subaru is an excellent vehicle be certain to check the antifreeze and oil for signs of bad head gaskets a common problem with this model that is expensive to fix on the two sided boxer engine why outback these are great cars that seat five in comfort with lots of room for extras inside you can lay down the seat and sleep in the back you can expect lots of trouble free miles from the outback so long as you avoid overheating and the head gaskets are good toyota land cruiser 80 series 1990 1997 sadly it s nearly impossible to find a 60 or 70 series land cruiser that isn t a pile of rust and is running for under 10 000 but if you shop smartly you should still be able to find an 80 series land cruiser around that 10 000 threshold price you can get a quality 80 series fifth gen j80 for 10 000 but expect it to have high miles the toyota tax is in full effect here as fans have continued to pine after nice examples prices for nice examples are only going up at this point the good with a land cruiser you re joining the ranks of legions of devoted fans these things have been everywhere and are well respected off road machines anywhere in the world they are excellent expedition vehicles and their customization options are endless the bad get ready to choke when you fill the tank the 1990 model gets 11 mpg in the city and 13 mpg on the highway unless you can find a rare in the u s turbo diesel model watch out for head gasket problems and valve gasket oil leaks why land cruiser 80 series comfortable seating for up to five passengers legendary reliability and genuine off road capability are just some of the reasons people around the world love these beasts isuzu trooper 1992 2002 boxy with a big interior the second gen isuzu trooper is a workhorse of an suv shoot you can fit bikes in the back without taking the wheels off and it s the only truck in which we ve fit a tandem removing the front wheel price troopers were available in the u s through 2002 so you ll have to choose from an older model many cost well under 5 000 with beaters under 2 000 a clean lower mileage example will set you back around 10 000 these days the good we can t think of any other midsize suv with the interior space of a trooper these things are basically large 4 4 boxes on wheels and that s awesome in the space department they also get decent gas mileage and have fairly high stock clearance the bad beauty is in the eye of the beholder and these are well boxy they re also tricky for the home mechanic and require a lot of specialized tools reliability can be a problem with older troopers as with finding a qualified mechanic why trooper want to sleep in the back of your suv this is your steed they have ample interior space but maintain a modest external presence toyota tacoma 1995 2004 ah the taco the early models were truly small trucks before they got nearly as big as tundras reliable capable and good looking tacomas hit all the high marks price snagging a good one for under about 10 000 calls for a little luck and a long search a solid example will probably set you back right around 17 000 the good classic good looks and a vehicle that can t be killed there s a good reason this is one of the most popular pickups in the world the bad the stock suspension isn t considered adequate by most serious off roaders if you re going to push it over tough terrain you ll want an upgrade also good luck finding a bargain many tacomas pushing 200 000 miles also push beyond the 10 000 mark some tacomas are prone to frame rust many were recalled so be sure to check the frame carefully why tacoma they will run and run and run these things are legendary vw vanagon multivan 1979 1992 it s the classic vw bus but with a better water cooled engine that means the heater works given its high clearance the t3 third gen type 2 vanagon is pretty off road capable especially with chains price these old babies have held their value well maintained models still bring well over 10 000 these days that said many can be found for much less if you re willing to do some work with 8 000 10 000 examples available regularly it s the westfalia editions that command the big dollars the good the vanagon is huge inside and carries up to seven passengers in reasonable comfort it has all kinds of conversion potential if you re lucky you may even find one of the westfalia camper models that fit your budget the bad can you say underpowered you will always see the vanagon in the far right lane creeping up mountains at a snail s pace the saving grace is that first gear is really low so it will always get going it was manufactured between 1979 and 1990 so you ll be looking at an old model and should be ready to wrench on it why vanagon these vans have classic styling tons of room and can handle easy off road conditions with their high clearance toyota corolla 1998 2010 why is the measly corolla on this list because i ve taken one on more adventures than any car other i ve ever owned and i still own one to this day it s nicknamed the off road ola it often gets chosen over my truck for one serious reason gas mileage price 2 000 give or take the good cheap reliable transportation that is remarkably spacious for two adults the back seats fold down to allow long items skis to fit in the trunk stick on a bike rack and you can carry a full summer s worth of camping gear with no trouble bonus if you get the hatchback model and you d better believe this thing can off road ok within reason the bad it can t really off road it s a car factor in the price of a roof rack you ll need it why corolla if you are strapped for cash a toyota corolla will get you there reliably for very little money want to road trip to yosemite with a bunch of climbing gear turn the key and go need to drive from the midwest to the pacific ocean for some r r turn the key and go these tiny tanks run on a little fuel and crossed fingers so those are some of our favorites yes tons of vehicles can get you into and hopefully out of adventure frequently asked questions what cars are best for adventure the best adventure vehicles will last for years of service are versatile have numerous aftermarket parts available and retain an affordable ownership cost what car can i buy with 10 000 great dependable vehicles can be found for 10 000 or less older japanese sedans such as the toyota camry honda accord and mazda 3 are excellent compact cars that combine reliability and affordability the third and fourth generation subaru outback is a popular choice for young families and people who enjoy an active lifestyle what is considered high mileage on a car a common threshold of 100 000 miles is a guideline when shopping for a used car typically older vehicles require more expensive maintenance and repairs after 100 000 miles or 8 years on the road nevertheless modern automotive technology and regular service intervals mean most production cars trucks and suvs will continue running well past 100 000 miles some automakers are known for making vehicles that easily exceed 200 000 miles an additional factor to consider is that highway miles put less wear on a

at risk of sounding like a broken record i do want to repeat a simple observation about the current investing climate you don t have to be a raging bear in the gmo mold to accept that although us growth stocks and thus us stocks are still on a tear valuations might be looking a little toppy so it s no leap to conclude as i have that international diversification is sensible for american investors the more difficult question is which foreign markets present the best opportunities i ve already made the case for uk equities as you d expect from a brit as well as emerging markets this week i want to challenge the brexit stereotype of eu phobia and suggest that despite some positive inflows us etf investors are still underweight eurozone equities more to the point this underweight position is a mistake since eurozone equities are cheap and their corporates are booming with record earnings and buybacks in the cards even more importantly us investors have gotten the wrong image of the eurozone markets as varied as germany and sweden have fundamentally changed but etf investors haven t caught on before we look at why the gap with us equities might narrow let s first admit that investing in europe is complicated there s a legion of indices kicking around all with different footprints the dominant distinction is between an index such as the msci europe or stoxx 60 index that tracks all european indices including the non eurozone markets of the uk and switzerland and those that are more focused this latter group largely consists of eurozone specific indices such as the msci eurozone index or the popular stoxx 50 index the fifty largest eurozone stocks by market cap

do you have investments if so then you should know about the drip reinvestment plan this is a popular investment strategy used by many investors to grow their assets in this guide we will discuss how drip works and how to go about setting up your drip account a drip is a type of investment account that investors can use to buy shares in a company it stands for dividend reinvestment plan it is an automatic investing method as you simply provide your bank information tell the company how much money you would like to invest each month week year they will automatically purchase additional shares on your behalf drip reinvestment plan is great for those who want to control their investments but do not have time to follow the stock market every day in drips you can choose to reinvest your dividends in the company s stock drips are different from other investment plans because they focus on buying and holding shares for long term growth rather than trading them frequently for short term gains understanding drip a dividend usually has a form of a check or direct deposit a dividend reinvestment plan allows owners to utilize their dividends to buy more stock from the company shares acquired in this method are often non liquid and may be redeemed only directly with the business one of the most common types of dividend reinvestment programs provides shares at a significant discount but it is on the condition that you purchase them with a small fee rather than the total price and they require a minimum investment amount of 10 these programs usually target investors who already have shares in the company however some will accept new investors if their investment is more substantial types of dividend reinvestment plans there are many ways to reinvest dividends depending on your investment objectives some drips do not provide any dividends for the first year others offer a little less than the issuing company pays out to shareholders generally besides some will give one or two additional shares as rebates for every share owned after a specific time interval in this way some companies reward their loyal long term shareholders by giving them an extra share now and then or by increasing the number of shares they own overall over time because the dividend is directly reinvested rather than paid out there are several types of drips company operated drip programs some large cap companies offer their own direct stock purchase plans and dividends reinvestment programs drips that allow you to buy stocks directly from them instead of using a brokerage as well as traditional drips that are available to buy in the public market suggested changes a few large cap company members of the djia have allocated a portion or all of their stock dividend payments for investors enrolled in their company s direct knowledge purchase plan and who reside within the us via providing attractive discount shares acquired by enrolling these firms include coca cola co nyse ko johnson johnson nyse jnj procter gamble nyse pg united states steel corp third party drips the best way to start investing is in third party drips which are often offered by transferring agents computershare is one of the leading transfer agents and offers a search portal so that you can research and sign up for companies with drips as well generally there are fees associated with the amount of stock you want to invest in in some cases there are also fees with individual purchases comparison is essential when looking at your options some brokerages offer the opportunity to invest in stocks for more than one company and mutual funds or etfs diy drips if you are looking for a company that does not offer dividend reinvestment or if your brokerage doesn t allow it it is possible to do it on your own fractional shares may be unavailable however you can still invest manually and continue to reap the benefits of compound returns or dollar cost averaging how does drip work a drip reinvestment plan is a simple concept invest all the dividends from stocks and index funds while buying new shares rinse and repeat as often as you wish however it is not limited to whole stocks and is applicable to fractional shares as well fractional shares occur whenever a company issues dividends in excess of the number of shares owned by an investor fractional shares are generally worth less than one whole share and have no financial value but they can serve as evidence that you own stock in a company to redeem fractional shares for cash payment you must contact the transfer agent or broker who processed your purchase when you made the first purchase on the stock market fractionals may not trade independently on any exchange therefore they have no market value although some security depositories will issue certificates carrying certain rights to fractionals fractional ownership occurs regularly within mutual funds where such holdings are better known as undivided interests advantages of a dividend reinvestment plan the benefits drips provide for investors are numerous firstly they include taxation advantages this is mainly applicable if you have stocks from a us company as they have tax holidays every year and usually come together with dividend payments secondly a drip allows the investor to buy stocks directly from the company without paying any commission or brokerage fees further a drip enables the investor to buy shares for only 25 per transaction this amount will vary by the company in addition an investor can purchase more shares with the money received from the dividend payment companies can take benefit from drips as well by using drips companies can raise cash to grow their businesses or cover shortfalls during tough economic times by encouraging investors to invest directly in the company rather than selling off stocks to get the money they need by offering them incentives such as lower fees moreover the money for dividend payments that accrued while the company was not publicly traded remains with the company and is not paid out pro rata to all shareholders another advantage for companies is the collection of fees in particular the company charges fees directly itself however it will generally use its broker dealer therefore there will be some costs on account of commissions exchange fees etc which other sources such as revenue from trading or other services performed for clients cover the drawbacks of using a drip despite numerous advantages there are several drawbacks that drips possess firstly there is no commission when investing in stocks purchased through dividend reinvestment plans in contrast a broker usually charges a 1 to 2 commission on each trade further the disadvantage of transactions costs adds up over time an investor can save thousands of dollars in transaction costs by investing through a traditional brokerage account instead of a drip plan finally some companies may have their share price drop below the level when you bought the stock if this happens you will still buy your shares at a higher rate regardless of market prices how to start drip investing a drip is a dividend reinvestment plan for buying shares of a company s stock automatically drip plans are common for companies that pay dividends as an alternative way for shareholders to purchase more shares at no additional cost and with little effort on their part companies may offer drip programs because they want long term investors to hold onto their stocks through various market cycles these programs can also be useful when there is limited liquidity or when it would otherwise be cost or time consuming for a shareholder to acquire enough securities using other methods when looking for stocks to invest in examine the company s history of paying dividends even if they have not increased their dividend payout historically a consistently reliable record is vital once you ve decided which companies to invest in there are several options for drips depending on the type of reinvesting they include company operated drip programs suggested changes third party drips and diy drips conclusion above and beyond the following safety tips a drip reinvestment plan also has tax implications if you plan to take advantage of this investment program consult a tax professional for specific information on how these investments relate to your tax situation

body is all about in order to maintain reasonable ethical standards in any sector in society the government of every nation either sets up regulatory bodies or authorizes already established regulatory bodies to control the affairs of these sectors financial industry regulatory authority finra is a private regulatory body authorized by the governmental body to oversee and regulate the affairs of the american financial system the securities and exchange commission sec the ultimate us government regulatory agency supports and empowers finra sec has charged finra with the primary assignment of focusing on setting standards and enforcing rules on brokers and broker dealer firms in america the industry basically acts as an auditor which scrutinizes the performances of brokers within the united states manipulative operations and bad practices have become rampant in the financial sector as the rate of fraudsters who seek to dupe people of their wealth is continuously on a significant rise in recent years the existence of a self regulatory institution like finra curtails such bad practices and protects the interests of investors in the market finra is the largest self regulatory firm in the united states by the volume of the brokerage firms and registered securities representatives it oversees it was more than 3 700 and 63 000 respectively as of mid 2021 history of finra the evolution of finra began in mid 2007 at that time finra came as a merger between the national association of securities dealers inc nasd and the new york stock exchange nyse nasd was a private regulatory body established under the 1938 maloney act amendments to the securities exchange act of 1934 it was as well empowered by the sec and responsible for overseeing and monitoring the activities of its members finra has become a successor to nasd as such both entities are established with similar regulatory powers finra s activity as said earlier the essence of regulatory bodies in the financial market cannot be overemphasized they serve the market a lot of benefits and make it safe for traders especially investors finra in its lots of responsibilities is serving the market in

dealer firms the body ensures that all brokers within the united states are licensed and registered before offering services to customers finra provides a platform that educates brokers on the ethical standards required of them to become validated and legitimated in the market thus it further conducts qualification exams for them brokers who are able to pass their qualification exams must

supervision of brokers this way finra can easily detect bad operations among brokers to protect the interest of investors finra processes most of the transactions in order to be able to easily detect manipulative transactions impeachment and discipline of bad operations it will be almost impossible to maintain compliance with rules if there are no provisions for disciplinary actions in cases where finra discovers bad operations among brokers the body takes disciplinary actions against such acts the fear of prosecution will curtail malicious acts to a good extent it is a very good measure to achieve finra s goals of protecting investors interests finra punishes non complying brokers in diverse ways sometimes the body issues fines or suspends its lawbreakers it also has the power to disqualify brokers who go against its rules if deemed worthy of disqualification moreso in some cases finra hands over cases of bad operations to the sec or some other regulatory bodies in addition to finra s obligations to the financial market the body also settles disputes among investors in order to maintain a conducive market environment staying compliant with finra as said earlier finra aims

tools deployable by brokers and broker dealer firms to help them stay tuned to finra s regulations are the paperless document and the efilecabinet finra vs sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra and the securities and exchange commission sec are two separate entities with almost similar functions finra is a regulatory body established under sec as such finra is subjected to sec and it is empowered by sec finra also enforces regulations that sec established finra is a non governmental body while sec is a governmental regulatory body that oversees it benefits of financial

were materially false and misleading at all relevant times for more information on the paypal class action go to cassava sciences inc nasdaq sava class period february 2 2021 to august 24 2021 lead plaintiff deadline october 26 2021 on august 24 2021 after the market closed reports emerged about a citizen petition submitted to the u s food and drug administration fda concerning the accuracy and integrity of clinical data for simufilam the petition requested that the fda halt cassava s clinical trials pending a thorough audit of the publications and data relied upon by the company among other things the petition stated that the detailed analysis of the western blots shows a series of anomalies that are suggestive of systematic data manipulation and misrepresentation it also stated that the methodology for studies about simufilam s effects in experiments conducted on postmortem human brain tissue defies logic and the data presented again have hallmarks of manipulation the petition further stated that after initial analyses of phase 2b trials found that simufilam was ineffective in improving the primary biomarkers endpoint cassava had these samples analyzed again and this time reported that simufilam rapidly and robustly improved a wide array of biomarkers and the reanalysis shows signs of data anomalies or manipulation on august 25 2021 before the market opened cassava issued a response to the petition claiming that the allegations regarding scientific integrity are false and misleading among other things the company claimed that the clinical data which the citizen petition stated had been reanalyzed to show simufilam was effective had been generated by quanterix corp quanterix an independent company suggesting that the reanalysis was valid on august 27 2021 before the market opened quanterix issued a statement denying the company s claims stating that it did not interpret the test results or prepare the data touted by cassava the same day cassava responded to quanterix s statement stating that quanterix sole responsibility with regard to this clinical study was to perform sample testing specifically to measure levels of p tau in plasma samples collected from study subjects on this news the company s share price fell 12 51 or 17 6 to close at 58 34 per share on august 27 2021 on unusually heavy trading volume the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and or misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company s business operations and prospects specifically defendants failed to disclose to investors 1 that data underlying the foundational research for cassava s product candidates had been manipulated 2 that experiments using post mortem human brain tissue frozen for nearly 10 years was contrary to a basic understanding of neurobiology 3 that biomarker analysis for patients treated with simufilam had been manipulated to conclude that simufilam was effective 4 that quanterix an independent company had not interpreted the test results or prepared the data charts for the biomarker analysis for patients treated with simufilam 5 that as a result of the foregoing there was a reasonable likelihood that cassava would face regulatory scrutiny in connection with the development of simufilam and 6 that as a result of the foregoing

traveled the planet doing the thing he loves most playing rock n roll marathons for tens of thousands of ecstatic foo fighters fans but when the pandemic necessitated going into lockdown grohl took stock of how he might use this moment of pause channeling his creativity into writing and using his remarkable skill for storytelling in may 2020 he wrote a moving reflection for the atlantic on

to spectacular stories about nirvana foo fighters david bowie joan jett iggy pop paul mccartney playing drums for tom petty on saturday night live performing at the white house and even swing dancing

storytelling grohl said whether in song documentary film or on the page i have always felt compelled to share moments from my life this inclination is a huge part of what excites me creatively but also as a human being in march 2020 realizing that my day job with the foo fighters was going to go on hold i started an instagram account davestruestories and decided to focus all of my creative energy on writing some of my stories down something i love doing but i ve never really had the time for i soon found that the reward i felt every time i posted a story was the same as the feeling i get when playing a song to an audience so i kept on writing the response from readers was a soul filling as any applause in an arena so i took stock of all the experiences i ve had in my life incredible difficult funny and emotional and decided it was time to finally put them into words now with the amazing people at dey street books i m excited and honored to announce the storyteller a collection of memories of a life lived loud from my early days growing up in the suburbs of washington dc to hitting the road at the age of 18 and all the music that followed i can now share these adventures with the world as seen and heard from behind the microphone turn it up thornton added from the second i saw dave s first post on instagram i knew i was going to publish his book well to be honest i ve been hoping to publish dave grohl s book since i became a book editor i m a gen xer i m from virginia just like dave we grew up listening to a lot of the same music i ve always admired his puckish personality and his awesome musicianship it turns out that he can write with as much energy and passion as he performs plus he s a spectacular human who cares deeply about his mom his family his bandmates music art and the world all of that passion comes through in his stories and in the storyteller i am a lucky editor indeed but mostly because i get to read the book first grohl has a well earned reputation as a prolific collaborator his various endeavors have included cut me some slack written and recorded with paul mccartney and grohl s nirvana bandmates krist novoselic and pat

the biggest set of u s tax increases in a generation took a major step forward on wednesday with approval by the house ways and means committee of 2 1 trillion in new levies mostly focused on corporations and the wealthy the vote largely along party lines there were no republican votes in favor brings president joe biden s 4 trillion longer term economic agenda one step closer to enactment the tax package will help pay for the biggest expansion in social spending in decades in a budget bill currently penciled in at 3 5 trillion while the committee agreed to key elements including tax increases on businesses and the wealthy an extension of refundable child tax credits along with a bevy of incentives for clean energy differences remain with legislation being developed in the senate with slim majorities in both chambers democrats expect weeks of wrangling to smooth out the disputes we celebrate success in this nation but we can also ask the biggest companies and the ultra wealthy to contribute a bit more to the common good ways and means chairman richard neal said while the increases that we propose will go a long way in responsibly paying for our planned investments the rates will still remain lower than they were before the 2017 tax law richard neal anna moneymaker bloomberg among key measures yet to be determined is addressing the 10 000 cap on the federal deduction of state and local taxes neal on monday had agreed to meaningful changes from the 2017 gop imposed measure that largely affects high tax democratic run states his panel punted salt talks to speaker nancy pelosi to resolve later likely at the house rules committee which governs the chamber s floor action for businesses the legislation approved by ways and means would increase the top corporate tax rate to 26 5 from 21 while offering a lower rate to smaller businesses extend tax rules on sales of equities to cryptocurrencies and commodities for the first time largely leave untouched breaks for oil and gas companies in a move that angered environmental groups and boost taxes on overseas earnings for u s multinational companies by increasing a minimum levy enacted in 2017 during the trump administration it would also reduce an exemption for some of that income for individuals top marginal income tax rate is restored to the 39 6 that preceded the 2017 gop tax cuts signed by president donald trump a 3 surtax is imposed on incomes over 5 million capital gains rate rises to 25 from 20 for transactions by high income individuals made after sept 13 2021 new limits are set for large individual retirement accounts a boost to the net investment income tax will generate an estimate 252 billion the doubling of the estate tax exemption enacted by trump would come to an end in 2022 and the up to 3 600 per year monthly child tax payment democrats enacted this year will be extended through 2025 the bill on net is estimated to raise 871 billion after the value of the tax breaks are taken into account democrats say they will be able to pay for additional social spending in the so called reconciliation package by counting some 600 billion in savings from medicare spending on drugs along with funds from increased tax enforcement and added revenue stemming from the faster economic growth that s anticipated as a result of the overall bill republicans are united in opposition to both the tax hikes and the social spending they would help fund gop members of the house ways and means panel argued over four days of votes on amendments that the democratic proposal will stymie the economic recovery and lead to a wave of companies leaving the u s they zeroed in on tax breaks like a 12 500 electric vehicle credit that can be claimed by the wealthy while blasting a doubling of tobacco taxes which hits the poor never has our government wasted so much to kill so many american jobs drive prices even higher and hook a whole new generation of the poor on government dependency the committee s top republican kevin brady said ahead of the final vote work remains the 24 to 19 committee vote reflected the no cast by moderate democrat stephanie murphy of florida who is concerned over the planned 3 5 trillion price tag for the overall bill last week the panel by a similar margin approved the largest expansion of medicare in two decades including dental vision and hearing benefits for the first time along with provisions allowing medicare to negotiate on drug prices pelosi can only afford to lose three votes when the bill comes to the floor so changes to appease murphy and other moderates are likely modifications to the tax bill could come when it is sent to the house rules committee or through an amendment on the house floor along with salt changes house democrats are also still considering the biden administration s proposal to require banks and other financial institutions to report customers account flows to the irs neal said that provision is still in play with members working with the white house and treasury to come up with a plan that democrats can agree on biden s proposal which would kick in for accounts with gross flows of 600 or more has faced backlash from banking and credit union trade associations as well as consumer protection groups senate s turn challenges for the tax legislation remain in the senate the fast track reconciliation process that democrats are using bypasses the normal 60 vote requirement to defeat a filibuster removing the need for republican support however all 50 members of the democratic caucus would be needed for passage and not all of them are on board with the 3 5 trillion program senator joe manchin of west virginia wants a smaller scale bill and has suggested a 25 corporate tax rate senate finance committee chairman ron wyden is also looking at additional tax increases like a 2 tax on corporate stock buybacks and another excise tax on excess ceo compensation wyden s energy tax plan is also different from the house with a focus on credits closely linked to carbon emissions reduction wyden has also complained that the house panel does not do enough to tax billionaires even so a proposal by the white house to tax unrealized gains of millionaires and billionaires at death is all but dead in the house according to neal he indicated this week that ending the benefit known as step up in basis didn t have enough support to garner the 218 votes needed for it to pass the full house

like almost any american over the age of 25 i vividly remember september 11 2001 the images of planes striking buildings and people fleeing in terror and the resulting acts of heroism are indelibly etched the human consequences defy measurement and the economic costs were substantial property damage and cleanup costs were extensive the stock market was shuttered for days and plummeted upon reopening air travel was also halted and required considerable time to recover thousands of lives were lost along with their potential creativity earnings and productivity the events of 9 11 caused 100 billion in losses in new york city alone with the fallout affecting companies around the world consumer and business confidence dropped causing further economic harms spending increased in some industries in the aftermath investments in private security and the military increased for a few years research and development to deter future issues was also encouraged rules for many activities changed such as more stringent requirements for airport screening while less obvious on the surface the attacks brought a new risk into focus the idea that terrorists could cause such damage on us soil consequently we have implicitly raised the discount rate on everything thus affecting the level of investment and how resources are allocated for the overall economy however the events of 9 11 presented only a transitory setback we were already in a recession at the time the aftermath of the dot com bubble and it continued a few more months before things turned around the losses were far less severe than the great recession which in turn pales in comparison to the steep covid 19 downturn the reason for this remarkable ability to recover from even horrific events such as 9 11 is the adaptability and resilience of people and markets things changed but we adapted flying became different in 2001 but we still fly we have strong institutions such as the federal reserve ready to take swift and decisive action as needed to help curtail downturns and support recoveries as we struggle with the lingering pandemic and its deleterious effects on our lives and livelihoods the tragedy of 9 11 offers a compelling and uplifting lesson rarely have we had our collective confidence and emotions so thoroughly shattered things changed but we endured and achieved new heights many aspects of our daily sojourn have been temporarily and in some instances permanently altered over the past 18 months how we work how we travel how we shop how we interact with one another and even how we play what has not changed however is the institutional strength and human ingenuity that has brought us through past challenges and will do so again onward stay safe dr m ray perryman is president and chief executive officer of the perryman group www perrymangroup com which has served the needs of over 2 500 clients over the past four decades

volume increased remarkably month over month in the third quarter we are taking initiatives to strengthen our business for the long term and increase the reliability of our services to the u s market so far we have formed a few strategic co operations such as a joint investment with tongwei co ltd in a high purity crystalline silicon project with annual capacity of 45 000 metric tons an investment in inner mongolia xinte silicon materials co ltd and we have signed a strategic five year polysilicon supply agreement with wacker chemie ag wacker will supply polysilicon to jinkosolar from its production sites in germany and the united states meanwhile our overseas wafer manufacturing facility started construction in august and will serve our production facilities in malaysia and the united states when production ramps up we further improved our traceability system for procurement and production over 7gw of newly added capacity of large size cells was put into production during the second quarter to support the rapid growth in demand for large size products we are also expanding our investment plan for n type cell capacity based on our technical advantages and two years of mass production experience we expect the proportion of our large size product shipments to increase rapidly to approximately 50 of total shipments in the second half of this year in addition the uptake of the distributed generation businesses achieved rapid development with more flexible business models and lower sensitivity to prices in response to this trend we have also raised the proportion of shipments in relation to distributed generation projects for the full year to around 40 compared with 20 25 last year in order to meet the needs of customers facing different distributed application
