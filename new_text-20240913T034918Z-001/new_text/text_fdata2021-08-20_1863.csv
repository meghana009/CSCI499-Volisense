netflix is routinely criticized for showing a certain lack of compassion to preserve its cutthroat company culture managers are pressured to apply a keeper test to their team members and employees have apparently used the firm s commitment to radical candor to shame peers the streaming giant is also known however for trusting its employees expenses are not limited for example and the public company shares sensitive information internally it even gives employees updates about subscriber growth a number that investors use to make trading decisions about netflix stock before making it public advertisement ceo reed hastings acknowledged he was tempting fate with this highly unusual practice in his book no rule rules penguin press 2020 the financial world sees this as reckless he wrote but the information has never been leaked when it does one day leak i imagine it will we won t overreact we ll just deal with that one case and continue with transparency the prophetic conclusion is no longer theoretical on aug 18 the us securities and exchange commission sec announced that three former netflix employees and two outsider associates were charged in a multi year 3 million scandal that relied on non public data about the company s performance how the alleged insider trades at netflix worked the former netflix engineer at the heart of the alleged scheme is sung mo jay jun 49 who lives in bellevue washington when he worked at netflix he had access to subscriber information from at least july 2016 through february 2017 according to the sec in that time he passed along information to his younger brother joon mo jun 45 and the senior jun s longtime friend junwoo chon 49 both of who also live in washington joon mo jun and chon would in turn buy or sell netflix stock accordingly before the analysts received the same information on earnings calls the evidence suggests part of their windfall would be shared with jay joon as a cash kickback according to the sec on many occasions during that period joon jun and chon placed trades minutes apart for identical netflix options contracts the ageny s complaint states advertisement jun left netflix in 2017 but he also made a personal trade ahead of the company s april 2017 quarterly earnings call allegedly based on information obtained when he was still at netflix the apparent ringleader also allegedly tapped his former netflix friends including a mentee that same year jun remained in contact with ayden lee 33 a netflix engineer who lives in san jose california and who considered jun a mentor the sec claims lee met the more experienced engineer when he interviewed for a job at netflix over a two year period jun routinely asked lee for information about netflix s performance lee seeing jun as a friend complied knowing that jun was using the knowledge to place trades the sec claims lee s lawyer emphasized the power dynamics between the two men in a statement to fortune about the case he essentially said that his client was swindled by a persuasive trusted mentor and that lee did not himself receive cash kickbacks or trade on insider information ayden is a young engineer who was taken advantage of by an older more experienced former colleague whom he considered to be a mentor and friend the attorney stated nevertheless ayden is taking full responsibility for his actions and looks forward to putting this mistake which he made having scarcely passed his 30th birthday behind him and moving forward with his life advertisement jun also is alleged to have solicited insider knowledge from one of his former friends at netflix jae hyeon bae age 42 in 2019 bae had joined a private messaging channel called race against the market on a popular business communication platform the sec says jun his brother and chon were members of the same forum the elder jun contacted bae to ask about how netflix was doing before its second quarter earnings call in july bae allegedly recommended selling netflix shares in advance of the release and the grim headlines that followed netflix stock plummets after massive subscriber miss cnn noted in all the sec alleges that the group acquired and took advantage of nonpublic information ahead of 13 separate netflix earnings announcements the regulator s market abuse unit used analytics tools to spot the suspiciously prescient trades netflix s policy on making subscriber numbers available to any employee who is interested was also noted in the docket netflix treats the subscriber numbers as confidential information according to its company policies including its insider trading policy which all employees must acknowledge the sec said the five defendants have waived their right to a trial and agreed to pay penalties in the sec s case the us attorney s office for the western district of washington has also filed a criminal case that could lead to jail time naming four of the defendants all but bae advertisement netflix s hastings ought to be unruffled by the insider s betrayal in recent years netflix has faced increasing competition from newer streaming providers including disney apple and amazon prime the company most recently reported poor growth for the second quarter of 2021 when it also projected adding 3 5 million global paid subscribers in the third quarter which would bring its total subscriber base to about 213 million employees of netflix which declined to comment for this story will likely still be among the first to know whether the company hits that goal as the site simply wall st notes hastings discussed his unusual policy of previewing internal information with his thousands of staffers in an interview with financial review last year he echoed his remarks in his book saying as we grow i m sure stuff will leak eventually it s really an apocryphal story that you can share a lot more with people than you think he said there are risks of sharing but there s risks of alienation in not sharing also he continued the point is most management teams drive to safety because they don t want to see that leak but when you run your organization like the security services run theirs there s real cost to innovation buy in and understanding

a couple of developments likely factored into the declines for these vaccine stocks what happened shares of three leading covid 19 vaccine makers sank on thursday as of the market close biontech bntx 0 94 stock was down 8 8 shares of moderna mrna 2 01 and novavax nvax 1 17 fell 5 8 and 4 2 respectively none of the companies announced any developments however there were a couple of stories that were likely related to the vaccine stocks sinking cnbc reported that some scientists are criticizing the u s government s decision to move forward with third booster doses of messenger rna mrna vaccines as premature also results from a large u k study were published online those results showed that the effectiveness against the delta variant for the covid 19 vaccines developed by pfizer pfe 0 61 and biontech and by astrazeneca falls off quickly so what some investors could fret that the u s might reconsider its position on third booster doses if there s too much pushback from the scientific community that could potentially impact biontech and moderna a rapid loss of efficacy against the delta variant could also make the pfizer biontech vaccine less attractive than other covid 19 vaccines however it seems highly unlikely that the biden administration will change its mind on booster doses in light of the ongoing surge in covid 19 cases the u k study actually bolsters the argument that booster doses could be necessary regardless the u s has already agreed to buy enough doses of the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines to provide third booster doses to all fully vaccinated americans and novavax arguably shouldn t be impacted all that much by any of this news now what many of the moves in these stocks on thursday were likely more noise than anything significant there are things to watch with each of the three companies though that could cause the stocks to move either higher or lower for biontech and moderna the key catalysts on the way are potential new supply deals for 2022 and beyond as well as the possibility of expanded u s authorizations for younger children the main potential catalysts for novavax are the anticipated authorizations over the next few months of its covid 19 vaccine in several countries including the u s
former westinghouse electric co senior vice president jeffrey a benjamin was charged with 16 felony counts including conspiracy wire fraud securities fraud and causing a publicly traded company to keep a false record for his part in failing to truthfully report information regarding construction of new nuclear units at the v c summer nuclear plant in south carolina benjamin is the fourth individual to be charged in the ongoing federal investigation former scana ceo kevin marsh former scana executive vice president stephen byrne and former westinghouse vice president carl churchman have all pleaded guilty to federal felony charges for their roles in the matter however in a statement acting u s attorney for the district of south carolina m rhett dehart noted that all charges against benjamin are merely accusations and that the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty the v c summer debacle the effort to expand the v c summer nuclear station began in 2008 when south carolina electric gas sce g a scana corp subsidiary and santee cooper south carolina s state owned electric and water utility the state s largest power provider and one of the nation s largest public power utilities filed an application to build two new westinghouse ap1000 reactors at the site in fairfield county south carolina the reactors units 2 and 3 were originally planned to be brought online in 2016 and 2019 respectively with sce g owning 55 of the v c summer expansion and santee cooper owning the remaining 45 the estimated cost was 10 5 billion the project quickly fell behind schedule and costs ballooned westinghouse which was also supplying two ap1000 units for the vogtle nuclear expansion in georgia which was also troubled by schedule delays and cost overruns was crippled financially as a result of the two projects in march 2017 westinghouse filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy with more than 10 4 billion in construction and interest reportedly spent by the owners on the v c summer project and analysis indicating that the project would not be finished until 2024 at a total of more than 25 billion scana and santee cooper decided to abandon the project on july 31 2017 it was reportedly more than 64 complete at the time scana corp which was reeling following the abandonment decision with several lawsuits filed by a variety of plaintiffs including ratepayers shareholders and citizen groups was acquired by dominion energy in a deal announced on january 3 2018 the merger was completed a year later with scana shares converted into 0 6690 shares of newly issued dominion energy common stock the conversion resulted in a transaction value of approximately 6 8 billion in addition to the assumption of approximately 6 6 billion in existing consolidated scana net debt benjamin allegedly concealed trouble benjamin who served as senior vice president for new plants and major projects and directly supervised all new nuclear projects worldwide for westinghouse during the v c summer project was charged in a federal indictment on aug 18 the indictment alleges that benjamin was personally involved in communications between westinghouse and the plant owners scana and santee cooper regarding the status of the v c summer project the indictment further alleges that throughout 2016 and into 2017 when westinghouse had direct control over the construction and schedule of the project benjamin received information that the v c summer units were materially behind schedule and over budget nevertheless at various times from september 2016 through march 2017 the indictment alleges that benjamin assured the owners that the units would be completed on schedule and took active steps to conceal from the owners damaging information about the project schedule during this time period the owners paid westinghouse more than 600 million in construction costs this indictment with its attendant allegations and charges is another step toward justice for all those responsible for the v c summer nuclear plant fiasco fbi special agent in charge susan ferensic said in a statement the fbi has devoted substantial resources to investigating this matter and will continue to work with the united states attorney s office the south carolina state law enforcement division and the south carolina attorney general s office to find facts and prove criminal conduct the charges benjamin faces carry a maximum of 20 years imprisonment and a 5 000 000 fine aaron larson is power s executive editor aaronl_power powermagazine

this is a reversal of the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact austin texas texas school districts must now notify teachers staff and families of all students of a positive covid 19 case in a classroom or extracurricular or after school program the texas education agency announced in an updated public health guidance thursday this is a change from the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact districts must still report positive cases to their local health departments and the state local health officials are also allowed to investigate covid 19 cases in schools while school districts across the state issue mask mandates the tea maintains that it will not issue guidance on mask requirements until legal challenges get resolved related to gov greg abbott s order banning such mandates in schools in its guidance the tea also states that abbott s mask order is not being enforced because of ongoing litigation when the tea initially released guidance on aug 5 it was met with backlash from parents and health experts who didn t understand why districts wouldn t have been required to tell parents about a close contact the agency s initial reasoning was that the data from 2020 21 showing very low covid 19 transmission rates in a classroom setting and data demonstrating lower transmission rates among children than adults but this left health experts questioning the rationale since the more contagious delta variant was not prominent last year the tea is also allowing schools to conduct rapid tests on staff to mitigate the risk of asymptomatic individuals being on campuses with written permission from parents students also can be tested parents and school officials are to continue keeping students out of classrooms if they have covid 19 or are exhibiting symptoms parents also can choose to keep their kids home for 10 days after learning their children had close contact with someone who contracted the virus according to the new guidance the guidance still allows for remote conferencing for up to 20 days for students who are sick with covid 19 or have been exposed to it if more time is needed schools can apply for waivers longer term remote learning has largely been defunded after it was offered at the start of the pandemic and efforts to allocate funding for it have so far failed in the legislature this year

apple s expected to reveal the ninth generation ipad in just a few weeks long ago no longer the company s flagship tablet the basic ipad is still a popular choice with many and there are different reasons for this that extend beyond price still when news hit that the next ipad could come without many of the features found on all the other ipad models including the often maligned ipad mini it got me wondering and asking a question is the ipad getting the respect it deserves a first steve jobs introduces first ipad image credit apple i remember the day very clearly the night before i made sure my car had plenty of gas in the tank and i woke up early enough to be one of the first in line at best buy that day sometime in april 2010 i was determined to get my hands on a first generation ipad even though the steps to do so weren t exactly easy back then apple didn t offer the ipad for pre order and it was only available at apple retail stores and a limited number of best buys locations in the united states i struck out on both points as the nearest apple store was two hours away and my local best buy store just five minutes from my house at the time like most of the others was not among the first stores to get the tablet to sell so that made the easiest choice driving 60 miles to the next nearly best buy which did have the product in stock if i got there in time second in line at the store that saturday i purchased a 32gb ipad in silver because it was the only model in stock only because the 8gb and 64gb models were sold out and only because the first ipad only came in silver before i left the store i plugged the tablet into my car s usb charger to ensure it would be all juiced up when i made it home so began my first experience with the ipad a quick history of ipad original ipad image credit apple for most of its history the singularly named ipad was only available in one size 9 7 inches diagonally that only changed in 2019 with the seventh generation model which measured 10 2 inches just like the current eighth generation version so to get a different size you needed to go smaller and say hello to the ipad mini which first arrived in 2012 or wait until the first 12 9 inch ipad pro launched in 2015 the ipad air didn t bring a different size to the table until the third generation version arrived in 2019 it and the current model the best ipad so far in 2021 measure 10 5 inches diagonally the point here isn t the history of ipad sizes rather it s that apple has always been committed to offering a regular size tablet which has always been called simply ipad 9th generation version ipad 2020 image credit luke filipowicz imore with this year s rumor mill spinning nearly out of control the time is getting close for the revealing of the ninth generation ipad if you believe the rumors the next ipad mini is going to look boxy much like the current ipad air and ipad pro and also include face id and a usb c port for the first time meanwhile the new ipad is poised to get thinner and receive a chip upgrade but will likely keep touch id and a lightning port after the projected changes to the ipad mini it will be the only tablet in the apple lineup to do so so let s be clear once apple s flagship tablet the ipad will remain the company s least expensive tablet in doing so it will join the iphone se as one of only two apple devices to embrace two technologies it killed off long ago elsewhere does this make sense not at all if you re looking at this from a historical perspective from this standpoint folks who embrace the footprint of the original ipad should get the same goodies on their tablet as those who select the 7 9 inch ipad mini and yet there s something bigger at work here actually a lasting legacy anyone who wants and is willing to pay for the latest bells and whistles on an apple tablet long ago recognized they needed to look beyond ipad for a while that meant taking a huge jump to the ipad pro more recently apple resurrected the ipad air and made it the company s mid priced offering meanwhile the original ipad remains with the ninth generation model coming as early as next month today this ipad serves the dual purpose of showing respect for the product steve jobs created a decade ago while allowing the public to join the ipad family for as little as 329 and usually for less in addition the ipad is sometimes the only apple tablet that gets discounted during events like black friday and amazon prime day at its price point the ipad is a great solution for students those on a budget and those users not impressed with the next crop of new features like 5g xdr an m1 chip and hip colors like sky blue though the now 10 2 inch ipad no longer leads apple s food chain it remains an integral part of the lineup overall therefore although some of us may shake our heads knowing another ipad could launch with touch id there s some satisfaction in knowing that some buyers find this okay and embrace going basic in this fast moving crazy world thoughts do you think apple should shift some innovation towards the ipad or are you okay with where it sits in the ipad lineup let us know in the comments below

the quick collapse of the us backed government in afghanistan has revealed how little ordinary people should trust canada s military arms industry and associated ideological supporters their justifications for war their claims of progress and then victory have proven to be no more than propaganda and lies canada s biggest military deployment since world war ii more than 40 000 canadian troops fought in afghanistan between 2001 and 2014 canada spent 20 billion on the military operations and related aid mission and over 200 000 afghan civilians and combatants were killed in two decades of fighting as i detailed yesterday canada engaged in significant violence and war crimes in the central asian country canadian special forces participated in highly unpopular night time assassination raids and a jtf2 member said he felt his commanders encouraged them to commit war crimes in afghanistan the reasons presented for canada s war in afghanistan were to fight fundamentalists build democracy and support women s rights these rationales never added out just before canada ramped up its fighting in kandahar in 2006 canadian troops invaded haiti to overthrow the elected government there five hundred canadian soldiers backed violent rebels haiti s taliban if you like who employed rape as a means of political control a study in the prestigious lancet medical journal revealed there were 35 000 rapes in the port au prince area in the 22 months after the overthrow of the elected government so much for advancing women s rights the other supposed motivation for the invasion and occupation was to weaken al qaeda and jihadist forces as canadian troops wound down their occupation of afghanistan a half dozen canadian fighter jets bombed libya with a canadian general overseeing the war and canadian naval vessels helping out nato helped rebels in the east of the country opposed to muammar gadhafi s secular government a year and a half before the war a canadian intelligence report described eastern libya as an epicentre of islamist extremism and said extremist cells operated in the anti gadhafi stronghold in fact during the bombing noted ottawa citizen military reporter david pugliese canadian air force members privately joked they were part of al qaida s air force lo and behold hardline jihadists were the major beneficiaries of the war taking control of significant portions of the country if fighting jihadists building democracy and defending women s rights were not canada s main objectives in afghanistan what was supporting the us was the main reason canada was fighting washington s reactions tended to be the exclusive consideration in almost all of the discussions about afghanistan explains the unexpected war canada in kandahar the political problem of course was how to support washington in its war on terror without supporting the war in iraq the answer to the problem was the so called afghan solution former foreign affairs minister bill graham explained there was no question every time we talked about the afghan mission it gave us cover for not going to iraq but there s more to it than that the military saw the conflict in afghanistan as a way to increase its profile there was a surge of martial patriotism in canada with initiatives such as highway of heroes and project hero in the mid 2000s every province adopted a special licence plate to signify the driver is a veteran the military saw afghanistan as a way to assert its warfighting bona fides as chief of the defence staff rick hillier infamously proclaimed we are going to afghanistan to actually take down the folks that are trying to blow up men and women we re not the public service of canada we re not just another department we are the canadian forces and our job is to be able to kill people the canadian forces have a predilection for war as basically all but canadian special forces had been withdrawn from afghanistan the chief of the defence staff publicly demanded a new war we have some men and women who have had two three and four tours and what they re telling me is sir we ve got that bumper sticker can we go somewhere else now general walter natynczyk told canadian press in 2012 you also have the young sailors soldiers airmen and women who have just finished basic training and they want to go somewhere and in their minds it was going to be afghanistan so if not afghanistan where s it going to be they all want to serve various think tanks and militarist organization such as the conference of defense

regulatory news pershing square holdings ltd ln psh ln pshd na psh today noted that pershing square tontine holdings ltd nyse psth ceo bill ackman issued the following letter august 19 2021 dear pershing square tontine holdings ltd shareholder a purported shareholder filed a lawsuit on august 17th claiming that psth has been operating as an illegal investment company because among other claims psth invested its ipo proceeds in securities short term treasurys and money market funds that own short term treasurys this is of course something all spacs do as they preserve funds necessary to complete their initial business combinations as the law professors who brought the case should very well know as both are securities law experts holding cash and government securities while seeking a business combination does not make psth an illegal investment company nor does it make any of the hundreds of other spacs that do the same illegal investment companies either while we believe the lawsuit is meritless the nature of the suit and our legal system make it unlikely that it can be resolved in the short term even if the case were dismissed expeditiously the plaintiff can then appeal as a result the mere existence of the litigation may deter potential merger partners from working with psth on a transaction until the lawsuit is finally resolved because the basic issues raised here apply to every spac a successful claim would imply that every spac may also be an illegal investment company as a result the lawsuit may have a chilling effect on the ability of other spacs to consummate merger transactions or to engage in ipos until the litigation is resolved in psth s favor as the consequences of being deemed an illegal investment company are extremely onerous psth has about 11 months remaining to enter into a letter of intent with a transaction counterparty for its initial business combination and six additional months to close that transaction this period may be extended by up to six months by a vote of psth shareholders while we have been working diligently to identify and close a transaction and we have begun discussions with potential merger candidates our ability to complete a transaction in the required time frame has been impaired by the lawsuit all is not lost however as we have previously disclosed we have been working on obtaining approval for the launch of pershing square sparc holdings ltd sparc if we are successful in securing sparc s approval and i am confident that we will get it done we will have a clear path to mitigate the harm that this litigation has and will continue to cause to psth shareholders and warrant holders pershing square sparc holdings ltd we are working to accelerate the launch of pershing square sparc holdings ltd sparc and expect that we will shortly be making a public filing of sparc s sec registration statement as a reminder sparc which we conceived of months ago and disclosed in connection with the umg transaction is a modified opt in rather than the current opt out spac structure where investors in psth would receive long dated transferable sparc warrants to acquire common stock in sparc which we expect to be traded on the nyse sparc warrants would give investors the right to invest in sparc s future merger transaction at a share price equal to sparc s cash net asset value nav per share the pershing square funds will be making a large co investment in sparc on precisely the same terms and at the same time as sparc warrant holders the sparc warrants would not be exercisable and warrant holders would not need to invest their capital until sparc has identified a merger target completed due diligence entered into and approved a transaction and cleared a registration statement with the sec which will provide full disclosure on the transaction and the target company originally sparc intended to issue the sparc warrants to psth shareholders after psth s initial business combination in light of this litigation we expect that sparc would issue the sparc warrants as promptly as possible after regulatory approvals are obtained while there is no certainty that sparc will be approved by the sec or that the nyse rule change will be adopted we are hopeful that sparc s favorable investor protection features will facilitate a timely approval the principal benefit of sparc is that it would not hold investors money while we are looking for a target this eliminates the substantial opportunity cost of capital that burdens all spac investors the sparc warrants will also remove the two year shot clock for a sponsor to consummate a transaction this reduces the time pressure faced by the sponsor which provides an incentive for spac sponsors to complete transactions before the clock runs out in a de spac merger transaction time pressure on the sponsor is the enemy of a good deal for shareholders we intend to seek shareholder approval to return psth s cash in trust if and when sparc is approved by the sec assuming sparc is approved by the sec and the sparc warrants are approved for listing on the nyse if psth has not by then entered into a merger transaction we intend to seek psth shareholder approval to enable us to return to shareholders the 4 billion of cash psth holds in trust following the return of cash we expect sparc to issue one sparc distributable warrant for each psth distributable warrant and one sparc warrant for each outstanding psth common share as a result of the above psth shareholders will receive 20 per share in cash and one sparc warrant for each share that they own this will entitle shareholders to invest in our next initial business combination at a share price equal to sparc s cash nav per share or to sell the sparc warrants on the nyse importantly the launch of sparc and the distribution of sparc distributable warrants to psth distributable warrant holders will give our 22 22 million distributable warrants outstanding which have been put at grave risk due to this litigation a new long term opportunity for value realization furthermore we believe that by launching sparc we will be able to continue working seamlessly on a potential merger transaction now on behalf of sparc rather than psth while eliminating the burden on psth shareholders of the opportunity cost from having their funds held in trust timing of sparc s official launch and warrant distribution we have already received a comment letter from the sec on our initial sparc confidential filing and we believe that we can address the disclosure and other issues that have been raised by the sec staff the listing of sparc warrants on the nyse however will require a nyse rule change which will be subject to sec approval which we are now pursuing with the nyse see for details on other proposed and approved nyse rule changes we have spoken extensively with the nyse about the necessary rule change to allow the sparc warrants to trade on the exchange in short the current nyse listing rules for warrants require that the shares into which the warrants are exercisable be listed since sparc common stock will only become listed when the warrants are exercised in connection with the business combination the warrant listing rule needs to be narrowly modified to accommodate this distinction based on our discussions with the nyse we believe they appreciate the investor friendly features of sparc and have offered to work closely with us and the sec to accelerate the necessary rule change nevertheless there is no assurance the rule change will be approved and it could take several months or more to secure approval while there is no certainty that sparc will be approved by the sec or that the nyse rule change will be adopted we are hopeful that sparc s extremely favorable investor protection features will permit a timely approval sparc s approval will allow us to return your cash preserve the opportunity for you to invest in our next business combination at sparc s cash nav per share and protect the long term value of the distributable warrants by replacing them with sparc distributable warrants as a result of these benefits we expect that all psth shareholders will be highly supportive of the necessary rule change we welcome your public input on the proposed rule change once it is filed publicly favorable public comments on a rule change are important factors that are considered by the sec and nyse as the proposed rule change is being evaluated we expect shortly to publicly file a revised sparc registration statement with the sec which responds to the sec s initial comments this document will provide detailed information about sparc we hope you will find it an interesting read in the meantime we will deal with the litigation in the ordinary course and address its spurious claims with great care and diligence why you might ask would a psth shareholder bring such a meritless lawsuit when any shareholder would understand that the mere filing of the lawsuit and the delays inherent in its resolution would impair psth s ability to create shareholder and warrant holder value within its remaining term by interfering with the process of consummating a merger transaction while the lawsuit is brought on behalf of a purported shareholder of psth this individual is simply an unwitting prop to enable the academics and the plaintiff law firms with whom they have partnered to bring the lawsuit the two law professors who concocted the legal theory behind the complaint conceded to the press that their motivation in bringing the lawsuit was to reform the entire spac industry as the largest spac ever psth is an attractive target in that its scale and visibility maximize media attention for the lawsuit s claims and the professors proposed efforts at reform while some reforms to the spac industry adoption of the sparc structure being one are clearly warranted we believe that psth and its highly shareholder aligned structure provide a good example of how spac structures and their incentives for sponsors can be improved for the benefit of public investors this litigation only serves to harm investors in psth and all other spacs it is not helpful in achieving spac market reform notably one of the professors who is leading the suit robert jackson served as an sec commissioner between january 2018 and february 2020 during his more than two year term as commissioner the sec reviewed and declared effective more than 100 spac ipo registration statements and oversaw dozens of de spac merger transactions if mr jackson is so sure that spacs are in fact illegal investment companies why didn t he take steps to shut them down while he was an sec commissioner beyond its shareholder destructive elements the lawsuit is also materially misleading the lawsuit includes misleading statements and inferences among them that psth s sponsor a wholly owned affiliate of the pershing square funds the sponsor has been promised staggering compensation of 880 million this headline grabbing assertion is wholly fabricated none of psth s directors nor its sponsor has received or has been promised any compensation of any kind as you may be aware the sponsor paid 65 million in cash for the sponsor warrants at the time of our ipo the purchase price for the warrants was based on their fair value as determined with the assistance of a nationally recognized third party valuation firm the sponsor warrants have features which increase their alignment with our shareholders that include a restriction on selling hedging or transferring the warrants for three years after the initial business combination takes place the sponsor warrants have the potential of becoming materially more valuable in the event psth is successful in completing a merger with a company whose stock price increases substantially over many years the sponsor warrants will likely be worthless if we do not consummate a high quality transaction on favorable terms even if the universal music group business combination had been completed as anticipated the sponsor would not have received any sponsor warrants as it agreed to waive its right to receive warrants in that transaction notably the proposed then abandoned psth umg de spac transaction is the only spac business combination transaction of which we are aware where the sponsor would have received no additional consideration in the form of fees founder stock promotes or other benefits compared to other shareholders had the transaction closed the pershing square funds would have invested 1 6 billion in psth units on precisely the same terms as every other investor who bought stock in our ipo as the plaintiffs are certainly aware the time required to resolve the lawsuit and remove its overhang on the company will increase the likelihood that the sponsor and director warrants will expire worthless rather than being promised 880 million in compensation the sponsor and directors have received no value and are at risk of experiencing a total loss this fact is not lost on the litigants and it is one of the pressure tactics that they likely believe can be brought to bear to motivate us to settle the litigation and enrich the lawyers involved at the expense of our shareholders and warrant holders unfortunately for them it won t work we will work diligently to make rapid progress on obtaining approvals for sparc so that we can return your cash preserve the value of our outstanding shareholder warrants and give you a free

this is a reversal of the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact austin texas texas school districts must now notify teachers staff and families of all students of a positive covid 19 case in a classroom or extracurricular or after school program the texas education agency announced in an updated public health guidance thursday this is a change from the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact districts must still report positive cases to their local health departments and the state local health officials are also allowed to investigate covid 19 cases in schools while school districts across the state issue mask mandates the tea maintains that it will not issue guidance on mask requirements until legal challenges get resolved related to gov greg abbott s order banning such mandates in schools in its guidance the tea also states that abbott s mask order is not being enforced because of ongoing litigation when the tea initially released guidance on aug 5 it was met with backlash from parents and health experts who didn t understand why districts wouldn t have been required to tell parents about a close contact the agency s initial reasoning was that the data from 2020 21 showing very low covid 19 transmission rates in a classroom setting and data demonstrating lower transmission rates among children than adults but this left health experts questioning the rationale since the more contagious delta variant was not prominent last year the tea is also allowing schools to conduct rapid tests on staff to mitigate the risk of asymptomatic individuals being on campuses with written permission from parents students also can be tested parents and school officials are to continue keeping students out of classrooms if they have covid 19 or are exhibiting symptoms parents also can choose to keep their kids home for 10 days after learning their children had close contact with someone who contracted the virus according to the new guidance the guidance still allows for remote conferencing for up to 20 days for students who are sick with covid 19 or have been exposed to it if more time is needed schools can apply for waivers longer term remote learning has largely been defunded after it was offered at the start of the pandemic and efforts to allocate funding for it have so far failed in the legislature this year remote conferencing differs from virtual learning in that conferencing is done live with a teacher going through material while virtual learning is done through modules or online portals where the teacher isn t necessarily present
we are little more than six months in and already joe biden s presidency is coming apart at the seams america s humiliation at the hands of the taliban s ragtag army of motorcycle mounted zealots would appear at first glance to have few implications for the economy and the stock market but if it harms biden s ability to get his domestic agenda through congress or otherwise undermines its credibility then it most certainly does foreign policy was meant to be one of biden s strong points after the chaos of the trump years but the fiasco of america s exit from afghanistan has made biden s predecessor look almost sure footed both were on the same page in wanting to disengage from afghan nation building arguably always a hopeless endeavour as far as this warring country is concerned and with little wider support among american voters joe biden s afghanistan humiliation will test investors faith in his presidency credit ap but execution is something else and that biden has profoundly messed up now looks pretty much unarguable americans may have been in favour of withdrawal but they don t like to see the us humiliated biden s approval ratings will already have plummeted and his chances in the midterms will have been correspondingly damaged if he can get it so wrong in afghanistan emboldening america s enemies almost everywhere you have to ask yourself what else he is misjudging the economy inflation and public spending seem all too possible answers

medicine to improve treatment for people with cardiorenal disease this includes patients with chronic kidney disease ckd on dialysis suffering from elevated serum phosphorus or hyperphosphatemia and ckd patients and or heart failure patients with elevated serum potassium or hyperkalemia the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding tenapanor and the likelihood that it would be approved by the u s food and drug administration fda defendants possessed were in control over and as a result knew or had reason to know that the data submitted to support a new drug application nda for tenapanor was insufficient in that it showed a lack of clinical relevance of the drug s treatment effect making it foreseeably likely if not certain that the fda would not approve the drug in june 2020 defendants submitted an nda to the fda for ardelyx s lead product candidate tenapanor a supposedly first in class medicine for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with ckd on dialysis according to ardelyx tenapanor has a unique mechanism of action and acts locally in the gut to inhibit the sodium hydrogen exchanger 3 or nhe3 resulting in the tightening of the epithelial cell junctions thereby significantly reducing paracellular uptake of phosphate the primary pathway of phosphate absorption if approved tenapanor would be the first therapy for phosphate management that blocks phosphorus absorption at the primary pathway of uptake and could greatly improve patient adherence and compliance with one single pill dosed twice daily in contrast to current therapies where typically multiple pills are taken before every meal thus tenapanor and its promise was widely touted by defendants and accordingly extremely important to the valuation and future success of ardelyx securities the fda accepted ardelyx s nda in september 2020 and set a prescription drug user fee act pdufa date of april 29 2021 the company repeatedly lauded this development highlighting the fda s acceptance and review of the nda supported by so called successful phase 3 studies in each subsequently filed quarterly report and in the company s 2020 annual report even when the fda requested that the company provide additional information related to ardelyx s clinical data which caused the pdufa date to slip by three months defendants continued to hype ardelyx s positive clinical trial results which according to them showed improvements over current treatments supported tenapanor s clinical safety and efficacy and reinforced its potential as a transformative treatment at no point did defendants state much less suggest that there may be fatal issues with the drug its clinical trial data or both rather defendants simply claimed that the fda s request was merely because they needed help to better understand the clinical data in light of tenapanor s novel mechanism of action as compared to approved therapies defendants rosy narrative however came to a halt after the market closed on july 19 2021 at that time ardelyx announced that it had received a letter from the fda dated july 13 2021 that said the administration had found deficiencies that precluded discussion around the would be labeling and post marketing requirements for tenapanor critically the fda said it detected issues with both the size and clinical relevance of the drug s treatment effect immediately analysts cut their price targets and downgraded the company s rating piper sandler for example rated ardelyx neutral down from a buy equivalent rating and wrote we struggle to see a path forward for tenapanor raymond james another analyst reset the company s price target to 4 00 from 14 00 per share the company s share price

this is a reversal of the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact austin texas texas school districts must now notify teachers staff and families of all students of a positive covid 19 case in a classroom or extracurricular or after school program the texas education agency announced in an updated public health guidance thursday this is a change from the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact districts must still report positive cases to their local health departments and the state local health officials are also allowed to investigate covid 19 cases in schools while school districts across the state issue mask mandates the tea maintains that it will not issue guidance on mask requirements until legal challenges get resolved related to gov greg abbott s order banning such mandates in schools in its guidance the tea also states that abbott s mask order is not being enforced because of ongoing litigation when the tea initially released guidance on aug 5 it was met with backlash from parents and health experts who didn t understand why districts wouldn t have been required to tell parents about a close contact the agency s initial reasoning was that the data from 2020 21 showing very low covid 19 transmission rates in a classroom setting and data demonstrating lower transmission rates among children than adults but this left health experts questioning the rationale since the more contagious delta variant was not prominent last year the tea is also allowing schools to conduct rapid tests on staff to mitigate the risk of asymptomatic individuals being on campuses with written permission from parents students also can be tested parents and school officials are to continue keeping students out of classrooms if they have covid 19 or are exhibiting symptoms parents also can choose to keep their kids home for 10 days after learning their children had close contact with someone who contracted the virus according to the new guidance the guidance still allows for remote conferencing for up to 20 days for students who are sick with covid 19 or have been exposed to it if more time is needed schools can apply for waivers longer term remote learning has largely been defunded after it was offered at the start of the pandemic and efforts to allocate funding for it have so far failed in the legislature this year

revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was 24 8 million compared to 24 5 million for the second quarter of 2020 net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was 3 9 million compared to a net loss of 6 8 million for the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to a gain of 4 0 million on the forgiveness of our paycheck protection program ppp loan adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 was a loss of 0 2 million compared to a profit of 2 5 million for the second quarter of 2020 mostly driven by higher operating costs which include fuel and driver costs total liquidity available as of june 30 2021 was 12 4 million including 5 0 million available under the company s undrawn operating line of credit principal payments on debt and finance lease payments during the six months ended june 30 2021 totaled 1 6 million the company invested 1 3 million in gross capital expenditures during the six months ended june 30 2021 as we climb out of the activity decline caused by the covid 19 pandemic we continue our ongoing efforts to lower our cost structure to better reflect the markets we serve we are taking steps to rationalize our fleet and facility footprint and continuing our work on increasing efficiency in our service dispatch processes and other back office systems we expect our g a expense to be lower in the second half of 2021 while we are focused on recovering pricing lost during the covid 19 induced downturn we face significant inflationary pressures that offset those hard fought price increases including higher wage costs due to competition for employees and fuel prices finally i would like to recognize that throughout all of the changes our industry has undergone the people at nuverra continue to safely execute excellent customer service i would like to thank all of the great people at nuverra for their hard work dedication and focus throughout all of the challenges we have faced over the past year said pat bond chief executive officer second quarter 2021 results for the second quarter of 2021 when compared to the second quarter of 2020 revenue increased by 1 or 0 3 million resulting primarily from increases in water transport services in the rocky mountain and southern divisions offset by a decrease in water transport services in the northeast division and a decrease in disposal services in the southern division despite an increase in the average commodity prices for both crude oil and natural gas quarter over quarter which increased 136 and 74 respectively over this time new drilling and completion activities have remained low relative to the levels seen in the past rig count at the end of the second quarter of 2021 compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020 declined 24 in the rocky mountain division 5 in the northeast division and offset by a 29 increase in the southern division the rocky mountain division has experienced a significant slowdown as compared to the prior year as evidenced by the rig count declining 24 from 21 at june 30 2020 to 16 at june 30 2021 the average rig count for the first quarter of 2020 was 52 representing a 69 decrease since that time although there was a notable increase in wti crude oil price per barrel which averaged 66 19 in the second quarter of 2021 versus an average of 28 00 for the same period in 2020 new drilling and completion activities have been very low versus levels seen prior to the covid 19 pandemic part of this decline in activity is the result of many of the larger exploration and production companies either focusing their capital spending in other basins or having a predetermined drilling program and not looking to increase production as they focus on drilling within cash flow at the request of their investors revenues for the rocky mountain division increased by 0 6 million or 5 during the three months ended june 30 2021 as compared to the three months ended june 30 2020 primarily due to a 0 4 million or 4 increase in water transport revenues from higher driver utilization company owned trucking revenue declined 15 or 1 2 million and third party trucking revenue increased 145 or 1 6 million we continue to face a truck driver shortage in the rocky mountain division similar to other areas of the country and industries we are actively recruiting to attempt to increase our driver count company owned trucking activity is more levered to production water volumes and third party trucking activity is more sensitive to drilling and completion activity the principal factors in the increase in third party trucking revenue was a small increase in revenue per rental days approximately 25 our rental and landfill businesses are our two service lines most levered to drilling activity rental revenues increased by 11 or 0 2 million in the current year due to higher utilization and pricing our landfill revenues decreased 64 or 0 2 million compared to prior year due primarily to landfill being near capacity we actively managed the facility to keep volumes low and are currently working on expanding the facility to take in additional volumes our salt water disposal well revenue increased 0 4 million or 33 compared to prior year as higher completion activity and production volumes in the areas near our wells led to a 28 increase in average barrels per day disposed during the current year other revenue which derives from the sale of junk or slop oil obtained through the skimming of disposal water decreased by 0 1 million revenues for the northeast division decreased by 0 3 million or 4 during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to decreases in water transport services of 0 2 million or 4 and other revenue of 0 1 million or 41 during the quarter the northeast division sought to consolidate operations by identifying locations and customers that are not profitable and try to recalibrate focus on fewer and more profitable customers although natural gas prices per million btu as measured by the henry hub natural gas index increased 73 5 from an average of 1 70 for the three months ended june 30 2020 to an average of 2 95 for the three months ended june 30 2021 producers continued their drilling activities at historically low levels the limited new drilling activities caused a 5 rig count reduction in the northeast operating area from 40 at june 30 2020 to 38 at june 30 2021 for our trucking services revenues per billed hour decreased by 5 which was a function of the increased competition and the operator focus on reducing costs the regional driver count declined approximately 12 year over year which also contributed to the lower revenue we continue to face a truck driver shortage in our northeast division similar to that seen in our rocky mountain division and similarly are actively recruiting to attempt to increase our driver count the combination of a lower rig count water reuse and sharing and competition contributed to the decline in disposal volumes and pricing in addition to these factors we chose to close our wellsboro truck yard in northern pennsylvania and relocated certain trucks to other areas of operation during the second quarter this led to a decrease in revenue as we ceased operations at that location the southern division usually has experienced a lesser impact relative to the other business units from the impact of the covid 19 downturn driven by its focus on servicing customers who are focused on dry natural gas which has experienced a relatively smaller impact from the downturn in commodity prices revenues for the southern division remained flat during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to lower disposal well volumes whether connected to the pipeline or not resulting from an activity slowdown in the region rig count increased 29 in the area from 38 at june 30 2020 to 49 at june 30 2021 driving an increase in trucking revenue and an increase in volumes received in our disposal wells not connected to our pipeline by an average of 1 776 barrels per day or 9 during the current year volumes received in the disposal wells connected to the pipeline decreased by an average of 6 571 barrels per day or 17 during the current year total costs and expenses for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 were 32 0 million and 30 2 million respectively total costs and expenses adjusted for special items for the second quarter of 2021 were 30 8 million or a 6 increase when compared with 29 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 this is primarily a result of 1 3 million of transitional costs which include severance and stock based compensation for executives as well as an increase in fleet related expenses including fuel and maintenance and repair costs and compensation costs net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was 3 9 million a decrease of 2 9 million as compared to a net loss for the second quarter of 2020 of 6 8 million for the second quarter of 2021 the company reported a net loss adjusted for special items of 6 6 million this compares with a net loss adjusted for special items of 5 8 million in the second quarter of 2020 adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 was a 0 2 million loss a decrease of 109 7 as compared to adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2020 of 2 5 million the decrease is a function of the reasons discussed previously with primary drivers being lower trucking volumes salt water disposal volumes and rental equipment utilization in the rocky mountain division second quarter of 2021 adjusted ebitda margin was 1 compared with 10 in the second quarter of 2020 driven primarily by higher operating costs during the second quarter of 2021 year to date ytd results for the six months ended june 30 2021 when compared to the six months ended 2020 2021 revenue decreased by 22 4 or 14 0 million the decline in service revenue is primarily due to decreases in water transport services in the rocky mountain and southern divisions coupled with a decrease of disposal services in all three divisions although there was a notable increase in commodity prices for both crude oil and natural gas which increased 69 0 and 77 9 respectively over this time period the impact of covid 19 is the main driver for the decline in demand for gasoline diesel and jet fuel which has led to lower drilling and completion activity with fewer rigs operating in the rocky mountain and northeast divisions and significant well shut ins primarily in the rocky mountain division further as we saw demand for commodities begin to rise we did not see a similar rise in production a major driver for this has been the focus of exploration and production companies on drilling within cash flow at the request of their investors versus growing production volumes despite the rise in commodity prices we have not seen the typical response in activity levels experienced historically in addition to the lack of additional production during the six months ended june 30 2021 we have seen our fuel costs and driver costs both rise at significant rates during the second quarter of 2021 we began reaching out to customers requesting price increases for our services to help cover these costs but it is unclear at this time to what extent we will be successful rig count during the first half of 2021 compared to 2020 declined 62 in the rocky mountain division 16 in the northeast division and increased 9 in the southern division the rocky mountain division experienced a significant slowdown with rig count declining 24 from 37 during the six months ended june 30 2020 to 14 during the same period in june 30 2021 although there was a notable increase in wti crude oil price per barrel which averaged 62 21 during the first half of 2021 versus an average of 36 82 for the same period in 2020 revenues for the rocky mountain division decreased by 10 1 million or 28 during the six months ended june 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a 4 4 million or 19 decrease in water transport revenues from lower trucking volumes third party trucking revenue decreased 15 or 0 7 million and revenue from company owned trucking revenue declined 19 or 3 4 million average total billable hours were down 22 compared to the prior year while company owned trucking activity is more levered to production water volumes third party trucking activity is more sensitive to drilling and completion activity which has declined to historically low levels thereby resulting in meaningful revenue reduction our rental and landfill businesses are our two service lines most levered to drilling activity and therefore have declined by the highest percentage versus the prior period rental revenues decreased by 40 or 2 0 million in the current year due to lower utilization resulting from a significant decline in drilling activity driving the return of rental equipment our landfill revenues decreased 90 or 1 6 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the landfill being near capacity we actively managed the facility to keep volumes low and are currently working on expanding the facility to take in additional volumes our salt water disposal well revenue decreased 4 4 million or 19 compared to the prior year as well shut ins and lower completion activity led to a 17 decrease in average barrels per day disposed during the current year with water from producing wells continuing to maintain a base level of volume activity revenues for the northeast division decreased by 2 8 million or 15 during six months ended june 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 due to decreases in water transport services of 2 0 million or 15 and disposal services of 0 3 million or 8 although natural gas prices per million btu as measured by the henry hub natural gas index increased 77 9 from an average of 1 81 for the six months ended june 30 2020 to an average of 3 22 for the six months ended june 30 2021 the rig count declined 5 in the northeast operating area from 40 at june 30 2020 to 38 at june 30 2021 this led to lower activity levels for both water transport services and disposal services our customers continued the industry trend of water reuse and water sharing in 2021 water reuse inherently reduces trucking activity due to shorter hauling distances as water is being transported between well sites rather than to disposal wells for our trucking services total billable hours were down 8 from the prior year and pricing decreases also contributed to the decline offset by disposal volumes increase in our salt water disposal wells of 2 in average barrels per day revenues for the southern division decreased by 1 1 million or 13 during the six months ended june 30 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the decrease was due primarily to lower disposal well volumes both on the pipeline and for saltwater disposal assets not connected to our pipeline due in part to the winter storm in the first quarter of 2021 resulting in lost revenue days due to power outages and dangerous road conditions volumes received in our disposal wells not connected to our pipeline decreased by an average of 5 771 barrels per day or 13 during the current period and volumes received in the disposal wells connected to the pipeline decreased by an average of 16 801 barrels per day or 22 during the current period total costs and expenses for the six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 were 62 6 million and 90 1 million respectively total costs and expenses adjusted for special items for the six months ended june 30 2021 were 61 3 million or a 16 3 decrease when compared with 73 2 million for the six months ended june 30 2020 this is primarily a result of lower volumes and related costs in water transport services and disposal services and company cost cutting initiatives resulting in a 25 decrease in the number of drivers compared to the prior year period in the rocky mountain and northeast divisions as well as general and administrative expenses net loss for the six months ended june 30 2021 was 11 5 million a decrease of 18 4 million as compared to a net loss for 2020 of 29 8 million for the first half of 2020 for the first half of 2021 the company reported a net loss adjusted for special items of 14 1 million this compares with a net loss adjusted for special items of 13 0 million for the same period in 2020 adjusted ebitda for six months ended june 30 2021 was 1 0 million a decrease of 123 as compared to adjusted ebitda of 4 4 million for the same period in 2020 the decrease is a function of the reasons discussed previously with primary drivers being lower trucking volumes salt water disposal volumes and rental equipment utilization in the rocky mountain division the year to date 2021 adjusted ebitda margin was 2 1 compared with 7 1 in 2020 driven primarily by declines in revenue partially offset by cost reductions in 2020 cash flow and liquidity net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended june 30 2021 was 2 4 million mainly attributable to a gain recorded on ppp loan forgiveness of 4 0 million increase of 0 1 million in accounts receivable increase of 0 7 million in prepaid expenses while capital expenditures net of asset sales consumed 1 1

seven months after the united kingdom left the european union british trade began to feel cold according to office for national statistics ons exports of goods and services in the uk fell by 13 36bn and imports by 22 66bn from january to may 2021 compared to the same period in 2019 a other report exports and imports from the same organization of services banking insurance transportation consulting maintenance etc in the first quarter of 2021 are 12 and 24 respectively to an extent this trend continues to cause pandemics however this decline is proving to be harder than the european average exports fall by 15 and imports by 39 indicating that brexit will not take effect the difference between the export of services to eu countries and other parts of the world is particularly marked in the areas of construction 43 24 repairs maintenance 62 vs 11 and construction services 40 vs 12 fact trade cooperation agreement these activities are not covered between the european union and the united kingdom and thus the delivery of british services is not made competitive eu members were given the freedom to decide whether or not to allow their various suppliers in their markets u s works it also suggests that other service exporting countries outside the eu could benefit from this situation stayed in london ireland is the biggest winner from brexit the island may benefit from business relocation and business diversion from the uk which has been helped by lower corporate tax rates and young and well trained workers between 2016 and 2019 ireland s service exports increased by 24 or 4 144 billion or 3 123 billion driven by financial services it and transportation there are a lot of ec hacks in other european cities which will benefit in the meantime in january amsterdam overtook london the largest european equity trading center absorbing a large share of the trade in euro denominated assets london place anyway come to mind again recently other potential winners include frankfurt for banking operations luxembourg for banking and asset management and paris for financial professional and business services even a serious competitor like berlin can attract technological talent to its cultural centers and affordable prices however most financial operators so far stayed in london the city still maintains its power to accommodate ipos and other capital raising there has been no influx of financial jobs outside london a fraction proponents of eu retention predicted the four year regulatory transition period for areas such as data protection and e commerce will definitely prove useful however these different considerations undoubtedly obscure the broader dynamics which means that europe s overall ability to provide services may be weak an opportunity elsewhere in the world suppose a group of american investors wants to invest a billion pounds sterling in european stocks or other financial assets in the past when he left some work to specialists in paris and frankfurt for questions related to france and germany he could create a fund in london using a network of lawyers accountants bankers and other economists in the city today due to brexit the group can no longer invest in some european securities from london investors need to create a second fund in dublin for example to access all the european assets they want the extra cost and time that leads them to decide that betting in asia is more profitable than in singapore may lead them if we consider this effect in all areas it becomes enormous it is certain that some investors will decide to leave the uk in favor of eu countries or bear the additional costs associated with doing business but others will find that an opportunity elsewhere in the world is more attractive now the danger is that this will translate into an overall change in the financial burden over time looks like we already saw the hints for this winners and losers in the upcoming research we analyzed the exports of major service providers in europe and globally we did this using trade data collected jointly by the world trade organization wto and the organization for economic co operation and development oecd they point out that the united kingdom is the largest service exporter in europe and the second largest in the world after the united states however it seems to have lost its position after brexit ireland and the netherlands are experiencing the strongest growth in the region in europe while china india and singapore are leading elsewhere uk service export growth slowed to 11 during 2016 2019 compared to 2010 15 exports of services by country between 2015 and 2019 batis this is confirmed by the findings of our recently published research which shows that the uk s global share has increased from 8 9 in 2005 to 7 in 2019 at the same time growth in france spain italy and belgium slowed while germany the netherlands switzerland luxembourg austria and the united states remained stagnant ireland is the fastest growing service export country but singapore and india are also gaining ground it is noteworthy that between 2016 and 2019 we saw rapid growth in asia in the areas of travel finance it and creative services in particular there has been extraordinary growth in the economic business insurance and pension sectors in singapore and in many sectors in china it looks like a real boom this development may be partially reflected industrial change the transition from manufacturing to services is taking place in the asian world it may also reflect the long term shift of service centers from west to east a global reorganization the question for years to come is whether the uk and european service classmates will be able to find arrangements that will help them maintain their collective strength and whether they will be able to take advantage of opportunities elsewhere especially in developing countries now us service providers have some lead

pershing square tontine holdings ltd releases letter to shareholders tweet pershing square tontine holdings ltd nyse psth ceo bill ackman today issued the following letter august 19 2021 dear pershing square tontine holdings ltd shareholder a purported shareholder filed a lawsuit on august 17th claiming that psth has been operating as an illegal investment company because among other claims psth invested its ipo proceeds in securities short term treasurys and money market funds that own short term treasurys this is of course something all spacs do as they preserve funds necessary to complete their initial business combinations as the law professors who brought the case should very well know as both are securities law experts holding cash and government securities while seeking a business combination does not make psth an illegal investment company nor does it make any of the hundreds of other spacs that do the same illegal investment companies either while we believe the lawsuit is meritless the nature of the suit and our legal system make it unlikely that it can be resolved in the short term even if the case were dismissed expeditiously the plaintiff can then appeal as a result the mere existence of the litigation may deter potential merger partners from working with psth on a transaction until the lawsuit is finally resolved because the basic issues raised here apply to every spac a successful claim would imply that every spac may also be an illegal investment company as a result the lawsuit may have a chilling effect on the ability of other spacs to consummate merger transactions or to engage in ipos until the litigation is resolved in psth s favor as the consequences of being deemed an illegal investment company are extremely onerous psth has about 11 months remaining to enter into a letter of intent with a transaction counterparty for its initial business combination and six additional months to close that transaction this period may be extended by up to six months by a vote of psth shareholders while we have been working diligently to identify and close a transaction and we have begun discussions with potential merger candidates our ability to complete a transaction in the required time frame has been impaired by the lawsuit all is not lost however as we have previously disclosed we have been working on obtaining approval for the launch of pershing square sparc holdings ltd sparc if we are successful in securing sparc s approval and i am confident that we will get it done we will have a clear path to mitigate the harm that this litigation has and will continue to cause to psth shareholders and warrant holders pershing square sparc holdings ltd we are working to accelerate the launch of pershing square sparc holdings ltd sparc and expect that we will shortly be making a public filing of sparc s sec news alert registration statement as a reminder sparc which we conceived of months ago and disclosed in connection with the umg transaction is a modified opt in rather than the current opt out spac structure where investors in psth would receive long dated transferable sparc warrants to acquire common stock in sparc which we expect to be traded on the nyse sparc warrants would give investors the right to invest in sparc s future merger transaction at a share price equal to sparc s cash net asset value nav per share the pershing square funds will be making a large co investment in sparc on precisely the same terms and at the same time as sparc warrant holders the sparc warrants would not be exercisable and warrant holders would not need to invest their capital until sparc has identified a merger target completed due diligence entered into and approved a transaction and cleared a registration statement with the sec which will provide full disclosure on the transaction and the target company originally sparc intended to issue the sparc warrants to psth shareholders after psth s initial business combination in light of this litigation we expect that sparc would issue the sparc warrants as promptly as possible after regulatory approvals are obtained while there is no certainty that sparc will be approved by the sec or that the nyse rule change will be adopted we are hopeful that sparc s favorable investor protection features will facilitate a timely approval the principal benefit of sparc is that it would not hold investors money while we are looking for a target this eliminates the substantial opportunity cost of capital that burdens all spac investors the sparc warrants will also remove the two year shot clock for a sponsor to consummate a transaction this reduces the time pressure faced by the sponsor which provides an incentive for spac sponsors to complete transactions before the clock runs out in a de spac merger transaction time pressure on the sponsor is the enemy of a good deal for shareholders we intend to seek shareholder approval to return psth s cash in trust if and when sparc is approved by the sec assuming sparc is approved by the sec and the sparc warrants are approved for listing on the nyse if psth has not by then entered into a merger transaction we intend to seek psth shareholder approval to enable us to return to shareholders the 4 billion of cash psth holds in trust following the return of cash we expect sparc to issue one sparc distributable warrant for each psth distributable warrant and one sparc warrant for each outstanding psth common share as a result of the above psth shareholders will receive 20 per share in cash and one sparc warrant for each share that they own this will entitle shareholders to invest in our next initial business combination at a share price equal to sparc s cash nav per share or to sell the sparc warrants on the nyse importantly the launch of sparc and the distribution of sparc distributable warrants to psth distributable warrant holders will give our 22 22 million distributable warrants outstanding which have been put at grave risk due to this litigation a new long term opportunity for value realization furthermore we believe that by launching sparc we will be able to continue working seamlessly on a potential merger transaction now on behalf of sparc rather than psth while eliminating the burden on psth shareholders of the opportunity cost from having their funds held in trust timing of sparc s official launch and warrant distribution we have already received a comment letter from the sec on our initial sparc confidential filing and we believe that we can address the disclosure and other issues that have been raised by the sec staff the listing of sparc warrants on the nyse however will require a nyse rule change which will be subject to sec approval which we are now pursuing with the nyse see for details on other proposed and approved nyse rule changes we have spoken extensively with the nyse about the necessary rule change to allow the sparc warrants to trade on the exchange in short the current nyse listing rules for warrants require that the shares into which the warrants are exercisable be listed since sparc common stock will only become listed when the warrants are exercised in connection with the business combination the warrant listing rule needs to be narrowly modified to accommodate this distinction based on our discussions with the nyse we believe they appreciate the investor friendly features of sparc and have offered to work closely with us and the sec to accelerate the necessary rule change nevertheless there is no assurance the rule change will be approved and it could take several months or more to secure approval while there is no certainty that sparc will be approved by the sec or that the nyse rule change will be adopted we are hopeful that sparc s extremely favorable investor protection features will permit a timely approval sparc s approval will allow us to 1 return your cash 2 preserve the opportunity for you to invest in our next business combination at sparc s cash nav per share and 3 protect the long term value of the distributable warrants by replacing them with sparc distributable warrants as a result of these benefits we expect that all psth shareholders will be highly supportive of the necessary rule change we welcome your public input on the proposed rule change once it is filed publicly favorable public comments on a rule change are important factors that are considered by the sec and nyse as the proposed rule change is being evaluated we expect shortly to publicly file a revised sparc registration statement with the sec which responds to the sec s initial comments this document will provide detailed information about sparc we hope you will find it an interesting read in the meantime we will deal with the litigation in the ordinary course and address its spurious claims with great care and diligence why you might ask would a psth shareholder bring such a meritless lawsuit when any shareholder would understand that the mere filing of the lawsuit and the delays inherent in its resolution would impair psth s ability to create shareholder and warrant holder value within its remaining term by interfering with the process of consummating a merger transaction while the lawsuit is brought on behalf of a purported shareholder of psth this individual is simply an unwitting prop to enable the academics and the plaintiff law firms with whom they have partnered to bring the lawsuit the two law professors who concocted the legal theory behind the complaint conceded to the press that their motivation in bringing the lawsuit was to reform the entire spac industry as the largest spac ever psth is an attractive target in that its scale and visibility maximize media attention for the lawsuit s claims and the professors proposed efforts at reform while some reforms to the spac industry adoption of the sparc structure being one are clearly warranted we believe that psth and its highly shareholder aligned structure provide a good example of how spac structures and their incentives for sponsors can be improved for the benefit of public investors this litigation only serves to harm investors in psth and all other spacs it is not helpful in achieving spac market reform notably one of the professors who is leading the suit robert jackson served as an sec commissioner between january 2018 and february 2020 during his more than two year term as commissioner the sec reviewed and declared effective more than 100 spac ipo registration statements and oversaw dozens of de spac merger transactions if mr jackson is so sure that spacs are in fact illegal investment companies why didn t he take steps to shut them down while he was an sec commissioner beyond its shareholder destructive elements the lawsuit is also materially misleading the lawsuit includes misleading statements and inferences among them that psth s sponsor a wholly owned affiliate of the pershing square funds the sponsor has been promised staggering compensation of 880 million this headline grabbing assertion is wholly fabricated none of psth s directors nor its sponsor has received or has been promised any compensation of any kind as you may be aware the sponsor paid 65 million in cash for the sponsor warrants at the time of our ipo the purchase price for the warrants was based on their fair value as determined with the assistance of a nationally recognized third party valuation firm the sponsor warrants have features which increase their alignment with our shareholders that include a restriction on selling hedging or transferring the warrants for three years after the initial business combination takes place the sponsor warrants have the potential of becoming materially more valuable in the event psth is successful in completing a merger with a company whose stock price increases substantially over many years the sponsor warrants will likely be worthless if we do not consummate a high quality transaction on favorable terms even if the universal music group news alert business combination had been completed as anticipated the sponsor would not have received any sponsor warrants as it agreed to waive its right to receive warrants in that transaction notably the proposed then abandoned psth umg de spac transaction is the only spac business combination transaction of which we are aware where the sponsor would have received no additional consideration in the form of fees founder stock promotes or other benefits compared to other shareholders had the transaction closed the pershing square funds would have invested 1 6 billion in psth units on precisely the same terms as every other investor who bought stock in our ipo as the plaintiffs are certainly aware the time required to resolve the lawsuit and remove its overhang on the company will increase the likelihood that the sponsor and director warrants will expire worthless rather than being promised 880 million in compensation the sponsor and directors have received no value and are at risk of experiencing a total loss this fact is not lost on the litigants and it is one of the pressure tactics that they likely believe can be brought to bear to motivate us to settle the litigation and enrich the lawyers involved at the expense of our shareholders and warrant holders unfortunately for them it won t work we will work diligently to make rapid progress on obtaining approvals for sparc so that we can return your cash preserve the value of our outstanding shareholder warrants and give you a free option to invest in our next transaction in a better structured vehicle that would be our greatest pleasure we have got your six sincerely william a ackman

this is a reversal of the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact austin texas texas school districts must now notify teachers staff and families of all students of a positive covid 19 case in a classroom or extracurricular or after school program the texas education agency announced in an updated public health guidance thursday this is a change from the tea s previous guidance which didn t explicitly require school districts to notify parents of a close contact districts must still report positive cases to their local health departments and the state local health officials are also allowed to investigate covid 19 cases in schools while school districts across the state issue mask mandates the tea maintains that it will not issue guidance on mask requirements until legal challenges get resolved related to gov greg abbott s order banning such mandates in schools in its guidance the tea also states that abbott s mask order is not being enforced because of ongoing litigation when the tea initially released guidance on aug 5 it was met with backlash from parents and health experts who didn t understand why districts wouldn t have been required to tell parents about a close contact the agency s initial reasoning was that the data from 2020 21 showing very low covid 19 transmission rates in a classroom setting and data demonstrating lower transmission rates among children than adults but this left health experts questioning the rationale since the more contagious delta variant was not prominent last year the tea is also allowing schools to conduct rapid tests on staff to mitigate the risk of asymptomatic individuals being on campuses with written permission from parents students also can be tested parents and school officials are to continue keeping students out of classrooms if they have covid 19 or are exhibiting symptoms parents also can choose to keep their kids home for 10 days after learning their children had close contact with someone who contracted the virus according to the new guidance the guidance still allows for remote conferencing for up to 20 days for students who are sick with covid 19 or have been exposed to it if more time is needed schools can apply for waivers longer term remote learning has largely been defunded after it was offered at the start of the pandemic and efforts to allocate funding for it have so far failed in the legislature this year

you john thank you all for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call fiscal 2021 was a year of significant progress at adtalem as we continue to strengthen our position as a leading workforce solutions provider this year we further extended our mission to be the market leader in healthcare education helping employers address the critical workforce shortages and talent gaps that exist in the medical and healthcare sectors while continuing to expand access to education within diverse communities with the completion of the walden acquisition we are even better positioned going forward to address the increasing demand for healthcare workers and we are uniquely positioned to help underserved communities before we get into the results for the quarter and fiscal year i wanted to briefly outline our agenda for today s call i ll start off by discussing our results for the fiscal year and quarter our decision to begin exploring strategic alternatives for our financial services segment and the ongoing ceo transition i ll then hand over to bob to discuss our results in greater detail steve will then conclude by discussing the successful close of the walden transaction which we announced on august 12 and perspective on future growth under his leadership of the incoming ceo the path of the covid 19 virus and the broader macroeconomic environment remain unpredictable and the alarming rise in the new cases and hospitalizations related to the delta variant magnify the increasing need for skilled healthcare workers particularly in underserved communities we are energized that adtalem will be able to play an even greater role in solving these worker shortages through the increased scale and differentiated capabilities made possible by our acquisition of walden now turning to our results for the quarter and the fiscal year starting with the fourth quarter we had a solid finish to the year as our strategy continued to deliver results our strong financial performance was driven by increasing demand for our programs and offerings strong student outcomes across our institutions and program and previous investments in marketing financial services delivered particularly strong performance with nearly 18 revenue growth in the quarter as the leadership changes and prior investments continue to drive improved operating performance our full year performance was in line with our outlook despite lingering covid 19 headwinds our healthcare institutions performed well as strong student outcomes continue to drive demand for the programs new student enrollment at our medical and veterinary institutions for example grew 12 in the may session starting with the medical and healthcare segment at chamberlain new student enrollment increased approximately 4 in the may session with growth in total student enrollment of about 5 driven by growth in our campus based bsn and doctor level programs we continue to see strength in total enrollment across our campuses including even weekend and hybrid options we also had the cap on our new orleans program lifted while our new brunswick campus had their cap increased in may chamberlain and lcmc health established a program to address lcmc s workforce needs this innovative call to care scholars program is the first of its kind nursing program that addresses the need for more nurses by expanding access for rns to obtain a bsn degree through a forgivable loan program lcmc health will fund 100 of tuition costs for up to 90 bsn students per year through this alliance with chamberlain in exchange for those students committing to work for lcmc health for up to three years after completing graduation and passing the oncourse exam and just last week we signed an agreement with emory healthcare in atlanta one of our most innovative and forward thinking partners emory is working to address the enormous nurse staffing challenges across the country and is committed to supporting their experienced registered nurses achieve a bsn emory chose to partner with chamberlain based on the depth and quality of its rn to bsn program and the superior student outcomes that chamberlain continues to demonstrate in all of its nursing programs these partnerships are perfect examples of our workforce solutions provider strategy in action in our medical and veterinary schools may session new student enrollment increased 12 the highest may session new students are starting in over six years total student enrollment declined 1 as we continue to work through the pandemic induced backlog of students waiting to begin clinicals in q4 i also want to say i m very proud of the more than 1 000 ross med and auc students who graduated in may an incredible achievement in the face of the pandemic first time residency match rates at ross med and auc were both 91 historically ross med and auc graduates have entered primary care with the physician shortage is predict projected to be most severe at twice the rate of their us medical school graduate counterparts and that trend continued for our 2021 graduates to round out the medical and healthcare segment ross med s may session new enrollment was in line with last year s strong may session reflecting continued interest in the veterinary profession and returns on previous investments in student support and marketing we believe that the strong demand from veterinarians will continue post pandemic turning to our financial services segment strong revenue growth continued in q4 our ability to capture demand generated by strong secular trends delivered double digit revenue growth we re also establishing prominent growth factors to enable expansion and diversification into new markets investments in new offerings are positioning the segment for long term growth with respect to each of our individual programs acams the premier anti financial crimes organization continued to see strong demand in the fourth quarter non conference revenue increased 19 in the quarter driven by demand for compliance certification in q4 year over year conference revenue was substantially higher as acams held its first in person conference since the start of the pandemic the australia conference in june was the inaugural event in the region and successfully hosted nearly 260 in person attendees the next planned in person event is the las vegas conference scheduled for the end of september for both in person and virtual participants the pandemic remains a dynamic situation and we will continue to monitor it closely the favorable mortgage environment continued in the fourth quarter and oncourse learning leveraged its leading position to drive strong mortgage pre licensing sales results continuing education sales also grew as businesses are retaining a high number of mortgage loan offices to meet refinance and new purchase mortgage needs ocl is well positioned to drive long term growth as we continue to build new relationships and expand existing ones becker continues its leading position in the cpa test preparation market becker cpa test preparation sales grew slightly in the quarter as hiring them on large cpa firms and our institutional clients improved becker is poised to capture future cpa review demand as the test taker market returns to pre covid levels becker s continuing education offerings performed well and remain a source of future growth attracting b2b and b2c customers in july we named josh braunstein as president and managing director of becker in addition to is role as president of ocl josh was the interim leader at becker and he will continue to scale and leverage the two organizations core competencies and strengths to help drive continued growth on august 4 we announced that we are beginning to explore strategic alternatives for our financial services segment this decision is consistent with our long standing commitment to delivering long term shareholder value and is a natural progression of our efforts to focus the portfolio on the healthcare industry each of the brands within our financial services portfolio are the leaders in their respective markets together they comprise a premium platform in an industry with attractive tailwinds as the regulatory and compliance burdens on the financial services industry proliferate driving increased demand for the unique solutions that these businesses offer as we said at the time of the announcement no timetable has been established for the completion of the strategic review and as the adtalem board approves specific action or otherwise concludes the strategic review we will disclose further developments to our stakeholders i want to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to the entire financial services team whose hard work and dedication have created a highly attractive set of businesses enabling us to take this path i am extraordinarily proud of the teams at acams ocl and becker alongside the financial services news we also announced on august 4 that steve beard will succeed me as the ceo and i will transition to the role of executive chairman of our board of directors effective september 8 it has been a great honor serving as the ceo of adtalem over the last five years during that time we have redefined the company s identity built a diverse inclusive and mission driven culture streamlined our portfolio of institutions and brands delivered strong returns and value to our shareholders and repositioned the company to become a pure play healthcare educator through our successful acquisition of walden university which we ll discuss in further detail later in the call delivering superior academic outcomes has been a primary focus for adtalem throughout my five year tenure as ceo and i am immensely proud of everything we ve achieved this year first time residency match rates at ross med and auc were both 91 more than 70 of our 2019 2020 medical graduates chose to enter critical roles in the primary care across all 50 us states and puerto rico and at chamberlain we have received we have first time nclex pass rates of over 91 these outcomes demonstrate that our dedication has paid off and we remain committed to building a pipeline of highly qualified talent to solve complex issues in the healthcare industry adtalem is in a position of strength and it s set up for long term growth following a solid end to the year i am so excited about the future of adtalem under steve s leadership many of you have witnessed steve s operational and strategic expertise over the last four years in the various positions he s held at adtalem first serving as our general counsel and then as our chief operating officer steve s leadership has been instrumental as we divested non core assets such as adtalem brazil devry university and carrington college repositioned our financial services companies for long term profitable growth attracted key leadership talent to the company and energized and aligned the team around our enterprise strategy under steve s leadership of the financial services segment the brands have enhanced their market leadership positions diversified and expanded their product portfolios and customer basis and recruited world class talent and leverage best in class capabilities across the segment resulting in double digit revenue growth and expanded operating margins steve also spearheaded our successful acquisition of walden and drove the integration planning process marking a pivotal step in expanding our scale as a leading workforce solutions provider navigating leadership transitions is a core competency of a highly effective board and i am gratified that a well designed and well executed succession plan has presented the opportunity to promote an internal successor who has been instrumental to the strategic direction and execution of adtalem for the last four years i m looking forward to continuing to partner with steve my fellow directors and our leadership team to continue driving results and superior student outcomes now i d like to turn over to bob to discuss our results in further detail after which steve will provide some thoughts on recent announcements and the year ahead bob phelan interim chief financial officer thank you lisa and hello everyone we delivered fiscal year 2021 revenue growth in the middle of the range of our prior full year outlook and eps growth near the top of that range fiscal 2021 revenue increased 5 7 to 1 1 billion driven by growth in both medical and healthcare and financial services diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items for the fiscal year 2021 was 2 98 a 30 7 increase from the prior year in the fourth quarter revenue increased 7 9 to 280 4 million and strong demand across our businesses driven by the strength of our student outcomes and our investments in marketing and new offerings cost of educational services was 125 6 million in the fourth quarter an increase of 8 3 compared with the prior year student services and administrative expense was 107 9 million in the fourth quarter a 4 1 increase when compared with the prior year consolidated operating income excluding special items in the fourth quarter increased 17 1 to 46 9 million primarily driven by increased revenue and operating leverage across the business net income from continuing operations excluding special items was 35 1 million a 14 9 increase compared with the prior year and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items was 0 70 compared to 0 58 a 20 7 year over year increase now turning to our segment results for the quarter in medical and healthcare revenue for the vertical was 223 5 million a 5 7 increase compared with the prior year revenue in chamberlain in the fourth quarter increased 5 3 compared with the prior year period driven by continued growth in new student enrollment new and total student enrollment increased 3 6 and 4 6 respectively for the may session revenue for the medical and vet schools in the fourth quarter increased 6 3 compared with the prior year primarily driven by new student enrollment growth new student med and vet enrollment in the may session grew 12 3 while total enrollment in the session decreased 1 2 as lisa mentioned total enrollment was negatively impacted by the clinical placement headwinds we view as transitory medical and healthcare segment operating income excluding special items for the fourth quarter was 41 3 million a 3 4 increase the increase was driven by higher revenue in the segment partially offset by higher operating costs turning now to our financial services segment fourth quarter revenue was 56 9 million an increase of 17 8 compared with the prior year driven by revenue growth at acams and oncourse learning and becker acams revenue increased as the non conference certification offerings continued to perform well and conference revenue began to show a recovery oncourse learning s continued focus on execution in a favorable mortgage market and strength in its continuing education business drove increased revenue in the quarter becker s revenue increase was driven by growth in its continuing education program offerings and an increase in cpa exam prep fourth quarter operating income excluding special items in the financial services segment increased 29 8 to 11 million turning now to our balance sheet we ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of 494 6 million and outstanding bank borrowings under our existing term loan b of 291 million we repurchased 481 000 shares in the fourth quarter for a total of 18 4 million in fiscal year 2021 we repurchased 2 9 million shares for a total of 100 million as of june 30 2021 we had 49 3 million shares outstanding turning to cash flow in the fourth quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was 56 million our capital expenditures for the quarter totaled 13 8 million as a result free cash flow in the fourth quarter was 42 1 million as a reminder we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures for the full fiscal year net cash provided by continuing operations was 223 2 million capital expenditures totaled 48 7 million resulting in a free cash flow of 174 5 million compared with the free cash flow of 105 4 million in the prior period as discussed as previously discussed we continue to expect significant free cash flow growth in the coming years post walden integration we would expect the adtalem to generate over 300 million of free cash flow on an annual basis the strong free cash flow generation supports our commitment to delever the balance sheet to below 2 times net leverage within 24 months moving on to our outlook with the close of the walden acquisition we will present our future financials on an adjusted basis for the full fiscal year 2022 we expect revenue to be within the range of 1 685 billion and 1 735 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 4 20 to 4 45 from continuing operations excluding special items with that i will now turn the call over to steve stephen w beard chief operating officer thanks bob i m honored to serve as adtalem s next ceo and to lead the organization during such an

positions than any other school in the united states and having the largest undergraduate and graduate nursing enrollment in the united states this transaction is a pivotal step in expanding our scale as a workforce solutions provider and enables us to better address critical workforce shortages and in equities that exist in the healthcare sector as you know there continues to be strong demand for healthcare practice and healthcare support professionals with demand currently exceeding supply by 44 and 9 respectively with the concentration of online graduate level health and behavioral sciences programs that are highly complementary to our core curriculum walden significantly expands our national healthcare education footprint and will further enable us to reimagine the future of healthcare education walden immediately strengthens our core nursing offering and allows us to expand into attractive high demand adjacencies including the social and behavioral sciences while also extending the

of the programs and you re hoping that they re just transitory can you give a little bit more color what s been happening with that and when do you think they will become non transitory lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer yes absolutely let me start by saying this is in the medical schools so those clinicals for medical students at auc and ross who are who just finished their basic sciences so not on the other that side of that med health so as we talked about last quarter there was a backlog simply because obviously there were hospitals that were taking clinical patients through covid and sort of getting to a place where clinical could be in place certainly we then had a backlog of students and then of course we got students coming through as enrollments have increased and so it s really getting through that backlog into those hospital systems which now have for the most part figured out mostly in april surge area figured out how to do both because of course it s helpful for them to have the frankly those plenty students in there and working etc and so if you think about it now we ve got some we prioritize those students who were waiting right we ve got more students coming to the queue but we see that over the next couple of quarters being able to level out one of the things that the team has been able to do is actually expand our clinical partnerships through this whole process because of course we were having to sort of move regionally as covid surged i m sure there ll be more of that with the delta variant and sort of the risk there so in the medium and long term jeff this is going to be beneficial for us because it really does expand the number of slots that we have across the network of our clinical operation in the short term we ve got to get those newer students through step one and into clinicals some of them taking longer to get there and then those students who are in the backlog into clinicals so another couple of quarters i think last quarter we said this was going to be something that was going to rectify in fy 22 we got a bit of that done this past q4 and we ll see more of that as we go into fy 22 jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator and our next question comes from jeff meuler with baird please state your question jeff meuler baird analyst yes thank you and congratulations to both of you so just on the starting point on the guidance just trying to understand like what the adtalem growth is so you said if the transaction closed at the end of the quarter i think it would have been an 0 86 contribution if it on a 12 month basis it s 1 15 so i guess do we split the difference or just anything that you can say about what kind of adtalem growth is assumed in the guidance bob phelan interim chief financial officer yes i think the best answer is to split that difference and you wind up at about 1 in terms of the incremental eps accretion at that point jeff meuler baird analyst okay so can you give us any sense of you have i guess three different pieces you have adtalem medical and health you have acquired walden and then i guess the divestco financial services is still on the guidance can you give us any sense of what kind of growth you re expecting for different parts of the business especially since that part of what s in guidance is expected no longer be in the company by the end of the year stephen w beard chief operating officer yes i think at this point what i would say is that our guidance is relatively consistent with what we ve done with guidance in the past which is in the 5 to 7 range whether you re talking about the adtalem previous adtalem or adtalem was walden so that s the way i would look at that range on a low and high end lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer and just to jump in a little bit on the financial services side obviously they had a great quarter and certainly for both we don t break them out but certainly acams and ocl looking at double digit growth in those organizations and becker also grew so we expect that trajectory to continue into fy 22 jeff meuler baird analyst okay and then just given your response sort of the last question that it sounds like the clinical headwinds should lessen and your as you said in the prepared remarks you re getting back to some in person conferences the covid estimated impact was a 0 50 eps headwind in 2021 what are you assuming in the 2022 guidance just wondering how much of the kind of adtalem growth in the guidance is coming from a lessening of covid headwinds versus maybe more core growth lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer yes i ll let bob jump in on the eps piece but let me just say from sort of those risks and the continuing covid you can sort of see in med health that the total students we re lessening that gap as i said at the clinical get still but we do have to continue to monitor couple of things right one on the acams conference that we had a successful in person in australia we are scheduled to do so in vegas and you ll recall that jeff that that september conference is a big when we also have that s going to be hybrid so we have options both ways but we will need to continue to look at that and just in general across nursing enrollment right to date we ve really been able to navigate that and in fact the demand has been quite strong but we all know right that nursing the profession in general right just like all healthcare workers is seeing some strategic things like that so that s how i think about sort of the overall risks from a qualitative perspective and i ll let bob jump in on the guidance bob phelan interim chief financial officer on the guidance i guess what i would say is as part of the reason on the low end that we re actually at 4 20 because if you just did the calculation you come up slightly higher than that but with the variation due to not knowing where we re going to be with covid we wanted to provide a little bit more of a wider range there on the guidance and that s both on the low end as well as the high end jeff meuler baird analyst okay and then just one last one from me not sure if it s best for steve really or maybe if you both want to chime in but i guess why is now the right time for a ceo transition while you have a large divestiture pending and a large acquisition closing it seems like a lot to and you have a interim cfo for the time being so it seems like a lot going on to time ceo transition that s it from me thank you lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer got it so i will start and i ll let steve jump in so for me this is actually a perfect time and i think about my time in this season in this role a little over five years now so if you think about the portfolio where it started how we thought about streamlining that portfolio and where we wanted that focus for the organization to be as we gravitated and in fact really proved out our right to win on the med health care side it made sense to pursue this transition as you know with this transition i mean transaction as well as most transactions in this space we are 10 months to really do two things one prepare for the synergies and two to prepare for what does the future look like and who is best served to take the fund that next piece of the journey and as i said internally here at adtalem steve had been a partner in this journey for almost a little over actually four years now so he is not coming into the seat without a great understanding both of our mission and where we need to really focus from an academic outcome perspective that s important both for our internal stakeholders but also external i mean that s why we re here and why we come here every day but he also understands the challenges across the institution and what we really need to do to drive synergies and so from my perspective this really derisks this entire transition because i am not going anywhere i am going to be in that executive chairman role i m going to be working with the team and with the board to make sure not only that this transaction and integration is successful but also to continue to tell our story as it relates to what we re really trying to do a change in the healthcare education industry that s my i ll let steve jump in stephen w beard chief operating officer not a lot i can add to that except to reiterate that both sides of the leadership transition are really intended to ensure continuity and no lost momentum over time so as lisa pointed out i ve been involved in all of these critical activities from their inception very very immensed in the near term activity whether it s related to integration with walden whether it s related to the divestiture of finserv assets whether it s related to what we are attempting to do with this coming fiscal year from a performance perspective so i m grateful for the opportunity i m equally grateful to have lisa as a partner as the chair of our board that s a critical role as we go through these activities and you can believe i m not letting her off the hook anytime soon jeff meuler baird analyst sound good thank you operator thank you our next question comes from alex paris with barrington research please state your question alex paris your line is open please unmute yourself alex paris barrington research analyst yes sorry i was on mute i apologize congratulations on the strong finish to the year and special congratulations to steve and lisa steve on the promotion and lisa on your numerous accomplishments during your tenure it s been great working with you lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer thanks alex alex paris barrington research analyst so similar question to the last why is now the right time for financial services strategic review to start with lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer yes great question so i will start off and i ll let steve jump in so we have always said that as we think about the portfolio we want to make sure that we are focused on those areas where we can really drive momentum across the entire portfolio obviously when we signed the transaction to acquire walden university we really had shifted the center of gravity of the organization to medical and healthcare that certainly doesn t mean that we believe the financial services don t have a mission always said right that we are helping people remain relevant in their current roles and have a career journey and not just a job and we do that on both side but in terms of timing this is a time where these businesses are on a great growth trajectory where a lot of the investments that we ve made and talked about with you all quarter over quarter in and quarter out have are starting to really come to fruition here whether it s marketing technology etc and we also have the right leadership and teams in those organizations now which as you all know we went through those transitions over the last year or two so from our perspective this is the right time for us to determine a home that can really focus on them and the financial services programs and offerings that they have stephen w beard chief operating officer yes i would concur with all of that the overall trajectory of the finserv businesses is one that we re quite proud of at this point we feel really good about the leadership that are in place we think that we ve got better visibility in choosing the forward momentum of those businesses covid notwithstanding and given the investments we ve made in the was down core healthcare business we think it s a great time to try to realize that value for our shareholders and invite home for those businesses where they can continue to grow and continue to be the beneficiary of investments to grow consistent with their trajectory so we re excited about that since the announcement we ve gotten lots of inbound interest we think these are highly attractive assets that are going to track ton of interest from high quality tutors so we re excited about that process and we believe it will end in a way that is highly valuable to our owners alex paris barrington research analyst great well thanks for that additional color a question about walden at the time of the acquisition announcement last september you gave trailing 12 months revenue and adjusted ebitda can you do that now on a trailing 12 month basis or will you do that now stephen w beard chief operating officer now that s i mean that s something we have not disclosed at this point so i would just say we don t update at this time alex paris barrington research analyst all right and then is any of the assumptions changed you had posted expectations for free cash flow in year one through four and adjusted eps contribution year one through four it sounds like that hasn t changed at all lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer that s correct the only thing where we ve said we re seeing at the beginning of this was we obviously will have not the full 12 months in this fiscal year just a month and a half but if you right size the eps on that absolutely it s nothing has changed alex paris barrington research analyst okay great and then the last question and i ll let you go is i think you said 60 million with the synergies i just didn t jet it down quick enough is it half in fiscal 22 and then the full 60 million in fiscal 23 and beyond is that what you said stephen w beard chief operating officer that s correct i mean there obviously we expect to receive the full 60 million within the first two years of the transaction we expect to realize half of that in the first year we don t necessarily expect to realize that on a ratable basis across the year given we just taken possession of the asset so we expect that to be back end loaded in year one but we are committed to delivering the 60 million within 24 months at close alex paris barrington research analyst great and then what s the expectation for the one time costs associated with those synergies bob phelan interim chief financial officer the estimate was it was we ve already incurred roughly 15 million we estimate another 30 million for the current year and then there will be roughly another 15 million in fiscal 23 stephen w beard chief operating officer 60 million in aggregate alex paris barrington research analyst okay so 60 million in synergies and at a one to one kind of cost basis stephen w beard chief operating officer one time 60 million cost for a 60 million run rate synergies lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer annually stephen w beard chief operating officer annually bob phelan interim chief financial officer annually alex paris barrington research analyst right annually got it all right that sounds great thanks again i appreciate the additional color stephen w beard chief operating officer of course thank you operator our next question comes from gregory pendy with sidoti please state your question gregory pendy sidoti analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question just one quick one i mean just in light of the annual guidance you said on the prior question it s not going to happen ratably can you give us a little bit of color on how to think about the cadence as it is back half loaded as you sort of build to that 30 million in synergies just that we have from a quarterly standpoint a way to think about it bob phelan interim chief financial officer i think there is a number of things one is what steve just went through in terms of the fact that the 30 million of synergies would be back end loaded really for the first year so that s one point but also what lisa had talked about is with the clinicals that s another thing that we would be again looking at a little bit more back end loaded in terms of getting that back and then the other thing i should point out is just the fact that we re closing in august on the walden transaction is that we ve only got a half of a quarter for that so really once again you re going to see lower numbers in the first quarter relative to that and more in the second third and fourth lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer greg only thing i would add to that is sorry the only thing i would add to that is we re confident in those numbers because we are hitting the ground running because we ve had 10 months basically for better or for worse we had 10 months waiting for regulatory approvals etc to really put the planning process in place so it s not so much when you have the plan it s just that as bob said we will only have about half of q1 gregory pendy sidoti analyst okay great and then just one last final one if i m not mistaken in the past maybe few years ago you sold your test prep business for veterinary and if i am correct can you talk a little bit about the valuation that you received for that as we kind of think about financial services and becker lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer yes i think you re referring to the becker health test prep which was a part of that business conference coming out in revenues we can get that for you greg on the individual call but not comparable to this type of comparison gregory pendy sidoti analyst got it okay fair point okay thanks a lot operator our next question comes from jeff silber with bmo capital markets please state your question jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst i m sorry i got cut off earlier don t know if this was asked but you did talk about the walden impact for 2022 you mentioned that you only have half a quarter s worth this year and how the synergies are going to be back end loaded beyond those two can we talk about the cadence of the walden business by quarter are there any peaks and valleys that we should be aware of on a seasonal basis lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think in some respects it s a bit like chamberlain so it s all about the session so i may have example there q3 or q1 they had a session in august they will not have another session or before our q1 they will not have another session until we get into q2 for some of their programs some of their programs are more interval so as we start reporting walden as part of our ordinary course and you ll see that we ll highlight than you ll recall for example in july we have that online only session at chamberlain so it changes the numbers we ll make sure that we get that to you so that you don t have to dig for it as we add them to the reporting jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst are you going to be reporting walden as a separate segment as well stephen w beard chief operating officer i think we have to work on determining how we re going to report segment at this point that s something that s still in the works at this time bob phelan interim chief financial officer the work is underway jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay but hope but we ll get enrollment data and hopefully revenue and ebitda data from walden separately even if it s not a separate segment lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer i think that we will be able to help you understand the trends but as we do today right in chamberlain and walden just as we do as we talk about that etc have no fee of that okay appreciate that jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks so much appreciate that and best of luck again operator thank you that concludes our question and answer session i ll now turn it back to john kristoff for closing remarks john kristoff vice president investor relations all right thank you everyone for joining us and as always if you have additional questions sorry lisa had closing comments lisa w wardell chairman and chief executive officer i just was going to so thank you to everybody who has bridged supportive of us

reminds us every day why we come here and why we do what we do and that this is really a social mission company and for all of you who are listening to this call i just so appreciate the support that

by our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year afterwards we ll be happy to respond to any questions you may have as noted in today s press release we are pleased that both second quarter sales and earnings substantially exceeded our expectations sales benefited from customers positive response to our broad assortment of great bargains in addition our results were bolstered by a number of external factors including ongoing government stimulus increasing vaccination rates and a diminishing covid restriction earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended july 31 2021 grew 22 to 1 39 on net income of 494 million this compares to 1 14 per share on net earnings of 413 million for the 13 weeks ended august 3 2019 total sales for the quarter rose 21 to 4 8 billion with comparable store sales up a robust 15 for the first six months earnings per share were 2 73 on net earnings of 971 million up from 220 up from 2 29 per share on net income of 834 million for the same period in 2019 sales for the first half of 2021 rose 20 to 9 3 billion with comparable store sales up 14 for the second quarter ross sales trends across merchandise areas and regions were fairly broad based with children s and the midwest performing the best additionally dd s discounts trends remained robust during the period as both sales and operating profit gains significantly exceeded our expectations at quarter end total consolidated inventories were down 5 while average selling store inventories were up 3 versus 2019 packaway levels ended at 30 of the total compared to 43 for the same period in 2019 as we used a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead of planned sales in addition there were receipt delays due to supply chain congestion turning to store growth we now expect to open approximately 65 total locations this year comprised of about 45 ross and 20 dd s discounts as usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores as mentioned in last quarter s call in 2022 we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 new stores now michael hartshorn will provide further details on our second quarter results third quarter guidance and updated outlook for the year michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer thank you barbara as we previously stated comparable store sales increased 15 in the quarter mainly driven by a larger average basket with traffic up slightly versus 2019 operating margin was well above plan and up versus 2019 at 14 1 cost of goods sold decreased by 45 basis points in the quarter merchandise margins and occupancy improved by 80 basis points each while buying costs declined by 10 basis points partially offsetting these items were higher distribution expenses which grew 40 basis points primarily from wage increases while worsening industrywide supply chain congestion drove higher freight cost of 85 basis points sg a for the period rose 5 basis points as leverage from strong sales gains was offset by covid expenses and higher incentives given our better than expected second quarter results total net covid related expenses for the period were approximately 45 basis points the vast majority of which impacted sg a during the quarter we repurchased 1 4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of 176 million we remain on track to buy back a total of 650 million in stock for the year now let s discuss our third quarter guidance as a reminder our projections compare to the same period in 2019 looking ahead there remains much uncertainty on the sustainability of the positive external factors that benefited our first half results as well as the potential risks we could face from the spread of covid variants and worsening industrywide supply chain congestion as a result we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 5 to 7 for the third quarter with earnings per share projected to be in the range of 0 61 to 0 69 the operating statement assumptions that support our third quarter guidance include the following total sales are projected to grow 9 to 12 we expect operating margin to be 7 3 to 7 9 this forecast reflects significant escalation of freight costs as well as higher distribution expenses in addition ongoing covid related costs are projected to negatively impact ebit margins by approximately 45 basis points in the period we plan to open 28 stores during the third quarter consisting of 18 ross and 10 dd s discounts net interest expense is estimated to be about 19 million our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24 to 25 and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 354 million based on our first half results and third quarter guidance we now project full year comparable store sales gains of 10 to 11 and earnings per share to be in the range of 4 20 to 4 38 compared to 4 60 in 2019 now i ll turn the call back to barbara for closing comments barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer thank you michael while we re pleased by the better than expected results we reported today as michael noted there is a high level of uncertainty on a number of external factors and how they may affect our business over the balance of the year that said we believe we are well positioned as a valued retailer and remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver great branded bargains moving forward we remain optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in both sales and profitability over the longer term especially given consumers increasing focus on value and convenience moreover the significant number of retail closures and bankruptcies in recent years further enhances our ability to gain additional market share in the future at this point we d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have questions and answers operator your first question is from the line of lorraine hutchinson from bank of america your line is open lorraine hutchinson bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good afternoon it s quite a different tone with the 2q beat versus the 3q guidance i was just curious how much of these sales and margin pressures are you seeing today versus how much you re baking in just in case things get worse michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer kimberly it s michael on the sales front the guidance is really based on the high level of uncertainty and risks that could happen in the third and fourth quarter and it s really based on the risks that the external factors that benefited the first half how sustainable those are and then also with the delta variant and supply chain congestion what other risks exists that said we hope to do better than the guidance as we have year to date thus far operator your next question is from mark altschwager from baird your line is open mark altschwager baird analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my question so a lot of focus out there on kind of the cost side of the current kind of supply chain backdrop just hoping you could speak to some of the opportunities this is creating or expected to create in the months and quarters ahead just with canceled orders late deliveries inventory trapped at nodes kind of throughout the system just how do you see this really playing out from an inventory availability standpoint in the coming quarters thank you barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer well listen obviously the supply chain congestion is causing all kinds of receipt delays right now and we expect those actually to worsen as the year goes on so at some point in time those goods will back up and we will see those as potentially an opportunity either for packaway or to flow depending upon business or what the types of products are so at this moment you would think that that would happen probably either late in the year or at the beginning of next year if i had to pick a timeframe operator your next question is from the line of paul lejuez from citigroup your line is open paul lejuez citigroup analyst hey thanks guys can you maybe talk about performance by state curious your three big states how different the performance was in the second quarter and also curious if there are any states in particular where you might be seeing some sort of change in trend in the third quarter to date that s kind of guiding how you are thinking about comps in 3q and i was also curious if you could just talk about home versus apparel performance in the quarter thanks michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer on the regional performance so texas florida california they make up about 50 of our sales what we saw during the quarter texas and california were relatively in line with the chain florida which trailed in the first quarter saw a significant improvement as tourism increased though still a bit below the chain in the second quarter and we wouldn t comment on current quarter trends at this point barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer and home versus apparel home continues to be one of our top performing merchandise areas similar to trends that we ve seen throughout the entire pandemic apparel however continued to accelerate from q1 to q2 so i think what we re seeing in apparel is pre covid there was already a shift toward casual wear and then activewear and what s happening now is that more traditional sportswear classifications have also improved so that s starting to make to build the sales from one quarter to the other paul lejuez citigroup analyst and barbara are you seeing the supply chain disruption impact certain categories more than others anything you can share there barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer look overall there is plenty of supply it s not consistent to your point across merchandise departments but in reality what s happening is that merchandise deliveries are sliding so it could slide two weeks 30 days they are sliding and so what the merchants are really doing is they are constantly flexing based on what they are seeing in the market the availability and they re chasing into classifications that they need so it s a little bit it s a little bit of a moving target but overall there is plenty of supply paul lejuez citigroup analyst okay thank you good luck operator your next question is from the line of kimberly greenberger from morgan stanley your line is open kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst okay great thank you i wanted to hear if you ve given any further thought to potentially some price actions just to help absorb some of the higher costs even if it s just a little bit here or there or sort of surgically done based on what comparison prices you re seeing in the marketplace i just wanted to see if you had thought about that any differently as compared to your comments back in may and then could i just get a clarification on the full year 10 to 11 comp guidance and what does that embed for the fourth quarter thank you so much barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer okay in terms of pricing kimberly we still strongly believe that price value is critical to our customers so as you know we over the years talked about how the merchants comp shop regularly and really they really understand that our target shopper is really price savvy so if she s not getting the best deal out there she knows it the higher prices at traditional retailers could increase the pricing gap that we offer and strengthen the values that we provide to our shoppers and quite frankly the merchants are constantly making those price value assessments of their assortments all the time they re prioritizing as we ll always prioritize really having sharply priced assortments for our entire store so at this point i wouldn t talk anything more about it for competitive reasons but the one comment that i would say is we won t be the leader in terms of raising prices the merchants will do their job and they ll assess it and they ll price it the way they see it michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer kimberly on comp guidance the fourth quarter looks very similar to the q3 at this time kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst thank you operator your next question is from chuck grom from gordon haskett your line is open chuck grom gordon haskett analyst hey thank you very much good quarter just wondering if you guys could speak to the magnitude of the dc and freight costs that you re anticipating in the third quarter it looks like over the past couple of quarters it s been about 100 basis point to 125 basis point drag just wondering if you could speak to how big of a drag you re expecting here in this quarter thank you michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer we didn t give specific guidance in the second quarter obviously dcs were 40 basis points of drag and freight was 85 basis points so we would expect both the dcs and the freight costs to worsen in the back half some of that s driven by the leverage on comp but we would expect we ve raised wages further in the dcs and we re seeing specifically ocean freight costs significantly escalate in the back half so those expectations for worsening are built into the guidance that we gave operator your next question is from the line of matthew boss from j p morgan your line is open matthew boss j p morgan analyst great thanks and congrats on a nice quarter so barbara any early thoughts on overall back to school trends maybe what you ve seen so far in august in some of the states that have gone back earlier and then michael on gross margin have you embedded any change in the external promotional or pricing backdrop for the third quarter relative to what we saw in the front half of the year just in your merchandise margin outlook barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer so matt the back to school trends look we ve been pleased with our younger businesses performances for a while and so that obviously bodes well for back to school in terms of classifications i would say the customer is still buying wear now but has started to make that conversion to go forward in a more traditional back to school fashion that we might have seen from a product perspective in let s say 2019 but we feel good about those businesses because obviously our younger businesses are doing well therefore back to school we feel pretty good about michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer and matt on margin obviously we had built in what we can see today with our current on order i think our big opportunity as it was in the second quarter is if we can exceed these sales plans there there should be a benefit as we turn faster and take lower margins operator your next question is from janine stichter from jefferies your line is open janine stichter jefferies co analyst hi thanks for taking my question wanted to ask you about the covid costs if you had any thoughts about the timeline for potentially starting to moderate the expense you re putting into the cleaning and sanitation aspect in the stores thank you michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer sure i think that s changed over time obviously if you would have asked me that two months ago it would have been sooner than later but right now we have the cleaning aspects built in throughout the rest of the year which we think is appropriate given the variant spread janine stichter jefferies co analyst got it thank you operator your next question is from michael binetti from credit suisse your line is open michael binetti credit suisse analyst hey guys thanks for taking our questions here michael i m curious what you think are the biggest opportunities to get the business if we try to look beyond a lot of the noise in the margin right now to get the business back to that kind of 14 plus operating margin that you guys saw a few years back it sounds like you i guess when you look at the pricing commentary in the softlines group you seem to think that there is no real urgency here to move toward it so maybe that s maybe that implies your thinking that some of these costs we re seeing are quite transitory do you within that if that s right what do you think are the best ways for this business to get back to that 14 plus operating margin in the past from here michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer sure michael as you mentioned obviously we have transitory costs in the business right now whether it s covid at some point there will be some equilibrium in the freight world especially with ocean freight that we expect to be an opportunity going forward and then i would say the return to 2019 margin levels will be highly dependent on strong sales performance over time and given we re in a very vibrant sector of retail there s market share up for grab with store closures and bankruptcies and the customer who is focused on value and convenience we feel good about our opportunities now that is not to say that we don t have a lot of work going on in the business to find places to be more efficient to offset some of these costs but i think it s dependent on how long some of this inflation lasts and then certainly on the topline growth michael binetti credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question is from john kernan from cowen your line is open john kernan cowen and company analyst excellent thanks for taking my questions just curious on the quantification of freight and distribution headwinds into next year is this the impact that you re guiding to in the back half of the year is that ballpark how we should think about it for the first half of next year michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer i wouldn t comment on next year at this point in the dcs the wages that we ve made are permanent and that said we do have productivity initiatives that we ll build into our budgets and plans for next year on the freight cost i d say it s hard to say at this point i gave you my view at this point i think some of the ocean and congestion will bleed into the first part of next year john kernan cowen and company analyst got it one quick follow up just as we stay on the theme of supply chain here are you concerned at all about deliveries into holiday in early part of next year given some of the things we re seeing at ports etc barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer well i think look we all know there s supply chain problems and it s backed up and all the issues with covid overseas which kind of made all of the not all but a large majority of goods coming out of china slide i think the issues are real and i think they ll continue for a while and so what we have to do is really make sure that we re paying attention to what it is and that the merchants are adjusting and flexing based on what they re seeing and what s happening around them i mean the majority of our business is closeouts so a lot of these things are a timing issue of how goods will slide what goods might be late that might be available for us to buy in season it s kind of like a moving target i think the challenge as you go into q1 is that chinese new year is a couple of weeks earlier so those two things are going to slide i think a little bit in terms of deliveries and the kind of goods that have to get out of china in particular so i think the answer is we re going to watch it we re going to adjust as we go and we re in a flexible business model so as long as we can offer a treasure hunt and a broad assortment that s we re going to do john kernan cowen and company analyst excellent thank you operator your next question is from adrienne yih from barclays your line is open adrienne yih barclays capital analyst yes thank you very much barbara i was wondering if you had seen any changes in basket or atv this quarter versus first quarter and then toward the end of the quarter were you ve seen any impact in particularly texas and florida of maybe the delta variant on late july trends i know that for a quarter they seem to be fine but any trailing off at the end of the quarter thank you very much michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer adrienne on the components of comp it was mainly driven by the size of the basket traffic was up slightly and the basket was driven aur was up slightly but it was basically driven by units per transaction and that was a consistent trend with comps throughout the quarter we wouldn t say specifically the sequential trend other than to say it was fairly robust throughout the quarter may was slightly higher than the other months in terms of absolute comp adrienne yih barclays capital analyst thanks very much and best of luck congrats operator your next question is from the line of marni shapiro from retail tracker your line is open marni shapiro retail tracker analyst hey guys congrats on a great quarter could you i just want to clarify one thing michael that you said you said texas california and florida made up what percent of your sales you guys used to talk about this in the past i just want to clarify the number that i heard michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer it s about 50 of our business marni shapiro retail tracker analyst that s what i thought can we talk just a little bit about marketing i know it s not a big ambitious push for you guys like it is for other retailers so i m curious just through covid coming into this year where was your marketing spend has it ticked up through this year as the stores have all now for the most part being opened and have you been spending against that or has demand been so strong that you haven t ticked up the marketing and how should we think about it in the back half of the year if you could just talk a little bit about that michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer in terms of marketing for competitive reasons we wouldn t provide the details there marni but we have made strategic investments we made channel shifts and we have used put more money into places like digital versus broadcast so we have made some shifts during covid and we ll continue to find what works best for us going forward marni shapiro retail tracker analyst has it picked up now that the stores are open compared to a year ago when say the first half of the year for sure stores were michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer no doubt yeah marni no doubt about it we when the stores were closed we obviously took it as an opportunity to not spend when the stores were closed so it certainly has picked up versus last year marni shapiro retail tracker analyst so that s all rolled back in here okay and it should be about your usual levels then from here out without the stores opened michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer that s correct marni shapiro retail tracker analyst okay fantastic thank you best of luck with the rest of fall season michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer thank you marni barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer thanks operator your next question is from laura champine from loop capital your line is open laura champine loop capital analyst thanks for taking my question i m still trying to get my head around the significant decline almost 50 sequentially in ebit margins that you re sort of looking to in q3 i certainly heard the 45 basis point of covid costs but are you expecting a big reversal in merchandise margin or what are some of the assumptions embedded within that ebit margin assumption michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer on the ebit margin in between q2 and q3 for instance obviously the 5 to 7 comp is lower than our year to date performance at 15 in the second quarter so that drives a significant portion of it and then as i mentioned ocean freight costs where we ve embedded the assumption that that will significantly escalate over q2 and then we expect higher wages in the dc to drive a bit more deleverage than we had year to date laura champine loop capital analyst got it do you have can you give me total logistics costs as a percentage of sales sort of normally and where it s tracking now michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer that s not something we provide laura laura champine loop capital analyst got it thank you michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer the best guidance i can give you at this point is again freight was 85 basis points for us in the second quarter and we ve embedded significantly escalation from that and then on the dcs as i mentioned it was 40 basis points and we expect additional deleverage because of higher wages laura champine loop capital analyst got it operator your next question is from dana telsey from telsey advisory your line is open dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good afternoon it seems like for a couple of quarters in a row now dd s has had terrific performance anything to note there and any changes to their plans in terms of what s driving that or is it the child tax credits and stimulus and then secondly just on packaway i think it s 30 this quarter i think it was 34 in the first quarter how do you how are you thinking about packaway for the balance of the year and the rate it would be at thank you michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer sure dana on dd s as we mentioned dd s continue to have a robust sales trend like ross ebit margin improvement i d say relative to ross it s been fairly consistent throughout the pandemic obviously the external stimulus has impacted the dd s customer but also helped the ross customer as well the one thing they have in common though is that that customer is very focused on value and they ve been attracted to what we ve had added in the stores so no changes that i would note in the second quarter on inventory levels as you mentioned packaway was at 30 of our total inventory with ahead of planned sales we obviously used some of that inventory to fuel some of the sales growth it was also impacted by receipts delayed receipts so within the inventory number we have a higher level of in transit than we have had historically and then the return we would expect to return to historical levels over time but that s going to be somewhat dependent on how we perform on the topline and whether we beat the plan and then also what supply chain congestion looks like at the end of the year operator your next question is from simeon siegel from bmo capital markets your line is open dick bmo capital markets analyst hi this is dick on for simeon i m just wondering if you could give some color potentially on where you re seeing the most opportunity to kind of capture that share if that s with new customers or with expanding the current customer wallet within the current dd s and ross customers and kind of what you re thinking about that going forward michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer yeah i would say what we ve seen during the pandemic is we ve seen a younger customer part of that early on in the pandemic was driven by the older customer with restrictions and hesitancy to shop as we moved along we ve seen in the customers that that older shopper is actually returning back to the store so i think we have an opportunity across our customer base to the extent that we can provide them the bargains that they ve come to expect dick bmo capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question is from jay sole from ubs your line is open jay sole ubs analyst great thank you michael is it possible to quantify for us the magnitude of the worsening of the inflationary pressures that you called out between q2 and q3 michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer yeah i would only just point to the overall ebit margin it s a significant de escalation right now the 7 3 to 7 9 is 4 50 to 5 10 versus 2019 of deleverage so the main drivers out of that are obviously the comp difference between q2 and q3 the higher ocean freight is a significant portion of that and then as i mentioned the higher distribution costs i d say the largest single deleverage is coming from ocean freight operator our last question is from roxanne meyer from mkm partners your line is open roxanne meyer mkm partners llc analyst great thanks and congratulations on a solid 2q my question is on the merchandise margin you delivered a very robust gain there on top of the sizable gain in the first quarter and really on top of a significant increase in merch margin last year where is that coming from is that being helped by just utilizing packaway and how should we think about merchandise margin going forward michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer yeah in the quarter really the upside versus our original expectations on gain versus last year is that we ve been able to operate in a with inventory very close to need we ve operated with lower inventories in stores we ve been able to chase the business and that has driven faster turns and lower markdowns what we ve done throughout the pandemic is tried to operate very close to need and we think that we can do that not only during the pandemic but post pandemic which will benefit margins in the future but the lower markdowns and faster turns was the main driver of the margin improvement in the second quarter operator there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over to barbara rentler for her closing remarks barbara rentler vice chair and chief executive officer thank you for joining us today

listen to this article listen to this article as a registered nurse for more than 40 years i know just how important health care is and more importantly how personal it is for each of us i was a young nurse when my husband passed away unexpectedly and i came away from the stress of that loss with a deeper understanding of the pivotal role that health care workers play in caring for people when they need it most the covid crisis has taught us this lesson again and again health care workers have been exhausted by the pandemic working for substandard wages and often without the protective equipment needed to keep them safe that is one reason i joined healthcare rising arizona to help amplify the voices of those who directly serve patients another reason is that my four decades of nursing inside intensive care units operating rooms recovery rooms nursing homes and hospice care all taught me an important lesson a lot of times it is the nurses on the front line who see the problems that need solving medical care can be confusing for any of us and sometimes the system is not very well thought out communication is vital to helping people make the best decision for themselves and their family but too many times the business side of the medical industry fails to communicate clearly the high costs are a tremendous burden for many of us as well that s where healthcare rising arizona comes in we are working to make a difference in the lives of health care workers and patients with more than 500 members across our state we bring together the voices of everyone who is impacted by our health care system and use the power of that collective voice to push for real policy change to make our health care system better right now we are working together to end the predatory collection practices that trap people in an endless cycle of debt families can lose their homes cars and wages to predatory debt collectors even when they ve done nothing wrong medical debt can be devastating and that s why at healthcare rising arizona we are working to pass the predatory debt collection protection act once we gather the signatures to put it on the ballot arizonans can vote to limit the interest that debt collectors can charge you for medical debt and protect homes and cars from seizure no arizona family should be bankrupted by the cost of care i loved working in the recovery room at banner baywood medical center in mesa the challenge of caring for patients to stabilize them after surgery was meaningful to me every single day some people were getting ready to go home others were headed up to a hospital room to rest still others were off to the critical care unit for more treatment but no matter where a patient was headed next my job was to deliver compassionate care and pay attention to their needs that s exactly why i volunteer as a member healthcare rising arizona today robin burgeson is a retired registered nurse in fountain hills where she has lived since 1985
