sefa ozel e via getty images by jeff weniger cfa speculative stocks have had an ugly five months the s p 500 pure growth index which tracks the â growthiestâ of growth stocks has ceded a huge chunk of its prior outperformance relative to dividend paying value stocks figure 1 it all started in november around the time the street started coming to terms with â transitoryâ inflation being not so transitory and itâ s been wild the ratio between the s p 500 pure growth index and the s p 500 high dividend index has not only come crashing downâ meaning growth stocks are underperformingâ but it just took out support from a critical transition day march 6 2009 that was when the 2007â 2009 bear market turned into the 2009â 2021 bull market figure 1 s p 500 pure growth index divided by s p 500 high dividend index when the banking system failed in 2008 growth beat value as society recovered everything switched value started beating growth the two sides of the coin looked like this 2008 fear growth beat value 2009 recovery value beat growth today itâ s the opposite when fear strikes value has held up better than growth when the bulls get the upper hand growth has seen relief covid reopening has morphed into â stay home because of gas pricesâ three hundred dollars per barrel â if not more â that was the warning from russiaâ s deputy prime minister alexander novak on state tv on march 7 as the west tried to figure out how to freeze out russian oil he is of course going to say that so i donâ t want to spend the time wondering about 300 oil just yet instead i point it out because maybe 300 is the new â shock number â the big bold call used to be 100 when i was very young and starting to pay attention to these things in the 1990s i specifically remember it being wildly bullish if you called for the high high high price of 30 per barrel ask yourself if the energy team at goldman were to put out a 200 barrel forecast right now would you laugh them out of the room iâ d read that report itâ s not so outlandish rystad energy the huge consultancy says we could get there letâ s say it doesnâ t get that bad instead brent crude goes sideways chopping around its current 109 level that is still high enough to make stagflation dominate the conversation one of the reasons our value mandates have held strong is due to the natural grab for energy stocks when you run a dividend screen one of our flagships the wisdomtree u s largecap dividend fund dln has 8 in the sector in contrast the russell 1000 only has 2 5 in the group leaving it with very few winners during the oil induced stock market panics of recent months the market has followed the publicâ s frustration with inflation in recent weeks moroccan truckers have planned a three day strike over fuel prices italian heavy goods truckers are also planning protests while there is talk of the same in ireland too the public has come into the streets in both pakistan and yemen both because of inflation if you had to use a word or two to describe the stock market in 2020 it would be â covid â for 2021 perhaps â recovery â for 2022 maybe it will be â inflation protests â inside the s p 500 the action has been problematic for industry groups most associated with covid reopening now that the middle class is giving a second thought to driving the kids to disney world with gasoline at 5 in many states casinos restaurants and hotels have all slid harder than the broad market lately and unnervingly so airlines were finally seeing light at the end of the covid tunnel but surging jet fuel prices have the market concerned for that industry too figure 2 covid reopening industries relative to s p 500 look at the tumble in the stock prices of the companies whose offerings consumers choose to purchaseâ a hotel room a restaurant mealâ and itâ s plain to see that the stock market is sending a message it is time to respect recession risk iâ m not quite there yet but itâ s on the radar let me explain why iâ m not completely freaking on american consumer health unlike the crescendo of the 2008 oil crisis labor market conditions today are improving not collapsing look at the â help wantedâ signs in your own neighborhood itâ s a far cry from the image etched into my own brain the last time gasoline was in crisis lehman employees carrying cardboard boxes out of the building figure 3 u s average gasoline price vs unemployment and the cars we drove when gasoline spiked in 2008 had lower fuel economy whereas the toyota camrys of that era got 25 miles per gallon every camry manufactured since 2018 has gotten at least 32 miles per gallon with hybrids getting much more even a big guzzler like the ford f 150 â americaâ s best selling pickup truck â gets about 25 miles per gallon in late models figure 4 ford f 150 fuel economy by model year miles per gallon additionally a dollar meant something different in the context of the 2008 median household income of 50 000 todayâ s median is 67 000 gas is pinching consumers but i suspect we need something like sustained 6 per gallon for it to feel like 4 a generation ago as i write aaa calculates that the high price states illinois hawaii alaska arizona utah nevada california oregon and washington each have gasoline in its highest range 4 43 to 5 92 per gallon troublingly only 11 states remain under 4 if gas stops here i think we can get through 2022 without a recession even so itâ s undeniable the marketâ s psychology has morphed from a stock market that was ruminating on a second coming of â the roaring 20sâ to one that has become disgusted with something like a 1970s style malaise figure 5 shows the performance of an equal weighted basket of consumer discretionary stocks relative to consumer staples i went with equal weighting because amazon and tesla comprise 40 of the cap weighted basket and i donâ t want those two stocks to skew the chart the theory goes that when consumer discretionary stocks outperform consumer staples there is confidence in the system people are choosing to buy 5 coffees and 150 sneakers neither of which is an item that anyone needs in other times when the consumer staples sector is beating consumer discretionary something is broken people keep buying bread and paper towels but not a new dishwasher the word â disturbingâ comes to mind when i review figure 5 figure 5 s p 500 equal weight consumer discretionary relative to equal weight consumer staples the trouble in discretionary stocks is a giant headache for the russell 1000 growth index which is heavy in the sector in contrast being so light in it is part of the reason our dividend stuff has been able to outperform in recent months one of our big strategies is dln which has just 5 6 in consumer discretionary figure 6 figure 6 consumer staples discretionary weights i have two recent blogs posts that touch on similar concepts for dlnâ s â cousin â the wisdomtree u s value fund wtv i think the half century chart on buybacks in the middle of this post is pretty compelling if my societal malaise concepts resonate thereâ s this post which touches on dln important risks related to this article there are risks

the securities and exchange commission s sec remit includes ensuring candor honesty and transparency in what public companies tell investors yet it will spend the next few weeks and months trying to fool us into believing that its new 510 page proposal on mandatory climate disclosure is solely about protecting investors and has nothing to do with climate policy or achieving net zero emissions by 2050 no one should be fooled materiality is the governing principle of corporate disclosure requirements in 2010 the sec issued 29 pages of guidance on climate change disclosures with respect to what is now called climate transition risk the guidance requires that companies should consider specific risks they may face as a result of climate change legislation or regulations and avoid generic risk factor disclosure that could apply to any company this common sense approach is now being superseded by an sec specified climate risk reporting and accounting framework that will run in parallel with traditional financial reporting requirements with its own verification and attestation regime necessitating the employment of legions of climate consultants at the heart of the sec s new climate disclosure regime is quantification of a company s greenhouse gas emissions at three levels those emitted directly as a result of its own operations scope 1 those emitted from generating the electricity it consumes scope 2 and those emitted by its suppliers and customers scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in many respects resemble financial statement disclosures writes commissioner allison herren lee who as the sec s acting chair in march 2021 initiated the process that led to the current proposal such disclosures she claims provide critically important insights into a company s operations this statement takes us to the crux of the matter the quantity of greenhouse gases that a company emits is material to its future financial performance if there is a probability that such emissions will be taxed or subject to regulation in which case current sec guidance requires companies to disclose their likely impact on the other hand tabulations of corporate greenhouse gas emissions are of great interest to climate activists sec chairman gary gensler claims that forcing companies to make such disclosures is rooted in the concept of materiality if investors say they need the information he argues it must be material however as hester peirce the sole republican sec commissioner points out in a 6 000 word statement of dissent gensler s justification omits a clear link between materiality of information and its relevance to the financial return of an investment the reasonable investor as described by justice thurgood marshall in tsc industries v northway 1976 is someone whose interest is in a financial return on an investment in the company making the disclosure peirce writes many calls for enhanced climate disclosure are motivated not by an interest in financial returns from an investment in a particular company but by deep concerns about the climate or sometimes superficial concerns expressed to garner goodwill investors can have any number of nonfinancial motives for wanting climate data some want to know how green their portfolio is morgan stanley capital international has developed paris aligned indices to help investors make net zero part of their decisionmaking state street the third largest index tracker provider has begun marketing four paris aligned exchange traded funds etfs tracking american european japanese and world indices the sec justifies the proposed mandate in part because some investors told the commission they want comparable climate data across their portfolios acceding to this would imply peirce argues that the sec thinks it appropriate for shareholders of the disclosing company to subsidize other investors portfolio analysis but these are subsidiary considerations let us be honest about what this proposal is really trying to do peirce writes although styled as a disclosure rule the goal of this proposal is to direct capital to favored businesses and to advance favored political and social goals climate disclosure is not as the sec claims about giving investors information about climate risk rather its main purpose is to force companies to provide information on their greenhouse gas emissions and those of their suppliers and customers so that shareholders interest groups and others can enforce net zero targets on them through proxy votes and other forms of engagement the sec justifies use of greenhouse gas emissions as indicators of climate related risk on the grounds that they are a commonly used metric to assess a company s exposure to such risks this won t wash and it is a travesty that the sec has adopted such reasoning corporate emissions disclosures systematically mislead investors on the degree of climate regulatory risk a corporation is exposed to because such disclosures assume the world is a homogenous regulatory space there is no factual basis to justify this assumption and the sec offers none climate regulation varies widely by jurisdiction according to economist william nordhaus in 2019 80 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions had an effective price of 0 unlike prior attempts at global climate treaties the paris agreement is based on nationally determined contributions moreover net zero by 2050 has no legal standing in the united states the senate was not invited to give its advice and consent to the paris agreement with its aspiration of achieving net zero sometime in the second half of this century yes net zero by 2050 is the policy of the biden administration but congress has passed no law to put it into effect once it is admitted that the purpose of requiring american public companies to tabulate greenhouse gas emissions is to provide tools to enforce net zero emissions targets on them it all makes sense the sec s proposal imports virtually wholesale the climate financial risk disclosure regime of michael bloomberg s task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd incorporating climate related risk into corporate decision making the tcfd website says will empower the markets to channel investment to sustainable and resilient solutions opportunities and business models similarly the g 20 s financial stability board in its roadmap for addressing climate related financial risks published last year declares that progress in identifying and addressing climate related financial risks will support a shift towards sustainable finance and create a positive feedback loop for the mobilization of sustainable finance jean rogers founder of the sustainability accounting standards board foresees the need for the sec to ask the environmental protection agency to develop transition pathways for each sector in order to evaluate the adequacy and materiality of the climate disclosures companies make nonetheless the sec must maintain the pretense that such disclosures are being made to protect investors and therefore fall within the sec s narrow congressional mandate the commission cannot openly admit that mandated climate disclosures are tools to facilitate investors enforcing climate policies on corporate america there are costs to the sec s conduct the commission tasked with upholding the probity of financial disclosures is working to mislead financial markets as to the intent of its proposed climate disclosure regime though touted as an indicator of climate transition risk consolidated greenhouse gas disclosures cannot serve this purpose unless there is a global greenhouse gas regulator which of course there is not rather such data are an indicator of a company s vulnerability to climate activists a different matter altogether and one that it s reasonable to conclude is the sec s intent in addition to harming investors foisting a structurally misleading disclosure regime onto financial markets by labelling it an indicator of climate transition risk runs contrary to the sec s mandate to maintain fair efficient markets and to facilitate capital formation the effort will push oil and gas investment from public to private markets and from wall street listed companies to overseas ones especially non western companies immune from climate activism the greatest cost though will be to america s national interest and to the sec s place in constitutional governance the sec s proposal could hardly have been more ill timed it was immediately denounced by sen pat toomey r pa ranking member of the senate banking committee for hijacking the democratic process and disdaining the limited authority that congress gave the sec with inflation at a 40 year high gas prices skyrocketing and russia waging an energy funded war the last thing the american people need are unelected regulators advancing policies by partisan vote that will cause energy costs to further rise toomey said writing in the wall street journal former sec chair jay clayton and rep patrick mchenry r n c ranking member of the house financial services committee note that the constitution assigns congress the task of weighing and resolving the trade offs inherent in climate and energy policy because the sec has decided to move forward unilaterally the debate will shift not to congress where it belongs but to the courts they observe so it will be in the courts that the sec will be forced to defend not just its constitutional overreach but also its misrepresenting of its climate risk disclosure regime as being about investor protection as opposed to what it s really about the sec trying its hand at climate policy rupert darwall is a senior fellow of the realclear foundation and author of climate risk disclosure a flimsy pretext for a green power grab

an analysis of the uk s corporate rescue tools the company voluntary arrangement the scheme of arrangement and the restructuring plan when it comes to options for the rescue of a distressed uk corporate there had for a very long time been a growing mood of regret amongst practitioners that there was no comprehensive restructuring tool that all changed with the introduction of the restructuring plan rp but as with all things new the evitable question is what happens to the old will the uk s longstanding corporate rescue tools the company voluntary arrangement cvas and the scheme of arrangement schemes slip quietly out the back door or more likely do they remain very useful tools we consider here both the old and the new procedures of the uk corporate rescue toolkit and offer some brief thoughts on how and when they may be used over the coming years the old historically two tools have been widely used under uk law to facilitate an upstream corporate restructuring that is one where there are signs of distress but insolvency may yet be staved off cvas under the insolvency act 19861 and schemes under the companies act 20062 however both procedures have at times attracted criticism as not always being fit for purpose or as missing certain key functions when compared for example to chapter 11 proceedings in the united states chapter 11 schemes conceived as an inherently solvent process schemes are not an insolvency procedure as such but rather have been molded through widespread practice to effect complex corporate restructurings in an often but not always distressed context in many ways this has significantly contributed to the successful development of the scheme as an international restructuring tool in that it is a companies act process not an insolvency act procedure and although it is necessary to apply to court to get the scheme sanctioned that is a light touch court process with a relatively short and predictable timeline with a ready raft of case law built up over the last few decades schemes are now highly developed reliable and swift and are imbued with a significant level of familiarity among practitioners and stakeholders including importantly the uk s judiciary this has led to the scheme procedure being viewed as a key tool with which to implement international restructurings and hand in hand with that development the english courts have been increasingly rigorous in scrutinising the supporting evidence to ensure consistency and fairness however schemes have historically been considered as fundamentally lacking in two key regards 1 the absence of an accompanying moratorium to protect the instigating debtor company from enforcement while it progresses with its restructure and 2 no provisions for cross class cram down through use of a scheme in isolation cvas cvas were introduced under the 1986 act as a tool which was hoped in hindsight perhaps with not an insignificant degree of naivety on the part of the legislators of the time could be used to effect a quick cost effective and easy to implement restructure of a company s debt their corresponding statutory footing was therefore quite deliberately straightforward and crucially only provided for the compromise of unsecured debts and lacked any inbuilt functionality through which a restructure of equity or secured debt could be executed given the shifts in capital structures since introduction of the 1986 act with secured debt now a significantly more common and material part of corporate balance sheets than before that shortcoming has become more and more of a hindrance that notwithstanding in the years since their introduction cvas have found particular favour with commercial tenants such debtors having often found themselves stretched too thinly across numerous leasing obligations have availed themselves of the cva as a handy tool through which to centrally compromise rent arrears and renegotiate rental obligations owed to their many landlords including the adjustment of rent going forwards however the introduction of the commercial rent coronavirus bill which is currently working its way through the house of lords and the corresponding code of practice for commercial rent arrears which aim to encourage and facilitate the resolution of rent arrears accumulated during covid 19 lockdowns either under a consensual settlement or failing that through a binding arbitration system could have a marked impact on the demand for cvas post covid 19 assuming the proposed arbitration scheme and the code of practice work as intended tenants may have less need to turn to a cva in the immediate future particularly given recent estimates from the british retail consortium that between 80 90 of their members have already reached agreement on the resolution of their covid 19 rental arrears so while both schemes and cvas have proved of much utility to restructuring practitioners companies and creditors over the last few decades neither can be considered a comprehensive restructuring tool indeed it must be recognised that they were never set up with quite the same reach or objectives as chapter 11 and the above outlined limitations must be appreciated within that context the absence of a one stop shop tool though has for some time been a source of much frustration and has led to the frequent practice of running the uk s existing tools in tandem with other procedures including administration appointments and sales processes to ensure the comprehensive implementation of a multi faceted restructuring naturally such an approach has at times been clunky costly and time consuming mechanical steps and in particular the transfers of assets and businesses in an accompanying administration have often been required where they might otherwise have been avoided the new it was with some enthusiasm then that the uk s restructuring community received confirmation that the government as part of its legislative response to the covid 19 pandemic would introduce a new alternative rescue procedure which had been on the stocks and under consideration for some time the rp3 the rp came into force on 26 june 2020 and built largely on the lessons learned since the introduction of cvas under the 1986 act and from the exhaustive judicial consideration of schemes it is designed and intended for use as a fully comprehensive corporate rescue tool its strength emanates from its far greater efficiency for those creditors with a genuine economic interest in the restructuring of a company through two key elements cross class cram down the much lauded cross class cram down function provides that only those creditors that are in the money i e those who can expect at least some return through the relevant alternative can block a proposed rp that means fewer wasted costs fighting uphill battles to persuade creditors and stakeholders of the merits of a proposal where those parties either have no genuine economic interest in the company or would in any event be worse off under the relevant alternative to the rp there is thus no need to leave the out of the money stakeholders behind by way of an administration pre pack sale which absent being able to persuade out of the money creditors to fold their hands has historically been required this powerful new mechanism comes with safeguards however there is a significant onus on those proposing the rp to demonstrate that they have adequately considered the interests of all impacted parties and the right balance must be struck to ensure that no creditor is worse off than it would be in the relevant alternative failure to address such factors will risk the court exercising its discretionary power to intervene and block the plan on behalf of those being crammed explored in more detail below with cross class cram down having already been successfully utilised in deep ocean4 virgin active5 and amicus finance6 but unsuccessfully in hurricane energy7 the recently reported landmark convening decision in smile telecoms 8 second rp has paved the way for even more efficient restructurings via an rp in smile the court determined it was competent under section 901c 4 of the companies act to exclude from voting on a plan those classes of creditor who have no genuine economic interest in the company i e no prospect of any recovery via either the rp or the relevant alternative for a more detailed discussion of the decision in smile please see our gt alert here this option under the rp legislation was used to facilitate a streamlined approach of seeking only the approving vote of only one of the eight classes of creditors and members the out of the money stakeholders i e those with no genuine economic interest were deprived of a class meeting which in this respect aligns the rp procedure to the us chapter 11 process which deems a completely out of the money creditor to have rejected the plan but they do not get to vote on the plan and so have no right of veto over the chapter 11 plan judicial and regulatory scrutiny unlike cvas which are not initially subjected to the judicial scrutiny of the courts rps and schemes require significant but focused court involvement at two hearings convening and sanction while this higher degree of court scrutiny at the outset may lead to increased costs up front it has and should continue to inspire greater confidence that the restructuring will not be de railed by challenge down the line which in turn should generally lead to more cost confidence and certainty of outcome it should also be noted that regulators as well as the courts are starting to exert increasing pressure and scrutiny on both rps and schemes particularly where consumers are impacted e g the recent decision on the proposed amigo loans9 scheme where the court was impacted by among other considerations the fca s intervention on behalf of consumer creditors in amigo the fca appeared at the sanction hearing and opposed the proposed scheme on fairness grounds due to the low level of consideration offered to the scheme creditors i e the consumers which the fca argued unfairly benefited other stakeholders such as shareholders and bondholders who were making an inadequate contribution to the restructuring following that intervention which marked a step change when compared to a more lackluster approach just months earlier in the case of provident spv limited10 the fca has taken steps to clarify how it sees its role in restructurings going forward and has warned regulated companies that it will formally object to debt compromises which it considers do not treat customers fairly 11 old vs new as we move further into 2022 it remains to be seen whether it will be the old or the new tools that prove of greatest utility in dealing with what could amount to a surge of post covid 19 restructurings as government support and creditor forbearance tails off likely the choice of restructuring tool or indeed arbitration if the matter concerns unpaid rent between 21 march 2020 to 18 july 2021 due to the adverse effect of covid 19 will depend on the facts of each situation cvas it seems probable that cvas will continue to remain favourites when it comes to the compromising of commercial rents given their specific treatment of unsecured debt and their now well established line of case law further prospective cvas may well find encouragement in the recent introduction of industry standard models12 and the support they may expect from secured high street lenders and hmrc both of whom remain acutely aware of sensitivities particularly post covid 19 around their roles in promoting the recovery of viable businesses while there will inevitably be some instances in which their intervention and enforcement can be expected the broader approach may be more measured and supportive with the directors of struggling businesses being urged to take remedial steps themselves neither the banks nor the tax man are keen to have their fingerprints on too many post covid 19 insolvencies with banks in particular understandably looking to avoid any repeat of negative media exposure regarding the historic roles of their business support functions schemes schemes despite their inherent flexibility and suitability to solvent as well as distressed situations and the ready familiarity they have come to enjoy in the market are likely to be less frequently used than before having said that they should continue to be a powerful force in certain situations including where the intention is to restructure a single or limited number of classes of stakeholder and there is broad support in those classes to do that unlike rps a scheme restructuring does not have to consider the entirety of a debtor s balance sheet so for example schemes can be used to compromise financial debt claims or specific classes of consumer claims such as mis selling as has been attempted recently in the proposed schemes for card protection plan limited13 and provident spv limited14 successfully and amigo loans15 unsuccessfully so far schemes v rps the role of recognition it is significant that rps have been determined by the high court in re gategroup guarantee ltd16 to be insolvency proceedings that determination while made specifically in the context of the lugano convention s bankruptcy exclusion which operates to exclude bankruptcy processes from recognition under that treaty is expected to have a much wider adverse impact on the international recognition of rps which is already a trickier proposition post brexit rps seeking recognition in a foreign jurisdiction will therefore not be able to rely on lugano or most likely the hague convention and instead will have to rely on far narrower and more involved routes to recognition including local law considerations schemes on the other hand do not appear to have been tarred with the same insolvency proceedings brush and so may be the more popular option where a restructure requires some degree of cross border recognition although it should be noted that the lugano convention route also remains closed for schemes post brexit with the eu having blocked the uk s accession to that treaty conclusion rps have taken uk restructuring to the next level for many complex restructurings the mood of the market suggests that we will continue to see a steady uptick in the use of rps in place of the old tools as stakeholders look to capitalise on the comprehensive and efficient restructuring solutions

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the president dubbed it the billionaire minimum tax but it applies to anyone with wealth greater than 100 million washington the president is trying to get the uber wealthy to pay up with a new tax a 20 percent minimum tax that applies only to the top one hundredth of one percent the president said monday one hundredth of one percent of the americans will pay this tax the tariff was unveiled in his 2023 budget proposal and will apply to households with more than 100 million dollars two big questions popping up are would this include more than just income and would it only affect 700 people the question will millionaires and billionaires be taxed on more than just income the sources the answer what we found president biden is attempting to fix a loophole in tax law used by the ultra wealthy in many many cases the uber rich have assets that never are taxed howard gleckman senior fellow a the urban brookings tax policy center said they re never taxed during their lifetime they re never taxed when they die and because of another strange provision of the tax law that increase in the value of their assets never is taxed to their heirs the president is trying to change the definition of income for multi millionaires and billionaires so that it s not just wages is the proposal a 20 tax on income or wealth mountainman rckymountainman march 28 2022 the point of the tax is to address a long standing flaw in the individual income tax where much of the income of very wealthy households doesn t get taxed every year on their tax returns samantha jacoby senior tax legal analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities said and that s because a large share of their income comes from capital gains like the increase in the value of an asset like stock or real property and that income is only taxed on a sale what s known as realization she continued so if a wealthy person just keeps holding on to their stock for years and years and decades the increase in the value of that asset is never taxed and if they hold it hold it for their entire life neither they nor their heirs will ever pay that tax so this is trying to sort of broaden the definition of taxable income for this small subset of very wealthy people right now the president said a firefighter or teacher ends up paying more than double the tax rate of what a billionaire pays these individuals are paying eight percent of their income versus the average american who pays 15 percent and that s what they re trying to close in terms of the gap bill hoagland senior vice president at bipartisan policy center said our experts say this proposal would not just tax income but also any increase in value of the things you own even if you don t sell them it s called unrealized capital gain so if you made more than 100 million in income and unrealized gains you ll face a minimum 20 percent tax under this proposal gleckman gave this basic example let s say a person making more than 100 million buys a stock for 10 if it jumps to 100 in a year that person would pay tax on that 90 dollar increase in value if the stock grows to 110 the next year they d pay tax on that 10 gain it s a wealth tax it is a tax clearly on the individuals who have been successful in gaining a great deal of income over their career hoagland said but at the same time they have created jobs and opportunities for many a million americans through the investments that they have created our experts say that those assets won t be double taxed basically if someone pays the tax unrealized gains before they sell it that amount will be credited to them when they later sell the asset jacoby said and if the asset loses its value and they sell it at a loss they can get a refund of the tax they already paid hoagland agrees no they should not get taxed twice he said i can envision however that an asset s unrealized gain at the end of the calendar year having been taxed say it was 100 if in the next year that asset is sold say at 110 the realized gain 10 from value it was last taxed end of previous year would be taxed at the regular capital gains rate so we can verify no the tax in this proposal won t just include income jacoby says keep in mind just because someone doesn t cash out their investments that doesn t mean they can t access the value of it somebody who owns a bunch of stock and wants to get some cash to finance a wealthy lifestyle like you know buying yachts or whatever else they can just get cash by taking out a loan and using their stock as collateral she said it s not quite right to think this type of income is not real or paper gains saying that it s not real is like saying that someone like jeff bezos or elon musk doesn t have anything of value because they haven t sold their stock which is just not true neither the budget nor the treasury s paper defines exactly what would be considered part of your wealth but jacoby and gleckman say things like vacation homes and expensive cars or art collections would likely be included the question will just 700 people be impacted by this tax the sources howard gleckman senior fellow urban brookings tax policy center samantha jacoby senior tax legal analyst center on budget and policy priorities the answer what we found lots of people are saying the wealth tax only applies to about 700 individuals that s an often quoted estimate of how many billionaires live in the united states 700 people affected by wealthtax is it me no you no anyone you know know one of the 700 richest nope me neither they can pay refreshing change of pace if retail workers mechanics can pay taxes ultra wealthy can too jodell wb jodellwb march 30 2022 part of the confusion may have been in part because president biden dubbed this the billionaire minimum tax

third quarter of 2022 in november the company consolidated its operations into a single location in jacksonville fl in addition to creating a more collaborative working environment the new facility will have sufficient space for the company s anticipated expansion over the next 12 months fourth quarter 2021 financial results it should be noted that the following financial results represent the consolidation of the company with its subsidiaries duos technologies inc and truevue360 total revenue for q4 2021 was essentially unchanged at 3 72 million compared to 3 78 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 q4 2020 total revenue for q4 2021 represents an aggregate of approximately 3 12 million of technology systems revenue and approximately 592 000 in recurring services and consulting revenue performance during q4 2021 was driven by new revenues being recorded after lengthy delays in receiving notices to proceed for anticipated new contracts earlier in the year which pushed delivery dates into the second half of 2021 and into 2022 although the industries in which the company operates are showing early signs of recovery from the delays incurred because of the covid 19 pandemic other macro economic effects impacted the company including supply chain issues and inflation which are extending deadlines for shipment of key components used in duos technology systems cost of revenues for q4 2021 increased 9 to 3 10 million compared to 2 83 million for q4 2020 the increase in cost of revenues for technology systems for q4 2021 compared to q4 2020 was driven by the need for additional work for some of the company s existing installations additional costs related to new deployments of an undercarriage technology and supply chain disruptions cost of revenues for q4 2021 compared to q4 2020 also increased on services and consulting but at a slower rate than the increase in revenues for the comparable periods this positive trend is expected to continue as more of the company s business is expected to come from recurring revenue duos is focused on expanding support operations in 2022 in an effort to increase expected recurring revenue streams and expand gross margins in line with company growth gross margin for q4 2021 decreased 35 to 618 000 compared to 951 000 for q4 2020 the decrease in gross margin for q4 2021 compared to q4 2020 was driven by a decrease in recorded revenues for q4 2021 compared to q4 2020 and an increase in total costs incurred during q4 2021 in support of those underlying revenues the main reasons for the elevated level of cost in q4 2021 relative to q4 2020 were additional costs incurred during q4 2021 as the result of additional development work on certain elements of the company s more complex installations as well as higher costs of materials due to supply chain disruptions the resultant additional cost of revenues in q4 2021 was partially offset by decreases in g a expenses during the same period the company anticipates an improvement in the overall gross margin for the full year reporting in 2022 with much of the improvement expected to occur in the second half of the year when ongoing contract revenues are recognized operating expenses for q4 2021 decreased 33 to 858 000 compared to 1 36 million for q4 2020 the decrease in operating expenses for q4 2021 compared to q4 2020 was driven by a 37 decrease in administration expenses and a 26 decrease in sales and marketing costs partially offset by a modest increase in research and development costs net loss for q4 2021 totaled 250 000 compared to net loss of 426 000 for q4 2020 the improvement in net loss for q4 2021 compared to q4 2020 was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating expenses previously noted partially offset by the aforementioned increase in total cost of revenue cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 totaled 894 000 compared to 3 97 million at december 31 2020 as noted previously in february 2022 the company conducted an underwritten public offering of its common stock resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 6 1 million before deducting expenses of 600 000 as of march 28 2022 the company had a pro forma cash position of approximately 5 7 million total revenue for 2021 increased 3 to 8 26 million compared to 8 04 million for 2020 total revenue for 2021 represents an aggregate of about 5 87 million for technology systems revenue and 2 39 million in recurring services and consulting revenue the increase in total revenue for 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by new revenues being recorded after lengthy delays in receiving notices to proceed for anticipated new contracts earlier in the year which pushed delivery dates into the second half of 2021 and into 2022 there was a slight decrease in revenue from systems which was more than offset by a 15 increase in services revenue most of which is recurring in nature cost of revenues for 2021 increased 39 to 10 82 million compared to 7 80 million for 2020 the increase in cost of revenues for technology systems for 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by additional work being necessary for some of the company s existing installations additional costs related to new deployments of an undercarriage technology and supply chain disruptions cost of revenues also increased on services and consulting but at a slower rate than the increase in revenues as noted previously this positive trend is expected to continue as more of the company s business is expected to come from recurring revenue gross margin for 2021 decreased to a loss of 2 56 million compared to a profit of 236 000 for 2020 the decrease in gross margin for 2021 compared to 2020 was mainly the result of higher costs and certain delays incurred in 2021 related to supply chain issues during the year throughout 2021 the company experienced an increase in costs related to the revamp of its operations to support an anticipated increase in the number of new systems as previously mentioned the main reason for the elevated level of cost is the result of additional development work being necessary on certain elements of the company s more complex installations as well as higher costs of materials due to supply chain disruptions the resultant additional cost of revenues while somewhat offset by decreases in g a expenses was not covered by a comparable increase in revenues as of the third quarter 2021 however these costs were offset by positive gross margins in q4 2021 operating expenses for 2021 decreased 29 to 4 90 million compared to 6 87 million for 2021 the decrease in operating expenses for 2021 compared to 2020 was the result of a 44 decrease in 2021 in overall administration costs offset by a 72 increase in sales and marketing in 2021 the decrease was also partially due to the recording of a separation agreement in 2020 which was not present in 2021 combined with other reductions in cost in 2021 as part of the restructuring of the business additionally certain costs to support the organization as it operated at that time were eliminated as an offset to increases in operations staff net loss for 2021 totaled 6 01 million compared to a net loss of 6 75 million for 2020 the improvement in net loss is primarily attributable to the effect of the paycheck protection plan ppp loan forgiveness in 2021 which was offset by increases during the year in project expenses as previously described financial outlook during q4 2021 the company was successful in closing several high value contracts and is entering 2022 with a strong commitment of business currently representing approximately 16 5 to 18 million in revenue expected to be recognized in calendar 2022 based on these committed contracts and near term pending orders that are already performing or scheduled to be executed throughout the course of 2022 the company is reiterating its previously stated revenue expectations for the fiscal year ending december 31 2022 the company expects total revenue for 2022 to range between 16 5 million and 18 million representing an increase of 99 to 117 from 2021 duos expects this improvement in operating results to be reflected over the course of the full year in 2022 as a result of timing and other factors the company expects revenues in the first quarter of 2022 to sequentially decrease before

with canadian securities commissions and the u s securities and exchange commission is available on tip inc s website www trilogy international com in the investor relations section and under tip inc s profile on sedar www sedar com and edgar www sec gov impact of covid 19 on our business in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus now known as covid 19 surfaced in china spreading rapidly throughout the world in the following months in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid 19 to be a pandemic shortly following this declaration and after observing covid 19 infections in their countries the governments of new zealand and bolivia imposed quarantine policies with isolation requirements and movement restrictions during 2020 and 2021 and continuing through the date of this press release the business and operations of both 2degrees and nuevatel have been affected by the pandemic the impact to date has varied with differing effects on financial and business results in new zealand and bolivia given the ongoing and changing developments related to the pandemic the full extent of future effects on the company s businesses and financial results cannot be reliably estimated in new zealand the government s swift and significant response at the outset of the pandemic had an immediate impact on customer acquisition and revenues and 2degrees undertook actions throughout 2020 and 2021 to mitigate the impact however as movement restrictions within new zealand were lifted financial results including revenues and segment adjusted ebitda see note 18 segment information to the consolidated financial statements began to improve sequentially in the latter part of 2020 and continued through 2021 as compared to the initial months of the pandemic during the third quarter of 2021 a resurgence of covid 19 cases resulted in a reinstatement of movement restrictions which adversely affected financial sequential results during the quarter these movement restrictions remained in force at various levels throughout the country until december 2021 when a new traffic light framework was rolled out the traffic light structure provides more certainty and stability with schools and businesses remaining open during all color stages however certain capacity and vaccination restrictions may be implemented depending on the color stage although this new framework provides a more predictable and open environment there continues to be uncertainty for 2degrees regarding the future effect of covid 19 on the new zealand economy and related responses by the government regulators and customers in bolivia the consequences of covid 19 and related societal restrictions have been more pronounced and the impact of the pandemic on the financial results of nuevatel has been more significant than in new zealand over the course of 2020 and 2021 nuevatel experienced a reduction in key financial metrics including revenues segment adjusted ebitda and subscribers as a result of societal and movement restrictions which significantly affected customer behavior additionally societal and movement restrictions in effect in bolivia through the end of 2021 resulted in economic uncertainty and it is unclear when customer behavior in bolivia will return to historic norms creating a risk of a continuing adverse impact on the timing and amount of cash collections bad debt expense and revenue trends periodically during 2021 certain regions in bolivia experienced a resurgence of covid 19 cases which resulted in additional measures that suppressed typical customer behavior due to the wide ranging economic effect of covid 19 in bolivia nuevatel generated substantial net losses during the periods impacted by the pandemic and continuing through the year ended december 31 2021 similarly the net losses incurred in 2020 impacted our near term expectation regarding the ability to generate taxable income in bolivia and thereby utilize nuevatel s deferred tax assets certain of which have a relatively short duration of use consequently during the third quarter of 2020 management changed its assessment with respect to the ability to realize nuevatel s net deferred tax assets concluding that they are no longer more likely than not to be realized on the basis of this evaluation management recorded a full valuation allowance against nuevatel s net deferred tax asset balance in 2020 and has continued to maintain a full reserve through december 31 2021 management will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods as it relates to nuevatel s long lived assets including property and equipment license costs and other intangible assets and operating lease right of use assets the company monitors and assesses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an affected asset group may not be recoverable this evaluation of long lived assets is performed at the nuevatel entity level which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified as disclosed in prior filings by the company nuevatel s financial performance during the second half of 2021 was expected to be pivotal to management s continuing evaluation of facts and circumstances in this regard amidst the ongoing impact of covid 19 on the local economy nuevatel did not meet management s expectations regarding recovery of its business and financial performance during the third quarter of 2021 particularly considering the sequential quarters of negative adjusted ebitda during a period when management expected a return to a positive trajectory as a result expectations regarding nuevatel s long term financial performance were revised to reflect these changes in facts and circumstances due to these and other changes in events and circumstances for nuevatel the company tested the long lived assets of nuevatel the asset group in the third quarter of 2021 for recoverability and impairment in evaluating long lived assets for recoverability the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group are compared to the carrying value of the asset group if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value considering external market participant assumptions the company performed a recoverability test during the third quarter of 2021 using management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows and determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable accordingly the company determined an estimated fair value of the asset group and related long lived assets using a combination of valuation techniques including i a discounted cash flow method which estimates the amount and timing of net future cash flows and discounts them using a risk adjusted rate of interest ii a guideline public company method using observable public company valuation information and iii a transaction based method using observable valuations of recent merged or acquired companies in the telecommunications industry the fair values of the long lived assets included within the asset group were further determined using various valuation techniques applied by asset type including observed market sales of similar assets and consideration of liquidation values and economic obsolescence factors as a result of estimating the fair value of the asset group and comparing amounts to their carrying value the company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 113 8 million during the year ended december 31 2021 the impairment was allocated to long lived assets in the following amounts 42 2 million to property and equipment 48 5 million to operating lease right of use assets 18 8 million to license costs and other intangible assets and 4 3 million to other assets these impairment charges were included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income the pre tax impairment charge resulted in a 28 5 million deferred tax asset which was offset by a full valuation allowance and a 5 2 million tax benefit as a result of the reduction to the company s deferred tax liability for nuevatel s unrepatriated earnings nuevatel has maintained adequate cash liquidity to date in part due to cash management efforts since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic resulting in 17 5 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december 31 2021 as an additional measure to preserve liquidity and support the ability to generate future cash flows nuevatel implemented workforce reductions in the fourth quarter of 2020 with related cost reductions continuing through the year ended december 31 2021 although these initiatives have tempered the impact to date the prolonged effect of the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in increased liquidity and cash challenges for nuevatel regarding its ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due specifically forecasted cash resources may not be sufficient to fund certain obligations due in the first half of 2022 as management continues to address issues associated with meeting such financial obligations these actions are currently underway and include arranging extended payment terms with suppliers further controlling costs and further limiting capital expenditures if nuevatel is unable to complete the aforementioned activities to a sufficient degree nuevatel is projected to have a cash shortfall in the coming months and as early as may 2022 notwithstanding the above and as further discussed in note 20 subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements on march 28 2022 the company entered into an agreement for the transfer of its equity interests in nuevatel to a third party for a nominal purchase price closing is subject to bolivian regulatory review and approval unless such condition is waived by the purchaser the company will monitor the progress of the closing of the transaction and the related impact on the company s exposure to nuevatel s liquidity concerns over future periods there is no certainty that the transaction will close or that nuevatel s liquidity concerns will be resolved consolidated

the biden administration has given the go ahead for another covid vaccine booster for people aged 50 and older and certain people who are immunocompromised they can now get another moderna or pfizer biontech booster at least four months after their last dose but just because you can get an additional booster does that mean you need to health officials argue that the protection provided by the covid vaccine booster shots wanes over time and they are concerned about people considered to be at highest risk of getting severe covid but the centers for disease control and prevention didn t make it clear how urgently people should be lining up for second boosters the agency says these groups are eligible for the shots but it stopped short of saying they should get them and some infectious disease experts say not everyone in this age group needs another shot now so if you re wondering whether to get a second booster here are a few key factors to consider risk of serious illness increases with age risk tracks with age and older people have the highest risk a recent study among people 60 and older in israel found that rates of covid 19 infection and serious illness were lower in people who had a fourth dose of the pfizer vaccine compared to three shots we re talking about extra protection from the most serious outcome of covid says dr eric topol founder and director of the scripps research translational institute dr bob wachter chair of the department of medicine at the university of california san francisco says he personally plans to sign up for a second booster i m 64 and pretty healthy he says but the evidence is clear that six months out from my first booster shot the effectiveness of that booster has waned considerably he says another dose will boost his immunity and decrease the probability of infection the benefits are very real wachter says but for people under 60 it s less clear a second booster is necessary i don t think we have the data for younger people 50 to even 60 says dr monica gandhi an infectious disease specialist at the university of california san francisco the study out of israel didn t include this younger age group she points out that other countries are targeting additional boosters for older people germany has authorized a fourth shot for people over 70 the u k is targeting people over the age of 75 and sweden is giving fourth shots to people over 80 gandhi says the u s is jumping the gun by forging ahead with shots for everyone over 50 without the relevant data still the trendline is clear says dr peter chin hong an infectious disease specialist at ucsf the older you are the bigger the benefit he says although the majority of deaths from covid have been people older than 65 there s a clear association with age and mortality with covid chin hong says it s really really striking and it starts at age 50 his advice walk to get the second booster if you re eligible then he says walk a little faster the older you get his mom is in her 80s and he wants to protect her as much as possible i m telling her to walk quickly he says dr carlos del rio an infectious disease researcher at emory university thinks it s reasonable for people under 60 to wait the vaccines are holding up pretty well against severe disease and death he says it s also worth noting that even for people over 60 the added protection of an additional booster shot is small in absolute terms people who got the first booster already have a very low risk of dying from covid chin hong points out that in the israeli study less than 1 of people with a third shot died a risk so low he calls it remarkable among people who got the fourth shot in this study just 03 died three shots is the magic number we think so far he says underlying conditions put you at higher risk certain medical conditions also increase the risk of serious illness and death from covid 19 and that s the reason the fda decided to authorize the additional boosters starting at age 50 we know that people in the age range from about 50 to 65 about a third of them have significant comorbidities said dr peter marks director of the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research at a press conference tuesday people with heart disease lung disease obesity and diabetes are at higher risk for serious illness and death and people over 50 particularly people of color are more likely to have an additional risk factor so by choosing age 50 and up to consider those at high risk or higher risk marks said we felt like we would capture the population that might most benefit from this fourth dose when it comes to age there s no bright cutoff of risk agrees wachter there are likely incremental increases in risk year after year as a person ages a 50 year old typically has lower risk than a 65 year old but health status matters too an unhealthy 55 year old is probably at the same risk as a healthier 65 year old wachter says bottom line risk goes up with age and underlying conditions and wachter says many people over 50 may benefit from another dose anyone who has a serious medical condition i would certainly suggest thinking about getting a booster says dr preeti malani an infectious disease professor at university of michigan health for my own family for my parents and my in laws this is something that i will recommend she says because that extra layer of protection does help ensure that if they get covid it s going to be milder immunocompromised people may need an extra boost health officials are particularly concerned about people who are immunocompromised because their immune responses to the vaccine tends to wane faster and they are at higher risk of getting severely ill or dying from covid 19 that s why anyone 12 or older with certain immunocompromised conditionscan now get an additional shot of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine four months after their last dose a second booster of the moderna vaccine can be given to people 18 years of age and older this includes people who have undergone solid organ transplants or who are living with conditions that have a similar level of immunocompromise timing from last dose or infection is important there is mounting evidence of waning vaccine protection against serious illness from covid 19 in older and immunocompromised people who are at least four to six months past their first booster evidence of waning immunity comes from a recent cdc analysis of covid 19 emergency room visits and hospitalizations visits during the omicron predominant period two months after a third dose people were 91 protected against hospitalization but by four months that protection dropped down to about 78 it means that people who were boosted three four five six months ago probably have limited protection against current infection malani says this means a second booster can help shore up that protection but it s not going to be long lasting so the timing of the additional shot can be tricky right now the rate of viral infections has come down significantly since the peaks in january but there are signs that infections are rising in some areas the even more contagious omicron variant ba 2 is now the dominant variant in the u s and hospitalizations are also creeping up in some places peter chin hong says some people might want to wait to get a booster until a time when cases start to rise in their community and they need the added protection more urgently he also notes there may be more effective vaccines on the horizon as vaccine makers test omicron specific vaccines and continue research on vaccines that could fend off multiple variants it may make more sense for people at lower risk to wait still if you re high risk you may not want to wait too long polls show many vaccinated people held off on a first booster dose when they became available last year but waiting until you see another outbreak in your community could be risky it reminds me a little bit of trying to time the stock market it turns out nobody s actually good at it wachter says if there s another outbreak on the horizon it s best to maximize your protection in advance of it there s one more factor to consider when deciding on the timing of a fourth dose have you had a recent covid 19 infection if you ve had three shots and you ve had an omicron infection sometime between december and now i think it s reasonable to wait wachter says he says a recent infection likely puts a person in a similar immunologic state as a second booster rob stein and

shift in geopolitical tension in ukraine oil prices are highly volatile on the back of russian military news and traders are awaiting significant economic numbers determining the future path for us equity markets said naeem aslam chief market analyst at avatrade com volatility in oil prices has taken another turn as traders are trying to make sense of the recent changes in geopolitical tensions basically on the one hand you have good news that there is some de escalation in geopolitical uncertainty as russia has withdrawn some army from kyiv he added benchmark brent crude futures were up 2 2 at 110 12 a barrel oil prices have been recovering after a covd 19 related lockdown imposed on shanghai dampened prices earlier this week but uncertainties over russia and ukraine are expected to keep markets nervous on the other hand the us hasn t acknowledged this thoroughly as it is saying that russia s dial back on its military strategy in ukraine is minuscule the issue here is sanctions on russian energy which has put the oil supply further out of whack if the us acknowledges that russia is moving in the right direction we can see the oil supply issues easing off but if the us stance doesn t shift significantly we will likely see oil supply issues anchored in place aslam said with us federal reserve chairman jerome powell recently noting the strength of the labor market in the world s biggest economy much attention will be on this afternoon s us adp employment figures which are seen as foreshadowing the crucial us non farm payroll data due out on friday last month we saw tremendous improvement in the us labor market making the fed raise the interest rate traders are expecting a decent number this time as well and the forecast is for 455k while the previous reading was 475k a strong reading is likely to trigger a risk on rally for the us equities as investors will feel more comfortable with the fed s tightening of monetary policy if the number misses the forecast and shows weakness speculators are likely to punish the markets because they believe that the fed is making another policy mistake concluded aslam the adp data is due out at 1 15pm et contact the

in a recent speech guyana s vice president himself a former president of the co operative republic bharrat jagdeo described t t as falling apart he told guyanese invest some of the oil and gas resources into building the infrastructure so the non oil and gas sector in the future can generate the jobs because if you don t do that when the oil money goes we will be poor more than many countries in the world look at what is happening in trinidad now jagdeo continued trinidad is falling apart and that is putting it mildly falling apart no jobs to sustain periods of negative growth can t see the light of day can t see the light of day for the near future according to guyana s vice president he recalled reading one of t t s earlier budgets where in one year the country lost 80 per cent of its revenue because of the change in the oil and gas prices and the fall in production he posited that it is difficult to organise a budget when a country has suffered such a big economic shock it is difficult things will fall apart whether you like it or not jagdeo said he added and i have said we are determined in guyana to avoid going that path which has happened not just in t t but in many countries of the world mr jagdeo s suggestion that t t is falling apart shows a stunning lack of knowledge of this country s economy and its energy sector which he continues to suggest is based on oil revenue it is really a continuation of what appears to be the present government of guyana s pre occupation with trying to attack and diminish the achievements of post independence t t to be sure t t has suffered from a lack of leadership this country has squandered a lot of its energy revenues and t t should have been a developed country or at least way ahead of where it is at the moment but to suggest that it is falling apart is far from the truth and unbecoming of an experienced regional leader i am happy that prime minister dr keith rowley did not fall for the bait that jagdeo and other elements in the guyana government and some of their supporters in t t have tried to set for his government there is nothing good that could come from animosity among caricom countries in some ways it is human to understand how one of the poorest and least developed countries in the caribbean would react to new found wealth especially if that wealth has the potential to make it richer than the country that it perceives as having traditionally turned up its nose at it but jagdeo and company would be better served focusing on the herculean task of economic transformation in the south american country rather than expending energy trying to diminish the achievements of t t i am glad dr rowley did not fall into the trap by responding and pointing out that guyana s gross domestic product is us 5 471 billion compare that to the country that is falling apart which has an economy that is almost four times the size of guyana s at us 21 73 billion rowley could have easily pointed out that t t s unemployment rate is 7 2 per cent while guyana s unemployment rate is twice t t s at 15 6 per cent the t t s prime minister could have said that this country s per capita is us 14 875 while guyana is us 9 250 but these are figures that point to the present state of play and give a sense of where the countries are they do not speak to the future jagdeo is correct that t t s economy has not grown since 2014 he is also correct to say the country relies heavily on its energy sector what mr jagdeo seems not to understand is that the country s energy sector is not an oil sector but it entails oil production service companies a large cadre of highly skilled human resource natural gas producers and petrochemical companies there is also liquefaction capacity as well as still some heavy manufacturing capabilities linked to the energy sector he seems not to understand that each of these sectors are important and require significant management and a requirement to formulate and implement policies that will lead to their growth and development in the midst of challenging global conditions jagdeo s apparent ignorance of t t s economy and his lack of recognition that this country still has the largest manufacturing sector the largest financial sector and even the largest regional stock exchange by market capitalisation is either an attempt to play smart with foolishness or mere bliss jagdeo will learn that the six lane highways he encountered when he left piarco on his way to port of spain and the highways that criss cross this country are neither cheap to build nor can be done quickly he will learn that the cost of fixing georgetown s infrastructure including its many canals and poor roads will lead to huge public spending and require a lot of human capital he will learn that the oil money guyana has and will get will be required to fix its electricity which sees weekly outages and insufficient coverage of the vast country jagdeo will learn that there will be increased expectations and demands for more government support and that will put a strain on revenues the days are young and the inflationary pressure that is sure to occur should there be any overheating of the economy in the south american country will force the guyanese government to deal with demands for more and more resources these are the real challenges that guyana must be laser focused on and not obsessed with attacking t t t t has its problems and its opportunities i have been on record for the last three years bemoaning the lack of a clear strategy by the government of t t it has failed to move the energy sector forward and has made serious mistakes in its management of the economy it is however not too late it is very possible that within the next four years this country s natural gas production could return to closer to 4bcf d and crude production to closer to 80 000 barrels of oil per day maybe the government of t t will change course just maybe the administration will find a way to embrace improving the ease of doing business of solving the forex challenge by allowing the rate to be managed based on its real value just maybe it will embrace the private sector these are all in the hands of the administration t t s future is still within its hands it needs to get its act together falling apart it is not
sen joe manchin is out there trolling us all again on president joe biden s agenda to tackle climate change and economic inequality this time he s telling reporters that he s certainly open to a package that could include increasing taxes on the climate and energy proposals and prescription drug pricing reforms he even suggested a timeframe i ve heard people say that before the july 4 break you should have something done if you re going to do anything because coming back might be futile note this is manchin saying that people are saying giving himself full deniability asked what he thought about that whether it was a good thing manchin again demurred if you can do something i m not saying anything s gonna be done then he suggested that he s not talking to anyone we ll look and see if anybody wants to talk but no there s nothing serious going on there but that he s at the center of all the talks to know what s going on everybody keeps talking but i ve given you the three subject areas we re talking that i m considering the objectively corrupt manchin should be pleased and at least a little bit willing to start playing nice with biden one he s now been exposed as corrupt by the new york times which should clip his wings just a little bit and he also forced a presidential budget catered primarily to him too bad the new york times story didn t come pre budget biden would have had a bit more leverage to tell him to stuff it at any rate the budget is being touted by the white house as the biggest deficit cutter and most friendly to police ever third way is raving but is it going to work who knows senator manchin is always willing to engage in discussions about the best way to move our country forward said samantha runyon spokesperson for manchin he remains seriously concerned about the financial status of our country and believes fighting inflation by restoring fairness to our tax system and paying down our national debt must be our first priority he has made clear that we can protect energy independence and respond to climate change at the same time he s actually not all that into tax fairness as it turns out he s already rejected biden s billionaire tax a plan to impose a minimum 20 income tax rate on the top 0 01 of earners and households worth more than 100 million that includes unrealized investment income manchin doesn t like that you can t tax something that s not earned earned income is what we re based on he says although you can entirely tax things that aren t earned unrealized gains is not the way to do it he told reporters shooting down the 20 minimum tax that s what one gets trying to please the senator from west virginia note that manchin is definitely on the record advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy just some other kind of higher tax on the wealthy apparently also note that many of the wealthiest americans don t actually earn much of anything they pay for their lifestyles by borrowing against their stock holdings and avoid paying taxes that way if manchin insists the only way they can be taxed is on what they earn well manchin is full of shit while manchin is playing hard to get things are going to start getting hard period for millions of americans as covid 19 relief programs start ending and there s no biden build back better plan to replace them for the 15 million who ve gained health care through medicaid and the children s health insurance program in the pandemic it means a potential loss of coverage the public health emergency is about to end and with it the requirement for continuous coverage on those programs there were provisions to help ease that transition in build back better which included continuous coverage for kids as well as enhanced affordable care act subsidies and provisions to close the medicaid gap but manchin and sen kyrsten sinema d az have killed all that now states the ones that care about keeping people insured anyway and the federal government have to try to figure out how to not drop 15 million people into an uninsured abyss other elements of biden s plans have been incorporated into the budget biden released monday in an attempt to keep them alive that s especially true of some the critical climate provisions which manchin has said maybe he d be okay with a group of house and senate democrats are attempting to resurrect the long term child care and pre kindergarten programs from the defunct bill they re circulating a letter to biden expressing support for advancing legislation through reconciliation that lowers the cost of child care for families expands access to pre k and invests in the early childhood workforce and infrastructure but as of now it s not at all clear how and whether these programs are going to move forward not as long as manchin keeps shooting down every trial balloon that s raised maybe an ethics investigation into his business practices with his dirty coal money and coziness with fossil fuel lobbyists would constrain him a bit republished with permission from daily kos

relations section and under tip inc s profile on sedar www sedar com and edgar www sec gov impact of covid 19 on our business in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus now known as covid 19 surfaced in china spreading rapidly throughout the world in the following months in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid 19 to be a pandemic shortly following this declaration and after observing covid 19 infections in their countries the governments of new zealand and bolivia imposed quarantine policies with isolation requirements and movement restrictions during 2020 and 2021 and continuing through the date of this press release the business and operations of both 2degrees and nuevatel have been affected by the pandemic the impact to date has varied with differing effects on financial and business results in new zealand and bolivia given the ongoing and changing developments related to the pandemic the full extent of future effects on the company s businesses and financial results cannot be reliably estimated in new zealand the government s swift and significant response at the outset of the pandemic had an immediate impact on customer acquisition and revenues and 2degrees undertook actions throughout 2020 and 2021 to mitigate the impact however as movement restrictions within new zealand were lifted financial results including revenues and segment adjusted ebitda see note 18 segment information to the consolidated financial statements began to improve sequentially in the latter part of 2020 and continued through 2021 as compared to the initial months of the pandemic during the third quarter of 2021 a resurgence of covid 19 cases resulted in a reinstatement of movement restrictions which adversely affected financial sequential results during the quarter these movement restrictions remained in force at various levels throughout the country until december 2021 when a new traffic light framework was rolled out the traffic light structure provides more certainty and stability with schools and businesses remaining open during all color stages however certain capacity and vaccination restrictions may be implemented depending on the color stage although this new framework provides a more predictable and open environment there continues to be uncertainty for 2degrees regarding the future effect of covid 19 on the new zealand economy and related responses by the government regulators and customers in bolivia the consequences of covid 19 and related societal restrictions have been more pronounced and the impact of the pandemic on the financial results of nuevatel has been more significant than in new zealand over the course of 2020 and 2021 nuevatel experienced a reduction in key financial metrics including revenues segment adjusted ebitda and subscribers as a result of societal and movement restrictions which significantly affected customer behavior additionally societal and movement restrictions in effect in bolivia through the end of 2021 resulted in economic uncertainty and it is unclear when customer behavior in bolivia will return to historic norms creating a risk of a continuing adverse impact on the timing and amount of cash collections bad debt expense and revenue trends periodically during 2021 certain regions in bolivia experienced a resurgence of covid 19 cases which resulted in additional measures that suppressed typical customer behavior due to the wide ranging economic effect of covid 19 in bolivia nuevatel generated substantial net losses during the periods impacted by the pandemic and continuing through the year ended december 31 2021 similarly the net losses incurred in 2020 impacted our near term expectation regarding the ability to generate taxable income in bolivia and thereby utilize nuevatel s deferred tax assets certain of which have a relatively short duration of use consequently during the third quarter of 2020 management changed its assessment with respect to the ability to realize nuevatel s net deferred tax assets concluding that they are no longer more likely than not to be realized on the basis of this evaluation management recorded a full valuation allowance against nuevatel s net deferred tax asset balance in 2020 and has continued to maintain a full reserve through december 31 2021 management will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods as it relates to nuevatel s long lived assets including property and equipment license costs and other intangible assets and operating lease right of use assets the company monitors and assesses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an affected asset group may not be recoverable this evaluation of long lived assets is performed at the nuevatel entity level which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified as disclosed in prior filings by the company nuevatel s financial performance during the second half of 2021 was expected to be pivotal to management s continuing evaluation of facts and circumstances in this regard amidst the ongoing impact of covid 19 on the local economy nuevatel did not meet management s expectations regarding recovery of its business and financial performance during the third quarter of 2021 particularly considering the sequential quarters of negative adjusted ebitda during a period when management expected a return to a positive trajectory as a result expectations regarding nuevatel s long term financial performance were revised to reflect these changes in facts and circumstances due to these and other changes in events and circumstances for nuevatel the company tested the long lived assets of nuevatel the asset group in the third quarter of 2021 for recoverability and impairment in evaluating long lived assets for recoverability the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group are compared to the carrying value of the asset group if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value considering external market participant assumptions the company performed a recoverability test during the third quarter of 2021 using management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows and determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable accordingly the company determined an estimated fair value of the asset group and related long lived assets using a combination of valuation techniques including i a discounted cash flow method which estimates the amount and timing of net future cash flows and discounts them using a risk adjusted rate of interest ii a guideline public company method using observable public company valuation information and iii a transaction based method using observable valuations of recent merged or acquired companies in the telecommunications industry the fair values of the long lived assets included within the asset group were further determined using various valuation techniques applied by asset type including observed market sales of similar assets and consideration of liquidation values and economic obsolescence factors as a result of estimating the fair value of the asset group and comparing amounts to their carrying value the company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of 113 8 million during the year ended december 31 2021 the impairment was allocated to long lived assets in the following amounts 42 2 million to property and equipment 48 5 million to operating lease right of use assets 18 8 million to license costs and other intangible assets and 4 3 million to other assets these impairment charges were included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income the pre tax impairment charge resulted in a 28 5 million deferred tax asset which was offset by a full valuation allowance and a 5 2 million tax benefit as a result of the reduction to the company s deferred tax liability for nuevatel s unrepatriated earnings nuevatel has maintained adequate cash liquidity to date in part due to cash management efforts since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic resulting in 17 5 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december 31 2021 as an additional measure to preserve liquidity and support the ability to generate future cash flows nuevatel implemented workforce reductions in the fourth quarter of 2020 with related cost reductions continuing through the year ended december 31 2021 although these initiatives have tempered the impact to date the prolonged effect of the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in increased liquidity and cash challenges for nuevatel regarding its ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due specifically forecasted cash resources may not be sufficient to fund certain obligations due in the first half of 2022 as management continues to address issues associated with meeting such financial obligations these actions are currently underway and include arranging extended payment terms with suppliers further controlling costs and further limiting capital expenditures if nuevatel is unable to complete the aforementioned activities to a sufficient degree nuevatel is projected to have a cash shortfall in the coming months and as early as may 2022 notwithstanding the above and as further discussed in note 20 subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements on march 28 2022 the company entered into an agreement for the transfer of its equity interests in nuevatel to a third party for a nominal purchase price closing is subject to bolivian regulatory review and approval unless such condition is waived by the purchaser the company will monitor the progress of the closing of the transaction and the related impact on the company s exposure to nuevatel s liquidity concerns over future periods there is no certainty that the transaction will close or that nuevatel s liquidity concerns will be resolved consolidated financial results results of our business segments new zealand financial results revenues new zealand total revenues increased by 8 5 million or 6 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared

exchange fixed broadband service revenues increased by 2 1 million or 9 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 this increase was driven primarily by a 13 year over year growth in the fixed broadband

foreign currency exchange benefit of 0 4 million or 1 the 9 reported increase in segment adjusted ebitda for the three months ended december 31 2021 was primarily the result of the aforementioned increases in revenues partially offset by the following increases in operating expenses cost of service increased by 3 9 million or 11 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange cost of service

and marketing increased by 1 7 million or 11 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange sales and marketing costs increased 1 5 million or 9 primarily due to an increase in commissions expense as a result of higher amortization expense relating to incremental contract acquisition costs capitalized subsequent to december 31 2020 general and administrative increased by 4 9 million or 29 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange the increase was 4 7 million or 27 primarily due to higher legal and consulting costs related to 2degrees preparation of a planned public listing and equity issuance which were deferred as of september 30 2021 as well as transaction costs related to strategic activities upon the announcement of the 2degrees sale these costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2021 these costs of 6 0 million were removed from segment adjusted ebitda due to the nonrecurring nature capital expenditures capital expenditures increased by 1 7 million or 7 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to 5g network investments excluding the impact of foreign currency capital expenditures increased by 1 4 million or 6 bolivia financial results revenues bolivia total revenues declined by 8 2 million or 22 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to a decrease in service revenues of 7 3 million or 20 this decline in service revenues was primarily due to the economic impact of covid 19 as well as increased competition in the market and included a 3 8 million or 23 decline in postpaid revenues due to a 15 decrease in our postpaid subscriber base combined with a 12 decline in postpaid arpu prepaid service revenues decreased by 3 5 million or 20 primarily due to an 18 decline in prepaid arpu as a result of declining voice revenues as subscribers continued to shift from voice usage to data based voice applications coupled with a decline in the prepaid subscriber base segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda declined by 2 4 million for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in total revenues which was partially offset by a decline in operating expenses primarily due to the following cost of service declined by 3 4 million or 17 primarily due to a decrease in interconnection costs as a result of lower mobile traffic terminating outside of our network and lower transaction taxes primarily due to the decrease in revenues and subscribers sales and marketing decreased by 0 8 million or 12 primarily due to workforce reductions in the fourth quarter of 2020 with related cost reductions continuing through 2021 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in commissions expense due to an impairment charge of 0 7 million recorded in the quarter related to customer acquisition costs associated with disconnections of prepaid subscribers general and administrative declined by 0 8 million or 10 primarily due to a decrease in administrative taxes related to certain government regulated promotional activity additionally the workforce reductions in the fourth quarter of 2020 with related cost reductions continuing through 2021 also contributed to the decline and cost of equipment sales declined by 1 7 million or 75 primarily due to a decrease in the volume of handsets sold during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased by 5 1 million or 78 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 mainly due to investment in lte expansion sites which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020 and

of 0 1 million for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was due to changes in the trading price of the warrants depreciation amortization and accretion depreciation amortization and accretion declined 5 6 million or 21 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and was primarily due to lower asset base in bolivia

to the consolidated financial statements income tax expense income tax expense declined by 0 2 million or 3 for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily

of the impairment charge on the company s deferred tax liability in respect of nuevatel s unrepatriated earnings other other increased by 12 6 million for the three months ended december 31 2021

2023 the tisp 8 875 notes in the fourth quarter of 2021 see note 7 debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information in addition approximately 8 0 million of the increase was due to nonrecurring professional service costs in new zealand and at corporate headquarters associated with strategic transactions that were under consideration related to the 2degrees business in 2021 due to the nonrecurring nature of these expenses the total of approximately 8 0 million of these costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2021 were removed from adjusted ebitda these increases

certainty that the transaction will close or that nuevatel s liquidity concerns will be resolved due to liquidity issues as discussed in impact of covid 19 on our business above nuevatel has taken a number of actions to conserve cash several of these actions could increase nuevatel s exposure to regulatory enforcement actions or claims by contractual counterparties should it be in default in meeting its obligations under relevant lease service and supply agreements specifically nuevatel was obligated to prepay an annual spectrum usage fee of approximately 9 5 million to the autoridad de regulación y fiscalización de telecomunicaciones y transportes of bolivia the att bolivia s telecommunications regulator in january 2022 nuevatel paid 1 12 of the amount due advising the att that it would pay the balance in monthly installments over the course of 2022 the att objected to the prorated payment and may require that nuevatel be subject to 6 interest and a 10 penalty with respect to late payment of the spectrum fee however the att did not indicate that it would bring any enforcement action against nuevatel with respect to delinquent payments in 2022 nuevatel is also obligated to deploy 4g lte services by october 2022 in numerous municipalities where it does not yet have network infrastructure nuevatel anticipates that it will be delinquent in meeting this obligation and as a result could be fined approximately 0 2 million by the att the att also has the authority to institute license revocation proceedings in connection with a failure to initiate lte service in a timely fashion nuevatel has received no indication regarding the likelihood that the att would pursue a license revocation additionally since november 2021 nuevatel has deferred payments due under other contracts with various suppliers and vendors to date none of the counterparties to these contracts has asserted that nuevatel is in breach of its payment obligations finally should nuevatel need to reduce staff in order to manage ongoing operating expenses it will be required to pay certain retirement severance and accrued leave benefits to employees who are terminated nuevatel has reserved funds to cover these costs in the event that such termination liabilities are incurred the nuevatel bond debt with outstanding balance of 20 1 million as of december 31 2021 is subject to certain financial covenants including a debt service ratio as calculated under local accounting standards the debt service ratio becomes operative commencing with the first quarter of 2022 the company anticipates that the requirements under the debt service ratio covenant will not be met for the first quarter of 2022 the first period during which the covenant is operative if the covenant is breached nuevatel will have a 90 day grace period in which to remedy the breach or seek a waiver from the bondholders if nuevatel is not able to remedy the breach or obtain a waiver the bondholders will assemble following the 90 day grace period to determine the course of action regarding nuevatel s future obligations under the bonds none of tip inc or its subsidiaries other than nuevatel have

an extension of the maturity date of this obligation and as long as the company continues to hold an ownership interest in 2degrees the significant amounts due under the new zealand 2023 senior facilities agreement relative to the company s available liquid assets would raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern and to satisfy this obligation within one year from the date of this press release however as discussed above in march 2022 tip inc s shareholders approved the 2degrees sale to a third party acquiror in connection with the closing of the 2degrees sale the company and its retained consolidated subsidiaries would no longer have any obligation related to such facilities while the 2degrees sale is subject to final regulatory approval management s plans to complete the sale of 2degrees are considered probable to be completed based on the stage and status of the sale process as of the date of this press release and accordingly alleviates the substantial doubt regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern accordingly management believes that the anticipated cash proceeds from the 2degrees sale together with the company s working capital will be adequate to meet the company s requirements including funding of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the next twelve months following the date of this press release operating investing and financing activities operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities increased by 7 8 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 this change reflects various offsetting changes in working capital in 2021 compared to 2020 including among other changes lease incentives received in the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by 7 0 million of fees paid to third parties in connection with the exchange in june 2021 of the trilogy llc 2022 notes and a 6 2 million increase in interest paid net of capitalized interest primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of the tisp 10 0 notes during the fourth quarter of 2020 see note 7 debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information investing activities cash flow used in investing activities increased by 7 4 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 due to a 15 5 million increase in capital expenditures and aggregate payments of 6 7 million for spectrum licenses in 2021 including renewal of 2degrees 1800 and 2100 mhz spectrum holdings and the receipt in 2020 of 5 8 million in cash proceeds from the fourth and final closing of the nuevatel tower sale leaseback transaction these changes were partially offset by 10 0 million of purchases of short term investments in 2020 and related 10 0 million in maturities and sales of short term investments in 2021 financing activities cash flow used in financing activities increased by 68 3 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 this change was primarily due to a 76 8 million reduction in proceeds from debt net of payments including proceeds in 2020 from the issuance of 50 million of senior secured notes by tisp and proceeds of 35 1 million from the new zealand 2023 senior facilities agreement these changes were partially offset by a 6 0 million decline in dividends paid to noncontrolling interests in 2021 compared to 2020 guidance performance against full year guidance the following table presents the company s full year 2021 guidance and actual results our new zealand business met our 2021 guidance for service revenues and exceeded our 2021 guidance for adjusted ebitda the service revenues growth was primarily driven by subscriber growth including postpaid and fixed broadband adjusted ebitda growth was driven by the higher service revenues along with higher margins as the company continued to benefit from increased scale and operating efficiencies guidance for capital intensity core capital expenditures as a percentage of service revenues for new zealand in 2021 was expected to be in the low 20s actual capital intensity for new zealand in 2021 was 19 3 as a result of the impact of labor and supply chain constraints due to the covid 19 pandemic in bolivia as the operating environment was uncertain due to the covid 19 pandemic guidance for 2021 was not provided however an improvement that was expected in operating and financial metrics over the course of the fiscal year did not occur due to these and other changes in events and circumstances for nuevatel the company tested the long lived assets of nuevatel in the third quarter of 2021 for recoverability and impairment resulting in an impairment charge in the amount of 113 8 million during the year ended december 31 2021 full year 2022 guidance based on the 2degrees sale which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022 we will not be issuing 2022 guidance for either of our operating segments non gaap measures and other financial measures basis of presentation in managing our business and assessing our financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements presented in accordance with u s gaap with several customer focused performance metrics and non u s gaap financial measures which are utilized by our management to evaluate our performance although we believe these measures are widely used in the wireless industry some may not be defined by us in precisely the same way as by other companies in the wireless industry so there may not be reliable ways to compare us to other companies adjusted ebitda represents net loss the most directly comparable u s gaap measure excluding amounts for income tax expense benefit interest expense depreciation amortization and accretion equity based compensation recorded as a component of general and administrative expense loss on disposal of assets and sale leaseback transaction and all other non operating income and expenses adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are common measures of operating performance in the telecommunications industry we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful measures because they allow us to evaluate our performance by removing from our operating results items that do not relate to our core operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under u s gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss the most directly comparable u s gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies unless the definition is the same reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin other information consolidated financial results quarterly summary tip inc s operating results may vary from quarter to quarter because of changes in general economic conditions seasonal

apple is developing its own payment processing technology and infrastructure for future financial products part of an ambitious effort that would reduce its reliance on outside partners over time according to people with knowledge of the matter a multiyear plan would bring a wide range of financial tasks in house said the people who asked not to be identified because the plans aren t public that includes payment processing risk assessment for lending fraud analysis credit checks and additional customer service functions such as the handling of disputes the effort is focused on future products rather than apple s current lineup of services still the news sent shares of corecard and green dot two of apple s existing partners down more than 10 apiece on wednesday goldman sachs another key partner slipped as much as 1 2 the push would turn the company into a bigger force in financial services building on a lineup that already includes an apple branded credit card peer to peer payments the wallet app and a mechanism for merchants to accept credit cards from an iphone chris ratcliffe bloomberg apple is also working on its own subscription service for hardware and a buy now pay later feature for apple pay transactions bloomberg has reported the company is unveiling streaming video and news subscriptions key parts of apple s push to transform itself into a leading digital services provider part of the project has been dubbed breakout internally underscoring the idea of breaking away from the existing financial system according to the people a representative for cupertino california based apple declined to comment on the plans the apple card currently uses corecard as its core processor overseeing the process of sending transaction details to a bank for approval the credit card relies on goldman sachs for other components like lending some customer service tasks and credit checks as well as the handling of transaction and payment histories what s known as a ledger those partners are likely to remain on board for current products apple shares briefly gained on the news but slipped back down to a decline of about 0 4 as of 2 25 p m in new york the stock had posted increases 11 days in a row before wednesday marking its longest streak since 2003 affirm holdings meanwhile fell as much as 4 5 before trimming some of the loss that company offers its own buy now pay later service technology how amazon apple facebook google are infiltrating financial services these tech titans still depend on banks to back their payment cards and loans but their vast audiences mean any financial product they offer is a competitive threat apple s project represents its biggest foray yet into the world of finance and it may not be an easy task other technology companies including facebook parent meta platforms and alphabet s google have taken on ambitious financial projects only to scale them back that included meta s development of its own digital coin and google s plan for bank accounts but apple has a head start in the form of its payment service launched in 2014 apple pay has become an important part of the company s services business which now generates almost 70 billion a year the group is run by jennifer bailey a longtime apple executive who previously ran the company s online store financial services help keep users glued to their iphones and generate revenue from interest and transaction fees that s why the company wants greater control over the process letting it roll out new options more quickly and potentially collect more revenue it also may help apple expand future services to additional countries though apple pay is available in more than 70 countries services such as peer to peer payments the apple card and the apple cash card remain u s only partners such as corecard and green dot are focused on the u s limiting apple s ability to grow last week apple acquired the u k based startup credit kudos ltd which uses bank data to make lending decisions the company will likely tap that technology to help build its own infrastructure as part of the initiative apple is developing its own processing system that it aims to use instead of corecard it s also creating tools for calculating interest rewards approving transactions contacting and reporting data to credit bureaus accepting or rejecting applications based on its own risk assessments determining and increasing credit limits and handling transaction histories the first product that will rely on the new system is expected to be the upcoming buy now pay later service that feature called apple pay later internally will have two parts apple pay in 4 for short term four installment payment plans without interest and apple pay monthly installments for long term payment plans with interest apple is discussing using the in house technology for the four installment plan apple would continue to work with goldman sachs on the longer term installment offering which will also have a higher maximum lending amount the company is considering additional partners beyond goldman sachs as well letting it offer competing plans with different interest rates and payoff deadlines moving to an in house payment processor would be a significant undertaking for apple and while development has advanced the company has faced some hurdles and could ultimately delay its plans or in a very unlikely scenario choose to remain with partners apple has also discussed becoming the lender for the more basic of the buy now pay later services as well as its future hardware subscription plan few companies can match apple s financial resources it had more than 200 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the last quarter and generated almost 95 billion in profit during the last fiscal year if apple were to become the financier it would probably focus on fairly low transaction amounts in the low hundreds of dollars and target users with high credit scores in this scenario the company may also require the use of debit cards which are less risky for buy now pay later lenders than credit cards the company s in house risk assessment engine would take into account consumers history as apple customers such as if they have routinely paid off purchases or ever had their credit card attached to itunes or the app store declined but even if future products don t rely on partners such as goldman sachs corecard and green dot the company doesn t have near term plans to drop those firms from current offerings including the apple card and apple cash card though the tech giant plans to handle credit checks itself for apple pay later it will still use existing credit bureaus to generate scores the company already

electric vehicle charging infrastructure and building out the province s ev battery supply chain quebec will be reducing the incentives for new battery electric vehicles bevs to 7 000 from 8 000 and to 3 500 from 4 000 for used bevs as of april 1 for new plug in hybrids the government previously provided rebates calculated based on the capacity of the battery the amounts available ranged from 500 to 8 000 now the rebates have dropped to a maximum of 5 000 according to the budget document the changes in the subsidies are meant to reflect the reduction in additional costs of electric vehicles on the market relative to comparable internal combustion models while encouraging the acquisition of vehicles with greater electric range and ghg emission reduction potential the province s ev rebates are part of its roulez v ert program which includes a number of actions aimed at encouraging drivers to buy electric cars quebec s goal is to get 1 5 million more evs on the road by 2030 electrification and climate change support funds will pay for the continued rebate program until 2026 2027 holistic decarbonization in an effort to further quebec s 6 7 billion 2030 plan for a green economy launched in 2020 the government is earmarking an additional nearly 1 billion in this budget on top of the original amount to be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions bringing the total amount allocated for the climate plan to 7 6 billion that money will largely come from revenue from the carbon market quebec operates on a cap and trade system reads the budget report and the breakdown of total funding allocation will now be in large part 3 5 billion for the transportation sector 1 3 billion for the industrial sector and 758 million for the building sector moreover just over 1 4 billion will be invested in initiatives with other objectives than that of reducing ghg emissions such as adapting to climate change reads the report other significant investments include 152 million to be spent in the energy transition with 100 million going toward the first green hydrogen and bioenergy strategy in quebec and 52 million going toward redesigning biofuel tax credits the government has embarked on a transition aimed at giving greater priority to the use of various renewable energies over the coming years green hydrogen and bioenergy will play an increasing role in the decarbonization of certain industrial sectors said eric girard quebec s minister of finance during the budget speech we have diversified resources and renewable electricity at a very competitive cost quebec therefore has the assets required to develop these energy transition sectors on its territory additionally the budget will be allocating funding to bolster both montreal and quebec city s municipal climate plans as well montreal will get 117 2 million over the next two years to help combat climate change measures part of the money will go toward installing 800 public charging stations promoting carbon neutrality in the municipal building stock by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy and lowering greenhouse gas emissions as well as other green infrastructure initiatives meanwhile quebec city will get 49 million to help advance the rollout of its public charging station network by installing 95 new stations and encouraging the decarbonization of city buildings critical and strategic minerals building on the government s 2020 launch of a plan for the development of critical and strategic minerals 2020 2025 the new budget pledges 15 million over the next three years to directly accelerate the completion of mineral projects in quebec and promote the development of the energy transition in renewable energy and battery manufacturing we all know the importance of certain critical and strategic minerals in the manufacturing of many goods such as electric car batteries said girard the quebec plan for the development of critical and strategic minerals 2020 2025 will help make quebec a leader in the processing and recycling of these minerals an investment of 15 million over three years will enhance the piloting and demonstration of processes for developing these minerals an additional 7 5 million will go towards increasing research and partnerships about sustainability in the mining sector as well as support site restoration finally the line item development of critical and strategic minerals and innovation in the mining sector in the supporting research and innovation section of the budget will receive an as yet undisclosed portion of the 1 5 billion earmarked in the budget to go towards the development of new technologies in the province b c cuts sale tax on used evs quebec s budget follows the release of british columbia s provincial budget last month in that document the b c government added 1 2 billion in funding to its original 2 3 billion investment in the cleanbc climate action plan program now a total of 3 5 billion including 125 million over the next three years to advance cleaner transportation electric vehicles are another example of how we are making climate smart decisions more affordable b c leads north america in the transition to electric vehicles to build on this momentum budget 2022 will continue the popular go electric program and to make used evs even more affordable we are going to remove the pst said selina robinson b c s finance minister at the budget speech in addition b c s go electric program will be getting a cash infusion of 79 million to continue providing rebates for electric vehicle charging systems fund hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and support commercial vehicle pilot projects reads the budget report the budget also outlines that bc hydro will now be taking up the responsibility from b c s ministry of energy mines and low carbon innovation to fund and administrate go electric s light duty vehicle rebates program bc hydro will use revenue from selling low carbon fuel standard credits to fund the rebate program since credit prices can be flexible each year depending on the market the total funding for the program will vary each year however it is estimated at 249 million over three years and finally another 7 million will be given to developing a clean transportation action plan that will outline specific actions to reduce emissions in the transportation sector in b c while 30 million will also be made available to municipalities wanting to build more bike lanes multi use pathways and other active transportation infrastructure editor s note this story was revised to clarify that b c s removal of sales tax only applies to used evs

limitations did not extinguish a party s right to arbitrate the history and text of 5 101 of the courts article confirm that it does not apply to the remedy for enforcing the contractual right to

but not legally inconsistent the circuit court did not err in accepting the jury s verdicts williams v state no 37 sept term 2021 filed march 25 2022 evidence regulatory violation where the code of maryland regulations requires an individual who is to be given a breath test to be observed for at least 20 minutes before the sample is taken an alleged lack of compliance with this requirement goes to the weight to be afforded breath test results by the trier of fact not to their admissibility dejarnette v state no 41 sept term 2021 filed march 25 2022 u s court of appeals for the 4th circuit constitutional religious zoning regulations bottom line where a church was aware of zoning restrictions when it purchased property it could not have had a reasonable expectation of religious land use dooming its claim under the religious land use and institutionalized persons act or rluipa and because the land use restrictions were rationally related to the government s interest in protecting the region s watershed the church s free exercise claim was rejected case canaan christian church v montgomery county maryland case no 20 2185 filed march 22 2022 judges king thacker judge richardson concurs facts in this case the court addresses whether montgomery county its council and its chief executive complied with the religious land use and institutionalized persons act or rluipa and the free exercise clause of the first amendment when it denied water and sewer category change requests or wsccrs submitted on behalf of canaan christian church when canaan sought to purchase and develop five neighboring pieces of land from the landowners the district court denied appellants motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to appellees law the court utilizes a two step analysis to determine whether or not a substantial burden is imposed 1 whether the impediment to the organization s religious practice is substantial and 2 whether the government or the religious organization is responsible for the impediment there is undisputed evidence of an unmet religious need the burdens described by appellants are an overcrowded facility the need for multiple services to accommodate the number of members and a lack of space for programs and it is uncontested that if canaan wishes to build a church of this size with public sewer access it would need to find a different property however appellants have not presented evidence that the restriction on religious use is absolute to the contrary the county indicated during and after its review of the canaan wsccrs that alternatives might have been more successful nonetheless appellants argue the restriction on religious use in this case is absolute despite the fact that the county considered and approved a smaller facility serviced by septic on the property the fact that there are practical and legal restrictions preventing a larger development on the property does not amount to a rluipa substantial burden violation therefore appellants do not demonstrate that they satisfy the first step in the analysis appellants also cannot demonstrate they had a reasonable expectation of religious land use because appellants knowingly entered into a contingent sale agreement for property that was expressly excluded from receiving public sewer access under the master plan they could not have had a reasonable expectation of the county approving their wsccrs for public sewer access the eleventh circuit has held that plaintiff bringing an as applied equal terms challenge must present evidence that a similarly situated nonreligious comparator received differential treatment under the challenged regulation this similarly situated nonreligious comparator analysis has been favored by several other circuits with most holding that a comparator for an equal terms claim must be similarly situated with regard to the regulation at issue the court finds this reasoning persuasive appellants fail to identify a comparator subject to the bcnp that was treated more favorably than canaan the history of denied or deferred wsccrs for both religious and secular developments on the property demonstrate the county s consistency in applying the master plan when reviewing applications for water and sewer extensions the bcnp is facially neutral and generally applicable and appellants fail to offer evidence that the county had a discriminatory motive that would trigger strict scrutiny therefore rational basis is the appropriate level of review here appellants have not shown that bcnp is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest to the contrary as the district court concluded the county s plan to protect the sensitive tributary headwaters which originate in the is a legitimate interest and the bcnp furthers that interest by restricting development to prevent damage to the watershed thus the county s actions withstand rational basis review affirmed concur i write separately for two reasons first to point out a few minor concerns with the majority s reading of the equal terms provision of the riulpa second to expand on judge thacker s free exercise analysis because i believe there is a complication that makes this a closer question than it may at first seem neither difference changes my view of the outcome and i agree that all of canaan s claims were properly dismissed maryland court of appeals administrative successor beer manufacturer bottom line where blue ribbon llc purchased pabst brewing company but neither blue ribbon nor its shareholder held any right to sell distribute or import any of the pabst beer brands in maryland blue ribbon was not a successor beer manufacturer under maryland s successor manufacturers law case pabst brewing company v frederick p winner ltd no 8 sept term 2021 filed march 25 2022 judges getty mcdonald watts hotten booth biran wilner facts under maryland s successor manufacturers law or sml a beer manufacturer generally may not terminate or refuse to renew a contract with a distributor without cause an exception exists where a successor beer manufacturer inherits a contract between a beer brand s previous manufacturer and the brand s distributor in that scenario the successor beer manufacturer may elect to terminate the contract without cause in which case the distributor is entitled to receive the fair market value of the terminated distribution rights in 1994 pabst brewing company began a contractual relationship with frederick p winner ltd under which winner and its predecessor entity distributed pabst beer brands in maryland in 2014 blue ribbon llc purchased 100 percent of the stock of pabst s parent entity in 2015 pabst terminated its contract with winner pabst claimed that winner s termination was permitted under the sml winner disputed that contention and sued pabst the circuit court agreed with pabst that blue ribbon was a successor beer manufacturer under the sml and that blue ribbon therefore was permitted to cause pabst to terminate its contract with winner without cause the court of special appeals disagreed with the circuit court s reading of the sml law the sml provides that a uccessor beer manufacturer includes a person or license holder who replaces a beer manufacturer with the right to sell distribute or import a brand of beer winner argues that the plain language of the sml requires the replacement of an existing beer manufacturer by another as the holder of the state issued license or permit that allows the beer manufacturer to sell distribute or import a brand of beer in maryland pabst disagrees contending that the sml plainly encompasses the situation where a change of corporate control of a beer manufacturer occurs but where no entity replaces the beer manufacturer as the holder of a state issued license or permit with respect to a beer brand we agree with winner the key phrases in 5 201 a 5 are replaces a beer manufacturer and with the right to sell distribute or import a brand of beer the verb replace means to take the place of especially as a substitute or successor or to put something new in the place of thus the plain language of 5 201 a 5 contemplates that a successor beer manufacturer takes the place of an existing beer manufacturer and the legislative history of the sml confirms winner s interpretation of the statutory language pabst makes several arguments in support of an alternative interpretation of the meaning of a successor beer manufacturer that turns on a person s or entity s control of a license or permit holder none are persuasive rather adopting pabst s interpretation of the sml would lead to confusion and would be inconsistent with settled principles of corporate law these consequences further convince us that winner s interpretation of the sml is consistent with legislative intent here mr kashper the majority owner of blue ribbon caused blue ribbon to purchase 100 percent of pabst holdings which in turn owns the membership interests in pabst however mr kashper does not personally own pabst s assets nor does he personally hold any right to sell distribute or import any of the pabst beer brands in maryland the same is true for blue ribbon both before and after the sale of pabst holdings from pch to blue ribbon pabst was a distinct legal entity separate from its shareholders it follows that neither mr kashper nor blue ribbon qualifies as a successor beer manufacturer under the sml because they were not successor beer manufacturers mr kashper and blue ribbon lacked the right to terminate pabst s agreement under the sml as such the maryland beer franchise fair dealing act prohibited pabst from terminating its agreement with winner without good cause the circuit court granted summary judgment to pabst based on the incorrect premise that blue ribbon replaced the old pabst brewing company and therefore qualified as a successor beer manufacturer under the sml accordingly the court of special appeals correctly reversed the circuit court s judgment and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion judgment of the court of special appeals affirmed arbitration statute of limitations bottom line where the parties agreed to arbitrate any disputes the expiration of the statute of limitations did not extinguish a party s right to arbitrate the history and text of 5 101 of the courts article confirm that it does not apply to the remedy for enforcing the contractual right to arbitrate case park plus inc v palisades of towson llc and encore development corp no 7 sept term 2021 filed march 25 2022 judges getty watts hotten booth biran gould raker facts in march 2009 park plus inc on the one hand and palisades of towson llc and encore development corp on the other hand executed a contract requiring park plus to furnish and install an electro mechanical parking system in a luxury apartment building owned by palisades in towson maryland the contract included a one year warranty period and contained an arbitration clause tenants began using the parking system in october 2010 problems arose immediately in september 2014 palisades sent a written arbitration demand to park plus as required by the contract palisades then submitted its claims to the project s architect who declined to participate within 30 days of the architect s refusal palisades again issued a written arbitration demand to park plus park plus showed a willingness to arbitrate but palisades filed a petition to compel arbitration in the circuit court that petition was later dismissed without prejudice for lack of service after more delays the parties agreed to appoint retired judge as their arbitrator more delays ensued ultimately in february 2016 palisades filed its second petition in the circuit court seeking an order enforcing the arbitration agreement park plus maintained that the three year statute of limitations provided under 5 101 of the courts article applied so that the petition was untimely the circuit court disagreed the arbitrator awarded 3 178 800 64 to palisades and 365 677 69 to park plus on its counterclaim the parties ultimately entered into a consent order under which an arbitration award in favor of palisades in the net amount of 2 813 122 95 was confirmed and a stay of entry of the judgment on the award was entered pending this appeal the court of special appeals affirmed the circuit court s order compelling arbitration law as park plus sees it if the contract is silent on the subject the statute of limitations under cj 5 101 steps into the void and extinguishes the right to arbitrate just as a contractual limitation provision would this proposition rests on a misunderstanding about the legal effect of statutes of limitations statutes of limitations have historically been considered procedural not substantive defenses and are generally understood to extinguish the remedy for enforcing a right not the right itself so if park plus and palisades had not included the arbitration provision in the contract then palisades could have filed a complaint seeking monetary damages in the circuit court instead of a petition to compel arbitration in that scenario the statute of limitations could have extinguished the remedy of a circuit court action resulting in its dismissal but because the parties did include an arbitration provision and given the limited nature of our role the only substantive right we are concerned with here is the contractual right to arbitrate based on our traditional understanding of statutes of limitations the expiration of the statute of limitations did not extinguish palisades right to arbitrate the history and text of cj 5 101 confirm that it does not apply to the remedy for enforcing the contractual right to arbitrate park plus argues if we don t apply the statute of limitations to a petition to compel arbitration we would be re writing the parties agreement to include a statute of limitations waiver where none exists and to delete the contract s choice of law provision requiring application of maryland law we disagree when park plus and palisades executed the contract with a binding arbitration clause they agreed to the limitations imposed by maryland law on the nature and scope of the court s involvement over arbitrable disputes when faced with a petition to compel arbitration the court s only function is to decide whether an agreement to arbitrate the dispute exists and if so to enforce it with an order compelling arbitration also cj 5 101 applies only to civil actions at law therefore it does not apply to petitions to compel arbitration thus our holding honors the parties agreement and applies maryland law precisely as the general assembly intended park plus contends that the circuit court s decision presented the arbitrator with confusing guidance that created the impression that the had decided any substantive statute of limitations issue as a result park plus maintains that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded maryland law or erred by refusing to consider park plus s statute of limitations defense park plus also asserts other defects in the proceedings before the arbitrator as well as in the circuit court s ultimate confirmation of the arbitrator s award none of those issues however are properly before us as this matter comes to us on an appeal from the order compelling arbitration judgment of the court of special appeals affirmed criminal inconsistent verdicts bottom line where a jury s verdicts were factually inconsistent but not legally inconsistent the circuit court did not err in accepting the jury s verdicts case williams v state no 37 sept term 2021 filed march 25 2022 judges getty watts hotten biran wilner judges mcdonald and booth concur facts the state charged nicholas jabbar williams with first degree premeditated murder of cameron marcel townsend use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence murder first degree assault of townsend use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence first degree assault possession of a regulated firearm while under the age of 21 and wearing carrying or transporting a handgun in a vehicle the jury found williams guilty of second degree murder and possession of a regulated firearm while under the age of 21 and not guilty of first degree assault and use of firearm in the commission of a crime of violence second degree murder williams s counsel objected on the ground that the guilty verdict as to second degree murder was legally inconsistent with the not guilty verdict as to first degree assault the circuit court accepted the jury s verdicts williams then filed a motion for a new trial contending that statements made by jurors after the jury had been dismissed indicated that the jury misinterpreted the jury instructions on second degree murder and other matters williams attached to the motion an affidavit signed by one of the jurors in this case the circuit court granted the state s motion to strike sealed the affidavit and denied the motion for a new trial the court of special appeals ordered a limited remand to the circuit court with instruction to determine whether a firearms examiner s report was admissible under rochkind v stevenson 471 md 1 2020 law we conclude that the guilty verdict as to second degree murder is not legally inconsistent with the not guilty verdicts as to first degree assault and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence because the jury instructions on the offenses at issue were correct and neither of the offenses at issue of which williams was acquitted is a lesser included offense of second degree murder it is undisputed that the jury instructions accurately conveyed the elements of all three of the relevant offenses the next step is to compare the elements of the offenses and resolve the question of whether under the required evidence test the offense of first degree assault where the modality of the commission of the offense is the use of a firearm or use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence is a lesser included offense of second degree murder the answer is no it is accurate that the verdicts in this case are factually inconsistent but that circumstance does not warrant reversal and instead reflects the role of the jury as the sole arbiter of factual disputes in a criminal jury trial the verdicts may represent nothing more than compromise or leniency we are aware that williams has contended that information provided by some of the jurors indicated that the jury misinterpreted the jury instructions on second degree murder and other matters i e that the reason for the factual inconsistency was a failure to follow the instructions as explained below however we will not invade the province of the jury by inquiring into its deliberations to ascertain the reason for a factual inconsistency that is permissible under our case law finally williams is mistaken in contending that the rule of lenity weighs in favor of vacating the conviction for second degree murder the rule of lenity is a potential ground on which an appellate court may vacate a sentence not a possible basis for an appellate court to reverse or vacate a conviction let alone to determine that verdicts are legally inconsistent the circuit court correctly granted the motion to strike statements by jurors referenced in the motion for a new trial and that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial none of the information attributed to the jurors involved allegations of racial bias or discrimination or the existence of external influences on the jury the post hoc information from jurors was clearly barred from being received by the circuit court under both the no impeachment rule and the plain language of maryland rule 5 606 b 1 and 2 williams contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the convictions for second degree murder and possession of a regulated firearm while under the age of 21 viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the challenged convictions judgment of the court of special appeals affirmed concur i would forgo the exercise of classifying allegedly inconsistent verdicts into abstract categories such as legally inconsistent factually inconsistent or another category with some similar label rather i would apply to that issue the analysis that the plurality opinion in state v stewart 464 md 296 2019 set forth that is whether the jury verdict on its face indicates that the jury failed to follow the trial court s proper instructions on the law governing the charged offenses evidence regulatory violation bottom line where the code of maryland regulations requires an individual who is to be given a breath test to be observed for at least 20 minutes before the sample is taken an alleged lack of compliance with this requirement goes to the weight to be afforded breath test results by the trier of fact not to their admissibility case dejarnette v state no 41 sept term 2021 filed march 25 2022 judges getty mcdonald watts hotten booth biran facts in maryland when a law enforcement officer has reason to believe that the driver of a motor vehicle is under the influence of alcohol the officer may ask the driver to take a breath test there are regulations governing the procedures for administering a breath test for alcohol among other things code of maryland regulations or comar 10 35 02 08g provides that an individual who is to be given a breath test must be observed for at least 20 minutes before the sample is taken in this case the state charged alexander dejarnette with four counts related to driving under the influence of alcohol prior to trial dejarnette filed a motion in limine to exclude the results of a breath test arguing that the 20 minute observation period had not been complied with the circuit court denied the motion dejarnette appealed contending that the circuit court erred in admitting the results of the breath test the court of special appeals held that the circuit court did not err and affirmed the circuit court s judgment law exclusion of breath test results is tied to compliance with statutory requirements not regulatory requirements the statutes and in particular cj 10 309 a 1 ii the provision which sets forth the exclusionary rule make no reference whatsoever to comar regulations or any compliance with them nothing in the statutory scheme indicates that the breath test results are not admissible for lack of strict compliance with the regulations in fact nothing in any of the statutes in subtitle three includes a requirement of strict compliance with comar regulations for admissibility of breath test results or a requirement of a 20 minute observation period prior to the administration of a breath test this is telling because the statutes demonstrate that the general assembly knows how to impose and has imposed a time requirement related to the admissibility of breath test results by its plain language the exclusionary rule set forth in cj 10 309 a 1 ii does not operate to exclude evidence of a breath test that may have been obtained contrary to the provisions of the comar regulations we decline to read into cj 10 309 a 1 ii the requirement that breath test results are not admissible if obtained contrary to the provisions of comar regulations where neither the controlling statutes nor the relevant comar regulation contains an exclusionary rule and where the fourth amendment exclusionary rule is not applicable there is no general exclusionary rule in maryland that would provide for the suppression of evidence in a criminal case for a violation of the maryland laws that are at issue in this matter given the absence of an applicable exclusionary rule we like the court of special appeals hold that an alleged lack of compliance with the 20 minute observation period set forth in comar 10 35 02 08g goes to the weight to be afforded breath test results by the trier of fact not to their admissibility we are unpersuaded by dejarnette s argument that the breath test results were inadmissible under maryland rule 5 403 due to a risk of unfair prejudice we are also not convinced that case law from other jurisdictions relied on by dejarnette compels a contrary result because we hold that alleged noncompliance with the 20 minute observation period goes to the weight of the evidence rather than to the admissibility of breath test results and dejarnette has raised no meaningful allegation as to any irregularity having occurred during the observation period we need not necessarily address whether the record in this case demonstrates that the officers complied with the observation period even so we conclude that the record supports a finding that the officers complied with the 20 minute observation period and we determine that the circuit court found on the record that the officers complied with the requirements of the applicable comar regulation judgment of the court of special appeals affirmed

yesterday as tuesday but the sector contributions were much the same as well on tuesday we pre learned of a 420 tax offset in the budget which sent anything impacting the consumer on a run while yesterday we responded to the 22c per litre fuel excise cut which had much the same effect of course the tax offset is a one off and the excise cut is only for six months gotta love a goodie bag energy 0 8 and materials 0 3 were again the only sectors to close in the red as commodity prices eased on russia s intentions to scale back its military operations to the east of ukraine that will all change today as russia has done nothing of the sort and base metal prices have all jumped back strongly iron ore and gold are slightly higher and the oils are up 2 technology again posted the biggest percentage gain yesterday 3 8 on a 1 8 gain for the nasdaq overnight but last night the nasdaq fell 1 2 and block in particular dropped 4 6 as apple seeks to cut its grass having risen 2 1 on tuesday consumer discretionary rose another 1 2 yesterday but the most notable consecutive gain was in the reits they rose 1 1 on tuesday and another 1 0 yesterday despite almost all of them going ex dividend ur westfield urw made the top five winners board with a 6 0 gain while healthcare also put in a repeat performance 1 4 industrials 1 3 and utilities 1 0 decided to join in yesterday having been left behind on tuesday having risen 0 5 on tuesday the banks rose 0 9 yesterday despite aussie bonds yields falling around 10 basis points across the curve more money in consumers pockets can only be a good thing but also the two years and ten years each fell 10 points after solid us inspired run ups of late so no shift in the curve incidentally as wall street watches nervously for the us two ten spread to invert last night 3 points the aussie equivalent is 100 points no recession in sight here at the individual stock level nothing much new outside of ur westfield and a 5 7 gain for domino s pizza dmp given 420 will buy a lot of extra toppings the usual names were in play the losers board was again full of miners representing all of gold coal and lithium and in south32 s s32 case most everything else as noted commodity prices have returned to strength overnight thus while the s p500 fell 0 6 and the nasdaq 1 2 our futures are up 10 points this morning note that the asx200 is only 75 points below its starting point for 2022 note also that today is the last day of the march quarter so we could see some non fundamental volatility as books are squared one way or the other russian roulette while the response from the us to russia s suggestion it will consolidate its efforts to the east was one of we ll believe when we see it wall street was not going to take any chances on tuesday night given if it proved to be true stocks would soar it s not the shells were still flying all about the place last night so wall street pulled back again but it was hardly dramatic the dow was down 170 points at its low before the usual late burst had it down only 65 nor does wall street seem concerned about yield curve inversion unless traders have decided the inversion point would provide a good excuse to take profits last night the two ten was hanging in there at 3 points the us private sector added 455 000 jobs in march according to adp just to add to the strong economy theme but it was not market moving given economists had forecast 450 000 history shows that every us recession since the war has been signalled by yield curve inversion but not every yield curve inversion has led to a recession moreover the average move in the s p500 between inversion and recession noting recession needs two negative growth quarters to confirm is a 19 gain if you sold on inversion in 1988 you missed 34 and in 1998 you missed 39 so no one s overly fussed and nor will they be fussed when the fed hikes 50 points in may the question remains as to whether the rally back from the depths can run further or run out of steam notwithstanding last night s minor dip note that while the asx200 needs only a 1 gain to be up on 2022 the s p500 still needs 4 2 it will no doubt come down to us

i never liked tesla s ceo i don t even have an ev yet but these two facts never got in the way of acknowledging what the american carmaker has meant for the world since its inception and what brilliant ceo it has now it s time for everyone to understand that tesla is probably going to rule the auto industry soon here s how it might happen ev tesla s big push the final blow get it done mr elon musk kept his true nature intact when he was met with the world the real one the man didn t change for the stage nor did he ever try to be or become someone else just for the sake of money or international fame the sec the tesla board politicians activists investors customers other public authorities nobody managed to make this businessman flinch he is who he is most importantly he managed to survive everything the entrepreneurial world had to throw at him this doesn t mean elon musk is a saint or some kind of savior no he s a successful businessman he got in a fight with a very conservative industry threw everything he got at it and managed to rise to the top this is something that most of us will never achieve it requires personal sacrifice incredible determination and a very keen sense of humor after all nobody can refuse laughter in the face of danger or failure while he s the most easily identifiable tesla figure we should also give props to those that helped elon musk in his endeavors including the first two co founders what this americanmaker achieved is not something that can be done alone or with just a few partners and several employees the success of this now global brand is something that everyone shares from customers and investors to enemies and taxpayers how this sharing is done well that s a topic of discussion for some other time it s hard to summarize so briefly this man s impact on the auto industry furthermore we can just imagine what he ll be able to do with spacex at the least he could open new doors for space exploration and cement america s global role in this soon to be vital sector let s just agree he s done a lot and we should be grateful he s still sane a couple of memes and some cryptocurrency tweets didn t and won t hurt anybody you might wonder now why this piece about tesla s journey to undeniable success started with praise for elon musk and those that believed in him well it was done for a very simple reason before i became a journalist i read and saw how the media treated this man he was mocked belittled accused of crazy things and was always put in the spotlight for something weird the public was rarely able to learn something useful about tesla s ceo his business oriented mind however never betrayed him legacy automakers laughed at tesla and its all electric cars a couple of years later they started buying carbon credits from the same company now everyone s looking to beat or be better than tesla the tables have indeed turned while ford might have a chance at competing with musk s company thanks to its f series trucks europeans are lagging that may be why mercedes benz and bmw are already trying things out with hydrogen not because they like it very much but they fear what the ev battle for resources might mean for their survival and here shines tesla once again because it already decided what it wants to be just today we found out the ev maker closed a secret deal for nickel with a mining company from brazil this is extremely important the demand for all electric cars has skyrocketed across the globe and tesla wants to make its customers around the planet happy with more deliveries the chances to have more orders increase furthermore musk and his team knew very well not to trust russia which is the world s largest nickel producer they ve weaponized natural gas nothing will stop them from using the same tactics on something similar in the future this month we ve also learned that tesla is accumulating cash at a faster pace than its ability to grow physically remember when cashflow problems were all the media reported about tesla so for now we know a couple of things musk is a great businessman and a good leader tesla is doing more than fine and is growing rapidly its competitors are struggling and the carmaker wants to do even more than it currently can enter master plan part 3 there s no need to speculate about what elon musk might be thinking or preparing right now scaling to extreme size sounds fun and a little bit menacing but let s talk facts and try to guess the next all important move tesla s ceo might ve announced on twitter that he s ready to take the company to the next level but here s what will give it the best shot at doing that it s not a marketing stunt a new car or another plant it s far more important than this adam jonas is the head of morgan stanley s auto and space research according to his briefing about what tesla s plans are we should get ready to witness a major victory for the ev era if this will be done right then musk s company will easily become the number one auto manufacturer if you re thinking about the newly requested stock split right now too then we re on the same page things click together right about now don t they jonas argues the master plan part 3 will include a huge change regarding the ev supply chain he says that the next winners will be those with the ability to buy the commodities in the highest volume and be guaranteed supply with unlimited capital being a critical ingredient essentially this means that companies must get their hands on raw materials fast easily and for the right price if they want to succeed tesla perfectly fits this description and looks as ready as ever to seize this opportunity if you ve been around for longer than me then you might remember ford s adventures in south america the company wanted to secure its own resources and heavily invested in developing entire villages close to mines or around forests fordlandia was just a preview for what s to come now pushing for manufacturing evs without delays and with costs under control blue oval city appeared the 11 4 billion investment will help ford in dealing with its aspirations as an ev maker the company s ceo even said that solving this issue must happen as soon as possible because we don t have much time and boy was he right with the brazilian deal in place and prices of lithium skyrocketing tesla is now looking forward to securing its own raw materials for batteries the key to long term success having the funds ready and an important partner that might be willing to let go of its operations elon musk is on track to become the one who signs the contract of the decade albemarle is the world s largest lithium producer and is already working with tesla it will surely be asked to give in to what the american carmakers want because it makes the most sense right now why not join forces with your biggest client there s nothing to lose knowing how the american manufacturer is doing business nowadays a transaction like this would be of no surprise i would even go as far as saying that it is most likely already in the works having a secure supply chain and cheap raw materials will turn any ev maker into an almost instant champion with albemarle having mines or processing plants on every continent except africa integrating it into tesla s own corporate group is a no brainer as of now albemarle doesn t want to give more of its products to tesla as with any other business out there it s in its best interest to have a diversified customer portfolio but musk s company is pushing to ensure its own success so the lithium provider might soon become a part of the global transformation of personal transport if tesla pulls this off then it will become unbeatable not only will it offer better priced cars after securing much cheaper raw materials for batteries but it will also choose who gets leftovers from them it will be fantastic to witness how the american carmaker will transform itself and the whole industry that being said you should bear in mind this is not confirmed this transaction might happen or it might not even get to the negotiation phase if this scenario goes as expected then get ready for the battle that ll make automated driving and artificial intelligence the most important things a carmaker would like to have tesla has already harnessed enough data from its customers and it collects more of it as each day passes elon musk will most likely get his much wanted crown which will sit nicely on tesla he never liked to show off anyway
the platform yanked 100 indian based accounts for pro russian sentiment pro russian twitter accounts in india have been suspended for apparent coordinated inauthentic behavior after posting messages supportive of russia s military offensive in ukraine the new york times reported twitter suspended more than 100 accounts following research published by marc owen jones at qatar s hamad bin khalifa university and director graham brookie of the pro nato atlantic council s digital forensic research lab the times itself admitted however that there was no hard evidence are part of a coordinated influence campaign aimed at shifting sentiment about the war in ukraine the paper also pointed out that india s government has maintained a neutral policy toward the war thus far and a twitter spokeswoman claimed the company was still investigating the platform acknowledged in a recent blog post that it has deleted 75 000 accounts for violation of their platform manipulation and spam policy since the war in ukraine began those accounts are not thought to represent a specific coordinated campaign associated with a government actor jones highlighted alleged suspicious behavior among those indian accounts promoting the russian government s view on the war including accounts using stock photos in profiles and gaining plentiful likes and retweets despite few followers the profiles had also used the istandwithputin hashtag it s unclear how many of the accounts belonged to real people but some of them most likely were real jones said if you can get enough people spreading a message then real people will join in he told the times brookie noted the longstanding and deep security and economic relations between india and russia saying moscow would be looking to countries like india to abstain from international efforts to isolate it after an indian student was killed in ukraine during the fighting earlier this month some of the 20 000 indian citizens struggling to escape were reportedly subjected to racism as ukrainians at the border refused to allow them on trains and buses headed for safety telling them they would have to walk reports that may have added fuel to anti ukrainian or pro russian sentiment in the country hundreds of indians belonging to an organization called the hindu sena marched in new delhi earlier this month chanting messages of support for russia and the country continues to purchase most of its weapons from russia giving them little reason to torpedo a mutually beneficial relationship india is not the only place where twitter has nuked accounts for alleged inauthentic posting in the months preceding the 2020 us election for example facebook removed over 10 000 accounts and pages from 13 countries including a multitude of then president donald trump s supporters for just such behavior facebook now meta twitter and other major social media platforms have long worked hand in hand with highly politicized think tanks like the atlantic council and western news agencies to help them fight disinformation online during elections and times of political upheaval rt com
thousands of financial advisors are facing new potential rules from the department of labor that could affect their businesses significantly or just start a new wave of industry legal fights after taking over last year the biden administration s labor department acted quickly in withdrawing the trump administration s independent contractor rule and unveiling its plans to more appropriately define when financial advisors are fiduciaries under the rules of the employee retirement income security act for advice on 401 k rollovers and iras that flurry of activity has been stymied by a court decision this month overturning the withdrawal of the rule and the threat of restarting the industry s ongoing fiduciary debate anew though despite the massive implications the agency hasn t offered any hints as to its next move enter trade groups such as the financial services institute which is cheering the latest court decision in its favor blocking the actions of a democratic administration s labor department while warning of potential risks to independent advisors and retail investors access to advice at the same time consumer advocates with opposing views are calling on the agency to act expeditiously toward issuing a new fiduciary rule and revamping the guidelines covering who is an independent contractor and who s an employee groups including the aarp the afl cio the consumer federation of america the public investors advocate bar association and phyllis borzi the former obama administration labor department s assistant secretary for employee benefits security and author of the prior fiduciary rule vacated by a 2018 appeals court decision have come together as the save our retirement coalition to urge the agency to act in an interview borzi pointed out that even an identical fiduciary rule issued by the sec and the labor department could have different impacts depending on the classification of advisors and other financial professionals the biggest delay for the department s employee benefits security administration in issuing a new rule likely stems from the difficulty of crafting a workable rule for independent insurance agents because the range of products they sell is under monitoring and supervision by several different financial entities rather than just one borzi said the biggest problem is in this rollover area what we ve seen over the past decade and what we see in the inexorable future is this tsunami of assets leaving the qualified plan space she said although not perfect erisa provides protections for people in a world where there are no protections in terms of the other matter before the department experts say that the march 14 decision in the federal court of beaumont texas ruling that the biden administration s may 2021 withdrawal of the rule violated the administrative procedure act carried many more consequences for janitors home health aides agricultural and construction workers and uber or lyft drivers than for independent advisors the department of labor isn t going to go after arrangements like that if the workers aren t complaining said catherine ruckelshaus the general counsel of the national employment law project it feels more ideological than actually a strategic legal problem for the members i ve never seen a case brought on behalf of a worker like that agency not showing its hand for its part the labor department s ebsa and its wage and hour division sent statements that leave their respective choices in both matters as open questions for coming weeks and months the court decision about the independent contractor rule is surprising and disappointing solicitor of labor seema nanda said noting that the department is evaluating all legal options including the potential need for rulemaking when employers misclassify workers as independent contractors workers lose key rights and protections hurting labor standards across the board and making it harder for law abiding employers to compete on an even playing field nanda said on the fiduciary rule acting assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security ali khawar and his team have received the message from the consumer advocates the agency placed the possible new rule on its regulatory agenda for the spring and the fall last year with a designation that it would be a major regulation about investment advice for a fee to employee benefit plans and iras the department issued guidance about existing rules as well while we are still reviewing the letter we share the goal of protecting retirement savers and understand the coalition s concerns related to conflicts of interest in investment advice khawar said the industry s perspective fsi an advocacy group for independent brokerages and their advisors is waiting to see what khawar and labor secretary marty walsh will do about any possible new fiduciary rule the organization supports the sec s regulation best interest and the existing labor department guidelines coinciding with it we of course are going to review very closely any proposal from the department of labor that would change the standard of care to retirement investors said david bellaire fsi s general counsel we don t come into that with any preconceived notions reg bi has greatly improved investor protection without pushing advice out of reach from main street with respect to rules about independent contractors bellaire conceded that the withdrawal of the trump administration s rule didn t in itself pose dangers to independent advisors he also admitted that a bill in congress that fsi opposes stringently the protecting the right to organize pro act wouldn t have a substantial initial impact on independent practices however fsi is concerned that the labor department s move the pro act and possible changes to unemployment insurance represents a multifront attack on the viability of independent contractor status in wealth management bellaire said the point is not that the pro act dooms the independent broker dealer channel each successive effort to limit or narrow who can be an independent contractor increases the costs of being an independent broker dealer increases the complexity of it increases the regulatory risk as a result we can expect to have fewer independent broker dealers bellaire said we think it s very important that we maintain the independent channel our channel delivers financial advice products and services to main street america people that oftentimes are overlooked by the wirehouse firms for now advisors industry professionals consumers and other stakeholders in both issues will argue their views and await the next signal of the labor department s plans labor secretary marty walsh speaks at an event earlier this month the agency has two pending matters before it that could pose an impact to wealth management bloomberg news who s subject to erisa today at which time with respect to erisa and advice about rollovers to the holders of 401 k s and iras the main issue involves whether clients are getting one time or ongoing advice if it s part of an ongoing relationship an advisor is subject to erisa s fiduciary duty if it s one time it s not that means there s a gap in regulation right now according to christine lazaro a piaba member and the director of the securities arbitration clinic at the st john s university school of law s securities arbitration clinic it s really ensuring that those who are not covered right now but should be covered are lazaro said the two biggest carveouts tend to be advice that s not on a regular basis or advice in which there s no understanding that it s the primary basis for the investment decision most brokerage firms attempt to carve themselves out of erisa by using account agreements in which it is agreed that the recommendation will not be the primary basis for the investment decision to demonstrate the point lazaro sent financial planning the relevant language on page 6 of a morgan stanley ira account agreement page 23 of a charles schwab agreement and page 29 of a merrill lynch agreement morgan stanley will not provide investment advice that will serve as a primary basis for the investment decisions the firm s agreement says merrill provides no advice on the investment consequences involving your ira unless provided under a separate agreement its language states and schwab does not serve as a fiduciary within the meaning of section 3 21 of erisa according to its ira agreement it is pretty crazy and they ve been doing this for decades lazaro said from left to right financial services institute ceo dale brown raymond james financial services independent contractor division president jodi perry stifel independent advisors ceo alex david and lincoln investment ceo ed forst spoke in a panel at the onevoice conference last month in dallas financial services institute representatives for the securities industry and financial markets association a trade group representing securities firms banks and asset managers said in an email that no staff members were available for an interview out of the three firms themselves only schwab provided a statement in response to fp s inquiry seeking comment the firm has always agreed with the underlying principle of existing labor department rules stating that fees should be reasonable and thoroughly disclosed up front and that the advice should be in their best interest said spokeswoman mayura hooper schwab s ira offerings are predominantly self directed and we do not provide discretionary advice unless a client specifically asks us to hooper said along with the rest of the retirement industry we don t know what specific changes the dol is contemplating however we are fully compliant with the existing version of the rule and will implement any new requirements if and when they are issued in all instances where schwab provides discretionary investment advice to ira accounts we do so according to finra rules and all applicable dol and irs requirements on the other hand retirement account holders may not understand all of the different fees they re being charged and those expenses may not be in their best interest according to micah hauptman the director of investor protection with the consumer federation of america rollover recommendations are among the most consequential recommendations even though its one time advice it should still be covered under the rule hauptman said most people reasonably believe that when they work with someone who refers to themselves as an advisor or uses terms of trust and confidence it s appropriate to rely on their recommendations especially in a market where things are so complex and investors may not know what they should be doing it s natural to rely on trusted experts to look out for their interests but that isn t necessarily the case for borzi the issue goes back to what she was hearing in her time with the agency over and over again from plan participants and sponsors particularly at small businesses she said the employers were desperately trying to do the right thing but got very bad advice borzi said clarifying that it was not because the people who were giving them advice were bad people but because of the way that the business model was structured the problem in this marketplace is the institutionalizing of bad financial incentives she said it s a compensation problem future steps on independent contractor definition on the independent contractor rule the next stage could play out in court if the agency appeals the decision in the case against the labor department filed by fsi building and contractors organizations and a group called the coalition for workforce innovation u s district judge marcia crone faulted the agency for failing to adequately consider alternatives to its arbitrary and capricious withdrawal of the rule and using a shortened public comment period that prevented a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to consider the idea the pressure for immediacy stems from the change of administration from that of former president donald trump to president joseph biden crone wrote while the biden administration sought additional time to review revise and repeal the trump administration s lingering regulations that objective does not constitute an emergency or further meet the high bar necessary for good cause the ruling surprised a lot of people because it treated the withdrawal of the rule as a legislative change rather than an interpretive one amounting to guidance according to ruckelshaus of the national employment law project the trump administration s labor department was the first to go through a formal rulemaking procedure defining an independent contractor ruckelshaus said the agency has several potential options now because the ruling is very technical on the that the court says they did not follow they could just undo it and reinstate the rule based on what the court says it has to do ruckelshaus said noting that there s a very heavy regulatory agenda at the agency currently it has stated publicly that independent contractor classification especially in low paying jobs is a priority because it s a big problem for a lot of workers who are told they re running their own business but they re really not

to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved in addition section 107 of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section 7 a 2 b of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have taken advantage of the extended transition period provided by section 107 of the jobs act we decided to comply with the effective dates for financial accounting standards applicable to emerging growth companies at a later date in compliance with the requirements in sections 107 b 2 and 3 of the jobs act such decision is irrevocable principal revenue and expense items we derive our revenue primarily from premiums earned net investment income and net realized gains losses from investments gross and net premiums written gross premiums written is equal to direct and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers ceded premiums written premiums earned premiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written gross premiums written include all premiums recorded by an insurance company during a specified policy period insurance premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are earned ratably over the duration of the policies at the end of each accounting period the portion of the premiums that is not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy our policies typically have a term of twelve months thus for example for a policy that is written on july 1 2021 one half of the premiums would be earned in 2021 and the other half would be earned in 2022 41 table of contents net investment income and net realized gains losses on investments we invest our surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and settlement expenses in cash cash equivalents equities fixed maturity securities and real estate investment income includes interest and dividends earned on invested assets net realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income we recognize realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost in the case of fixed maturity securities and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost as applicable our portfolio of investment securities is managed by two independent third parties with managers specializing in the insurance industry icc s expenses consist primarily of loss and settlement expenses loss and settlement expenses represent the largest expense item and include 1 claim payments made 2 estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates from prior periods and 3 costs associated with investigating defending and adjusting claims amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses expenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as policy acquisition expenses variable policy acquisition costs consist of commission expenses premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the writing and acquisition of new and renewal business these policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies fixed policy acquisition costs referred to herein as underwriting and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred these costs include salaries rent office supplies and depreciation other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs accounting and internal control salaries as well as audit and legal expenses income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date key financial measures we evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability in addition to reviewing our financial performance based on results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we utilize certain non gaap financial measures that we believe are valuable in managing our business and for comparison to our peers these non gaap measures are combined ratio written premiums underwriting income the loss and settlement expense ratio the expense ratio the ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus and return on average equity we measure growth by monitoring changes in gross premiums written and net premiums written we measure underwriting profitability by examining losses and settlement expenses underwriting expenses and combined ratios we also measure profitability by examining underwriting income loss and net earnings loss loss and settlement expense ratio the loss and settlement expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of loss and settlement expenses incurred to premiums earned we measure the loss ratio on an accident year and calendar year loss basis to monitor underwriting profitability an accident year loss ratio measures loss and settlement expenses for insured events occurring in a particular year regardless of when they are reported as a percentage of premiums earned during that year a calendar year loss ratio measures loss and settlement expense for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior accident years as a percentage of premiums earned during that year 42 table of contents expense ratio the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to net premiums earned and measures our operational efficiency in producing underwriting and administering our insurance business gaap combined ratio our gaap combined ratio is the sum of the loss and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio and measures our overall underwriting profit if the gaap combined ratio is below 100 we are making an underwriting profit if our combined ratio is at or above 100 we are not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio the net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written after reinsurance ceded to statutory surplus this ratio measures our exposure to pricing errors in our current book of business the higher the ratio the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate underwriting income loss underwriting income loss measures the pre tax profitability of our insurance operations it is derived by subtracting loss and settlement expense amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses from earned premiums each of these items is presented as a caption in our statements of earnings net earnings loss and return on average equity we use net earnings loss to measure our profit and return on average equity to measure our effectiveness in utilizing equity to generate net earnings in determining return on average equity for a given year net earnings loss is divided by the average of the beginning and ending equity for that year critical accounting policies general the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies we are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments market conditions industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments investments available for sale securities debt securities are classified as available for sale afs and reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from net earnings but are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive earnings and policyholders equity net of deferred income taxes equity securities equity securities include common stock mutual funds and non redeemable preferred stock equity securities are carried at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in net earnings other than temporary impairment under current accounting standards an otti write down of debt securities where fair value is below amortized cost is triggered by circumstances where 1 an entity has the intent to sell a security 2 it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 the entity does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if an entity intends to sell a security or if it is more likely than not the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery an otti write down is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security s amortized cost and its fair value if an entity does not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery the otti write down is separated into an amount representing the credit loss which is recognized in earnings and the amount related to all other 43 table of contents factors which is recognized in other comprehensive income impairment losses result in a reduction of the underlying investment s cost basis the company regularly evaluates its fixed income securities using both quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of the investments the following are the key factors for determining if a security is other than temporarily impaired the extent to which the fair value is less than cost the assessment of significant adverse changes to the cash flows on a fixed income investment the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on a material obligation the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization under which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value the probability that the company will recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income securities prior to maturity or the ability and intent to hold fixed income securities until maturity quantitative and qualitative criteria are considered during this process to varying degrees depending on the sector the analysis is being performed corporates the company performs a qualitative evaluation of holdings that fall below the price threshold the analysis begins with an opinion of industry and competitive position this includes an assessment of factors that enable the profit structure of the business e g reserve profile for exploration and production companies competitive advantage e g distribution system management strategy and an analysis of trends in return on invested capital analysts may also review other factors to determine whether an impairment exists including liquidity asset value cash flow generation and industry multiples municipals the company analyzes the screened impairment candidates on a quantitative and qualitative basis this includes an assessment of the factors that may be contributing to the unrealized loss and whether the recovery value is greater or less than current market value structured securities the stated assumptions analytic approach relies on actual 6 month average collateral performance measures voluntary prepayment rate gross default rate and loss severity sourced through third party data providers or remittance reports the analysis applies the stated assumptions throughout the remaining term of the transaction using forecasted cash flows which are then applied through the transaction structure reflecting the priority of payments and performance triggers to determine whether there is a loss to the security loss to tranche for securities or sectors for which no actual loss or minimal loss has been observed certain prime residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs for example sector based assumptions are applied or an alternative quantitative or qualitative analysis is performed property held for investment property held for investment purposes is initially recorded at the purchase price which is generally fair value and is subsequently reported at cost less accumulated depreciation buildings are depreciated on a straight line bases over the estimated useful lives of the building which we estimate to be 39 years income from property held for investment is reported as net investment income investment income interest on fixed maturities and short term investments is credited to earnings on an accrual basis premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the lives of the related fixed maturities dividends on equity securities are credited to earnings on the ex dividend date realized gains and losses on disposition of investments are based on specific identification of the investments sold on the settlement date which does not differ significantly from trade date accounting cash and cash equivalents cash consists of uninvested balances in bank accounts cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of 90 days or less primarily aaa rated prime and government money market funds cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value the company has not experienced losses on these instruments 44 table of contents loss and settlement expense reserves we maintain reserves for the payment of claims incurred losses and expenses related to adjusting those claims loss settlement expenses our loss reserves consist of case reserves which are reserves for claims that have been reported to us loss settlement expense reserve which includes all defense and litigation related expenses whether internal or external to us and reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported or for case reserve deficiencies or redundancies ibnr when a claim is reported to us our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment the amount of the loss reserve for the reported claim is based primarily upon a claim by claim evaluation of coverage liability injury severity or scope of property damage and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim each claim is settled individually based upon its merits and some claims may take years to settle especially if legal action is involved case reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated as new data becomes available in addition to case reserves we maintain an estimate of reserves for loss and settlement expenses incurred but not reported some claims may not be reported for several years as a result the liability for unpaid loss and settlement expense reserves includes significant estimates for ibnr we utilize an independent actuary to assist with the estimation of our loss and settlement expense reserves bi annually this actuary prepares estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and settlement expenses based on established actuarial methods described below our management reviews these estimates and supplements the actuarial analysis with information not fully incorporated into the actuarially based estimate such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy we may adjust the actuarial estimates based on this supplemental information in order to arrive at the amount recorded in the financial statements reserving methods in developing our loss and settlement expense reserve estimates we relied upon widely used and accepted loss reserving methods described below based on the deemed predictive qualities of each of the applied methods we selected estimated ultimates by year in order to determine our reserve estimates our estimates can be considered actuarial central estimates which means that they represent an expected value over the range of reasonably possible outcomes loss development methods paid and incurred loss and settlement expense loss development ultimates are determined by multiplying current reported values by cumulative loss development factors incremental loss development factors are determined by analyzing historical development of losses and assuming that future development will mimic historical cumulative development factors are calculated from the selection of incremental factors this method is also applied to incurred settlement expense to incurred loss ratios and paid settlement expense to paid loss ratios to estimate ultimate settlement expense loss development methods are particularly appropriate when historical loss development patterns have been relatively stable and can be predicted with reasonable accuracy expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method applies a selected ultimate loss ratio to premium to determine ultimate losses and settlement expenses expected loss ratios for 2007 and prior were selected based on the results of the loss development methods discussed above industry experience actual loss experience of icc to date and general industry conditions beginning with 2008 expected loss ratios have been calculated based on the prior expected loss ratios rate changes and loss trend bornhuetter ferguson b f methods paid and incurred loss the loss development methods rely heavily on data as of the most recent evaluation date and a relatively small swing in early reported or paid losses may result in a large swing in the ultimate loss projections therefore other methods may also be considered the b f methods offer a blend of stability and responsiveness by estimating ultimate losses as a weighted combination of an expected loss estimate and current loss data the weight applied to the expected loss estimate is based on the appropriate cumulative loss development factor from the loss development methods this percentage is multiplied by expected losses to determine expected future development this estimate of future loss development is then added to losses as of the current evaluation date to project ultimate losses 45 table of contents a oe method in 2012 we implemented a new approach to reserving for unpaid adjusting other expenses a oe this method is referred to as the wendy johnson method where historical a oe payments are measured against certain claim units to develop an average rate for projecting into future years these claim units are defined as a means of measuring the overall level of claim activity in a year as follows units 2 x newly reported claims in year x number of claims open at start of year x future a oe costs are projected by inflating the selected average a oe per unit rate 1 0 annually against future units calculated by claims runoff patterns range of estimates in addition to our actuarial central estimate we have also developed a range of estimates this range is not designed to represent minimum or maximum possible outcomes it is developed to represent low and high ends for a reasonable range of expected outcomes given the selection of alternative but reasonable assumptions actual results may fall outside of this range high and low net reserve estimates were developed by stressing our expected loss ratio and loss development factor selections by applying a factor to increase and decrease these assumptions we developed high and low ultimate loss and settlement expense estimates these estimates along with paid and incurred loss information result in a range of reserves the gross reserve range is based on selected percentages which produce a range which is slightly wider than the net range we estimate ibnr reserves by first deriving an actuarially based estimate of the ultimate cost of total loss and settlement expenses incurred by line of business as of the financial statement date we then reduce the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expenses by loss and settlement expense payments and case reserves carried as of the financial statement date the actuarially determined estimate is based upon indications from one of the above actuarial methodologies or uses a weighted average of these results the specific method used to estimate the ultimate losses for individual lines of business or individual accident years within a line of business will vary depending on the judgment of the actuary as to what is the most appropriate method for a line of business unique characteristics finally we consider other factors that impact reserves that are not fully incorporated in the actuarially based estimate such as changes in the external business environment and changes in internal company processes and strategy the process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables these variables can be affected by both internal and external events such as changes in claims handling procedures economic inflation legal trends and legislative changes among others the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by line of business due to differences in claim complexity the volume of claims the potential severity of individual claims the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer informed judgment is applied throughout the process including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses we continually refine our loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled we consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates final resolution of the estimated liability for loss and settlement expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date therefore actual paid losses as claims are settled in the future may be materially higher or lower in amount than current loss reserves we reflect adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed we accrue liabilities for unpaid loss and settlement expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amount payable policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses the company defers commissions premium taxes and certain other costs that are incrementally or directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts acquisition related costs may be deemed ineligible for deferral when they are based on contingent or performance criteria beyond the basic acquisition of the insurance contract or when efforts to obtain or renew the insurance contract are unsuccessful all eligible costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value this deferral methodology applies to both gross and ceded premiums and acquisition costs other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs accounting and internal control salaries as well as audit and legal expenses 46 table of contents premiums premiums are recognized ratably over the term of the contracts net of ceded reinsurance unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written relative to the unexpired terms of coverage unearned premiums are calculated on a daily pro rata basis reinsurance ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and settlement expenses are reported separately as assets instead of being netted with the related liabilities since reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders quarterly the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers the company s monitoring efforts include but are not limited to the review of annual summarized financial data and analysis of the credit risk associated with reinsurance balances recoverable by monitoring the a m best and standard poor s s p ratings in addition the company subjects its reinsurance recoverables to detailed recoverable tests including an analysis based on average default by a m best rating based upon the review and testing the company s policy is to charge to earnings in the form of an allowance an estimate of unrecoverable amounts from reinsurers this allowance is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the amount makes a reasonable provision for reinsurance balances that the company may be unable to recover income taxes the company files a consolidated federal income tax return federal income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities operating losses and tax credit carry forwards the effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers uncertainties in income taxes and recognizes those in its financial statements as required as it relates to uncertainties in income taxes unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalty accruals are not considered material to the consolidated financial statements also no tax uncertainties are expected to result in significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 month period penalties and interest related to income tax uncertainties should they occur would be included in income tax expense in the period in which they are incurred as an insurance company the company is subject to minimal state income tax liabilities on a state basis since the majority of income is from insurance operations the company pays premium taxes in lieu of state income tax premium taxes are a component of policy acquisition costs and calculated as a percentage of gross premiums written comprehensive earnings comprehensive earnings include net earnings plus unrealized gains losses on afs investment securities net of tax in reporting the components of comprehensive earnings on a net basis in the statement of earnings the company used a 21 tax rate for 2021 and 2020 results of operations our results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general the operating results of the united states property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition weather catastrophic events regulation general economic conditions judicial trends fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment our premium growth and underwriting results have been and continue to be influenced by market conditions pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been cyclical during a soft market cycle price competition is more significant than during a hard market cycle and makes it difficult to attract and retain properly priced commercial business a hard market typically has a positive effect on premium growth 47 table of contents the following summarizes our results for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 premiums direct premiums written grew by 12 110 000 or 20 5 primarily due to our insureds businesses being open substantially all year long in 2021 in contrast to business closures brought on by covid 19 in 2020 and net written premium increased by 11 163 000 or 22 8 during the same period net premiums earned grew by 4 204 000 or 8 5 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we ceded to reinsurers 10 854 000 and 10 080 000 of earned premiums respectively ceded earned premiums as a percent of direct premiums written were 15 3 in 2021 and 17 1 in 2020 premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy other income other income is derived from policies we write and represents additional charges to policyholders for services outside of the premium charge such as installment billing or policy issuance costs another component of other income is attributable to sales made by the company s subsidiary katkin other income increased by 580 000 or 251 1 in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of a decrease in premiums written off and the addition of katkin in the fourth quarter of 2021 unpaid losses and

the ultimate loss estimates were updated through the reserve analysis process the recognition of the changes in initial reserve estimates occurred over time as claims were reported initial case reserves were established initial reserves were reviewed in light of additional information and ultimate payments were made on the collective set of claims incurred as of that evaluation date the new information on the ultimate settlement value of claims is updated until all claims in a defined set are settled as a small specialty insurer with a niche product portfolio our experience will ordinarily exhibit fluctuations from period to period while management attempts to identify and react to systematic changes in the loss environment management must also consider the volume of experience directly available to the company and interpret any particular period s indications with a realistic technical understanding of the reliability of those observations 48 table of contents for calendar year 2021 the company experienced unfavorable development relative to prior years reserve estimates in both its property and liability lines of business relating to businessowners

2020 accident year claims for calendar year 2020 the company experienced unfavorable development relative to prior years reserve estimates in both its property and liability lines of business relating to businessowners property 2019 accident year claims and businessowners liability 2016 accident year claims respectively these adverse developments were largely offset by favorable development in liquor liability policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses and the expense ratio policy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies which include commissions premium taxes underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs the company offsets the direct commissions it pays with ceded commissions it receives from reinsurers other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs accounting and internal control salaries as well as audit and legal expenses policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by 2 295 000 or 12 4 the primary drivers for this change were an increase in commissions along with positive earned premium growth our expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by net earned premiums we use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations costs that cannot be readily identifiable as a direct cost of a product

which reflect the uncertainty inherent in the loss reserve process this range does not represent the range of all possible outcomes we believe that the actuarially determined ranges represent reasonably likely changes in the loss and settlement expense estimates however actual results could differ significantly from these estimates the range was determined by line of business and accident year after a review of the output generated by the various actuarial methods utilized the actuary reviewed the variance around the select loss reserve estimates for each of the actuarial methods and selected reasonable low and high estimates based on his knowledge and judgment in making these judgments the actuary typically assumed based on his experience that the larger the reserve the less volatility and that property reserves would exhibit less volatility than casualty reserves in addition when selecting these low and high estimates the actuary considered historical industry development experience in our business line historical company development experience the impact of court decisions on insurance coverage issues which can impact the ultimate cost of settling claims changes in our internal claims processing policies and procedures and 50 table of contents trends and risks in claim costs such as risk that medical cost inflation could increase our actuary is required to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all of these and other factors in the analysis of our loss and settlement expense reserves and related range of anticipated losses because of the level of uncertainty impacting the estimation process it is reasonably possible that different actuaries would arrive at different conclusions the method of determining the reserve range has not changed and the reserve range generated by our actuary is consistent with the observed development of our loss reserves over the last few years the width of the range in reserves arises primarily because specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and the ultimate losses paid and settlement expenses incurred with respect to known losses may be larger than currently estimated the ultimate frequency or severity of these claims can be very different than the assumptions we used in our estimation of ultimate reserves for these exposures specifically the following factors could impact the frequency and severity of claims and therefore the ultimate amount of loss and settlement expense paid the rate of increase in labor costs medical costs and material costs that underlie insured risks development of risk associated with our expanding producer relationships and our growth in new states or states where we currently have small market share and impact of changes in laws or regulations the estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid loss and settlement expense inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred but not paid in preceding years negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated unfavorable development for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we experienced adverse development of 732 000 and 1 206 000 respectively potential for variability in our reserves is evidenced by this development as further illustration of reserve variability we initially estimated unpaid loss and settlement expense net of reinsurance at the end of 2020 at 48 556 000 as of december 31 2021 that amount was re estimated at 49 288 000 which is 732 000 or 1 5 higher than the initial estimate as discussed earlier the estimation of our reserves is based on several actuarial methods each of which incorporates many quantitative assumptions the judgment of the actuary plays an important role in selecting among various loss development factors and selecting the appropriate method or combination of methods to use for a given accident year the ranges presented above represent the expected variability around the actuarially determined central estimate the total range around our actuarially determined estimate varies from 11

000 at the end of 2021 this sharp decrease in unrealized gains was driven by an increase in treasury rates in 2021 5 year treasury rates increased 90 bps and 10 year treasury rates increased 60 bps as a result of this rate move corporate bond prices dropped causing the unrealized gain position to worsen municipal bonds the net unrealized gain in the municipal portfolio decreased from 1 300 000 at the end of 2020 to 1 127 000 at the end of 2021 a decrease of 0 17 million this stability in the unrealized position was driven by two factors treasury rates rose during the year which had a negative impact on municipal prices however this was mostly offset by spread tightening in the municipal sector throughout the year this spread tightening was driven by a number of factors most notably investor concerns about the potential for higher tax rates and an influx of cash into municipal coffers from the fiscal stimulus package the fair value and unrealized losses for our securities that

may be affected by increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates which generally translate respectively into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments also may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer prepayment options relative values of other investments the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions we monitor our investment portfolio and review securities that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary when assessing whether the amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered we compare the present value of the cash flows likely to be collected based on an evaluation of all available information relevant to the collectability of the security to the amortized cost basis of the security the shortfall of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is referred to as the credit loss if there is a credit loss the impairment is considered to be other than temporary if we identify that an other than temporary impairment loss has occurred we then determine whether we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis less any current period credit losses if we determine that we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security the amount of the impairment loss related to the credit loss will be recorded in earnings and the remaining portion of the other than temporary impairment loss will be recognized in other comprehensive income loss net of tax if we determine that we intend to sell the security or that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis less any current period credit losses the full amount of the other than temporary impairment otti will be recognized in earnings there were no other than temporary impairment losses recognized in net earnings during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 adverse investment market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in impairment charges in the future we use quoted values and other data provided by independent pricing services in our process for determining fair values of our investments the evaluations of such pricing services represent an exit price and a good faith opinion as to what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security in a current sale this pricing service provides us with one quote per instrument for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets market quotations are provided for fixed maturity securities that do not trade on a daily basis the independent pricing service prepares estimates of fair value using a wide array of observable inputs including relevant market information benchmark curves benchmarking of like securities sector groupings and matrix pricing the observable market inputs that our independent pricing service utilizes may include listed in order of priority for use benchmark yields reported trades broker dealer quotes issuer spreads two sided markets benchmark securities market bids offers and other reference data on markets industry and the economy additionally the independent pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios the pricing service did not use broker quotes in determining fair values of our investments should the independent pricing service be unable to provide a fair value estimate we would attempt to obtain a non binding fair value estimate from a number of broker dealers and review this estimate in conjunction with a fair value estimate reported by an independent business news service or other sources in instances where only one broker dealer provides a fair value for a fixed maturity security we use that estimate in instances where we are able to obtain fair value estimates from more than one broker dealer we would review the range of estimates and would select the most appropriate value based on the facts and circumstances should neither the independent pricing service nor a broker dealer provide a fair value estimate we would develop a fair value estimate based on cash flow analyses and other valuation techniques that utilize certain unobservable inputs accordingly we would classify such a security as a level 3 investment the fair value estimates of our investments provided by the independent pricing service at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively were utilized among other resources in reaching a conclusion as to the fair value of our investments 53 table of contents management reviews the reasonableness of the pricing provided by the independent pricing service by employing various analytical procedures we review all securities to identify recent downgrades significant changes in pricing and pricing anomalies on individual securities relative to other similar securities this will include looking for relative consistency across securities in common sectors durations and credit ratings this review will also include all fixed maturity securities rated lower than a by moody s or s p if after this review management does not believe the pricing for any security is a reasonable estimate of fair value then it will seek to resolve the discrepancy through discussions with the pricing service in our review we did not identify any such discrepancies for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 and no adjustments were made to the estimates provided by the pricing service the classification within the fair value hierarchy of accounting standards codification asc topic 820 fair value measurement is then confirmed based on the final conclusions from the pricing review deferred policy acquisition costs certain acquisition costs consisting of direct and ceded commissions premium taxes and certain other direct underwriting expenses

costs 6 539 5 430 unearned premium reserves 36 212 29 789 the method followed in computing deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of deferred costs to their estimated realizable value which gives effect to the premium to be earned related investment income loss and settlement expenses and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned future changes in estimates the most significant of which is expected loss and settlement expenses may require adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs if the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable they would be written off income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date we had a net deferred tax liability of 955 000 and 1 231 000 at

realized at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had no valuation allowance with respect to a deferred tax asset we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets which are

inflation impact on dividend distributions where are we now dividend paying stocks have historically been a successful way to protect capital against inflation in addition to stock price appreciation that occurs during inflationary periods companies also tend to increase their dividend distributions this trend continued in 2021 when aggregate us dividend payments rose by 6 5 while consumer price index cpi came in at 4 7 however the inflation that has cropped up in the last three months is different than that of the past supply chain disruptions energy price increases wage inflation and now the war in ukraine highlight the overwhelming number of fronts from which these price pressures originate as we saw in the latest bureau of labor statistics report cpi rose 7 9 over the prior 12 months and is now at the highest level since 1982 elevated cpi coupled with the threat of war in europe has contributed to a stock market pullback and sent the sp500 nasdaq and dow into correction territory higher prices are no longer a benign factor that can be taken in stride we now look to uncover if the impact of inflation will traverse into dividend distributions energy is to blame in february the impetus for a sharp rise to inflation readings has been the increase in energy prices spurred by the russia ukraine war and an embargo on russian oil products the gasoline portion of the cpi reading rose 6 6 in february alone up 38 year over year and accounted for a third of the total increase in the futures market brent crude oil remains 50 above the price in december 2021 the price moderated due to opec increasing production and demand in china falling owing to a covid 19 outbreak prompting regional lockdowns but it has since risen again crude oil now trades 20 below peak march highs but remains well above the average price of february as a result energy is expected to continue impacting inflation and the operations of global companies oil and gas producers are riding the high inflation is top of mind for any physical goods company but not energy producers high oil prices are welcomed by the likes of exxonmobil xom and chevron cvx whose sales are directly tied to market prices these producers have the same fixed costs regardless of market price so high prices increase profitability in their most recent earnings publication exxon acknowledged rising input costs but expects cost savings to more than offset the impact the company initiated a new development plan in 2018 that locked contractors and suppliers into long term contracts insulating some of their exposure to higher wages and materials costs furthermore thanks to careful planning of assets and controlled spending exxon s breakeven price the price of crude oil at which exxon will not lose nor make a profit is a mere 35 per barrel this gives them plenty of cushion to absorb greater costs of machinery and drilling and ensures a continued dividend in the coming years we expect the company to increase their dividend again in 2022 to a healthy payout ratio of 45 the most sustainable level in the past seven years transportation companies absorb costs differently for the transportation industry crude oil and derived products are a key input into company operations american airlines aal the largest us airline operator saw its fuel costs double in 2021 company policy prohibits the use of futures contracts to hedge prices and therefore it is fully exposed to price fluctuations in the market the company suspended its dividend at the start of the covid 19 outbreak and although booking sales just reached 2019 levels it is unlikely to resume payments in the near to medium term delta and southwest airlines are also on hold from paying their shareholders dividends the industry should return to profitability this year but having experienced two years of rising input costs with not enough demand to pass on these higher expenses to the customers we do not expect a rush to distribute cash on the seas matson matx a us based maritime shipping company also saw its fuel costs double from 2020 to 2021 thankfully matson implements a fuel price surcharge to pass some of the rising costs along to its clients its earnings were also bolstered by insatiable demand during the pandemic which saw shipping rates on a 40 foot container increase by nearly five times the company raised its quarterly dividend payment by 30 in the third quarter of 2021 and still only paid out 5 of its earnings that year drastically lower than the 45 paid in 2019 while demand for shipped goods is expected to moderate from recent highs we are forecasting matson to increase its dividend again in the back half of 2022 success is in the ability to pass through costs the airline and maritime shipping industries are a clear example of how the ability or inability to pass through costs to customers can impact the dividend in inflationary periods companies that can increase sales prices at the same rate as their expenses will be able to maintain margins profitability and shareholder payments consumer demand enables pricing power if a company changes the price of its good and consumer demand is not impacted its product is said to be demand inelastic food and beverage companies have shown that they fall into this category and have been utilizing their pricing power to sustain margins coca cola s ko gross margin of 60 and operating margin of 27 6 are both at the five year average while its cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses together rose usd4 5 billion during 2021 increased revenue of usd5 5 billion more than covered the difference demand for its product has not been impacted because its customers the everyday consumer have experienced higher wages lower cost of borrowing and increased savings these factors allow coca cola to continue selling at higher prices and collecting enough revenue to pay a growing dividend as it demonstrated with a 5 increase to its dividend in the first quarter the retail industry has had a similar experience given that it serves largely the same end customer tjx companies tjx has not seen margin compression and has a gross margin of 28 5 that is on par with the five year average and equal to competitor target tgt real consumer spending measured as personal consumption expenditures increased 7 9 in 2021 this buoyed demand for products and outweighed price increases that sellers pass along from their suppliers tjx s management noted that while prices may be up on some products it is still a value brand and can capture a higher tier of market share when luxury shoppers look to save additionally the broader retail sector is experiencing the same supply chain pressures and have collectively decreased the level of competitive promotions tjx has been able to collect full price on goods that would otherwise be subject to discounts while the company was forced to suspend its dividend in 2020 owing to massive store closures it has since been paying for the last four quarters we expect the company to raise its dividend 13 next quarter to distribute excess capital that has accumulated from strong performance business investment allows for industrials to raise prices too in an industry like manufacturing the end customer is primarily another corporation rather than a consumer nonetheless the sector has been able to increase prices with the same limited impact to demand 3m mmm and caterpillar cat have both acknowledged use of price increases to maintain margins there has been almost a direct pass through of input costs that rose due to supply chain delays freight and materials costs and wage inflation these companies are also investing a lot in supply chain and production efficiency to realize cost savings wherever possible as a result we have seen growth in both earnings and net income increasing the cash available for shareholder distributions 3m recently raised its dividend in february and is expected to maintain that level through the year paying out 60 of eps we forecast caterpillar to raise its in the third quarter to reach a payout ratio of close to 40 navigating the supply chain inflation and more specifically cpi first rose above the federal reserve s target of 2 in march of 2021 a full year into the pandemic the early cause of this inflation was supply chain delays that were prompted by an unprecedented demand for goods particularly ecommerce goods and automotive while there is some optimism that supply chain pressures will ease soon the reality is that they are not close to doing so therefore companies that expect to continue paying a growing dividend will have to manage their suppliers accordingly bargaining power over suppliers larger companies with a global supply chain are best positioned to mitigate rising costs that arise from supply chain difficulties they purchase such large quantities from their suppliers that they often have bargaining power for example walmart wmt has increased the price of some goods but noted that it has not needed to do so with others because of contract negotiations with those suppliers in other words if margins are being squeezed it often falls on the upstream seller production location also matters walmart boasts the fact that two thirds of products in its stores are us made or assembled this means less of its products need to be loaded onto shipping containers and subject to the global shipping log jam there is simply not enough infrastructure capacity to unload containers efficiently which is why there are still almost 100 container ships waiting for a berth off the coast of los angeles a secondary benefit of local operations is that facilities are less exposed to international government covid 19 responses lockdowns or mandates currently navigating the inflationary environment expertly we forecast walmart to its their dividend next quarter from 0 56 share to 0 57 share the automotive industry is taking the brunt automotive producers have been most heavily impacted by the supply chain disruptions but it is not visible in their margins general motors company gm noted in its 2021 year end earnings that it achieved record ebit adjusted margins of 11 4 this is because the prices for autos have risen exorbitantly the new vehicle portion of february s cpi reading was 12 4 higher year over year while the used car portion was up a staggering 41 2 auto producers are collecting higher wholesale prices owing to pent up demand which ihs markit automotive analysts expect is about 10 million units higher than achievable production in 2022 the problem is not pricing it is that auto makers simply cannot procure the materials particularly semiconductors needed to build their vehicles and are forced to shut down production general motors has dealt with multi week shutdowns or slowdowns across operations in north america south america and asia it has not paid a dividend since march 2020 and although the company expects to produce 25 more vehicles over 2022 we do not expect it to reinstate payments until 2023 ford f has not fared much better and has also experienced multi week shutdowns across its plants it has however reinstated its dividend at 60 of the pre covid 19 amount it is unlikely it will raise this dividend until it achieves normalized wholesale figures both general motors and ford are forming partnerships with chip producers and other upstream producers to help smooth the supply of critical components and materials they are also simplifying the technical requirements for their vehicles to cut down on the quantity of unique parts required it will take time to normalize operations and lead times which is why we do not expect the automotive industry to pay pre covid 19 levels of dividends until next year at the earliest downside risks in the medium term aside from auto producers airline operators and a select few others we do not expect inflation to impact broader dividend payments in the short term of 2022 a rising tide lifts all ships and most industries have been able to stay afloat we are forecasting aggregate dividend payments in the united states to increase 8 during 2022 to an impressive usd670 billion with that said inflation does not usually remediate quietly and there are ample downside risks in the medium term federal reserve actions can go awry the federal reserve recently announced a 25 basis points bp increase to their overnight funds rate and pencilled in six additional raises through the remainder of the year rate increases are implemented to increase the cost of capital and incentivize consumers to save instead of spend the full arc is as follows the federal reserve increases rates borrowing becomes more costly businesses invest less in growth hiring slows wages flatten consumer demand for goods falls and finally prices come down this method intentionally hampers business and consumer growth rate increases are necessary but difficult to get right without causing a recession there is the risk that since today s inflation is being caused by so many different factors a sequence of cuts will slow economic growth and increase unemployment without lowering inflation otherwise known as stagflation in this type of environment dividends would be impacted to the downside across all sectors we will be watching the federal reserve closely as its actions will likely steer the market as well as the ability of companies to pay dividends in the medium term prices will catch up to the consumer as discussed earlier consumer wage growth has been supporting price increases in goods and driving demand the us department of labor said that average hourly wages increased by 4 7 in 2021 since this is more than 2 less than december s cpi figure of 7 prices are rising faster than wages and people are earning lower real wages the gap worsened in the latest cpi reading released the first week of march the price categories that increased the most were those that impact the consumer daily such as groceries and transportation services which each rose 1 4 in a single month electricity gasoline and utility gas services are up 9 38 and 24 respectively over the last 12 months these items are growing substantially faster than incomes and ballooning household expenses if this is not tamed soon consumers will not be able to afford discretionary goods the retail food and beverage travel and leisure sectors could all experience a significant drop off in demand exposing the sector to potential dividend cuts in the medium term it will be important to track how inflation impacts real wages in the coming months heavily indebted companies will have less cash while not mentioned earlier in this paper significant rate hikes increase borrowing costs for companies companies that borrow continuously or have a lot of debt will see their payments increase meaningfully with more cash going to interest payments there will be less available for dividend payments the utilities sector has recently seen a surge in share prices as investors flock to value stocks however they are most exposed to higher rates most utilities companies do not earn enough to cover debt payments and rely on additional borrowing to stay afloat while share prices show support we believe the sector s debt levels will inevitably expose it to downside risks in the dividend source ihs markit
