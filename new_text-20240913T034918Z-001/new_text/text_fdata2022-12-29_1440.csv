this is an edition of the atlantic daily a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day helps you discover new ideas and recommends the best in culture sign up for it here i indulged in my share of gloom in 2022 and i have plenty more where that came from but i want to make the case for a certain amount of optimism in 2023 and to offer my gratitude to readers of the daily but first here are three new stories from the atlantic no good thing ever dies throughout 2022 i ve worried a lot i ve had plenty of smaller gripes that is my nature as a professional curmudgeon but mostly i ve been concerned about world war the rule of law and the collapse of democracy but here at the end of the year i am optimistic which is a surprise even to me first things first however i want to thank the readers of the daily and the atlantic for your willingness to join me and my colleagues every week i hope you ll stay with us in the coming year a lot is going to happen in america and around the world and i look forward to continuing to explore those issues with you before we head off into 2023 let s think about why the past year wasn t as bad as we might think and why the coming year might even be better the single most important story of the year is the resilience of democracy two great events or more accurately non events reassured me as part of that heartening narrative the russians failed to win a war in europe and antidemocratic candidates failed to rebound in america these were not small things and indeed i sometimes worry that americans underestimate just how close to disaster we all came in 2022 i am not prone to world war ii metaphors but i was moved enough by the midterm elections to refer to them as democracy s dunkirk my colleague anne applebaum meanwhile offered a terrifying picture of what the world would look like right now had vladimir putin s tanks taken kyiv almost a year ago in 2022 however the west chose to help ukraine defend itself and the voters chose to protect democracy in fact the american system is now engaged in a certain amount of healing even if it doesn t feel that way election deniers led by kari lake in arizona are regularly being told by the judicial system to go pound sand donald trump s presidential campaign is so far a shambolic and pitiful mess congress with something that these days looks like a smidge of bipartisanship has sent a bill with the electoral count reform act to president joe biden s desk adding some insurance against any further attempts at electoral vote chicanery meanwhile consequences for coup plotters seditionists and other criminals are piling up a group of oath keepers is facing real time in prison some of the january 6 rioters have gotten stiff sentences and this morning one of the ringleaders of the plot to kidnap michigan s governor got sentenced to the big house for more than 19 years even smaller stories had some positive lessons in them for example elon musk proved to us that billions of dollars cannot buy everything and especially not competence or common sense tesla stock the source of so much of musk s fortune has lost more than 800 billion that s billion with a b in value most of it vanishing after musk s decision to detonate his reputation as a savvy businessman so that he could become the world s richest shitposter if this makes people rethink worshipping rich celebrities so much the better arizona senator kyrsten sinema meanwhile finally dumped her affiliation as a democrat a move that was almost certainly prompted less by ideology than by her realization that she is deeply unpopular among democrats and was likely to lose a primary in her own party this ploy seems to have backfired her approval rating has cratered which suggests that voters finally might actually punish rank opportunism add to these stories the collective national shrug at trump s entry into the gop presidential race and it looks like 2022 was a bad year for narcissism all of this optimism is making me itch even if i am enjoying the schadenfreude so let me suggest a few things that could go horribly wrong in 2023 let s start with nuclear war russia s war in ukraine is nowhere near over the russians are in bad shape but they still enjoy some immutable advantages in geography and manpower the kremlin might well try again to take kyiv or the russian high command could simply decide to pursue meat grinder battles across the eastern ukrainian front putin is a terrible strategist and if these next moves go badly for russia he could return to making unhinged threats when ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said that putin loves life and doesn t want to die he was right but that s a different problem from putin simply being a desperate gambler who could set in motion events he cannot control the west must continue to send aid and weapons to ukraine but i have worried about unpredictable nuclear dangers in 2022 and i will continue to worry about them in 2023 and for as long as putin pursues this mad war the crisis of american democracy is also not over yet the republicans whose national elected members are still the main source of threats to the constitution at this point will take control of the house next month by a slim majority and the 2024 senate map favors the gop trump s gambit to regain his office may well be thwarted but by whom it s not much of an improvement if he s edged out by florida governor ron desantis or one of the many other contenders whose goal is not to restore sanity to the gop but to use its delusional base to gain the white house the bright spot here is that gop control of the house could be such a spectacular and ridiculous carnival in 2023 that voters in 2024 will remember why they were so reluctant during the midterms to let them back into power but we cannot end on a note of gloom consider this anyone who predicted at the end of 2021 that we d be in such good shape heading into 2023 would have been dismissed as a pollyanna besides the challenges we ll face next year including the preservation of democracy and the restoration of global peace aren t new we ve faced them before and we re still here in one piece so let s celebrate by remembering the words of the great prison philosopher andy dufresne hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies tomorrow my colleague rebecca rashid will be here to discuss how to have a happier life in 2023 and i ll be back on friday with your new year s resolutions so remember to send those along to me

comfort you when you re lonely watch spend the holiday week with one of the best tv shows of the year according to our critics play our daily crossword p s many years ago my elderly father was widowed by my mother s sudden and unexpected death my parents had a new year s eve tradition of ordering chinese food and watching movies and when my father found himself alone at 82 years old i decided to continue that tradition by bringing him from massachusetts to rhode island at the end of every year the chinese food was easy to replace but my father was something of a difficult old coot about movies and so one year i decided to plop him in a big chair with the full set of episodes from hbo s world war ii miniseries band of brothers it worked like magic my father was mesmerized and peace reigned in the nichols home i bring this up as a suggestion to americans that they might consider watching the episode about the siege of bastogne in which u s forces were encircled by the germans in belgium for a brutal week in late december 1944 cut off and surrounded by nazi tanks the americans huddled in the bitter cold as the germans rained artillery on them the germans were so sure of victory that they sent a note to the americans to surrender rather than be annihilated to which u s army brigadier general anthony mcauliffe replied nuts on december 26 lieutenant general george patton s third army arrived and broke the siege i recommend this not only so that we remember an important christmas week nearly eight decades ago but also so we bear in mind that as we celebrate with our family and friends this new year s eve the russians will be shelling and bombing ukrainians in the same kind of unforgiving cold yesterday russian forces struck a maternity hospital in kherson the ukrainian situation is not yet as desperate as bastogne but the misery and cold and violence are no less brutal this year be thankful for the sacrifices made by the battered bastards of bastogne and hold a good thought for the ukrainian defenders under siege today tom isabel fattal contributed to this newsletter
like clockwork tesla reported autopilot safety statistics once every quarter starting in 2018 last year those reports ceased around the same time the national highway traffic safety administration the nation s top auto safety regulator began demanding crash reports from automakers that sell so called advanced driver assistance systems such as autopilot it began releasing those numbers in june and those numbers don t look good for autopilot tesla won t say why it stopped reporting its safety statistics which measure crash rates per miles driven the company employs no media relations department a tweet sent to tesla chief executive elon musk inviting his comments went unanswered tesla critics are happy to speak up about the situation however taylor ogan chief executive at fund management firm snow bull capital held a twitter spaces event last thursday to run through his own interpretation of tesla safety numbers he thinks he knows why the company ceased reporting its safety record because it s gotten a lot worse also last week nhtsa announced it had added two more crashes to the dozens of automated driving tesla incidents that it s already investigating one involved eight vehicles including a tesla model s on the san francisco bay bridge on thanksgiving day through friday s close tesla stock has lost 65 of its value this year ogan using nhtsa crash numbers tesla s previous reports sales numbers and other records concluded that the number of reported tesla crashes on u s roads has grown far faster than tesla s sales growth the average monthly growth in new teslas since nhtsa issued its standing order was 6 he figures while comparable crash stats rose 21 the tesla autopilot crash numbers are far higher than those of similar driver assistance systems from general motors and ford tesla has reported 516 crashes from july 2021 through november 2022 while ford reported seven and gm two to be sure tesla has far more vehicles equipped with driver assist systems than the competition an estimated 1 million ogan said about 10 times as many as ford all else equal that would imply tesla ought to have a nhtsa reported crash total of 70 since last summer to be comparable with ford s rate instead tesla reported 516 crashes tesla s quarterly safety reports were always controversial they did put tesla autopilot in a good light for the fourth quarter of 2021 tesla reported one crash per 4 31 million miles driven in cars equipped with autopilot the company compared that with government statistics that show one crash per 484 000 miles driven on the nation s roadways for all vehicles and all drivers but statisticians have pointed out serious analytical flaws including the fact that the tesla stats involve newer cars being driven on highways the government s general statistics include cars of all ages on highways rural roads and neighborhood streets in other words the comparison is apples and oranges none of the statistics tesla s or the government s separate out autopilot from the company s controversial full self driving feature fsd is a 15 000 option that s more aspirational than its name implies no car being sold today is fully autonomous including those with fsd autopilot combines adaptive cruise control with lane keeping and lane switching systems on highways fsd is marketed as advanced artificial intelligence technology that can cruise neighborhood streets stop and go at traffic lights make turns onto busy streets and generally behave as if the car drives itself the fine print however makes clear the human driver must be in full control and is legally liable for crashes including those involving injuries and deaths the internet is filled with videos of fsd behaving badly turning into oncoming traffic confusing railroad tracks for roadways running red lights and more the number of injuries and deaths involving autopilot and fsd is unknown except perhaps to tesla publicly available safety statistics about autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles are scarce meanwhile the crash reporting system in the u s is rooted in 1960s methodology and no serious attempt to update it for the digital world appears to be in the works at nhtsa or elsewhere nhtsa s driver assist crash statistic collection order issued in 2021 depends on the car companies for accurate and complete reporting musk has misstated fsd s safety record in the past including a claim that the technology had been involved in no crashes when the public record made clear it had not all the information sent to nhtsa is available for public scrutiny ogan who drives an fsd equipped tesla said more public information would allow a lot more transparency into robot car safety at tesla and other automakers tesla once reported its autopilot utilization rate but no longer does so i m looking at the only data available he said the california department of motor vehicles has been investigating whether tesla is violating its rule against marketing vehicles as fully autonomous when they re not musk has stated clearly that the company plans to develop fsd to create a fully autonomous robotaxi that tesla owners could rent out for extra cash he had promised 1 million of them on the road by 2020 but that date came and went and no fully autonomous tesla exists the dmv declined to comment fsd s safety and capabilities are by musk s own admission existential concerns especially as tesla stock continues to dive bomb in a june interview with axios he said that solving fsd is really the difference between tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero
by li yang china daily updated 2022 12 29 07 03 a vehicle passes the building of the european commission in brussels belgium oct 18 2022 the natural gas price in europe once hit nearly 350 372 58 per megawatt hour since the russia ukraine conflict broke out however from dec 19 to 23 the benchmark price of natural gas futures in europe fell sharply down by 26 40 percent in a week that means it has fallen back to the pre conflict level an immediate consequence of the energy shortage in europe as a result of the russia ukraine conflict was a sharp rise in manufacturing costs leading to a contraction in industrial output the eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index has been below the expansion contraction line for six months in a row since july new orders have fallen for eight consecutive months in the eurozone s manufacturing sector as of this month and for six months in its service sector germany the netherlands and spain have all shown obvious signs of output contraction this creates a cycle the energy crisis depresses economic output which in turn depresses demand for natural gas european energy ministers agreed on dec 19 to impose a price cap if prices in the european union s main trading centers remained above 180 per megawatt hour for three consecutive days which has been another factor pushing down gas prices the agreement is stricter than the european commission s original ceiling of 275 per megawatt hour the new ceiling of 180 gives the market no room to stir up gas futures prices besides the previous shortage of natural gas has prompted major european countries to expand their stock to prepare for an even worse situation as a result they once had nearly 94 percent of their gas stocks at full capacity a historical high and now about 83 percent of their natural gas stocks remain full moreover despite the cold winter in north america nearly 250 million united states and canadian people have felt the icy grip of a massive winter storm over the past holiday weekend the temperature in europe this winter is higher than average and that has weakened many speculators expectations for a sharp rise in nature gas prices in the future contrary to their claims european countries have still imported large amounts of natural gas through various means from russia this year in the january november period european lng imports from russia rose 40 percent from the same period in 2021 hitting 19 4 billion cubic meters according to russian data that means russia remains europe s second largest source of liquefied natural gas with a market share of 16 percent second only to the us europe has fully realized that the us inflation reduction act threatens to hollow out european industry perhaps in the future europe may take advantage of its imports of more russian gas and oil as a tool to answer the us selfishness and hypocrisy

commission which charged founder sam bankman fried with orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors through its ftx ventures unit the crypto firm in march invested 100 million in dave a fintech company that had gone public two months earlier through a special purpose acquisition company at the time the companies said they would work together to expand the digital assets ecosystem the other deal the sec appears to have referenced was a 100 million investment round in september for mysten labs a web3 company in total it was a 300 million funding round that valued mysten at 2 billion and included participation from coinbase ventures binance labs and andreessen horowitz s crypto fund feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here while ftx ventures has done dozens of transactions according to pitchbook the mysten labs and dave investments were the only two disclosed investments of 100 million based on documents published by the financial times which broke down how the company put 5 2 billion to work ftx ventures was described as a 2 billion venture fund in its press release with dave bankman fried 30 stands accused of committing widespread fraud after ftx which was valued by private investors at 32 billion earlier this year sank into bankruptcy in november a central theme in the charges is how bankman fried diverted funds from ftx to his hedge fund alameda research which then used that money for risky trades and loans ftx ventures was allegedly part of that scheme neither mysten nor dave have been linked to any alleged wrongdoing within bankman fried s empire but the investments appear to be the first identified examples of customer money being used by ftx and bankman fried for venture funding as investigators and ftx lawyers attempt to retrace the outflow of ftx funds these identified investments and others in the 5 billion venture pool will attract heavy scrutiny in explicitly linking the two 100 million investments to customer money the sec has raised the possibility that they ll be prospects for clawbacks if ftx bankruptcy trustees can establish that client money funded bankman fried s investments they could pursue recovery of those funds as part of an effort to retrieve customer assets a spokesperson for the sec declined to comment dave ceo jason wilk told cnbc that ftx s investment in dave is already scheduled to be repaid with interest by 2026 ftx s 100 million investment was through a convertible note a short term loan of cash that ftx could convert into shares at a later date that conversion was never made leaving dave with a 101 6 million liability including interest to ftx and any successor companies according to the company s most recent sec filings source jason wilk the note issued to ftx is due for repayment in march 2026 the company said in a statement no terms contained in the note trigger any current obligation by dave to repay prior to the maturity date wilk added that it is important to state we had no knowledge of ftx or alameda using customer assets to make investments bankman fried s investment in mysten labs was an equity deal because mysten is a privately held company there s no clearly defined process in u s bankruptcy code for clawing back those funds mysten declined to comment lawyers at sullivan cromwell which represents ftx did not respond to requests for comment an sec complaint filed against two of bankman fried s lieutenants caroline ellison and gary wang specified that two 100 million investments made by ftx s affiliated investment vehicle ftx ventures ltd were funded with ftx customer funds that had been diverted to alameda irrespective of what money was being used ftx s investments were ill timed dave shares have plummeted over 97 since the company went public mirroring the performance of the broader basket of spacs in july the nasdaq warned dave that if its share price didn t improve it was at risk of being delisted the stock currently trades for 28 cents and the market cap sits at around 100 million alameda research had previously made a 15 million investment in dave in august 2021 before the nasdaq listing dave was founded in 2016 and offers customers a free cash advance on their future income as part of a suite of banking products mark cuban led a 3 million seed round in 2017 the investment could have been lucrative for ftx if dave s share price had improved beyond 10 a share allowing ftx to convert at a profit ftx s investment in mysten came in the midst of a crypto meltdown bitcoin and ether were down by more than half for the year and numerous hedge funds and lenders had gone bankrupt the funds were to be used in mysten s effort to build a blockchain that scales with demand and incentivizes growth mysten ceo evan cheng said at the time representatives for ellison and wang did not respond to requests for comment a representative for bankman fried declined to comment ellison 28 and wang 29 pleaded guilty in new york last week to federal charges over the illicit use of customer funds for trading and venture investments allegedly directed by

an aerial view of the 1901 pan american exposition neighborhood in buffalo n y which remains coated in a blanket of snow after a blizzard tuesday dec 27 2022 state and military police were sent tuesday to keep people off buffalo s snow choked roads and officials kept counting fatalities three days after western new york s deadliest storm in at least two generations derek gee the buffalo news via ap buffalo n y ap the toll from the weekend blizzard that hit the buffalo area was approaching 40 deaths wednesday from the region s deadliest storm in generations homes are only beginning to warm after days without heat drivers are still claiming cars they had abandoned in a region that prides itself on being able to handle frequent and heavy snowfall the natural question is why was this storm so paralyzing officials note that they declared emergencies warned residents and positioned crews and equipment well before the first storm winds blew in but the ferocity of a blizzard packing near hurricane force winds and more than 4 feet 1 2 meters of snow severely limited what crews could do even in responding to 911 calls on wednesday tensions surfaced between the region s two top elected officials with erie county executive mark poloncarz swiping at snow removal efforts in the county seat of buffalo where a driving ban remained in place and national guard troops helped to enforce it the city unfortunately is always the last one to open poloncarz said it s embarrassing to tell you the truth in the aftermath of the storm many of the dead were found outside and others were in snow covered vehicles and unheated homes some were stricken after clearing snow others died while awaiting help during a medical crisis a look at the response and aftermath the forecast meteorologists saw it coming four days before the arrival of bad weather the national weather service on dec 19 warned of a powerful storm and repeated the warning with increasing detail each day an urgent advisory on dec 20 warned of blizzard conditions and heavy snow by dec 21 forecasters termed it a once in a generation storm on thursday a blizzard warning was posted to take effect at 7 a m friday describing heavy snow high winds windchills of minus 10 to 25 degrees minus 23 to 32 below celsius and difficult to impossible travel through christmas weekend preparations and response buffalo mayor byron brown saying a potentially life threatening storm was coming announced thursday that the city would be under a state of emergency once the storm arrived the next morning closures of schools churches and offices including government offices in erie and neighboring niagara and chautauqua counties poured in gov kathy hochul expanded the state of emergency to the entire state thursday and said state equipment and personnel were standing by and the state thruway authority which oversees the interstate highways linking buffalo to other major cities statewide announced commercial vehicles would be banned for a stretch in the area at 6 a m friday we highly recommend private businesses to close on friday and saturday erie county executive poloncarz said at a public briefing using a slideshow to illustrate the forecast blizzard conditions and dangers of frostbite and hypothermia by friday the county upgraded a travel advisory to a ban too late critics said for employees who were instructed to go into work poloncarz said later the intent was to allow third shift workers to get home that conditions deteriorated more quickly than expected some people ventured out anyway among them was sean reisch a 41 year old salesman from the suburb of cheektowaga who came to regret the decision to pick up milk and bread friday afternoon as i pulled on one of our main streets it was like incredibly whiteout conditions to the point where you literally couldn t see anything he said the store was closing when he arrived and when he got stuck in the parking lot someone lent him a shovel to dig out his nissan sentra loaded with presents for his young children he barely made it home sticking his head out the window in a cold wind that took your breath away to dodge drifts at last he stumbled into his house stunned i kept saying to my wife all night long i don t think you understand how lucky i am to be here how lucky i can t believe i made it home through all that storm veterans it s no surprise that getting people to heed warnings is a challenge but with climate change intensifying all kinds of global weather events according to experts the stakes are higher people tend to normalize well i ve lived here all my life i went through the worst blizzard i know what i m doing said craig fugate administrator of the federal emergency management agency during the obama administration this is something i think we re going to really wrestle with with extreme weather we re seeing events that are exceeding our past experiences and they re exceeding our understanding fugate pointed to hurricane ian s death toll in lee county florida in the fall and the criticism the county faced for issuing a mandatory evacuation order just one day before the storm hit choosing to wait while surrounding counties posted theirs with the blizzard arriving on the last shopping day before christmas eve many employees some citing the lack of a driving ban said they felt pressured to go to work if there s criticism that it wasn t done right i ll take it poloncarz responded wednesday the holiday erie county emergency services commissioner dan neaverth jr said he had to put his foot down to keep his own family members from running last minute holiday errands in the storm something many of those stranded were likely doing how this fell exactly where it did heading into a holiday weekend he said i think that that had a tremendous impact on people wanting and feeling that need but not everybody had the benefit of a father who said absolutely not under no circumstances should you go out the criticism some residents of buffalo about 27 of whom live in poverty bristled at instructions to stock up on food and medicine before the storm calling it unrealistic others questioned whether the region has enough specialized equipment to handle increasingly common extreme weather after volunteer snowmobile operators and emergency responders from outside agencies sent people and equipment poloncarz suggested wednesday that the county with more money and other resources should take over the city s future storm operations as national guard members knocked on doors wednesday conducting wellness checks guard spokesperson eric durr addressed complaints members did not respond to the sometimes desperate pleas filling social media from people trapped in cars freezing in homes without power or suffering medical emergencies hochul had said friday that 54 members of the national guard and five vehicles would be deployed in erie county to help at one point saturday almost every fire truck in buffalo was stranded along with numerous police vehicles and residents of buffalo and several suburbs were told emergency services were unavailable even plows were pulled from roads if the fire department isn t there chances are the national guard can t get there durr said on saturday hochul announced additional troops by tuesday more than 500 national guard members were in western new york her office said political fallout responding to poloncarz s critique of the city s response brown said that the city bore the brunt of the storm and that its narrow residential streets posed challenges he suggested poloncarz a fellow democrat was crumbling under stress some keep working some keep trying to helping the residents of our community brown said and some break down and lash out i don t have any feud he said the future erie county sheriff john garcia was among those looking for ways to improve after first responders were prevented from answering calls saying better equipment more equipment would help we never thought that it was going to be as bad as it was he said so do we have to get better absolutely fugate said fema has benefited from talking with survivors of hurricanes to ask why they made the decisions they did we can t ask that of those who lost their lives but we can people who were stranded he said we can ask the questions what more information did

the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed this week the convictions of four defendants for insider trading involving information from the u s centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the split 2 1 vote decided that the four had not committed a crime because the information under a recent supreme court precedent in the new jersey bridgegate case was not property and thus the men did not commit the federal crime of fraud according to authorities christopher worall a cms employee at the time provided information regarding changes to reimbursement rules affecting publicly traded healthcare companies to david blaszczak a former colleague at cms who then was working as a political consultant mr blaszczak passed that information on to theodore huber and robert olan both of whom worked at deerfield management co which manages multiple hedge funds dealing in healthcare investments prosecutors claimed that mr huber and mr olan used the information to make profitable decisions worth over 3 million from 2012 to 2014 the associated press reported the four were convicted in 2018 the precedent that saw the convictions reversed stems from the 2020 u s supreme court decision in a high profile new jersey case involving aides to then gov chris christie the aides had ordered the blockage of a commuter bridge for political reasons to punish local officials by creating a traffic jam but the supreme court undid their convictions for fraud because the blockage deprived the bridge s owners of neither property nor money the supreme court had ordered lower courts to reconsider the insider trading case against the four men in spite of a 2019 decision by the appeals court upholding the convictions the defense for mr blaszczak argued that just as bridge access was not property the information provided by mr blaszczak was not property and providing it could not be considered a thing of value within the context of federal fraud and insider trading law as such the 2nd circuit court of appeals dismissed outright the fraud and theft charges against the four men the appeals judges also set aside convictions against mr blaszczak mr huber and mr olan for conspiracy though it left a decision on a retrial to prosecutors and lower courts according to reuters news agency mr worrall s convictions were dismissed entirely and his lawyer daniel sullivan told reuters that we are gratified that the cloud of conviction has been lifted the dissenter on the 2nd circuit court judge richard sullivan excoriated the ruling as overturning decades of law on insider trading the reversal effectively permits sophisticated insiders to leverage their access to confidential government information and sell it to the highest bidders in this case hedge funds that used the confidential information to make millions shorting the stocks of public companies affected by cms s regulations judge sullivan wrote brad matthews can be reached at bmatthews washingtontimes com

fox business anchor ashley webster delved into tesla s stock being down nearly 70 year to date asking the inevitable question if the plunging value is linked to elon musk s acquisition of twitter and his ongoing transparency efforts to reestablish trust in the social media platform there s little debate that musk became public enemy 1 on the left which includes much of the media when he took care to create a level playing field effectively stripping away the dominance they enjoyed on twitter courtesy of like minded executives running the company the ongoing release of the twitter files has only added to the angst on the left which has since set out to not only try to cancel musk but destroy twitter and any other endeavor he is associated with the data released proved conservatives were being censored and shadow banned and that the prior leadership was colluding with the fbi and other u s intelligence agencies to shape the outcome of the 2020 election in a segment featuring investor jeff sica webster noted the stock decline of the world s largest electric vehicle manufacturer adding that tesla is planning to reduce output of their shanghai plant before asking a loaded question if you re a tesla shareholder are you getting pretty sick and tired of elon musk and his ongoing saga with twitter i have to say i ve never liked tesla as a stock i ve never owned a share of it i ve been critical of the company sica replied i m very i admire elon musk for what he s doing for the cause of free speech he s paying a big price for that but the tesla shareholders are also paying a big price for that acquisition tesla was a garbage company it appears that sica intended to say twitter was a garbage company as he continued it was an acquisition that hopefully helps free speech but it was not a good acquisition as said he can t find anybody dumb enough to run this company after he steps down he has to pay attention to tesla which at its peak tesla was had a market cap that was higher than the five top automakers combined sica added before offering a gloomy outlook i don t think the future looks all that bright for them or evs in general he concluded i think soon there ll be more market saturation with evs but i don t think it s anywhere in the next couple of years on the other hand there may be the hope that by getting musk refocused on tesla he will let up on the march toward free speech on a platform the billionaire considers to be today s town square wedbush securities dan ives who maintains his buy recommendation on tesla stock commented on musk s leadership in a report on tuesday according to cnbc the business network noted that tesla investors want musk to refocus his efforts on stabilizing the company at the same time that tesla is cutting prices and inventory is starting to build globally in face of a likely global recession musk is viewed as asleep at the wheel from a leadership perspective ives wrote i think he really needs to focus on operations focus on giving us great cars craig irwin an analyst at roth capital said according to cnbc republished with permission from american wire news service donate to bizpac review please help us if you are fed up with letting radical big tech execs phony fact checkers tyrannical liberals and a lying mainstream media have unprecedented power over your news please consider making a donation to bpr to help us fight them now is the time truth has never been more critical donate success thank you for donating please share bpr content to help combat the lies comment we have no tolerance for comments containing violence racism profanity vulgarity doxing or discourteous behavior if a comment is spam instead of replying to it please click the icon below and to the right of that comment thank you for partnering with us to maintain fruitful conversation bpr insider comments scroll down for non member comments or join our insider conversations by becoming a member we d love to have you please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus
early 99 7 3 cracked piston 4 why on december 1st while delivering a relatively light load 3 500 lbs on my 6 600 lb flatbed gooseneck trailer to south florida i pulled into a weigh station looking to park for the night and noticed the truck running rough once the rpm s got below 2 000 i proceeded to the next exit to a truckstop where i found i had blowby and had lost oil i stocked up on oil delivered my load and kept the oil topped off at my last stop apparently i did not fully seat the dipstick or the blowby pressure increased because it started blowing a lot of oil and i lost power spent the night on the side of the highway topped off the oil left the filler cap off and made it to a truckstop where i was able to park the truck and leave it while i returned with my daily driver to tow it home i pulled codes off my edge used of gauges only and i had p0733 left over from my previous 4r100 p0470 i found the back pressure tube was cracked and of course my persistent p1211 my weak hpop i warmed up the truck and checked cylinder contribution with autoenginuity p0272 cylinder 4 injector circuit contribution balance fault i ran a buzz test which passed not that there was any doubt with the blowby i pulled the driver s side valve cover and tested the compression warm not hot on cylinders 2 4 and 6 2 and 6 were over 350 and 4 was zero pulled the engine and found cylinder 4 cracked with a hole to boot what i didn t find however was the little cracks on any other pistons running it 600 miles with the blowby coked up all the pistons so i had to use a dremel tool with a fine wire wheel to clean the pistons so i could display the burn marks and inspect for fine cracks this e99 7 3 is stock except for the 6637 air filter and i run the 25 hp towing tune on a hydra i monitor egt s measured at the bottom of the driver s side manifold just before it turns up to the bellowed up pipes i try to keep the egt s below 1200 the oil and coolant was clean no mixing or loss of coolant my plans are to assemble my spare 7 3 rebuild project engine and install it this engine will be cleaned up and stored for a potential rebuild what i really want to know is why did this happen the engine had 219k on it when i bought the wrecked truck i put 32k on it towing my 6 600 lb gn trailer with 2 000 9 500 lbs on it most loads were 2 000 4 000 lbs this last load was supposed to weigh 3 500 lbs but i couldn t tell there was any weight onboard nor was there any wind drag my trailer tires are rated for 75 mph so that s about as fast as i typically drive and the truck has 4 10 gears the very last repair i did to this truck was to replace the small hose between the degas bottle and the radiator which had a small leak i was having to add a few ounces of coolant every 1 000 miles or so this repair was done just prior to this trip this was the 3rd 7 3 in this truck the original e99 engine cracked the block between cylinder s 1 and 3 i installed the e99 7 3 from my previous truck which i wrecked and it cracked 8 366 days before this one that engine had fine cracks on most pistons and i had been running a 60hp tow safe tune on my edge skyskijason towed me home that day and we discussed rebuilding options he convinced me to change to a hydra for some real tunes if i install my rebuilt 7 3 in this truck i don t want to ever see another cracked piston i do have another low mileage 7 3 coming to me a friend obtained a burned truck and i m getting most of it i may elect to install it instead of my rebuilt engine here s a short video i posted about the cracked piston i love my 7 3 s but i ve had bad luck the past 2 years maybe it s my fault

former transportation secretary elaine chao warned wednesday that southwest airlines should expect to be under the microscope following the total nightmare that occurred over the christmas holiday when airlines chiefly southwest canceled or delayed thousands of flights causing chaos at airports around the country chao who served in the trump administration and separately as labor secretary under george w bush noted to fox news the stock market has already taken notice of southwest s catastrophe knocking 6 off its shares value since the chaos began on top of that should be prepared for a lot of scrutiny from the department of transportation from congress and from the public it s going to take some time for trust to be reinstated once more between the airlines and also the company she said on the story chao also reacted to claims in southwest s case that their slightly different flight patterns combined with the lack of substantive hubs compared to other major airlines may have also attributed to the fact their passengers were the ones most affected by the arctic bomb cyclone s disruption of air travel thousands of bags pile up at airport baggage claim after christmas delays you know it s ironic because southwest airlines used to have one of the best computer scheduling booking systems of all the airlines chao said they basically prided themselves on having a personal relationship with the passenger so that the passenger goes on their website books it directly they don t have to go to any other website but what evidently was happening is that this is not being kept up during a very very catastrophic period of time she added that the coronavirus pandemic greatly affected air travel in that numerous workers from pilots to baggage handlers left the industry when the nation essentially shut down the coronavirus aid money approved by congress helped maintain payroll for affected employees but the industry was still left in the lurch workforce wise she said that is also contributing to the problems that we re seeing in the airline industry chao said cbs news called out for claiming airplane turbulence is result of climate change chao also referenced a pilot shortage she attributed at least somewhat to new reported faa rules governing how long pilots can fly and where they can go these are almost sacrosanct to the industry and also to organized labor she said so this is a major issue it is one of the factors contributing to the shortage of pilots and again it s very very sensitive and both sides management and labor and the regulators have to get involved in examining all of that earlier on the story guest host trace gallagher shared reaction from chao s successor transportation secretary pete buttigieg buttigieg a former south bend ind mayor characterized the chaos as a system failure and went on to press that southwest must do more than simply compensate stranded passengers southwest is going to have to not only make them financially whole but find a way to really rebuild trust and confidence again they pledged to me that they re going to do that i want to see exactly what that means he said click to get the fox news app the texas based airline also released a lengthy statement and apology in the wake of the crisis which read in part with consecutive days of extreme winter weather across our network behind us continuing challenges are impacting our customers and employees in a significant way that is unacceptable and our heartfelt apologies for this are just beginning we re working with safety at the forefront to urgently address wide scale disruption by rebalancing the airline and repositioning crews and our fleet ultimately to best serve all who plan to travel with us it continued we were fully staffed and prepared for the approaching holiday weekend when the severe weather swept across the continent where southwest is the largest carrier in 23 of the top 25 travel markets in the u s this forced daily changes to our flight schedule at a volume and magnitude that still has the tools our teams use to recover the airline operating at capacity

authored by chris hedges the democrats position themselves as the party of virtue cloaking their support for the war industry in moral language stretching back to korea and vietnam when president ngo dinh diem was as lionized as ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky all the wars they support and fund are good wars all the enemies they fight the latest being russia s vladimir putin and china s xi jinping are incarnations of evil the photo of a beaming house speaker nancy pelosi and vice president kamala harris holding up a signed ukrainian battle flag behind zelensky as he addressed congress was another example of the democratic party s abject subservience to the war machine the democrats especially with the presidency of bill clinton became shills not only for corporate america but for the weapons manufacturers and the pentagon no weapons system is too costly no war no matter how disastrous goes unfunded no military budget is too big including the 858 billion in military spending allocated for the current fiscal year an increase of 45 billion above what the biden administration requested the historian arnold toynbee cited unchecked militarism as the fatal disease of empires arguing that they ultimately commit suicide there once was a wing of the democratic party that questioned and stood up to the war industry senators j william fulbright george mcgovern gene mccarthy mike gravel william proxmire and house member dennis kucinich but that opposition evaporated along with the antiwar movement when 30 members of the party s progressive caucus recently issued a call for biden to negotiate with putin they were forced by the party leadership and a warmongering media to back down and rescind their letter not that any of them with the exception of alexandria ocasio cortez have voted against the billions of dollars in weaponry sent to ukraine or the bloated military budget rashida tlaib voted present the opposition to the perpetual funding of the war in ukraine has come primarily from republicans 11 in the senate and 57 in the house several such as marjorie taylor greene unhinged conspiracy theorists only nine republicans in the house joined the democrats in supporting the 1 7 trillion spending bill needed to prevent the government from shutting down which included approval of 847 billion for the military the total is boosted to 858 billion when factoring in accounts that don t fall under the armed services committees jurisdiction in the senate 29 republicans opposed the spending bill the democrats including nearly all 100 members of the house congressional progressive caucus lined up dutifully for endless war this lust for war is dangerous pushing us into a potential war with russia and perhaps later with china each a nuclear power it is also economically ruinous the monopolization of capital by the military has driven u s debt to over 30 trillion 6 trillion more than the u s gdp of 24 trillion servicing this debt costs 300 billion a year we spend more on the military than the next nine countries including china and russia combined congress is also on track to provide an extra 21 7 billion to the pentagon above the already expanded annual budget to resupply ukraine but those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup the new york times reported military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the iraq and afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011 and the second highest in inflation adjusted terms since world war ii a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined the democratic party which under the clinton administration aggressively courted corporate donors has surrendered its willingness to challenge however tepidly the war industry as soon as the democratic party made a determination it could have been 35 or 40 years ago that they were going to take corporate contributions that wiped out any distinction between the two parties dennis kucinich said when i interviewed him on my show for the real news network because in washington he or she who pays the piper plays the tune that s what s happened there isn t that much of a difference in terms of the two parties when it comes to war in his 1970 book the pentagon propaganda machine fulbright describes how the pentagon and the arms industry pour millions into shaping public opinion through public relations campaigns defense department films control over hollywood and domination of the commercial media military analysts on cable news are universally former military and intelligence officials who sit on boards or work as consultants to defense industries a fact they rarely disclose to the public barry r mccaffrey a retired four star army general and military analyst for nbc news was also an employee of defense solutions a military sales and project management firm he like most of these shills for war personally profited from the sales of the weapons systems and expansion of the wars in iraq and afghanistan we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us on the eve of every congressional vote on the pentagon budget lobbyists from businesses tied to the war industry meet with congress members and their staff to push them to vote for the budget to protect jobs in their district or state this pressure coupled with the mantra amplified by the media that opposition to profligate war funding is unpatriotic keeps elected officials in bondage these politicians also depend on the lavish donations from the weapons manufacturers to fund their campaigns seymour melman in his book pentagon capitalism documented the way militarized societies destroy their domestic economies billions are spent on the research and development of weapons systems while renewable energy technologies languish universities are flooded with military related grants while they struggle to find money for environmental studies and the humanities bridges roads levees rail ports electric grids sewage treatment plants and drinking water infrastructures are structurally deficient and antiquated schools are in disrepair and lack sufficient teachers and staff unable to stem the covid 19 pandemic the for profit health care industry forces families including those with insurance into bankruptcy domestic manufacturing especially with the offshoring of jobs to china vietnam mexico and other nations collapses families are drowning in personal debt with 63 percent of americans living paycheck to paycheck the poor the mentally ill the sick and the unemployed are abandoned melman who coined the term permanent war economy noted that since the end of the second world war the federal government has spent more than half its discretionary budget on past current and future military operations it is the largest single sustaining activity of the government the military industrial establishment is nothing more than gilded corporate welfare military systems are sold before they are produced military industries are permitted to charge the federal government for huge cost overruns massive profits are guaranteed for example this november the army awarded raytheon technologies alone more than 2 billion in contracts on top of over 190 million awarded in august to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons sent to ukraine despite a depressed market for most other businesses stock prices of lockheed and northrop grumman have risen by more than 36 and 50 percent this year tech giants including amazon which supplies surveillance and facial recognition software to the police and fbi have been absorbed into the permanent war economy amazon google microsoft and oracle were awarded multibillion dollar cloud computing contracts for the joint warfighting cloud capability and are eligible to receive 9 billion in pentagon contracts to provide the military with globally available cloud services across all security domains and classification levels from the strategic level to the tactical edge through mid 2028 foreign aid is given to countries such as israel with more than 150 billion in bilateral assistance since its founding in 1948 or egypt which has received over 80 billion since 1978 aid that requires foreign governments to buy weapons systems from the u s the u s public funds the research development and building of weapons systems and purchases them for foreign governments such a circular system mocks the idea of a free market economy these weapons soon become obsolete and are replaced by updated and usually more costly weapons systems it is in economic terms a dead end it sustains nothing but the permanent war economy the truth of the matter is that we re in a heavily militarized society driven by greed lust for profit and wars are being created just to keep fueling that kucinich told me in 2014 the u s backed a coup in ukraine that installed a government that included neo nazis and was antagonistic to russia the coup triggered a civil war when the ethnic russians in eastern ukraine the donbass sought to secede from the country resulting in over 14 000 people dead and nearly 150 000 displaced before russia invaded in february the russian invasion of ukraine according to jacques baud a former nato security advisor who also worked for swiss intelligence was instigated by the escalation of ukraine s war on the donbass it also followed the biden administration s rejection of proposals sent by the kremlin in late 2021 which might have averted russia s invasion the following year this invasion has led to widespread u s and e u sanctions on russia which have boomeranged onto europe inflation ravages europe with the sharp curtailment of shipments of russian oil and gas industry especially in germany is crippled in most of europe it is a winter of shortages spiraling prices and misery this whole thing is blowing up in the face of the west kucinich warned we forced russia to pivot to asia as well as brazil india china south africa and saudi arabia there s a whole new world being formed the catalyst of it is the misjudgment that occurred about ukraine and the effort to try to control ukraine in 2014 that most people aren t aware of by not opposing a democratic party whose primary business is war liberals become the sterile defeated dreamers in fyodor dostoevsky s notes from the underground a former convict dostoevsky did not fear evil he feared a society that no longer had the moral fortitude to confront evil and war to steal a line from my latest book is the greatest evil

are paying nearly twice as much for a dozen eggs what does inflation looks like these days consumers are paying roughly twice as much for a dozen eggs than they were a year ago driven in part by

november 2022 up from 1 37 the same quarter the previous year that increase has outpaced a rise in feed costs which have been surging in recent years supply and demand are propelling the surge in prices while bird flu has hurt industry supplies cal maine has continued to see enormous demand notably in premium specialty eggs conventional egg volumes were actually 2 lower in the quarter while specialty eggs saw a 24 surge in volumes there are a couple of reasons for this conventional egg prices have been increasing so much that they ve been exceeding prices for specialty eggs cal maine s average price for conventional eggs in the latest quarter was 2 88 more than 21 higher than the going price of 2 37 for specialty eggs so why pay for a conventional egg when you can get a less

shares of amc have fallen more than 85 so far this year sinking below 4 as of wednesday afternoon the stock s high for 2022 was 21 09 in march the stock drop comes after ceo adam aron announced a pay freeze for himself and the company proposed a 10 1 stock split branded credit cards and a pay freeze for its ceo have done little to assuage amc entertainment shareholders growing concerns as the movie theater chain s stock hit a fresh 52 week low wednesday shares of amc have fallen more than 85 so far this year closing at 3 84 a share on wednesday the stock drop comes as the company has devised several plans to raise more capital to pay down its debt and invest in acquisitions and theater upgrades while the company was able to come back from the brink of bankruptcy in 2021 thanks to millions of retail investors who turned its shares into a meme stock it has struggled to maintain momentum in 2022 get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters concerns about amc s massive debt load which it had amassed prior to the pandemic have resurfaced as the company dilutes its stock and contends with a slow to recover film industry additions to the company including a popcorn business and even a gold mine have failed to move the needle as the stock price continues to plummet for several quarters amc s revenue has not been enough to outweigh its costs much of that is because of a slim slate of hollywood films the result of production delays brought on by the pandemic and lower ticket sales there is little doubt that the domestic and global box office will recover more strongly in 2023 as more films are released to the public however moviegoing may not return to prepandemic levels until 2024 or 2025 if at all analysts warn where amc s trouble lie are in its fundamentals says eric handler mkm partners media and entertainment analyst he noted that the recent ape stock issuance and previous stock sales allowed amc to pay down some of its more than 5 billion in debt but that the company s overall valuation hasn t changed it s a negligible impact on valuation handler said the credit card is a nice little thing the popcorn deal is a nice little thing all these things are low risk and additive to the business but he added things aren t as nice when you look at amc s capital structure its large number of shares outstanding combined with its high debt levels there s just not a lot of equity value in the shares and it s still trading at a substantially higher valuation than where theater operators traditionally trade he said at some point fundamentals matter amc didn t immediately respond to a request for comment amc s latest effort to right the ship is an equity deal with antara capital one of the company s major debt holders to raise 110 million via a sale of its ape units to antara for 66 cents a piece antara will also exchange 100 million of amc notes for 91 million ape units which would reduce amc s annual interest expense by about 10 million clearly the existence of apes has been achieving exactly their intended purposes ceo adam aron said in a statement last week they have let amc raise much welcomed cash reduce debt and in so doing deleverage our balance sheet and allow us to explore possible m a activity however given the consistent trading discount that we are routinely seeing in the price of ape units compared to amc common shares we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders for us to simplify our capital structure thereby eliminating the discount that has been applied to the ape units in the market he added the company s board announced last week it intends to hold a special meeting for shareholders to vote on the proposal which includes seeking permission to enact a reverse stock split of amc common shares amc declined to comment further when contacted by cnbc the steps that they re taking right now in terms of converting ape to amc if that s passed and then doing the reverse stock split if that s passed that gets them pretty much back to where they were in 2019 said alicia reese an analyst at wedbush essentially amc wants to provide its shareholders one share for every 10 shares they own converting the individual stock value from just under to 4 to just under 40 this new valuation doesn t make much sense to several analysts who note that amc may have more cash in hand than it did in 2019 but it still has a similar debt load and no dividends it doesn t work said reese all it s saying right now is that the shares are still overvalued by quite a lot and they still have quite a bit to drop

big brutal poetic a hero among states alaska has always been america s national park of the imagination a 600 000 square mile invention colonized by a few tracts of reality the name itself the great land in aleut conjures with its sled of a s an expanse that trails endlessly to nowhere alas kaaaa as if the sounds between tongue and palate toll the beginning of a journey it s true mine began weeks before i left florida with the word a whirl of anticipation in my head at night an avenue three blocks away had never sounded more distant or anchorage so near i had decided to drive the 5 200 miles to my destination kodiak island rather than fly in because it made sense to cross the procession of states that had preceded alaska s so recent entry into the union from overdeveloped east to emptier west to a primitive far north i d soon find that the primitive in kodiak is a bit more imagined than real i d left florida late one afternoon in a september drizzle with 12 days to make homer the tiny alaskan fishing town hooked on quaint at the southern tip of the kenai peninsula there i d catch the last outgoing ferry of the season to kodiak giving me a week on the largest island in the country after hawaii it wasn t until i was past the bumpy appalachian afterthoughts of northwestern georgia that the dimensions of the trip began to hit me i was driving to alaska no offense to delaware or georgia but it s not like going anywhere in the lower 48s where simply being cocooned in the contiguous scales down anticipation red and blue state conceits aside there s a sameness of safety and expectations to the 48s that doesn t let up a sameness alaska defies as it ridicules ordinary human imaginations john muir found himself embosomed in scenery so hopelessly beyond description john mcphee described it as a foreign country significantly populated by americans but where people are even more marginal than plants merle colby who wrote the 1940 wpa guide to the state counterintuitively discouraged visits with the book s opening line the best way to know alaska is to spend a lifetime there few do the entire population of the state doesn t exceed that of polk county so what are lesser hacks to do with this outland where mere place names says mcphee are so beautiful they run like fountains all day in the mind my mind s gurgles pictured plenty of whiteness ice peak riddled mountains jutting up from the beds of thick conifer forests a lot of rivers moving fast visions of salmon because for homebodies schooled on nature television shows it s impossible to think of southern alaska without shoals of salmon rutting it upriver to spawn or land kabob like on the fangs of bears i pictured trawlers and crab fishing boats crowding bays at the foot of rugged mountains and imagined great expanses of tundra even though i had no idea that tundra meant treeless heights that i would soon be grazing parts of the tundra or that it s endangered i also pictured embarrassing stereotypes eskimos and igloos and log house settlements disconnected from utility poles and combustion engines although i knew that a i was not going anywhere near places of the sort and b those places don t exist the most remote settlement is a bush plane ride away there are eskimos on kodiak the original aleut or alutiiq people but they have cable tv eat chinese on christmas and see therapists like everyone else the most arresting human architecture on kodiak is the holy resurrection russian orthodox cathedral and its onion shaped turquoise domes testament to the island s colonization by russian fur traders at the end of the 18th century photographs of the church s latest incarnation it s been rebuilt four times tend to crop out the scene a few feet south the closest thing to igloos when glanced by satellite 10 massive white fuel tankers it s the supersize version of alaskan flora wherever one or more human beings gather for more than a few days the 55 gallon drum with a twist some of the tankers in the shadow of the church are imprinted in huge boldface with the letters pms for petro marine services which greet you along with the waves of aleut children as you sail by in the ferry pms since my visit redesigned spelling out the name in deference to its spiritual neighbor and its greener aspirations so most of my prefab images crinkled the moment i stepped on the island but traveling slowly to alaska is as close as we get anymore to conjuring up the sort of el dorado old world travelers on their way to the new must have made up a century ago slow travel to strange distant lands was once a necessity dangerous and uncertain more hopeful than reasonable the utopian images on the other side provided the required courage to face the promise and the menace of an escape from the past as christopher lasch put it that kind of travel is all contrivance now a luxury reserved for the extreme few the few extremists who might afford the risk and expense of a trip to the 98 percent of alaska s untouched interiors a hundred years ago they hunted elephant tusks in central africa and wrote stories like the short happy life of francis macomber today they troll for elite isolation while showing it off in every social medium imaginable for everyone else there is no past that needs escaping the present being as prosperous as ever we plan our escapes into the wild on trails of simulated danger getting into harm s way takes effort or organized tours so when we call alaska the last frontier a title alaska s tourists take seriously we can t mean it the way we did when ohio or indiana or the dakotas were the frontier where cruelty and violence had as much to do with taming the wild country as did singing amazing grace after a hard day s barn raising john troy the state s governor in 1940 said as much in his introduction to the wpa guide when he cautioned readers with vague schoolroom ideas of alaska as a frozen land of ice and snow that they may find themselves deprived of many cherished illusions pretty much as i did did decades later far from a frontier kodiak is an outpost of american tensions an island of ten thousand gray shades as david allen cates described it kodiak s fisheries are still among the richest in a world of devastated fisheries but for an island only a little bigger than my native lebanon and a population about the size of the flagler county school district 12 800 people the density of conflict was everywhere conflicts between big and small fishermen between fishermen and government conflicts within fisheries as overcapitalization and bankruptcies forced downsizing conflicts and jealousies between the handful left of native aleuts who once numbered perhaps 20 000 before russians landed and whites simmering conflicts between filipinos hispanics asians and whites conflicts between developers and environmentalists and the overriding conflict between man and nature the interchangeable parts of american conflict don t change no matter where we go the first thing you see when you get off the ferry is a grim mass of gray docked like an iceberg of steel i took it at first to be one of those warships stripped of guns and permanently anchored to tourism it was actually a tyson foods fish processing plant formerly known as star of kodiak where among other things millions of tons of pollock became fishmeal or surimi a sort of low grade fish paste disguised as crab meat it s big in east asia and in america s fast food fish sticks the second thing you see is the forest of masts and antennas rising out of the four hundred odd fishing boats anchored in st paul harbor and nearby st herman harbor the boats aren t big 30 40 50 footers lolling in the protected waters with names like breezy dee miss heather suzanne ana pilar risky business they don t look like the sort of vessels that can withstand the north pacific s storms among the most violent on the planet but they do these aren t gentlemen s fishing hobbies they re business they are nothing compared to the big trawlers not visible anywhere near the island are the huge factory ships that harvest process and package the sea s bounty of pollock and other ground fish without coming to port or paying the taxes for fish landed on the island for weeks at a time their massive nets can pull in fish by the ton each haul a rake of the ocean bottom as ecologically considerate as strip mining the processors the independent fishing boats and the factory ships form the triad of the north pacific s multi billion dollar fishing industry they cannot all compete for the sea s limited resource what has happened in the rest of the world 70 billion worth of fish caught by an industry that cost 124 billion to run around the time when i visited it s become less sustainable since has kept happening on a smaller scale in the north pacific s overcapitalized fisheries that meant too many fishermen and not enough fish in the sea hardly a week goes by without dire revelations of disappearing species from crab to sharks to cod tuna and rays to prevent overfishing off kodiak the third largest fishing port in the country by fishing volume brought to shore the government instituted a quota system that tended to benefit big fishing operations at the expense of the small independent fishermen at least that s how the small independent fishermen saw it regulators argue that without a quota system the fisheries would have been overexploited faster than they were though by then there was a third equation in play climate change none of this mattered to the consumer fish would keep making it to the dinner table at reasonable prices because there d always be someone there to fish the question was who it wasn t to be people like andre nault anymore the 46 year old montana native had been fishing in kodiak for 28 years when i met him he was one of about 1 500 independent commercial fishermen that have given kodiak its radiance of individualism few of them natives of the island fishermen like nault arrived here in the 1970s and 80s convinced that unbridled work meant unbridled success it was to them all bridled now by quotas regulations hyper competition and also by an american palate that won t eat too much fish though the asian market compensated when i met nault in the harbor he was preparing his gold nugget for a three day halibut hunt preparation that includes baiting 3 500 hooks with undersize pollock carcasses although that part of the work nault left to his deckhands he talked of quitting the business soon because he sees the same drastic changes in the fisheries that have overtaken other ways of life we are losing the small american entrepreneur and we re losing the family business whether it s farms whether it s small fishing whether it s small grocery stores whether it s mom and pop operations of all kinds he said over coffee the walmart in kodiak was a new apparition like the occasional cell tower we are going towards the corporate mentality the government is growing by leaps and bounds with the corporation take over mentality and the government exploding those two things to me spell i don t know it s real scary to me nault has since moved to california i d heard similar words from mary jacobs who in 1979 led kodiak s first all women fishing crew on the 29 foot renaissance with the fishing quotas lots of times it s the crooks that get in and it s taking away from some of the honest lifestyle that we had here she said maybe some of the issues like dragging which are destructive to the bottom of the ocean aren t being taken up because we re too busy fighting for our piece of the pie so what happens to the resource nothing according to men like scott smiley who headed the government funded fishery industrial technology center on kodiak we have no endangered stock he told me with the kind of finality that suggested he didn t like my questions but what of the demise of king crab a fishery that went bust in 1983 in kodiak and of shrimp which crashed three years later clearly knocked off by environmental change we know that it was probably not overfishing it s not clear how the difference was as absolving as smiley was making it sound alaskan logic has it that the collapse of fisheries around the world can be blamed on overfishing but the disappearance of a certain type of sea animals in alaska augurs nothing it merely has to do with environmental change adamant that no one gets it meaning that i was the dumb one who wasn t getting it smiley handed me sheets of statistics showing the wealth of the surrounding seas 1 2 billion worth of exported seafood in 1996 among other numbers his figures were deceiving the national oceanic and atmospheric administration annual report lists just under 600 million in exports of edible seafood with 1 78 billion in non edible exports that year he must not have been aware that the sheets were printed on the back of office scrap paper once used to circulate ethnic and obscene christmas jokes why did the snowman have a smile on his face etc what smiley s figure didn t show is a little perspective kristen johnson another fish biologist on the island told me people give the last two or three years of data not the 15 20 year time period to really look and say this is what s really going on johnson said the system is productive but if you look at population numbers fish landings have been declining for several years we re dropping down the scale all the time it is the same old alaskan gold rush story with a scaly twist the gold nuggets are now good swimmers although not so good that they can always evade ships drift nets long lines trawls radar sonar gps kodiak and the bering sea once boundless some years ago were at risk of becoming like the rest of the world s fisheries barrels good management can keep fish harvesting at sustainable levels but even governments are battling each other alaskans despise federal regulators and some state funded alaskan boosters like smiley are already blaming the potential demise of the fisheries on washington s meddling but it seems to have been just that sort of meddling that stabilized alaskan fisheries including in kodiak king crab and shrimp haven t returned but other species are stable today in 1998 kodiak s port landed 358 million pounds of fish according to noaa s annual report in 2020 it was 364 million salmon is a major industry on kodiak total catch in 1998 the year i was there was 26 5 million fish six years later it was 14 8 million but in 2020 it was back up to 23 9 million and 30 2 million the following year that didn t happen because alaskan fisheries were left free to revel in their frontier mentality it happened because the frontier mentality was tamed it was mildly regulated it happened because romance aside there is nothing so destructive to natural resources than a frontier mentality chest thumping its individualism but even that may have happened too late oil is by far the leading industry in the state providing almost 5 billion in income to 77 600 workers in 2019 fisheries are next with 37 000 workers collectively taking in 2 2 billion according to an annual report by the mckinley research a chamber of commerce affiliated industry cheerleader kodiak by its count still had 5 800 workers in the fishing industry earning 228 million last year the household income in kodiak is 50 percent higher than in palm coast the number seems grossly inflated and masks some signs that kodiak s fishery is declining the island s cumulative catch was valued by more reliable government reports at 88 million in 1997 it was 120 million in 2019 but in inflation adjusted dollars the haul would have had to be valued at 140 million just to match the 1997 value similarly federal catch share regulations ended the ravages to the king crab and snow crab fisheries of the bering sea ravages to fish and fishermen as fans of deadliest catch can attest old regulations forced fishermen to race against the clock today s catch shares have saved lives one of the deadliest catch captains wrote of what had been one of the most dangerous jobs on the planet but alaska s regulators canceled the 2022 snow crab season outright blaming it on warming waters if that isn t the sign of a catastrophe i don t know what it the catch share system reversed the devastation of the fisheries its equivalent from carbon trading to effective net zero emission goals could do the same for warming waters if now on a much longer time scale the waters will warm a lot more before they can start cooling but the same consumers of king crab at your local florida publix are not inclined to support climate change regulations the way alaskans eventually accepted catch share quotas for alaskans it was a matter of economic survival you d think floridians would see it the same way as rising seas and intensifying storms continue to carve up the coast and erode one of tourism s principal assets they do not the state is now entirely controlled by the gop so what republicans think matters and it matters almost exclusively what they think is reflected in state policy florida republicans who believe climate change is happening are far more likely to say it s due to natural causes and only 35 believe individual efforts can reduce the pollution causing climate change according to one recent poll another showed older voters only tepidly worried about climate change and uninterested in addressing its causes so much as building resiliency against it a euphemism for building on frontier like damn the consequences you re familiar with the butterfly effect the allegory that a butterfly flapping its wings at one end of the planet can cause a hurricane at the other the allegory is meant to reflect the intimate connection between everything we do on the planet and especially to the planet no matter where we are it sounds exaggerated but there s really nothing allegorical about the connection between the floridian who substitutes chest thumping resiliency for emission lowering actions and the warming waters of the bering sea that are devastating crab fisheries we are those butterflies flapping our wings in concert with our denialist gums and pretending it has nothing to do with those warming rising seas all around us i retreated to the dinner table of ann and bill barker ann owned shire bookstore the only one on kodiak bill was a retired schoolteacher who chaired an advisory committee to the alaska board of fisheries and there after they d spent two hours educating me about the island s conflicted fisheries the barkers son in law matt corriere began talking about the winter night five years ago when his fishing boat the massacre bay struck a reef rolled over and plunged him and three shipmates into icy black waters off kodiak i found it very exciting at the time he said laughing about the very first moments after the 86 foot crab fishing vessel rolled it s not a happy laugh it s more self ridiculing he was the youngest member of the crew the others knew better i was joking with the other guys laughing i thought this was great young crab fishermen have an idea that they are invincible and i didn t think anything was going to happen i mean i m in the water in the middle of the night this is just part of fishing i remember saying that they were all kind of freaking out and i said hey we re crab fishermen this is great not for one minute did i think that we would not make it matt was 23 at the time bill corbin was 45 tom salisbury 48 jock bevis 42 remember that name jock bevis they all died one of a heart attack as he was jumping in the water the other two of hypothermia even though all wore survival suits designed to resist the water s lethal cold at least temporarily matt blames alcohol and drugs which were found in the skipper s bloodstream the skipper had fallen asleep as he piloted the boat to a different destination at 3 a m and he struck a reef opening a 9 foot gash in the bottom of the boat whether because he was younger or healthier or in a different mental frame of mind hypothermia spared matt long enough that he made it to a rocky shore where he was rescued by the coast guard helicopter that had already retrieved two of his three shipmates bodies for about six months afterward i was really kind of a mess matt said still punctuating his story with a nervous laugh it just made me grow up a little faster it s changed me completely i was young and wild and did many things i will not speak of now i stopped commercial fishing basically but he has no fear of boats or of the ocean the ocean he cussed and cursed after making it to the rocks of humpy cove the night of the accident he s now a general contractor who owns his own company matt s is not an unusual story on kodiak the island until the 1990s was losing on average 24 commercial fishermen a year to the sea an occupational fatality rate 20 times the national average according to the centers for disease control eighteen fishermen died in 1993 the year of the massacre bay accident every time the island lost a fisherman all of its other conflicts receded to a disagreeable black dot but fishing safety has been another huge improvement not least because of federal and state regulations like that quota system the deadliest catch captain boasted about between 2000 and 2014 average annual fatalities were cut by more than half with further declines almost every year in 2015 and in 2022 no one died on the job the barkers still fished for salmon as many residents on the island do not commercially but for pleasure for the culture of it especially for canning before i left they handed me a stash of cans i rationed them for weeks as i crossed montana the dakotas and the midwest feeling every time i cracked open a can as if i were tasting alaska at its purest i ve been on a hunt for that salmon taste ever since when you drive along an old back road in the lower forty eight and come upon a yard full of manufactured debris where auto engines hang from oak limbs over dark tarry spots on the ground and fuel drums lean up against iron bathtubs near vine covered glassless automobiles that are rusting down into the soil john mcphee wrote in coming into the country you have come upon a fragment of alaska the people inside are alaskans who have not yet left for the north on kodiak the kalakala was part of that strange northern migration of junk that keeps blackening the alaskan landscape from kodiak to prudhoe bay and everywhere in between where human beings tread because that s what they do they remake their surroundings in their image i spotted the kalakala by chance within an hour of driving off the ferry onto kodiak as i was wandering aimlessly wherever there was gravel or asphalt for my venture what looked like a monstrous ufo was moored next to piles of junky metal and a couple of trucks it would catch anybody s eye i parked approached walked up to it i could touch its steel walls from the wharf even its name sounded outlandish i took it to be indigenous to kodiak a mass of rusting history until i spotted peter bevis the closest thing i came to a bear on the island as his friendly smile welcomed me from behind a jungle of a beard we struck up a conversation as if we d always known each other and spent the next two hours walking the decks and bowels of the kalakala he d flown in from seattle that morning he was there to prepare for the kalakala s journey home home to puget sound he d been working on it for years this sculptor who spent fishing seasons in kodiak to pile up money and have time for his art the rest of the year who d lost a brother to a crabbing accident the same josh bevis who died in the massacre bay accident and who d fallen for the kalakala to the point of passion after he d spotted it rotting on the same wharf years before this pile of junk had found its savior bevis wanted to do nothing less with the kalakala than picasso had done with that rusty old handlebar transforming it into one of his most famous works of art with one touch of genius to bevis it was just a matter of bringing the kalakala back to its artistic roots it had started life as the peralta a san francisco bay ferry in 1926 it partly sank two years later partly burned a few years after that and was sold to the puget sound navigation company which had it rebuilt and put back to work in time for july 4 1935 it looked like a stepchild of norman bel geddes the designing father of streamlining though he didn t have anything to do with it it was renamed kalakala pronounced kah lock ah lah a chinook word meaning flying bird but also hen or eagle this bird was 276 feet long though prone to collisions because of the way the design restricted the pilot s visibility it became known all over the world for its art deco style its 500 upholstered armchairs its metal walls its rivets replacing welding its own band the flying birds of course and ballroom dances on weekend nights when it took a break from ferrying 110 cars and 2 000 people at a time its parties were broadcast on am radio the new york times called it radically different from any ship of her type anywhere in the world outwardly she looks like a giant wingless hydroplane her interior is like the lounge of a luxurious hotel in 1945 it was the first boat to experiment with radar the saturday evening post called it the greatest ferry tale since noah according to bevis himself partial to the same kind of puns by the time of the 1962 world s fair the kalakala had been in decline its operating costs rising its car deck shrinking its collisions multiplying its hull decomposing in 1967 it was sold to the new england fish company for 101 551 exiled to kodiak and used as a fish processing plant its bowels the site of a billion disembowelments no longer seaworthy it became a dockside cannery in 1972 then it was abandoned left to rust and rot in kodiak bay s mud peter bevis first saw it in 1984 he saw it as a beautiful sculpture to unwrap the opposite of the way christo liked to do to cherished landmarks it s not so much what i see as what i feel he said as we walked the kalakala s hazards he as if it were his childhood bedroom me as if i were navigating tripwires bevis spoke in lyricisms one hundred million people rode this ferry at the time that was half the population of the united states there s laughter in the steel there s music in the metal there s dancing on the floor and to me that s still there there s still people who remember the kalakala despite the minor exaggerations it may have ferried 30 million people at most bevis always dreamed bigger than any reality allowed as we walked through the ship i could see what he was talking about the scrapes left on the walls by vehicles too big for the deck as america s cars finned for suburbia got much bigger than the model t s and model a s the ferry was built for the self confident immensity of the ballroom upstairs the romance of the observation deck out front with kodiak s old woman s mountain range in the distance the last surviving period bench in one of many half arcaded alcoves but the ballroom had also reminded me of the uneasy atmosphere of that hotel s deserted playrooms in the shining and when we came to the ship s famous engine deep below the waterline it was as if we d penetrated the sepulchral recesses of a pyramid the massive single 3 000 horsepower diesel colossus lying there unhappily disturbed bevis wanted to save the ship bring it back to seattle turn it into a museum he d started the kalakala foundation a decade earlier to raise the money clean the boat of three years worth of bonfires it raised little he paid for the 500 000 expense maxing out 10 credit cards borrowing against a foundry he owned spending an uncle s inheritance he hadn t secured a tugboat yet but said the trip back to seattle would happen in two weeks i didn t believe him when i asked him if he thought it could make it down pacific winds and all he said we don t say down we say home i was wrong that november it made the 16 day journey back to seattle i would see bevis again late there the following year when my own journey took me to washington and for the last time the kalakala made it home but it was never adopted again it never became a museum it never recovered its art the foundation filed for bankruptcy in march 2003 owing bevis 1 million and vendors 200 000 the boat was sold for scrap and demolished bevis heartbroken abandoned seattle in turn angry at a city he felt had betrayed him he died in mid july 2022 in san diego he d tried the impossible turning a sarcophagus of junk back to a glory that may not even have existed quite like he thought the kalakala was his alaska perfect only in the imagination alaska s detours in irony never cease one of the stories alaskans like to tell about themselves is that they re the last rugged self made individualists left in america but they happen to live in the most socialist state in america thanks to the alaska permanent fund that s the black gold kitty that has ensured every alaskan man woman child receives an annual dividend check averaging 1 500 drawn from the state s oil sales last september every one of alaska s 660 000 eligible resident a quarter of them children received 3 284 including the extra 662 lawmakers decided to add to help with energy costs it was the highest payout since the fund began in 1980 the only other time the fund was raided for an extra 1 200 per resident was in 2008 when then gov sarah palin that paragon of anti socialism signed the bonus into law it s the country s only equivalent to a basic minimum income the sort of social welfare idea that keeps circling without finding a footing except in rugged self sufficient alaska it s a great idea of course it s how any state s revenues should be invested and shared but some alaskans typically go nuts when the fund s hand outs are called for what they are alaska needs its mythologies as all neverlands do the day i left the island i took a drive in the country on one of kodiak s two roads the pavement ends after a few miles and a few miles after that a sign pops up warning of the absence of warning signs ahead real wilderness you think for a moment it even looks like it a salmon spawning marsh here a buffalo herd there a dirt road of switchbacks and precipices and bear traveled trails then the punch line near the end of the road about 50 miles from kodiak u s navy trucks satellite dishes a launch pad getting prepped for an inter continental ballistic missile test flight and a rickety sign by roadside that says construction site for kodiak launch complex the 28 million facility on 3 200 acres was begun as a state venture to attract the private sector nasa and the air force had funded all but 5 million of the pad by 1998 a few weeks after i left the air force launched a minuteman 2 missile that traveled 450 miles up and 1 100 miles south before splashing into the pacific what the pentagon was forbidden to do from a montana launch site it could now do to its strategists content from kodiak it has since been renamed the pacific spaceport complex run by state owned alaska aerospace and kept rich by the endless welfare of federal defense contracts every state s basic minimum income and private satellite launches with a few growing pain failures along the way the launch complex was once an isolated nowhere at the east central end of the island the suburban effect is changing that residential homes are creeping closer nearby beaches are becoming more popular the site s detractors noisier the nimbyism louder i thought of something mary jacobs the pioneer skipper of the renaissance had told me a week earlier about her love for the island all your problems are within 30 feet and i think it s that simplicity of life a lot of us want to hang on to i don t know if we can or not but we ll do it as long as it s possible on kodiak as in alaska s 581 037 remaining square miles there s always more room for the imagination

investors holding u s bonds which typically serve as a ballast during bear markets have lost almost 16 of their assets in the past year as the federal reserve increases borrowing costs to tame inflation some economists fear that it may tip the u s into a recession if it goes too far a 50 basis point increase in short term interest rates was announced by the federal reserve in december increasing expectations of future hikes by the central bank increased concerns that the economy will slip into recession but that s been welcome news for annuity sales continued equity market declines and rising interest rates drove investors to continue seeking protection and purchase fixed rate deferred and fixed indexed annuities at record levels in the third quarter said todd giesing assistant vice president limra annuity research our forecast suggests that protection products will continue to propel growth in the annuity market for the next several years annuities had a record breaking 2022 fixed annuities are especially on a tear in the third quarter limra reported total fixed rate deferred annuity sales of 29 8 billion 159 higher than the third quarter of 2021 as noted in the report this was the best sales quarter for fixed rate deferred annuities ever recorded however in the third quarter fixed indexed annuity fia sales reached 21 4 billion up 25 from the previous quarter this beat the previous quarterly sales record of 20 billion for the year to date ytd fia sales were 57 4 billion up 22 even rila sales rose 13 to 10 5 billion in the third quarter sales for rila were 30 9 billion in the first nine months of 2022 up 9 but that s not all a return to pre pandemic levels has been achieved by income annuities during the third quarter single premium immediate annuity spia sales were 2 5 billion an increase of 58 over the previous year a total of 6 0 billion has been generated by spia so far this year a 28 increase over the same period last year there were 600 million in deferred income annuity sales in the third quarter an increase of 18 sales at dia were 1 5 billion up 3 ytd unfortunately traditional variable annuity va sales continued to decline traditional va sales dropped 37 to 13 7 billion in the third quarter the lowest quarterly results since 1995 sales of traditional va products totaled 48 5 billion ytd down 25 from the same period in 2021 in 2022 limra predicts traditional va sales will fall by more than 20 but will these annuity trends continue into 2023 how rising interest rates impact annuities before we answer that question let s take a look at how interest rates affect annuities for immediate annuities and fixed annuities interest crediting rates usually rise with interest rates in general insurance companies earn more in bond yields when the federal reserve raises interest rates as a result they can offer their customers higher rates it is challenging to make big financial decisions due to constantly changing financial conditions this makes long term retirement planning complicated especially for those with limited financial knowledge at the moment interest rates are on the rise as a result debt is becoming more expensive for example the cost of getting a mortgage or a personal loan will be higher on the flip side annuities which are low risk financial products can yield a higher profit does the federal reserve rate affect annuity interest rates recently the federal reserve also known as the fed or the central bank raised interest rates by doing so they hope to reduce inflation which occurs when prices rise are those benchmark interest rates linked to annuity interest crediting rates there is a possibility that that rate might affect the interest rates annuity companies offer on their products however it doesn t always have a direct impact long term bonds determine annuity rates typically the company that sold you the annuity invests your funds in very safe investments like corporate and government bonds during the course of the year the annuity company pays your annuity interest and keeps the remainder to cover their expenses interest rates are influenced by the bond yield which is the rate at which bonds return their value annuity companies can offer a better interest crediting rate for annuities when bond rates increase because they make more money on their investments federal reserve benchmark rate doesn t affect long term bond rates in addition to investing in long term bonds annuity companies are affected most by long term interest rates on bonds short term and variable interest rates are affected by the fed rate as a result the rates for bonds annuity companies are most likely to invest in aren t affected there is still an effect of interest rates on annuity rates even though federal reserve interest rates do not directly affect annuity interest crediting rates they can still have a general impact insurance companies can offer higher interest crediting rates on their annuities when interest rates rise as bond yields typically do as well the higher the interest rate the more money you earn on your annuity whenever you re ready to retire you ll have more wealth in your account as a result of earning interest in retirement you can also expect more income if your annuity account value increases when interest rates are low annuity rates typically remain low as a result annuitizing reduces your income and earnings annuitize simply means to make periodic payments in retirement from your annuity instead of a lump sum in short annuity rates differ from the fed s benchmark rate however they usually follow one another what may happen to annuities if interest rates rise annuity rates generally rise when the fed rate goes up however the exact effect varies by annuity type listed below are the main types of annuities and how interest is credited fixed annuities interest rates have a direct effect on fixed annuities which are insurance contracts paying out a guaranteed rate as rates increase investors can get a better payout for the same premium says philip chao principal at experiential wealth in cabin john md in contrast fixed indexed annuities fias are based on market indexes such as the s p 500 which provide a fixed rate of return there is usually a limit on losses if the index falls and the contract holders benefit when the index rises however the amount of index gain that s credited to the fia can change the cap rate which represents what percentage of index gains are credited to fias can be raised if the insurance company s general account grows interest rates are expected to rise which will result in insurance companies general accounts increasing shoring up the balance sheet enables insurers to offer more attractive annuities explains karl wagner iii a partner at biondo investment advisors in milford pa this applies to all types of annuities eric henderson president of nationwide annuity in columbus ohio states rising interest rates allow us to offer increasingly competitive products chief investment officer jayson bronchetti of lincoln financial group an annuity provider headquartered in radnor pa adds the new money yields of our investment portfolio also increase which is a positive contributor within the overall annuity rate setting process variable annuities you can also expect higher crediting rates on registered index linked annuities rilas a type of variable annuity va variable annuities tend to be more correlated with equity markets the assets of a traditional va not the rila type are held in subaccounts that resemble mutual funds in addition to falling equity markets rising rates will also adversely affect their performance if you absolutely knew that stocks would have a loss i suppose a fixed annuity would be better says wade pfau director of the retirement income certified professional designation program at the american college of financial services in king of prussia pa the exception he says is for vas without a guaranteed living benefit rider which for a fee ensures a separate income payout rising interest rates will give insurance companies more flexibility to increase payout rates on living benefits adds giesing at the same the future direction of equity markets is impossible to predict it sort of depends on whether the rise in bond yields is more or less than the anticipated rise in bond yields that are already priced in says joe tomlinson an actuary and financial planner currently based in west yorkshire england the inflationary effect on annuities inflation can have a real impact giesing told investment news when you think about the cost increases we re seeing today it absolutely is hitting the pocketbooks of americans you can see it at the grocery store you can see it at the gas pump it is everywhere inflation can have a significant impact on retirement finances even when it is normal for instance the center for retirement research at boston college found that spending for retirees decreases by an average of 12 over 20 years although that affects people with lower wealth more significantly according to researchers retirees spend less due to necessity over time this is a prime time to talk to clients especially those that are five to 10 years from retirement about the ability to build protection said kelly lavigne vice president of advanced markets and solutions at allianz life when inflation goes up it s very difficult for everyone but for those on fixed income it s more difficult as a result of the fed s move fixed annuities variable annuities with guaranteed benefits and others can offer more attractive features we know that if inflation goes up the fed is going to act they re going to increase interest rates that s good for the insurance companies as a whole lavigne said you might be able to move a traditional fixed client into a fixed indexed product simply because it will give them a little bit more opportunity to at least mitigate the risks associated with inflation the use of products that increase payments over time can be helpful but they are typically less expensive than fixed annuities he said despite the fact that many people are holding annuities that were bought when guaranteed benefits were at their peak it is unlikely that vas will return to pre crisis levels of optional riders as interest rates dropped many insurers regretted offering vas with very competitive features prior to 2009 the days of those income wars or benefit wars are pretty much over lavigne said as an industry we really have learned our lessons from the past in addition insurers are now interested in buffered annuities registered index linked annuities rilas which limit an account s growth potential while also protecting it from losses previously demand for these products has increased rapidly driven by market volatility and general uncertainty in recent years annuity providers have added rilas to their product offerings in great numbers unfortunately limra projects that rila sales will be flat in 2022 after three years of 30 growth what is the annuity forecast rising interest rates will allow insurers to improve crediting rates while protecting the principal investment from equity market volatility making these products more attractive to investors for the foreseeable future noted giesing as a result limra projects 2022 fia sales to reach as high as 76 billion and increase each year through 2026 moreover limra predicts that income annuity sales will increase by more than 10 in 2022 and continue to grow steadily through 2026 however a market report from s p global has a drastically different outlook because of the high bar set by sales the momentum annuities have enjoyed in recent years is likely to diminish in the next few years the combination of difficult year over year comparisons and increasing distance from the two most compelling growth catalysts the business has experienced in many years a heightened focus on end of life planning amid the pandemic and a favorable federal income tax change will drag on the pace of expansion the report predicts in spite of a strong year in 2021 the annuity industry has seen record breaking sales after the fed rate hike it is also true that rising rates encourage surrenders which has a negative effect growth rates in 2022 and into 2023 will be tempered to some extent by rising surrenders as annuitants seek out products with more favorable rates and more attractive features according to the report demographic changes and market volatility are also contributing to the industry s attractive rates because of increasingly erratic volatility consumers are scared away from direct investment in equities we anticipate growth in first year and single premiums which serve as a measure of new business production to more than offset a drop in renewal premiums the report says additionally a key element in growing a business is the injection of private equity cash the impact of these transactions can be viewed in multiple ways the analysts wrote in the ordinary individual annuity business for example the share of gross contract reserves ceded to reinsurers rose to a new high of 18 7 at year end 2021 it had been less than half of that amount as recently as 2017 are annuities a good investment right now considering annuities current interest rates is now the right time to buy yes it is possible you may want to keep in mind that timing the market is extremely difficult but in the world of insurance annuities are long term products aside from tax benefits and guaranteed retirement income they also have steady growth over time in addition to providing a guaranteed lifetime income they are a great choice for individuals looking to grow their nest egg ultimately your financial goals and circumstances will determine whether they re right for you investing in other types of investments for instance might be better if you re looking for short term growth it is currently possible to expect annuity rates fixed between 3 60 and 5 25 for a term of 2 years to ten years and that s pretty solid so purchasing an annuity isn t a bad idea if you ve maxed out your other retirement contributions but don t be afraid to talk to a financial advisor or other personal finance professional if you re uncertain getting started with the right annuity if you have an annuity rising interest rates could be beneficial in general insurance companies bond yields increase as interest rates rise this means their annuity crediting rates are going up too as annuity rates rise your funds accumulate more quickly giving you more to enjoy when you retire it is particularly important to keep in mind that interest rates have a major impact on immediate annuities and fixed annuities fixed indexed and variable annuities which are typically tied more closely to the stock market are less likely to be affected by them faqs what are annuities annuities are contracts between you and an insurance company where you get a fixed income for your lifetime an annuity can be bought either once or over time in the same way your payout might come as a lump sum or in installments why do people buy annuities people buy annuities for two main reasons guaranteed income in retirement and tax deferred savings for either reason or both you might want to consider an annuity guaranteed income a lifetime guaranteed income annuity may be a good option for you if you want to receive a guaranteed lifetime retirement income need to diversify your retirement portfolio in retirement you won t be able to cover your basic living expenses such as food transportation healthcare and housing with other sources of guaranteed income such as social security tax deferred savings you may be a good candidate for an annuity if you meet the following criteria you ve maxed out your other tax advantaged retirement savings options such as your 401 k or ira you re interested in maximizing your retirement savings with tax advantages it is expected that retirement funds will be withdrawn once you reach age 59 ½ remember withdrawing before that may result in tax penalties and other withdrawal fees it is likely that your tax bracket will remain the same in retirement or even lower than it is now what factors influence annuity income several factors will influence how much income you receive from an annuity gender men usually get higher income annuities due to their lower life expectancies men usually get higher income annuities due to their lower life expectancies age your income will be lower the younger you are as you will have a longer life expectancy your income will be lower the younger you are as you will have a longer life expectancy features if you have a lot of guarantees your income will be lower the payout rate of an annuity that guarantees an income for a set period of time is lower than one that stops when you die for example if you have a lot of guarantees your income will be lower the payout rate of an annuity that guarantees an income for a set period of time is lower than one that stops when you die for example interest rates you will receive more income if you purchase your annuity at a time when rates are relatively high if you purchase multiple annuities over time you can reduce your risk of buying at the wrong time can i lose the principal in an annuity perhaps your principal or the money you give to the insurer to fund

never fear our brave department of transportation secretary pete buttigieg is on the case four days after the southwest airlines debacle with flight cancellations and wayward luggage began buttigieg came forward and vowed to hold the airline accountable that likely is comforting absolutely no one at this point advertisement thousands of flights have been cancelled leaving flyers stranded in airports some for days for many of the lucky ones who have been able to get to their destinations their luggage went elsewhere as of 9 00 a m et today there had already been 2 770 cancellations made for flights into and out of the united states of that number 2 507 are southwest flights according to flightaware the chaos and confusion that began on december 22 isn t over either there is more disruption on the way in all southwest has canceled more than 15 700 flights since winter weather began disrupting air travel on december 22 that figure includes more than 2 300 flights already canceled for thursday other us airlines have since recovered from the storm disruptions denver international airport is leading the way wednesday in the number of cancellations at chicago midway and dallas love field close to half of wednesday flights are canceled southwest plans to fly a reduced schedule over the next few days to reposition crew and planes airline ceo bob jordan said in a video released by the airline late tuesday we re optimistic to be back on track before next week jordan said on the heels of wide scale disruptions we re working diligently to safely recover our operation accommodate displaced customers crews we know this is unacceptable sincerely apologize if your travel was impacted explore self service options here pic twitter com mlwndymned southwest airlines southwestair december 28 2022 advertisement the airline s business model is built around communities not hubs which sets it apart from other airlines frankly i m surprised that this is happening with southwest it is known for friendly personnel and for good customer service at least that is what i thought the events of the past few days will take a while for customers to work through by tuesday afternoon southwest s stock had plunged more than 4 percent southwest airlines stock price plunged more than 4 percent after the airline company canceled thousands of flights on monday and tuesday the public company s stock price had fallen about 4 75 percent to 34 27 per share as of tuesday afternoon holy moly the airlines including southwest airlines received millions and millions of american taxpayer dollars through government hand outs to keep them afloat during the pandemic why weren t staffing problems handled why wasn t software used in the airline s operations updated and made more customer friendly what about its aging communications system sure some of the problems can be blamed on weather but all the airlines have had to deal with the same weather conditions and only southwest went off the rails so spectacularly this catastrophe can t be blamed on just the weather personnel blame the company s communications system too advertisement what exactly does mayor pete think he can do about all this though is he going to keep an eye on customer satisfaction on ticket refunds hotel and meal vouchers and that sort of thing those are the immediate concerns for most travelers customers tell stories of being put on hold for two or three hours as they try to re book a flight or find out about a refund i feel for the flyers but also for the employees stuck with dealing with everything going on they received a memo with instructions that due to the operational emergency there are no excuses allowed for not showing up for work except maybe a doctor s note is this part of your leadership team treating hard working employees like this diva netskid december 28 2022 sleepy joe finally weighed in on the subject on tuesday the day he headed off to st croix for another vacation thousands of flights nationwide have been canceled around the holidays our administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable if you ve been affected by cancellations go to usdot s dashboard to see if you re entitled to compensation president biden potus december 27 2022 i m not saying the president doesn t deserve some time off but this president has spent 40 of his term in office on vacation whether its his 3 day weekends in delaware or off to a place like nantucket for thanksgiving week his trip to st croix as most of the country is dealing with a major winter storm and frigid temperatures along with all the crises he has caused in office well flashbacks to the criticism senator ted cruz received for leaving houston while we were trying not to die from the big freeze that tried to kill us all when the power grid failed came to my mind it s not good optics to say the least advertisement mayor pete wants to run for president again so look for him to be grabbing the cameras for some on air bloviating the guy has not exactly covered himself in glory in his current position though he was mocked for pretending to ride his bike to work at the beginning of the administration when a video showed him taking the bike out of the back of a standard suv and pedaling a short distance to his building new daddy pete took a very generous amount of time off as paternity leave during the height of the supply chain crisis he was also caught in making a phony video as he was overseas on vacation when the rail strike was supposed to be eminent he tried to make it look like he was in d c doing his job pete s more concerned about photo ops and virtue signaling than actually doing the work good luck to those flyers trying to get their luggage

of economic analysis in general most people s finances are probably better than we give them credit for said ted rossman senior industry analyst at bankrate but i think there are reasonable worries that may not last consumer spending remained resilient throughout much of 2022 however stubbornly high inflation has taken its toll and knocked the stuffing out of the financial cushion with interest rates poised to go higher in 2023 and economic uncertainty sure to grow consumers could be starting to run dry at the worst time a lot of people have been able to keep up with the bills they ve been able to save more it s just a question of where do we go from here rossman said that could quickly change if the historically low unemployment rate ticks up as the federal reserve and economists expect he said a return to pre pandemic levels americans personal savings rate reached an all time high during the pandemic as many locked down workers saved on the cost of their daily commute and other expenses and benefited from government checks meant to stimulate spending but the household savings rate now sits at 2 4 the lowest level since 2005 and the second lowest rate going back more than 60 years household financial obligations i e debt as a percentage of disposable personal income hit an all time low of 12 57 in the first quarter of 2021 according to federal reserve data that share has now ticked up to 14 49 well below average rates of the past 40 years as consumers lean more on credit cards and other borrowing as of september 30 credit card delinquencies remained near historic lows with a 2 07 rate according to federal reserve data however that rate is higher than the previous quarter and was reached at the fastest pace on record according to fed data going back to 1991 auto loan delinquencies which fell to the lowest level since 2003 are revving up to pre pandemic levels however those delinquencies are climbing faster than they have during those nearly 20 years auto delinquencies do seem to be the biggest trouble spot at the moment more so than things like credit cards and mortgages rossman said the biggest problem with car loans is that the spike in prices caused people to get in over budget the rate hikes haven t helped he added we re seeing more people taking out 700 or 800 monthly payments and loans that are lasting five six seven years he said it seems like a lot of people have already gotten over extended on this and that does seem to be leading to more worries about delinquencies and defaults especially in the auto space the average monthly payment for a new car was 703 in the third quarter up nearly 26 from 2019 according to edmunds com although delinquencies defaults and repossessions are on the rise from record lows they aren t expected to soar to red alert levels said jonathan smoke chief economst at cox automotive the real worry in the market right now is a recession not a tsunami of repossessions he wrote in a post last week we have been expecting loan defaults and repossessions to increase but long term expectations through mid decade 2025 suggest overall defaults and repossessions will remain within expected norms balance sheets starting to shrink the pendulum is swinging from a place where many of these metrics were artificially low rossman said things don t feel great with high inflation and higher interest rates and it s not great that at the moment the saving rate has slipped to just 2 3 but in terms of money that some people have in the bank it s a lot more he said pandemic aid combined with a drastic curtailing of consumer spending during the height of the pandemic allowed people s savings accounts to balloon fed economists estimated that between 2020 and through the summer of 2021 us households accumulated 2 3 trillion in savings in excess of pre pandemic trends consumers have been draining those coffers to an estimated current range of 1 2 trillion to 1 8 trillion according to jpmorgan chase that trillion and a half dollars will run out some time mid year next year jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon told cnbc earlier this month noting that inflation is eroding the pile of savings and american s dependence upon credit cards and other forms of financing including buy now pay later installment loans is growing rossman said may feel better than a credit card because it may have a lower interest rate and it may have a shorter term but it may also encourage you to overspend he said 2023 outlook getting cloudier headwinds are gathering and that could put pressure on household spending which makes up the lion s share of the us economy the main engine of us growth the consumer is still running but as we head into 2023 three key factors suggest it will lose considerable steam wrote gregory daco ey parthenon s chief economist in a note earlier this month first the soft income trend will weaken further in 2023 on softer compensation and employment growth second the savings dip is unprecedented and unsustainable third the credit splurge is a true risk especially for families at the lower end of the income spectrum ey parthenon projects that consumer spending will flatline in 2023 after growing 2 7 this year persistent inflation tighter financial conditions and weaker global growth could help tip the united states into a mild recession during the first half of the year daco noted with household sentiment historically depressed and savings cushions rapidly dwindling consumers will likely grow increasingly reluctant to spend in coming months he wrote this will become more apparent as labor market conditions deteriorate and household wealth takes a hit from falling stock prices and declining home values but consumers while showing resiliency also are showing some restraint said matt kramer national sector leader of consumer and retail for kpmg consumers are definitely making tough choices a pause on the larger ticket items focusing on non discretionary items he said those adjustments have included buying fewer gifts and seeking out savings he said that frugality has extended to purchase of essentials discount retailers such as walmart and dollar general have reported an increase in wealthier customers we may have a tale of two years within 2023 with the first half being a bit challenged with the economic headwinds but coming out of it in the back half with things looking more favorable and consumers being a little bit more willing to spend with the positive outlook that s ahead kramer said the cnn wire 2023 cable news network

fatf s review on india must be crucial fatf s review on india is overdue as it has been a decade since the international anti graft body had made its review slated to commence in 2020 the review process was delayed owing to the covid 19 pandemic the upcoming mutual evaluation will be conducted by the asia pacific group of the fatf an inter governmental body to identify india s national level vulnerabilities with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse of money laundering and terror financing the last such review of india s anti money laundering and terrorist financing regime was held in june 2010 and it is usually taken up again after a period of 10 years taking these petitions on record the indian supreme court issued a notice on a petition filed inter alia by congress member of parliament karti p chidambaram on 25 august 2022 which seeks to review its 27 july judgment that upheld the power of arrest attachment search and seizure conferred on the ed by the pmla a bench headed by the then chief justice n v ramana opined that prima facie two aspects of the judgment upholding the provisions of the pmla must be reconsidered the first provision is the absence of a legal requirement to provide an ecir copy to the accused whether a person being arrested can be denied a copy of the ecir the equivalent of an fir in a criminal case on the ground that it is just an internal document of the ed the second provision is on the reversal of the presumption of innocence or whether the law can ascribe the presumption of guilt on an accused as against the presumption of innocence in contrast to the cardinal common law principle of being innocent till proven guilty as per this re scheduled assessment calendar the technical evaluation of indian anti money laundering countering terrorist financing and the role of relevant legal framework and agencies enforcing these measures would shortly be followed by an on site visit of fatf experts to the country in february 2023 another official privy to the development said during this evaluation indian financial regulatory and enforcement agencies are expected to showcase their action taken reports and dossiers for the enforcement regulatory and investigative work undertaken by them under the anti money laundering law criminal tax evasion instance and for strengthening the cft combating financing of terrorism regime the enactment of the fugitive economic offenders act in 2018 the anti black money act of 2015 amendments brought in the pmla over the years curbing tax evasion under indirect taxes by bringing in the gst goods and services tax new protocols to better regulate suspect transactions in banks and financial intermediaries and the 2016 demonetization of two large currencies are part of the indian presentation an officer had said last year the high number of domestic and international attachment of assets and penalties issued under the pmla 2002 amended in 2005 and charge sheets filed by various probe agencies under criminal sections of the law against financial crimes and terror funding will also be part of india s presentation to the fatf review team given a fair analysis of the indian economy there are certain areas where economic disarray appears which should be seriously taken into account by the fatf body most notably black money defined by different terms such as unaccounted income underground income black wealth or black economy shadow economy and unofficial economy is rampantly used in india findings show that every money regulator sector in india generates and uses black money for its survival in local and international market society etc and most exclusively these sectors include the real estate the financial market the bullion jewelry market non profit organisations and external trade in india black money persists due to the existence of a demonstration effect model the way to live a life in terms of other points of view looking at others livelihood this overwhelming quest for a rapid social change in india has drastically affected the lifestyles of other people of the society who are maintaining considerable high status and in turn want to be like them for this they want to generate money by any means the government of india came out with a white paper on black money in may 2012 ministry of finance 2012 presenting the different dimensions of black money and its complex relationship with policy and administrative regime in the country which also reflected upon the policy options and strategies the government has been following to address the issue of black money and corruption in public life nonetheless the task of curbing black money is far more complex and prolonged which fundamentally requires new strategies and modalities to be exercised at the governmental level via stronger intervention of the state despite the fact that the benami transaction act 1988 was enacted in india this act could not stop the flow of black money money laundering in india that said the non governmental organisations ngos in india often have complex financial operations including multiple donors investments and currencies often receiving and using cash having to account for high volume of small transactions and using informal money transfers a total of 43 527 ngos is registered under the foreign contribution regulation act as of march 31 2012 as per the new stipulations ngos responsible of receiving more than rs 11 500 crore 1 9 billion in foreign funds annually will have to be accountable the indian home ministry has recently warned that the ngos could be vulnerable to risks of money laundering and terror financing and arguably some ngos may work within or near those areas that are most exposed to terrorist activity or the money laundering activity ngos may have unpredictable and unusual income and expenditure streams so suspicious transactions may be harder to identify it can be further argued that since fatf s last review on india in 2010 there remains a high magnitude of financial and economic anomalies that come under the ambit of the fatf technical review thus the cases of money laundering and terror financing in india require apolitical and impartial scrutiny by the international anti graft body in order to prevent fatf s grey list benchmarking india needs a comprehensive reform model in its tax laws and above all a comprehensive financial scrutiny at both domestic and international levels is an all time need the writer an independent ir researcher cum international law analyst based in pakistan is member of european consortium for political research standing group on ir critical peace conflict studies also a member of washington foreign law society

a simple victory in a modest maiden special weight dec 28 at tampa bay downs meant more than first meets the eye the winner a 2 year old frosted filly named froshado is the 11th foal out of champion ashado whose broodmare days have come to an end at age 21 michael banahan bloodstock director for godolphin usa shared the news wednesday evening while reflecting upon the narrow debut victory of froshado who emerged victorious by a neck in a 25 700 event over six furlongs at the florida track ashado might have a nice filly to finish up her broodmare career with he said she s scheduled to be retired and won t be bred in the coming year she s at gainsborough and she s lived there for many years now she s got a fan club that keeps coming out to visit her every year that s where she ll live out her years froshado a gray or roan filly trained by eoin harty already developed a bit of a following as ashado s 2020 foal she was produced during the mare s participation in foal patrol an initiative of the national museum of racing and hall of fame designed to give viewers rare insight into the lives of mares during their pregnancies including the births and early weeks of their foals lives view foal patrol page for ashado 2020 despite her more public journey into this world froshado s wednesday trip to the winner s circle came as a bit of a surprise as she was sent off as the second longest shot on the board at odds of 16 1 in a field of eight after hopping at the start from post 4 under laureano sosa froshado quickly recovered to track frontrunner broken hearts bay on the outside up the backstretch then made her move around the turn for home broken hearts bay proved a stubborn rival but sosa coaxed more from his mount in the final strides and the filly emerged victorious in a final time of 1 11 14 4 froshado 35 00 wins race 8 at tampabaydownsfl under apprentice jockey laureano sosa the 2 year old filly by frosted and out of ashado is trained by eoin harty for the godolphin racing stable pic twitter com d0tajgjmnh tvg tvg december 28 2022 i didn t expect her to win simply because my stats with first time starters are so deplorable harty joked she d shown plenty of speed in the morning and the fact she did win didn t surprise me at all she s a very temperamental filly a very quirky filly and it s been a challenge to train her but when she does work she s shown plenty of talent harty gave credit to groom roni mansilla exercise rider jeanna nicosia and assistant trainer janelle campbell for the filly s progress she didn t come in until late in the year in september he said david scanlon had her and he mentioned she was a little temperamental which may be why she didn t come in until later i ve got a string down at tampa and she s happy there i ve got an excellent groom with her a very quiet gentleman he seems to put these horses to sleep and he s probably 90 behind this win i ve also got a world class exercise rider in jeanna and a top assistant in janelle they ve got the patience of job in dealing with her and i just mark the charts banahan said his team was happy to see froshado s debut result in a win the jockey had strict instructions not to go to the whip unless it was absolutely necessary and he did well with that he said when he did urge her she responded well and did it nicely we re delighted that she won and delighted as well for frosted photo sv photography froshado breaks her maiden at tampa bay downs frosted by tapit stands at darley near lexington where his advertised fee for 2023 is 10 000 stands and nurses froshado is the ninth starter and seventh winner out of ashado the champion 3 year old filly of 2004 and champion older mare of 2005 the mare s most accomplished runner to date is the 2014

million ticket for ashado on behalf of godolphin at the 2005 keeneland november breeding stock sale where she was consigned by taylor made sales agency starlight racing and todd pletcher campaigned the daughter of saint ballado to a 12 4 3 record from 21 starts with earnings of 3 9 million including victories in the 2004 kentucky oaks g1 and breeders cup distaff presented by nextel g1 ashado produced a full sister to froshado in 2021 who is currently being broken in kentucky at golden vale farm and dropped a bernardini colt this year ashado has always done well with that a p indy line that was the impetus to go to frosted and this 2 year old was particularly attractive so we went back again as well banahan said the bernardini weanling about to turn yearling is quite a nice horse and that will be her last foal harty said froshado will remain at tampa bay downs and target a logical progression through her conditions asked if he saw promise in her wednesday win he was optimistic as all trainers must be who wouldn t when you consider that pedigree he said i think if i keep her mentally grounded i see certainly bigger and better things in her future

the toll from the weekend blizzard that hit the buffalo area was approaching 40 deaths wednesday from the region s deadliest storm in generations homes are only beginning to warm after days without heat drivers are still claiming cars they had abandoned in a region that prides itself on being able to handle frequent and heavy snowfall the natural question is why was this storm so paralyzing officials note that they declared emergencies warned residents and positioned crews and equipment well before the first storm winds blew in but the ferocity of a blizzard packing near hurricane force winds and more than 4 feet 1 2 meters of snow severely limited what crews could do even in responding to 911 calls thundersnow was seen around buffalo n y during a large snowstorm get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters on wednesday tensions surfaced between the region s two top elected officials with erie county executive mark poloncarz swiping at snow removal efforts in the county seat of buffalo where a driving ban remained in place and national guard troops helped to enforce it the city unfortunately is always the last one to open poloncarz said it s embarrassing to tell you the truth in the aftermath of the storm many of the dead were found outside and others were in snow covered vehicles and unheated homes some were stricken after clearing snow others died while awaiting help during a medical crisis a look at the response and aftermath the forecast meteorologists saw it coming four days before the arrival of bad weather the national weather service on dec 19 warned of a powerful storm and repeated the warning with increasing detail each day an urgent advisory on dec 20 warned of blizzard conditions and heavy snow by dec 21 forecasters termed it a once in a generation storm on thursday a blizzard warning was posted to take effect at 7 a m friday describing heavy snow high winds windchills of minus 10 to 25 degrees minus 23 to 32 below celsius and difficult to impossible travel through christmas weekend preparations and response buffalo mayor byron brown saying a potentially life threatening storm was coming announced thursday that the city would be under a state of emergency once the storm arrived the next morning closures of schools churches and offices including government offices in erie and neighboring niagara and chautauqua counties poured in gov kathy hochul expanded the state of emergency to the entire state thursday and said state equipment and personnel were standing by and the state thruway authority which oversees the interstate highways linking buffalo to other major cities statewide announced commercial vehicles would be banned for a stretch in the area at 6 a m friday we highly recommend private businesses to close on friday and saturday erie county executive poloncarz said at a public briefing using a slideshow to illustrate the forecast blizzard conditions and dangers of frostbite and hypothermia by friday the county upgraded a travel advisory to a ban too late critics said for employees who were instructed to go into work poloncarz said later the intent was to allow third shift workers to get home that conditions deteriorated more quickly than expected some people ventured out anyway among them was sean reisch a 41 year old salesman from the suburb of cheektowaga who came to regret the decision to pick up milk and bread friday afternoon as i pulled on one of our main streets it was like incredibly whiteout conditions to the point where you literally couldn t see anything he said the store was closing when he arrived and when he got stuck in the parking lot someone lent him a shovel to dig out his nissan sentra loaded with presents for his young children he barely made it home sticking his head out the window in a cold wind that took your breath away to dodge drifts at last he stumbled into his house stunned i kept saying to my wife all night long i don t think you understand how lucky i am to be here how lucky i can t believe i made it home through all that storm veterans it s no surprise that getting people to heed warnings is a challenge but with climate change intensifying all kinds of global weather events according to experts the stakes are higher people tend to normalize well i ve lived here all my life i went through the worst blizzard i know what i m doing said craig fugate administrator of the federal emergency management agency during the obama administration this is something i think we re going to really wrestle with with extreme weather we re seeing events that are exceeding our past experiences and they re exceeding our understanding fugate pointed to hurricane ian s death toll in lee county florida in the fall and the criticism the county faced for issuing a mandatory evacuation order just one day before the storm hit choosing to wait while surrounding counties posted theirs with the blizzard arriving on the last shopping day before christmas eve many employees some citing the lack of a driving ban said they felt pressured to go to work if there s criticism that it wasn t done right i ll take it poloncarz responded wednesday the holiday erie county emergency services commissioner dan neaverth jr said he had to put his foot down to keep his own family members from running last minute holiday errands in the storm something many of those stranded were likely doing how this fell exactly where it did heading into a holiday weekend he said i think that that had a tremendous impact on people wanting and feeling that need but not everybody had the benefit of a father who said absolutely not under no circumstances should you go out the criticism some residents of buffalo about 27 of whom live in poverty bristled at instructions to stock up on food and medicine before the storm calling it unrealistic others questioned whether the region has enough specialized equipment to handle increasingly common extreme weather after volunteer snowmobile operators and emergency responders from outside agencies sent people and equipment poloncarz suggested wednesday that the county with more money and other resources should take over the city s future storm operations as national guard members knocked on doors wednesday conducting wellness checks guard spokesperson eric durr addressed complaints members did not respond to the sometimes desperate pleas filling social media from people trapped in cars freezing in homes without power or suffering medical emergencies hochul had said friday that 54 members of the national guard and five vehicles would be deployed in erie county to help at one point saturday almost every fire truck in buffalo was stranded along with numerous police vehicles and residents of buffalo and several suburbs were told emergency services were unavailable even plows were pulled from roads if the fire department isn t there chances are the national guard can t get there durr said on saturday hochul announced additional troops by tuesday more than 500 national guard members were in western new york her office said political fallout responding to poloncarz s critique of the city s response brown said that the city bore the brunt of the storm and that its narrow residential streets posed challenges he suggested poloncarz a fellow democrat was crumbling under stress some keep working some keep trying to helping the residents of our community brown said and some break down and lash out i don t have any feud he said the future erie county sheriff john garcia was among those looking for ways to improve after first responders were prevented from answering calls saying better equipment more equipment would help we never thought that it was going to be as bad as it was he said so do we have to get better absolutely fugate said fema has benefited from talking with survivors of hurricanes to ask why they made the decisions they did we can t ask that of those who lost their lives but we can people who were stranded he said we can ask the questions what more information did

can civilization survive these studies might tell us the world s shift away from its current reliance on fossil fuels will be the biggest most expensive and most complex technical project ever attempted by humans if it fails that might mean the end of industrial civilization for it to succeed enormous amounts of investment and effort along with some shared sacrifice will be required these are the conclusions of key recent studies attempting to model the global energy transition energy is essential it s what enables us to do literally anything and everything we do fossil fuels with their ability to store and deliver enormous amounts of energy underpin the modern industrial world but since fossil fuels are finite and polluting it s imperative that we plan a shift to renewable energy systems that can be sustained over the long term a transition away from fossil fuels is not optional in some form or other it is inevitable however there are serious questions about how much it will cost in terms of money energy and emissions how fast we can accomplish it and what kind of society can be supported by the alternative energy sources we adopt presumably a suite of sources dominated by solar and wind power these questions have political and economic dimensions but relying on politics or economics to guide the transition would be foolish without first analyzing the options and their physical world implications otherwise politicians and economists will just try to maintain our current industrial system as much as possible even though this system is inherently unsustainable due to the fact that it depends overwhelmingly on depleting fossil fuels and is generating cascading crises via climate change trained analysts are using computer based models to gauge what the energy transition will mean and how it can best be accomplished but so far transition modeling has received remarkably little attention from policy makers or the general public what we need to know the first efforts toward energy transition modeling mostly estimated how many solar panels and wind turbines would be needed to replace the energy we currently derive from fossil fuels and how much all of that technology would cost but the energy transition will be a far more complex task than just building new energy generators because solar and wind power are intermittent energy storage will be required along with more redundancy in generating capacity because most of the new energy sources will produce electricity while most current energy usage infrastructure is designed for storable fuels we ll have to electrify a great deal of energy using technology electric cars are just the start at the same time we ll need a whole new industry to make low carbon fuels for technologies that will be hard to electrify like cement kilns and airplanes the field of system dynamics is ideally suited to energy transition analysis since its practitioners aim to model changing complex systems system dynamics studies often produce several possible scenarios with each scenario based on the adjustment of a key variable with regard to the energy transition we need system dynamics scenario studies that can answer the following questions how much will the transition cost monetarily not just for panels and turbines but for the system as a whole including all the new electrified infrastructure along with infrastructure needed for energy storage and the production of low carbon fuels how much energy will it take building all this new infrastructure will take energy in the early phases of the transition most of that energy will come from fossil fuels which supply over 80 percent of global energy currently what about carbon emissions during the energy transition society will be emitting more greenhouse gases than it would otherwise due to ramped up industrial processes needed to build new energy infrastructure how much more how will the transition affect economic growth and vice versa if the global economy continues to grow that might make the transition harder as more energy would be required for non transition purposes but deliberately contracting the economy in order to direct more energy toward the transition might erode financial and political support for the project how will the transition impact society s return on the energy it invests in getting more energy energy return on investment or eroi it is the high energy profit ratios of fossil fuels that have enabled humanity to construct complex industrial societies in which the great majority of people spend their days using energy rather than producing it eroi for fossil fuels is generally declining due to the depletion of high quality stocks of oil gas and coal while eroi for renewables is generally increasing due to technology improvements but the situation is complicated during the transition energy costs will come earlier than the energy paybacks thereby possibly lowering the eroi for society as a whole at least temporarily and eroi for renewables could decline due to the depletion of mineral and metal ores needed to build these technologies at scale since it takes more energy to mine and refine lower grade ores how will the transition be impacted by materials scarcity the construction of solar panels wind turbines batteries and other renewable energy technologies at scale will require enormous amounts of metals and minerals some of which are already scarce what are the costs and benefits if the transition goes faster or slower the speed of the transition could have varying impacts on the economy on energy availability on societal eroi and on greenhouse emissions clearly there s a lot that we need to know and adding further to the complexity we can t just address each of these questions independently because all of the parts of the energy system and the industrial system it powers will be constantly interacting that s why we need scenarios based on dynamic systems modeling interest in energy transition modeling is fairly recent but the academic literature is growing quickly dozens of relevant research papers have been published in the past decade though most attempt to answer just one or two of the questions listed above for example a report by mckinsey consultants estimated that the global transition will cost 275 trillion over 30 years that report was criticized here a full discussion of all these publications would be unwieldy especially since many do not employ system dynamics methodology instead let s survey just two recent system dynamics studies that address many of the questions i ve posed one study s conclusions are more gloomy the other s less so dynamic energy return the first study is dynamic energy return on energy investment eroi and material requirements in scenarios of global transition to renewable energies by iñigo capellán pérez carlos de castro and luis javier miguel gonzález published in energy strategy reviews in november 2019 below i ll refer to this study simply as dynamic energy return the dynamic energy return team of scientists focused on eroi because they believe it will be the key to the outcome of the energy transition if societal eroi is high during and after the transition that means energy will be easier to obtain and with more plentiful and cheaper energy other problems will be easier to solve for example cheap energy could enable the processing of lower grade mineral and metal ores in larger quantities thereby making it cheaper to manufacture renewable energy components and install infrastructure however if societal eroi declines most industrial and economic problems become harder to solve whether they involve manufacturing or resource acquisition this study s findings are worrisome currently according to the authors the world gains 12 units of energy for every unit of energy invested in producing energy via drilling oil wells mining coal building nuclear power plants manufacturing and installing solar panels and so on a nearly full transition of the global energy system by 2060 would reduce that payback to between 3 and 5 units the authors note that previous research suggests that an energy profit ratio in the range of 3 1 to 5 1 could not sustain the operation of modern industrial societies societal eroi would decline partly because of the increased need for energy to build new energy infrastructure even though the new energy generators would be producing more energy over their lifetimes than would be expended in building them energy investment would come first while energy payback would be achieved over years or decades therefore a fast transition means that the eroi of the energy system as a whole would decline at least until after the transition is mostly finished moreover the production of energy would need to increase by 35 in order to supply the same level of net energy to society during the transition the dynamic energy return study also found that greater requirement for raw materials could drive a substantial re materialization of the economy the authors estimate that cumulative demand would surpass current mineral reserves for tellurium indium tin silver and gallium the implications of the study are startling if society pursues a fast transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy alternatives while attempting to maintain current levels of energy usage for other purposes agriculture manufacturing building heating and cooling road and building construction and transportation energy systems will be strained possibly to the breaking point indeed under conditions of declining eroi and resource scarcity the transition might fail and industrial societies might find it difficult to stave off collapse energy requirements the second study energy requirements and carbon emissions for a low carbon energy transition by aljoša slameršak giorgos kallis and daniel w o neill was published in nature communications in november 2022 i ll refer to this study as energy requirements partly confirming the dynamic energy return results the authors of energy requirements found that the initial push for a transition is likely to cause a 10 34 decline in net energy available to society again these authors found societal eroi to be a key metric in modeling the transition indeed this study was structured around three scenarios high medium and low eroi the energy transition s cost and difficulty increased significantly as the assumed eroi declined energy requirements also investigated the cumulative carbon emissions associated with the transition to a low carbon energy system and found that they will likely be substantial ranging from 70 to almost 400 billion tons of co 2 depending on the scenario for comparison today s global carbon emissions clock in at about 50 billion tons per year by 2050 if society pursues a rapid transition activities associated with building operating and replacing energy generators will produce over two and a half times the percentage share of society s overall carbon emissions as compared with today s fossil dominated energy system that seems counterintuitive however for the current energy system the authors are counting mainly emissions from drilling and mining not the burning of the fuels that are produced as those emissions are associated with other economic sectors agriculture transportation manufacturing etc this finding means that if society s overall emissions are to stay within the budget permissible to limit global warming to 1 5 degrees the rest of society i e sectors other than the energy industry will have to reduce emissions perhaps effectively to zero how this could be accomplished for sectors such as aviation and the steel and cement industries is barely imaginable unless we figure out how to reinvent many key industrial processes they ll simply have to be significantly downsized the conclusions of energy requirements are relatively optimistic in its high eroi scenario the reduction in societal eroi during the transition is modest and the jump in emissions is relatively small moreover the authors conclude a good life could be achieved at lower per capita energy use by improving the efficiency of energy using technologies e g by replacing gasoline powered cars with electric cars by shifting from consumption choices with higher energy intensities to choices with lower energy intensities e g from cars to bicycles and by avoiding the most inefficient alternatives altogether e g flying comparing two studies what can we learn controversy within the community of energy transition modelers largely boils down to differing assumptions about current and future eroi figures for renewable energy sources in the research literature some studies suggest that the overall energy return for renewables is far lower than that for fossil fuels while other studies find the energy return for solar and wind to be somewhat higher than for oil currently these differences in eroi estimates stem largely from design differences of the studies some studies count only the most essential energy inputs to the building and operation of renewable energy generators these studies tend to find a higher eroi other studies draw a wider boundary that includes additional factors such as energy storage which yields a lower energy profit ratio renewable energy eroi pessimists argue that when modeling a global energy transition the widest possible boundaries should be used indeed eroi pessimists would likely consider even the low eroi scenario of the energy requirements study to be unrealistic because it assumes rising eroi figures for renewable energy technologies would the eroi figures for renewables really improve as the depletion of high grade deposits of minerals and metals forces manufacturers of low carbon infrastructure to expend more energy in mining and refining on the other hand renewable energy eroi optimists point to the recent history of falling costs for most of the technologies associated with renewables and argue that further efficiency improvements are inevitable especially if resource constraints can be kept in check by substituting common minerals for ones that are growing scarce the two studies do agree on some general points the energy transition will require a significant expenditure of energy this will have implications for the overall economy in general energy will tend to be more expensive during the transition though how much is unclear the energy transition will generate extra carbon emissions how much is unclear the faster the transition the more wrenching it is likely to be for society therefore starting sooner is better that s because as the eroi of fossil fuels inevitably declines everything we do that depends on fossil fuels will get harder and more expensive including the construction of renewable energy infrastructure ideally we should have started the energy transition decades ago when energy usage was lower and we had both higher eroi fossil fuels and a larger carbon budget those who seek to delay the transition as the fossil fuel industry has done are making matters much worse for society higher energy usage for non transition purposes makes the transition more difficult because the energy transition will itself require a great deal of energy both society s total energy demand and its carbon emissions will increase during parts of the transition unless energy usage for normal operations transportation manufacturing etc can be curtailed in the best case scenario the energy transition is certainly possible if problematic but well meaning organizations promoting the notion of green growth may be encouraging unrealistic expectations given the costs and constraints outlined above in the worst case scenario the pathway to the maintenance of industrial civilization narrows considerably indeed if the conclusions of dynamic energy return are correct a successful transition will probably require fundamental changes not just in industries but in our economic system as well and the latter would have significant political implications the yellow vests movement and the canada truckers protests offer only faint hints of what could be in store in all scenarios some degree of shared effort and sacrifice will be needed throughout society during the transition although reducing energy consumption for normal societal operations appears to be a key to the success of the transition there is still relatively little discussion along those lines among national and global policy makers that s understandable given that economic growth requires more energy and politicians have learned that pro growth policies are the key to winning elections this is why climate discussions among political leaders quickly turn away from the subject of limiting consumption and toward carbon offsets and emissions reduction targets that are merely aspirational and that have failed to rein in fossil fuel dependency and global warming it s also why climate activist greta thunberg characterizes most global climate policy discussion as blah blah blah energy transition modeling is complicated and imperfect but its conclusions so far should be an urgent wake up call for policy makers everywhere hello washington geneva and beijing is anyone listening richard heinberg

the toll from the weekend blizzard that hit the buffalo area was approaching 40 deaths wednesday from the region s deadliest storm in generations homes are only beginning to warm after days without heat drivers are still claiming cars they had abandoned in a region that prides itself on being able to handle frequent and heavy snowfall the natural question is why was this storm so paralyzing officials note that they declared emergencies warned residents and positioned crews and equipment well before the first storm winds blew in but the ferocity of a blizzard packing near hurricane force winds and more than 4 feet 1 2 meters of snow severely limited what crews could do even in responding to 911 calls thundersnow was seen around buffalo n y during a large snowstorm get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters on wednesday tensions surfaced between the region s two top elected officials with erie county executive mark poloncarz swiping at snow removal efforts in the county seat of buffalo where a driving ban remained in place and national guard troops helped to enforce it the city unfortunately is always the last one to open poloncarz said it s embarrassing to tell you the truth in the aftermath of the storm many of the dead were found outside and others were in snow covered vehicles and unheated homes some were stricken after clearing snow others died while awaiting help during a medical crisis a look at the response and aftermath the forecast meteorologists saw it coming four days before the arrival of bad weather the national weather service on dec 19 warned of a powerful storm and repeated the warning with increasing detail each day an urgent advisory on dec 20 warned of blizzard conditions and heavy snow by dec 21 forecasters termed it a once in a generation storm on thursday a blizzard warning was posted to take effect at 7 a m friday describing heavy snow high winds windchills of minus 10 to 25 degrees minus 23 to 32 below celsius and difficult to impossible travel through christmas weekend preparations and response buffalo mayor byron brown saying a potentially life threatening storm was coming announced thursday that the city would be under a state of emergency once the storm arrived the next morning closures of schools churches and offices including government offices in erie and neighboring niagara and chautauqua counties poured in gov kathy hochul expanded the state of emergency to the entire state thursday and said state equipment and personnel were standing by and the state thruway authority which oversees the interstate highways linking buffalo to other major cities statewide announced commercial vehicles would be banned for a stretch in the area at 6 a m friday we highly recommend private businesses to close on friday and saturday erie county executive poloncarz said at a public briefing using a slideshow to illustrate the forecast blizzard conditions and dangers of frostbite and hypothermia by friday the county upgraded a travel advisory to a ban too late critics said for employees who were instructed to go into work poloncarz said later the intent was to allow third shift workers to get home that conditions deteriorated more quickly than expected some people ventured out anyway among them was sean reisch a 41 year old salesman from the suburb of cheektowaga who came to regret the decision to pick up milk and bread friday afternoon as i pulled on one of our main streets it was like incredibly whiteout conditions to the point where you literally couldn t see anything he said the store was closing when he arrived and when he got stuck in the parking lot someone lent him a shovel to dig out his nissan sentra loaded with presents for his young children he barely made it home sticking his head out the window in a cold wind that took your breath away to dodge drifts at last he stumbled into his house stunned i kept saying to my wife all night long i don t think you understand how lucky i am to be here how lucky i can t believe i made it home through all that storm veterans it s no surprise that getting people to heed warnings is a challenge but with climate change intensifying all kinds of global weather events according to experts the stakes are higher people tend to normalize well i ve lived here all my life i went through the worst blizzard i know what i m doing said craig fugate administrator of the federal emergency management agency during the obama administration this is something i think we re going to really wrestle with with extreme weather we re seeing events that are exceeding our past experiences and they re exceeding our understanding fugate pointed to hurricane ian s death toll in lee county florida in the fall and the criticism the county faced for issuing a mandatory evacuation order just one day before the storm hit choosing to wait while surrounding counties posted theirs with the blizzard arriving on the last shopping day before christmas eve many employees some citing the lack of a driving ban said they felt pressured to go to work if there s criticism that it wasn t done right i ll take it poloncarz responded wednesday the holiday erie county emergency services commissioner dan neaverth jr said he had to put his foot down to keep his own family members from running last minute holiday errands in the storm something many of those stranded were likely doing how this fell exactly where it did heading into a holiday weekend he said i think that that had a tremendous impact on people wanting and feeling that need but not everybody had the benefit of a father who said absolutely not under no circumstances should you go out the criticism some residents of buffalo about 27 of whom live in poverty bristled at instructions to stock up on food and medicine before the storm calling it unrealistic others questioned whether the region has enough specialized equipment to handle increasingly common extreme weather after volunteer snowmobile operators and emergency responders from outside agencies sent people and equipment poloncarz suggested wednesday that the county with more money and other resources should take over the city s future storm operations as national guard members knocked on doors wednesday conducting wellness checks guard spokesperson eric durr addressed complaints members did not respond to the sometimes desperate pleas filling social media from people trapped in cars freezing in homes without power or suffering medical emergencies hochul had said friday that 54 members of the national guard and five vehicles would be deployed in erie county to help at one point saturday almost every fire truck in buffalo was stranded along with numerous police vehicles and residents of buffalo and several suburbs were told emergency services were unavailable even plows were pulled from roads if the fire department isn t there chances are the national guard can t get there durr said on saturday hochul announced additional troops by tuesday more than 500 national guard members were in western new york her office said political fallout responding to poloncarz s critique of the city s response brown said that the city bore the brunt of the storm and that its narrow residential streets posed challenges he suggested poloncarz a fellow democrat was crumbling under stress some keep working some keep trying to helping the residents of our community brown said and some break down and lash out i don t have any feud he said the future erie county sheriff john garcia was among those looking for ways to improve after first responders were prevented from answering calls saying better equipment more equipment would help we never thought that it was going to be as bad as it was he said so do we have to get better absolutely fugate said fema has benefited from talking with survivors of hurricanes to ask why they made the decisions they did we can t ask that of those who lost their lives but we can people who were stranded he said we can ask the questions what more information did you need to make a better decision
