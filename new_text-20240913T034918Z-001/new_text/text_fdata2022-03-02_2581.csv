they ve still held onto the bulk of their recent gains a pause right here isn t that concerning the dow jones and s p 500 have given up a bit more of their recent bounces but their rally attempts are intact the market remains headline driven as an investor you don t need to follow the headlines obsessively but you should be aware that the news could have big market and sector impacts that s especially true now a lot of the assumptions built into markets are being upended inflation is at a 40 year high and europe is aggressively changing decades old defense policies overnight of course that doesn t mean the stock market will go in the seemingly obvious direction the huge 2020 stock market rally amid the pandemic and crashing economy proves that a follow through day could still happen at any time to confirm the new market rally a confirmed uptrend isn t guaranteed to work as the recent market sell off showed but it s a positive signal beyond the 21 day moving average the major indexes face resistance at their february highs as well as their 50 day and 200 day moving averages with their all time highs well above that so the next confirmed stock market rally will face plenty of technical hurdles in addition to major headline risks one positive sentiment is turning bearish just 29 9 of investment newsletters are bullish below the pandemic crash low the cboe

to stem the tide of losses the russian stock market suspended its exchanges until march 5 theoretically giving moscow time to prepare a recovery strategy the russian economy saw sharp contractions on monday after the united states the european union and other western nations and international organizations imposed a raft of sanctions against moscow for its invasion of ukraine last week the u s treasury department which initiated the sanctions initially argued that they would both deprive the kremlin of funds and punish russian leaders including president vladimir putin and his inner circle for their role in initiating the conflict the unprecedented action we are taking today will significantly limit russia s ability to use assets to finance its destabilizing activities and target the funds putin and his inner circle depend on to enable his invasion of ukraine treasury secretary janet yellen claimed in a statement in addition to other sanctions the united states ordered a number of major russian banks including the country s central bank to suspend transactions in u s dollars swift an international organization that authenticates bank transfers also blocked the banks from accessing its network effectively suspending their ability to engage in transactions with the rest of the world after the sanctions were announced the russian ruble collapsed in value appreciating 30 percent against the u s dollar a number of western companies also indicated that they would withdraw from russia to avoid violating sanctions rules while putin and his allies had reportedly stockpiled a 630 billion war chest of foreign currency for use in such an emergency to be exchanged for rubles within russia in order to keep the exchange rate from collapsing the suspension of international transactions appears to have pre empted this strategy media reports also indicated that some of the russian government s foreign currency had been stored in western countries and promptly frozen at the outset of the conflict preventing the kremlin from accessing it to stem the tide of losses the russian stock market suspended its exchanges until march 5 theoretically giving moscow time to prepare a recovery strategy russia invaded ukraine on february 24 after months of building up troops on ukraine s borders however the invasion has bogged down in the wake of fierce ukrainian resistance and severe deficiencies have been revealed in the russian army including low morale and the extensive use of untrained conscripts an estimated 4 500 russian troops have lost their lives in the first week of the conflict a larger number than the united states has lost during its nineteen year military presence in iraq diplomatic efforts to end the war and withdraw russian troops remain ongoing although negotiators have reported remained at an impasse russian troops have continued their offensives on major ukrainian cities including kyiv and kharkiv leading hundreds of thousands of ukrainians to flee to the country s west and to neighboring countries trevor filseth is a current and foreign affairs writer for the national interest image reuters

depression a global health crisis the poignant and powerful article calls for immediate and united action to reduce the global burden of depression stating that the world is failing to tackle deeper sustain and increasingly serious global crisis of depression that article is one of many data points demonstrating an undeniable urgent need to help address this burden and bring support to those affected by the disease our approach to commercialization for axs 05 is innovative and purposeful and we are prepared to execute if approved field leadership remains excited and have fully recruited the field force all of whom are ready to join axsome immediately upon approval the market access team continues to engage in permitted payer discussions in sharing awareness of axsome and the product profile distribution and patient support services are ready to turn on at launch and marketing materials are ready to be deployed pending adjustments for final label if approved axs 05 would be an important new treatment option for the many americans living with depression and we are prepared and ready to bring this meaningful innovation to patients i will now shift gears to address launch preparations for axs 07 for the acute treatment of migraine despite recent innovation there continues to be close to 70 dissatisfaction rate with currently available therapies demonstrating high unmet need for the 37 million americans who experience migraine given the current migraine landscape our commercialization strategy for the acute migraine market will be strategic and highly targeted in terms of preparation marketing efforts and launch planning are well underway and tracking accordingly permitted payer discussions have commenced and sales force recruiting is underway consistent with the axs 05 sales rep offers all offers for the axs 07 salesforce will be made contingent upon approval we are excited about the opportunity to potentially bring to market another option for the any americans suffering from migraine lastly our digital centric commercialization or dcc platform remains fundamental to the commercialization strategy the dcc platform is a technology enabled platform designed to use streamlined systems and digital enablement tools combined with sophisticated data and analytics to allow for a more effective efficient and meaningful engagement with physicians and patients the platform is fully implemented tested and ready for execution our commercial launch strategy is innovative and purposeful with the intent to bring important new products to market in a meaningful way the differentiated clinical profiles for both axs 05 and axs 07 have the potential to bring significant benefit to patients and physicians who treatment them we remain excited about the opportunity to potentially bring these important new products to market i will now turn it over to nick who will review our financials nick pizzie chief financial officer thank you lori and good morning everyone today i will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and provide some financial guidance we ended the year with approximately 87 million in cash compared to roughly 115 million at the end of the third quarter a net decrease of approximately 28 million inclusive of utilization of our atm facility in q1 2022 our proforma cash balance as of year end is approximately 106 million r d expenses were 13 8 million for the quarter ending december 31st 2021 versus 17 4 million for the comparable period in 2020 the decrease was due to the conclusion of several clinical trials which were ongoing in the comparable prior period for the year r d expenses were 58 1 million compared to 70 2 million for fiscal year 2020 r d expense during 2020 included a one time charge of 10 2 million related to the pfizer license agreement g a expenses were 18 8 million for the quarter ending december 31st 2021 and 10 4 million for the comparable period in 2020 the increase was primarily related to pre commercial activities at personnel expense along with an increase in non cash stock compensation expense for the year g a expenses were 66 6 million compared to 28 9 million for the comparable period in 2020 the increase was primarily due to the build out of the commercial function along with an increase in stock compensation expense net loss was 34 million or 0 90 per share for the three months ended december 31st 2021 compared to a net loss of 29 2 million or 0 78 per share for the comparable period in 2020 net loss for the year was 130 4 million or 3 47 compared to a net loss of 102 9 million or 2 07 per share for fiscal year 2020 as a reminder in q4 of 2021 we expanded our term loan facility with hercules capital to 300 million with up to 120 million available upon fda approval of axs 05 in mdd and axs 07 in migraine and access to an additional 130 million thereafter this committed non dilutive capital gives us additional financial flexibility through both anticipated potential commercial launches for axs 05 and axs 07 we believe our year end proforma cash position of 106 million along with the remaining committed capital from our 300 million term loan facility is sufficient to fund anticipated operations based on the current operating plan into 2024 that concludes our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial review i will now turn the call back to mark to lead the q a discussion mark jacobson chief operating officer thank you nick operator may we please have our first question questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of charles duncan of cantor fitzgerald your line is now open please go ahead pete stavropoulos cantor fitzgerald analyst hi this is pete stavropoulos on for charles good morning and congratulations on all the progress first question is for 005 can you provide any color on the next steps with the fda and anticipated timing and has there been any other dialogue with the fda relating anything about efficacy or safety or anything else herriot tabuteau chief executive officer great thank you for the question so i ll turn it to mark to talk about the regulatory communications and interactions with the fda mark jacobson chief operating officer hey pete good morning so the current snapshot is as you re aware we were made of two deficiencies pertaining to cmc in particular analytical methods a number of months ago we subsequently responded to those efficiencies addressing them and fda has confirmed receipt of those acknowledgement receipts and has told us they are reviewing our responses so that s still the current snapshot we have not been made aware of any other deficiencies or anything like that no discussion around efficacy safety or things like that and as that proceeds we ll continue to keep you updated in terms of how we re thinking about timing we don t have any guidance for you or specific feedback that we ve received so what we re doing for planning purposes is we re using kind of the major amendment framework to inform our planning processes and just as a reminder to that during the course of a normal review if there is a major amendment submitted that fda accepts to review that typically expends the pdufa clock by three months in total and so again that s our guidance we haven t been told by fda that that s the process or procedures they re using but that s what we re using just for planning purposes so solely that s helpful pete stavropoulos cantor fitzgerald analyst yep thank you and for 05 in alzheimer s agitation can you give us a sense of how enrollment is going and has there been any impact by covid herriot tabuteau chief executive officer sure thanks for the question enrollment is proceeding well and it puts us on track to meet our guidance of the first half of 2023 in terms of reporting results we did discuss in the release this morning that the target number of events which determines actually when we would be able to stop the study that is it s a good thing that those events are lower than our projections because it implies potentially greater than expected durability of effect but it does make us want to look at the design of the trial and also take advantage of the fact that we have breakthrough therapy designations with the fda for the syndication and consult with them we re very excited that this is pioneering work which we are conducting and this is the first time that this study design has been used in this syndication in alzheimer s disease agitation with axs 05 and so we want to make sure that we re looking at the study very carefully pete stavropoulos cantor fitzgerald analyst ok and switching gears and last question for 07 given the treatment landscape for migraine with oral cgrp drugs and taking share from the triptans as well as the cgrp monoclonals can you help us understand the residual unmet need and product positioning lori englebert senior vice president commercial and business development yeah hi i m happy to take that thanks for the question so the migraine landscape continues to have a high unmet need recently as recently as a year ago champ a well known patient advocacy organization performed a very extensive survey which shows that 70 of patients are still dissatisfied with the current therapies available and to give you a further data point that i think was fairly pointing and driving that point home is that that survey revealed that 55 of migraine patients have cycled through at least 10 different therapies it s a point that that isn t lost on me that cycling through that many therapies needs that there s for sure a continued high level dissatisfaction and again that was as recently as a year ago and i also just want nick mentioned that triptans are still 85 of the market share out in the current treatment landscape we do think that given our clinical profile there s a great potential for the product pete stavropoulos cantor fitzgerald analyst all right thank you for taking our questions operator thank you our next question comes from joon lee of truist securities joon lee truist securities analyst hey guys thanks for taking our questions and thanks for the updates so just to summarize your response to the prior question you re working assumption based on what you call a major amendment framework is a three month extension under pdufa is that correct and can you share any references supporting that assumption mark jacobson chief operating officer hey joon it s mark so don t take that as written in stone we re just using that for something to allow us to run the business and for planning purposes and why do we think about it like that because again during the course of a normal review if you have a substantive addition amendment or additional data analysis etc that fda accepts to review right if they accept to review it that s a major amendment and then depending on what you submit the clock can be extended by say two months to three months depending on the nature of the content so if you go on to the fda s website and check out their guidance the desk reference manual things like that it gives you categories of what triggered say a two month or a three month and we re just assuming for planning purposes given the timeline extension at play given that there s no pdufa clock we re assuming that that three months is why the three months because that s typically the time that fda has determined they need in order to review additional data so it s similar here but we re just off the clock and so that s the thinking of it and is it going to be three months and we don t know we haven t again we haven t received that specific feedback that they re going to take action in three months from our submission that s not what it is but we think it s in absence of any direct commentary like that that s what we re using because that s information that fda has provided publicly in terms of the normal course of a review so no other references for you besides standard fda processes and procedures joon lee truist securities analyst understood that s fair and thank you so much that s helpful and then one more question regards to your accord study in alzheimer s agitation you re seeing a lower event of relapse than you projected and then you re implying that that could be due to drugs having a greater than anticipated effect and then you re looking to have a dialogue with fda for potential trial amendments what kind of amendment did you have in mind is this an interim look and an interim analysis so that for possibility of a superiority at interim we love to hear your elaboration on what you hope to accomplish with that meeting with the fda on accord thank you herriot tabuteau chief executive officer yeah so joon thanks for the question so the reason why we mentioned that is when you conduct and design a randomized growth study the timing of when you stop that study is kind of up in the air it depends on the number of events as opposed to standard parallel group design where the study might be let s say five weeks or six weeks in duration and so we do watch the event rate carefully and also typically the way that those parameters are set out prospectively is that it s based on prior information with a particular indication in the case of alzheimer s disease agitation there currently is no product that is approved and so there s very little in terms of precedent so we want to make sure that given that the study is blinded and we actually don t know what s going on i want to make sure that we look at the design very carefully and that we dialogue with the fda to make sure that this is an appropriate study design joon lee truist securities analyst when can we expect an update on that thank you herriot tabuteau chief executive officer this is something that we would expect to provide to the street fairly quickly so this is active as you know the study is ongoing and we do have an open dialogue with the fda on the indication joon lee truist securities analyst great thank you herriot tabuteau chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vamil divan of mizuho securities your line is now open please go ahead vamil divan mizuho securities analyst ok thanks for taking the questions and for the update so one thing just to clarify because we get this question a lot when trials are ongoing and the events are not accruing the way initially expected so just to be clear so you don t know you have no sense of whether it s fewer events in the treatment arm or potentially fewer events in the placebo arm or both just to be clear it s obviously that fewer events in the treatment arm is good but at this point you just don t know so maybe you could just clarify that because we re getting a couple of questions i want to make sure that s clear and then my second question going back to the 05 discussion on mdd i think it s just been confusing i think for you and for all of us on path sort of taken with the fda where you did not receive sort of an official crl but there s been sort of back and forth dialogs so i m just wondering if you ve received any other further insights from the fda as to why this unusual path is taking place is there why wasn t there some more formal communication and actual announcement and then maybe an official pushout of the action it would probably be helpful for your planning purposes as well so i m just curious if you have any other insights on why it s gone this route as opposed to what we ve seen previously herriot tabuteau chief executive officer sure i ll let amanda answer the first question and then we ll address the second question amanda jones senior vice president clinical development sure so thanks for the question so the relapse rate that we re looking at it s blinded so this study that study period is fully blinded so we don t know which treatment arm that relapses are recurring in so that s herriot tabuteau chief executive officer and then with regards to the further insights into why the fda delay we don t really know what we do know that has been publicly discussed is which also is reflective of what s been happening with other pdufa gold in general in the industries is there is a capacity a resource constraint at the fda could that be contributing to this particular situation perhaps what we are focused on is making sure that we respond to the fda as quickly as possible in the best possible fashion to allow them to continue the review of the nda so we re happy that they have continued to review the nda and with regards to the cmc deficiencies that were the fda was very prescriptive in terms of what they wanted to see and our team was able to respond to that so we ll continue to do that currently there are no open items as mark mentioned vamil divan mizuho securities analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from marc goodman of svb leerink your line is now open please go ahead marc goodman svb leerink analyst yes good morning everyone can you talk about just on those i got a couple of questions i know 07 first of all has the fda done the manufacturing inspection yet have they told you that if there s a date if they haven t done it yet herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so with regards to 07 what they have told us is that completing the inspection by the pdufa date will not be an issue marc goodman svb leerink analyst right but have they done it yet herriot tabuteau chief executive officer yes so in the typical course of an nda review we made an exception with axs 05 during the unusual situation we refrain from providing the back and forth but we have disclosed the fda has told us directly that their prior warning that there might be a delay in the pdufa date because of a delay in conducting the facility inspection if that is no longer an issue marc goodman svb leerink analyst have you started labeling discussions on that product yet herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so again we won t be commenting on the back and forth however the pdufa date is still valid which is april 30th and typically labeling discussion is just to give you a sense of timing of a rhythm of nda reviews typically those occur at approximately one month prior to the pdufa date marc goodman svb leerink analyst well then maybe you can just flip to 05 and when did you file your response exactly to fda so we can know when that three months in your head you know the clock started in your head mark jacobson chief operating officer hey mark it s mark and so that was around year end the first part of the year what we re tethering to is when we received acknowledgment of receipt and confirmation of review and that s around the time we gave that which i think was like mid january and that is that s how we re thinking about i guess you could say like potential marc goodman svb leerink analyst well for planning purposes not guidance mark jacobson chief operating officer potential range i think somewhere in there if you add three months but again that s not guidance from us that s just potential range where something could occur marc goodman svb leerink analyst right so has there been any type of label and negotiations on this product or will you not comment on that either herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so mark for axs 05 given the unusual situation we have sought to provide the street with updates that are definitive so whenever we get anything definitive from the fda we have provided an update given the unusual situation the unusual situation being lack of a pdufa date but with an ongoing review so we do think that that would be something that is definitive and so currently you could expect that once we have something definitive on that front that we would look to let the street know marc goodman svb leerink analyst and something definitive would also be if you responded and the fda basically came back and asked you a follow up question would that be definitive like is that happened yet they acknowledge your receipt but have they actually asked you for anything else or so any herriot tabuteau chief executive officer yeah so what we said is that we would let the street know once there is anything definitive and that s clear from the fda we ve been doing that and so if you have not heard anything then there is nothing marc goodman svb leerink analyst right ok and then just completely different subject that the smoking cessation can you just describe the type of study that you re planning in the program that you re planning herriot tabuteau chief executive officer yeah so i ll turn that over to amanda amanda jones senior vice president clinical development sure so consistent with our prior practice we ll reveal the whole study design once we announced the launch of it but just to speak generally the study design will be similar to other registration trials for smoking cessation products these designs typically incorporate short treatment periods followed by treatment pre observation period marc goodman svb leerink analyst and this is going to start when amanda jones senior vice president clinical development we intend to provide further guidance on initiation of the study within a year marc goodman svb leerink analyst ok thanks operator thank you our next question comes from joseph thome from cowen and company your line is now open please go ahead joseph thome cowen and company analyst hi there good morning and thank you for taking my questions maybe for the axs 05 review i know you highlighted at the top line merit data to the fda middle of last year have you provided any additional data to the agency on that trial and that s my first question and i have a would follow up herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so we did make the fda aware of the results of the study and provided that information to the fda and we have not made we have not provided additional information apart from the result of the trial joseph thome cowen and company analyst all right and then on the axs 07 review are the analytical concerns that popped up with axs 05 applicable to axs 07 did you have to make any changes there or is that specific to axs 05 herriot tabuteau chief executive officer that was specific to axs 05 so we don t see any direct connection between the two joseph thome cowen and company analyst ok perfect and then maybe just last one on the alzheimer s agitation update i guess how consistent are agitation symptoms between patients are we now hitting a point where it s just been too long for too many patients or is it common that you re going to have patients that have less severe disease and maybe just wouldn t have had an agitation relapse with that treatment kind of how consistent is the thesis here herriot tabuteau chief executive officer there definitely is variability in the symptoms of the disease so patients who have alzheimer s disease who are agitated they have a range of symptoms so for example one of the common symptom scale the cohen mansfield agitation inventory has 29 items so and each of those items corresponds to a separate behavior and those behaviors are a clustered into different groups and so that reflects the variability in the presentation so agitation can be manifested in different ways depending on the patient joseph thome cowen and company analyst ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt kaplan of ladenburg thalmann your line is open please go ahead matt kaplan ladenburg thalmann and company inc analyst hi good morning i just wanted to shift topics a little bit as may be for lori can you talk a little bit about your commercial prep and specifically how you interactions have been going with payers and discussions for 05 and 07 on the payer front lori englebert senior vice president commercial and business development yeah hi matt thanks for the questions so as i ve stated in the prepared remarks commercial prep for 05 is we are ready to go and 07 is well on its way tracking accordingly to potential launch plans in terms of payer engagements for 05 we have engaged in permitted payer discussions since april of last year and the amount of payers that we ve engaged within a permitted fashion covers almost the majority of all commercial lives covered so we ve had a great representation of introducing axsome as well as the clinical profile of 05 to all the payers the potential payers in making decisions what i can tell you is that payers recognize that there s an unmet need in mdd and they do recognize the novel mechanism of action associated with 05 five and they re impressed by the clinical profile again there are 20 mdd patients diagnosed right now we see trends of that number continuing to increase we know that two thirds do not achieve remission and the clinical profile for axs 05 is extremely compelling given the data package that we have with symptom reduction as early as one week and achievement of remission in two weeks so we re encouraged by the discussions that we ve had with payers and look forward to tell anymore once we get approval matt kaplan ladenburg thalmann and company inc analyst right and then for axs 07 just given the phase 3 data which showed superiority to triptan how do you think this will be utilized and i guess how are you positioning the marketplace amanda jones senior vice president clinical development yeah it s a great question thanks so i ll answer a question you didn t really ask although you did ask in the last one and that s around how the discussions with payers are going those discussions have just recently commenced and so more to come on that but what we do know is that payers recognize the dissatisfaction with current therapies and the continuing cycling of patients to speak specifically to how we re positioned within the hcps market it s a bit premature to speculate on that right now but we ll continue to hone in on the fact that the accelerator absorption and the speed of action for our product is will be meaningful to both hcps patients and payers matt kaplan ladenburg thalmann and company inc analyst all right thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question comes from jason gerberry of bank of america your line is now open please go ahead unknown speaker hey this is on the line for jason thanks for taking our question just a quick question on accord axs 05 trial and the relapse rates could you tell us how many patients this has been based on and i guess generally where the current enrollment is at at this time just want to get a sense of how a change in trial design perhaps less patient seems to be enrolled or how that will impact the potential timeline of the trial thanks herriot tabuteau chief executive officer hi so i ll start off before trying to get over to amanda to answer the specific questions on a number of events and enrollment but with regards to the timing of completion of the trial we do not anticipate that that is going to change amanda amanda jones senior vice president clinical development sure so based on just enrollment alone we on track for the planned readout of mid next year so the key thing that we re looking at is obviously you know we do have projections based on the number of relapses that we assume should be happening based on the study design and so since we are below that number currently what s kind of triggering our desire for consultation with the fda unknown speaker got it thank you operator thank you herriot tabuteau chief executive officer sorry and just as a reminder just to add to that just remember this is we are referring to what s happening in the second part of the study the randomized portion all of these patients have previously received axs 05 and have been stabilized on axs 05 prior to randomization operator our next question comes from yatin suneja of guggenheim securities your line is now open please go ahead eddie hickman guggenheim partners analyst yeah hi this is eddie on for yatin thanks for taking my question in terms of the label for 05 are there assumptions that you re looking under that may influence the launch preparations that you have ongoing and would you disclose when and if the label discussions begin given that those deficiencies that you respond to were precluding those discussions and then assuming you can get an approval in the first half of the year like how should we think about 2022 revenues how quickly can you penetrate this market and would you ever plan to provide revenue guidance in depression thanks herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so a lot of questions there so before turning it to lori to answer the question around assumption with regards to the label in terms of disclosure of labeling discussions we do think that that would be a definitive piece of information to be able to provide to the street so that is our current thinking with regards to making you guys aware of that and then in terms of guidance for revenues for 2022 it s really premature for us to be providing revenue guidance on the product the product is not yet approved and also we want to make sure that we understand what the label is and which leads us into the question that you asked with regards to labeling assumptions and i ll turn that over to lori lori englebert senior vice president commercial and business development yeah thanks for the question eddie so the best we could do in terms of commercial preparation is to prepare based off the label the draft label that you submit to the fda which obviously is highly substantiated from the clinical trial results and so we are preparing for that i can imagine that major adjustments will be made to that label but we are prepared to tweak as fast as possible based on any labeling negotiations we get there eddie hickman guggenheim partners analyst can you just remind us what that proposed label language is herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so what we ve disclosed as you know is that the indication that we are going after is the treatment of mdd with regards to the specifics in the graphed label obviously it would not be prudent for us to be disclosing that on the call eddie hickman guggenheim partners analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ram selvaraju of h c wainwright your line is now open please go ahead ram selvaraju h c wainwright and company analyst thanks very much for taking my questions firstly just quick clarification on the launch preparations timeline for both 05 and 07 can you give us some additional clarity on assuming whenever you receive regulatory approval for those two drugs what sort of lag would you expect to occur between the announcement of the approval and the actual commercial availability of product herriot tabuteau chief executive officer thanks ram for the question so lori you want to take that lori englebert senior vice president commercial and business development yes so hey ram thanks for the question so i think we ve previously discussed and disclosed you know it will likely be within one quarter after approval that we will launch ram selvaraju h c wainwright and company analyst in both cases for both 05 and 07 lori englebert senior vice president commercial and business development in both cases yeah ram selvaraju h c wainwright and company analyst ok secondly on the smoking cessation front just two additional points of clarity there that i was hoping you could provide one is in the discussion with the fda did they definitively indicate whether top line positive data from the clinical trial you are currently envisaging would be sufficient to support a supplemental nda or if they indicated that even in the context of positive top line data from this study a second confirmatory study would be necessary in smoking cessation herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so smoking cessation is a separate indication and two positive trials are required ram selvaraju h c wainwright and company analyst got it and did you get any color from the agency regarding their preferences with respect to what would constitute an appropriate control and if this is an active control what preferences they have if any herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so given the product profile for axs 05 as you know because it has two apis in it we do have to follow fda s combination products rules and so we would have to demonstrate component contribution so one of the arms would likely have to be before on ram selvaraju h c wainwright and company analyst but no specific additional requirements or recommendations were provided by the agency beyond that is that correct herriot tabuteau chief executive officer ram i think as amanda mentioned earlier so we will provide the details of the design of the trial once we launched the study and that s been our practice in the past and we re looking forward to finalizing the study design and then once we launch it we ll be able to provide your details we don t like to speculate prior to launching a study because as you know the design can change ram selvaraju h c wainwright and company analyst understood and then the last question is with respect to the narcolepsy indication if you have positive top line data from the symphony trial would that potentially constitute a circumstance under which you would be able to file the nda right away herriot tabuteau chief executive officer so ram i ll turn that over to amanda to comment on that amanda jones senior vice president clinical development sure thanks yes if the symphony study has positive results then that would be the basis of efficacy for our nda we do also have an ongoing label study as well so that study is anticipated to complete approximately six months after conclusion of the symphony study ram selvaraju h c wainwright and company analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vikram purohit of morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead gospel asonye morgan stanley analyst good morning everyone this is gospel on for vikram thanks for taking our question i was wondering if you could walk us to how the dcc platform works what the metrics are that you have been testing i guess on how you will monitor its utility in the real world setting herriot tabuteau chief executive officer yes please i think that s a question for lori lori englebert senior vice president commercial and business development if you like to answer go ahead we re very excited here you can tell we re arguing over who s going to answer the question thanks for the question so first of all let me just start out with why we we re excited about dcc so fundamentally we believe that the goal of any engagement with hcp or patient is that it s meaningful and impactful and in order to achieve that what we did was design a technology enabled platform that uses ai machine learning sophisticated data and analytics really to synthesize data points that are collected and then deploy that to any axsome touchpoint whether that be with reps to hcps or for patients and the way that we came about developing this platform is that we did fairly extensive research on understanding our audience and how they want to be engaged as well as research on the latest technology and then that s why and that s how we put the platform together it is a highly integrated platform with several different systems to but it is now seamlessly integrated in terms of kpis and metrics and what we re planning for because we believe that meaningful engagements that will have a higher impact with both physicians and patients we do believe that the call points will be more and given the digital nature of it we do believe that it will be incredibly more efficient when we get close to approval or once we have approval and we start discussing salesforce size i can give you more details around additional metrics that we ll be tracking operator thank you our next question comes from the line of myles minter of william blair your line is now open please go ahead myles minter william blair and company analyst just on the accord study for 05 have you disclosed what the definition of response to be randomized into the withdrawal portion is and also how you re classifying relapse i know in advance you used cohen mansfield i m just wondering whether it s different here and whether or not a very stringent relaxed criteria on that scale is maybe what s driving the event rate less than what you have predicted herriot tabuteau chief executive officer sure amanda amanda jones senior vice president clinical development sure thanks for the question so the response rate we ll disclose that when we release the top line results of the study we do want to make note that yeah this study does include standard measures of alzheimer s agitation so similar with some of the programs that are ongoing myles minter william blair and company analyst ok so the relapse measurement is it safe to say that it is cohen mansfield or is it just like an event of agitation amanda jones senior vice president clinical development yes so there is formal definition which is driven by data driven definition we re just we ll be releasing the full formal definition at a later date myles minter william blair and company analyst ok cool and then i did not as obviously all on the review and you ve got to go talk to the fda but you are reiterating first half 2023 guidance in the press release i was just wondering why that is and i got your messaging that we expect that to change but maybe just to the point of life we don t know when that s changing too so we just won t change it yet i m just curious as to why you restated that rather than withdrawing timing guidance here herriot tabuteau chief executive officer yeah so i think the reason for that is in giving our prior guidance we did try to incorporate some buffer and so currently we don t see any reason to change that guidance but we did want to alert folks to the fact that there may it may change and that it is an active process and we do want to take advantage of the fact that we have this dialogue with the fda we want to make sure that the study design is appropriate but for now in terms of guidance we don t see any reason yet to formally change it we will be coming back to you guys and providing an update as appropriate but until then our guidance is our guidance myles minter william blair and company analyst cool thanks for the questions operator thank our final question comes from the line of david hoang of smbc your line is now open please go ahead david hoang smbc nikko securities analyst hey guys thanks for fitting me in here i just had a question on the sales force for launching axs 05 mdd can you just remind us of the sales force numbers that you would expect are necessary to successfully support the launch in mdd and then how are you sort of managing expectations there with contingent offers given the unusual situation with the 05 review lori englebert senior vice president commercial and business development yeah hi david thanks for the question so we have not disclosed the number of sales reps that we re hiring just yet but what i can tell you is that our

our launch in terms of the contingent offers i couldn t be more proud of the sale leadership that we have out in the field we are just to give you statistics that the field leadership that we hired in

all s not as bad with lucid as the market s making it out to be a lot has happened since lucid group lcid 2 41 went public in july 2021 its air dream edition with 520 miles became the longest range electric vehicle ev yet and attracted rave reviews once it hit the roads in late october with the company also expanding production capacity lucid stock rose a stunning 280 in 2021 in the past three months though the stock has lost more than 50 of its value partly because of the broader sell off in growth stocks and largely because of a subpoena from the securities and exchange commission sec in december regarding its merger with a special purpose acquisition company and unnamed projections and statements there have been no updates on the sec matter lucid investors have since pinned all hopes on its fourth quarter numbers and outlook to help the stock bottom out and rebound instead the earnings report sent the stock plunging even further with its share price dropping 19 at one point this morning the big question now is whether lucid s numbers and outlook warrant such a knee jerk reaction or has the market overreacted and in doing so presented you with a golden opportunity to buy the once hot ev stock before it rebounds before you jump to conclusions here are the most crucial numbers from lucid that you must know reservations lucid had secured more than 17 000 reservations across all of its four models the air dream edition air grand touring air touring and air pure by mid november as of feb 28 lucid s reservations exceeded 25 000 units worth more than 2 4 billion in potential sales deliveries lucid started deliveries of the dream edition in late october as of feb 28 it had delivered more than 300 units including 125 units in 2021 investors had bigger expectations given that lucid had earlier said it plans to start deliveries of other models only after delivering 520 dream editions production this by far is the most important number investors are focused on because the ability of an ev manufacturer to produce at scale and its pace of production are two of the biggest advantages to have in such a highly competitive industry until november lucid was confident of producing 20 000 vehicles in 2022 as it ramped up production at its arizona factory it now expects to produce only 12 000 to 14 000 units this year as it navigates supply and logistics challenges to be fair lucid isn t the only ev start up to fall short of its production estimates rivian automotive rivn 8 00 whose debut electric truck has also won accolades like lucid s debut electric car is just one of the other companies to have missed its goals also lucid isn t the only automaker facing supply constraints importantly its reservation numbers are strong also during its fourth quarter earnings conference call lucid said that reservations for its second most expensive model after the air dream edition the grand touring were higher than its two lowest priced trim packages lucid also confirmed plans to set up a factory in saudi arabia a nation it has strong connections with i d want to believe lucid is prioritizing quality over quantity when it comes to production right now and its revenue could grow steadily once the dust settles on the supply chain as that happens lucid s stock could be back in the limelight again

service and geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance effective january 1 2021 the company s lease accounting policy follows the guidance from accounting standards codification asc 842 leases which requires companies to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by the leased asset the company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach for all leases entered into before the effective date prior to the adoption of asc 842 the company s lease accounting recognition policy followed guidance from asc 840 leases due to the adoption of this guidance the company recognized operating right of use assets and operating lease liabilities of 47 1 million and 53 0 million respectively as of the date of adoption the difference between the right of use assets and lease liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is primarily due to the accrual

from our existing customers as well as their potential long term value to us we also believe the results shown by this metric reflect the stability of our revenue base which is one of our core

unique billing accounts that generated revenue during the corresponding month of the prior year by b annualized software revenue as of the corresponding month of the prior year the calculation includes changes for these billing accounts such as change in the solutions purchased changes in pricing and transaction volume but does not reflect revenue for new customers added the calculation excludes a changes in estimates related to the timing of one time revenue and other revenue including professional services and b annualized software revenue for smaller customers with annualized software revenue below the threshold of 100 000 for carriers and 4 000 for shops the customers that do not meet the revenue threshold are small insurance carriers and collision repair shops that tend to have different buying behaviors with a narrower solution focus and different tenure compared to our core customers excluded small carriers and shops represent less than 5 of total revenue within these sales channels our software ndr includes carriers and shops who subscribe to our auto physical damage solutions which account for most of the company s revenue and excludes revenue from smaller

timing of their adoption and our assessment to the extent we have made one of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures our estimates are based on our historical experience trends and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition valuation of goodwill and intangible assets stock based compensation valuation of warrant liabilities 66 table of contents revenue recognition revenue recognition requires judgment and the use of estimates the company generates revenue from subscription based contracts that are billed either on a subscription or transactional basis revenue is derived from the sale of software subscriptions and other revenue primarily professional services the estimates and assumptions requiring significant judgment under our revenue recognition policy in accordance with fasb asc 606 are as follows determine the transaction price the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for services to the customer variable consideration is included in the transaction price if in our judgment it is probable that no significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will occur the sale of our software subscriptions may include variable consideration related to usage based contracts and provisions for additional fees when the volume of a customer s transactions exceeds agreed upon maximums within defined reporting periods we estimate variable consideration based on the most likely amount to the extent that a significant revenue reversal is not probable to occur the company may occasionally recognize an adjustment in revenue in the current period for performance obligations partially or fully satisfied in the previous periods resulting from changes in estimates for the transaction price including any changes to the company s assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the impact on revenue recognized in the respective period from performance obligations partially or fully satisfied in the previous period was not significant determine the amortizable life of contract assets sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to generally be between three and five years we determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts our technology and other factors most often with larger customers a new contract or amended master agreement will not include a renewal period that requires assessment of whether the new business and renewal business commissions are commensurate this is because the solutions and services offered as part of the new contract or amended agreement will be different from the original due to changes in technology and offerings while the renewal period may be reached most often a new multi year agreement is signed that includes new services and features which will pay out a commission on the new services and features at the new business percentage and the renewal services and features at the renewal commission percentage in situations when the renewal period is triggered it is typically with smaller customers where the sales commission paid is insignificant thus sales commissions are amortized on a systematic basis over three to five years which corresponds to the period and pattern in which revenue is recognized sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over the related contractual renewal period amortization expense is included in selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we perform an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of september 30 each fiscal year or whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is below its carrying value in 2021 2020 and 2019 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test in which we compared the fair value of our reporting units which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds their respective carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analyses we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that represent the highest and best use for our reporting units changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment charges we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management 67 table of contents no goodwill impairments were recorded during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 based on the results of our assessment performed as of september 30 2019 which included downward revisions to future projected earnings and cash flows of one of our reporting units it was determined that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired and the company recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of 25 8 million intangible assets with finite lives and software equipment and property are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis we monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period we test these assets for potential impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the original estimate of an asset s useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset s useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset there was no impairment charge recorded during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded an impairment charge to one of its reporting unit s customer relationships and acquired technology intangible assets the company s forecasted future revenue and expense cash flow streams indicated the carrying amounts of the intangible assets were not recoverable and therefore the company recorded an impairment charge of 181 3 million stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation plans in accordance with asc 718 compensation stock compensation which requires the recognition of expense measured based on the grant date fair value of the stock based compensation awards our stock based awards include stock options restricted stock units rsus and phantom shares our stock based awards have vesting terms that are service based performance based or performance based with a market condition the grant date fair value of our service based awards excluding rsus is determined using the black scholes option pricing model the fair value of each service based and performance based rsu is determined using the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant the fair value of each award with performance based with a market condition vesting is determined using a monte carlo simulation model for stock based awards with only service conditions we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period only for the portion of awards expected to vest based on an estimated forfeiture rate for stock based awards with only performance conditions we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the explicit performance period when the performance targets are probable of being achieved we recognize stock based compensation expense on awards that are subject to performance based vesting with a market condition when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the market condition of these awards impacts the fair value at grant date and is the reason the monte carlo simulation is utilized to determine fair value key assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model and monte carlo simulation method include fair value of common stock prior to the business combination there was no public market for our common stock for those periods included in our consolidated financial statements fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our stock based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors our board of directors with input from management considered among other things valuations of our common stock which were prepared in accordance with the guidance provided by the american institute of certified public accountants 2013 practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation as well as the advent transaction for grants in 2017 expected term the expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and for time based awards is determined using the simplified method that uses the weighted average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the awards 68 table of contents expected volatility as we have limited trading history for our common stock the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants the comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size stage in the life cycle or area of specialty risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the u s treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of awards expected dividend yield historically we have not paid regular dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock on a regular basis we do not have a dividend policy therefore we used an expected dividend yield of zero see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for more information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the black scholes and monte carlo option pricing models to determine the estimated fair value of our stock based awards with service vesting and performance vesting some of these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment as a result if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates our stock based compensation could be materially different valuation of warrant liabilities we account for our warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in asc 815 40 under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities accordingly we classify the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the warrants to fair value at each reporting period this liability is subject to re measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised and any change in fair value is recognized

expectations during this year s annual enrollment period nevertheless we are extremely disappointed that these successes did not translate to bottom line performance we like many in our space

up for q a i will speak generally the pages 4 through 8 of the presentation provided to you i am excited to discuss montrose s strong full year 2021 and fourth quarter results which belong to our dedicated team members around the world for whom i am very grateful through their efforts we were able to produce another year of record breaking results and further our leading position in the environmental industry before i delve into a discussion of our performance and as we have noted for you before i d like to reiterate that our business is best assessed on an annual basis given the nature of demand for environmental services not being driven by quarterly patterns an annual basis is how we manage our business and how we recommend others view our results as well in terms of our financial results 2021 was another exceptionally strong year for montrose we achieved over 0 5 billion in revenue converted our earnings into over 50 million in operating cash flow and achieved the highest rate of double digit organic growth 37 including cteh and 17 excluding cteh since my time here at montrose the 17 organic growth excluding cteh in 2021 is stronger than we expected at the start of the year given our historical average of mid to high single digit organic growth and the ongoing impact of the pandemic we also greatly exceeded our full year 2021 objective of over 20 annual base business growth we think of our base business as excluding excess cteh revenue with approximately 400 million of base business revenue growing nearly 40 year over year almost double our targeted growth rate our business has scaled more quickly than we expected which put a lot of pressure on our teams but also created excitement about the future our outperformance in 2021 and expectations for continued outperformance in 2022 all relative to an industry growing 2 to 3 per year are being driven by our capabilities related to greenhouse gas measurement and mitigation pfas remediation and waste to energy services in particular demand for our services is a direct result of key tailwinds across our business lines as corporate esg initiatives environmental regulation and enforcement and better environmental stewardship remains at the forefront of c suite and government policy this is why we have confidence in our newly introduced 2022 outlook which allan will discuss later on in addition to strong organic growth the other key value driver we have discussed with you before are immediately accretive acquisitions that have added great talent and service capabilities to our team we added several incredible teams to montrose in 2021 and started 2022 on a great foot with the addition of the environmental standards team to the montrose family within our assessment permitting and response segment complementary acquisitions such as environmental standards remain one of our key growth and value creation drivers our m a pipeline remains very robust and our thesis and strategy remain unchanged our business is the environment and our mission is to help protect the air we breathe the water we drink and the soil that feeds us this mission statement is increasingly resonating with our clients our team members our communities and our stakeholders as we ve discussed over the past 18 months we continue to see market drivers arise as government policy catches up with public and market demand for better environmental stewardship we were pleased to see president biden signed the 1 trillion infrastructure bill into law with bipartisan support last november and we are already seeing announcements relative to our relevant to our business resulting from the bill in addition the us epa announced the first in a series of actions to respond to concerns of local communities historically and disproportionately impacted by pollution our leadership and air quality management uniquely position us to support both our clients and our communities as they navigate these new regulatory priorities beyond the public sector we continue to partner with our corporate customers to help them navigate rapidly evolving priorities and investor requests regarding environmental stewardship our capabilities related to water management and water treatment as one example of many allow us to serve our clients and drive value in this regard a large and growing addressable market a business well positioned to capture tailwinds in the environmental industry and an incredible team all of these are reasons it is an exciting time for montrose and grateful for the privilege to lead this incredible group next i ll point to some 2021 highlights and accomplishments excluding the impact of discontinued service lines in the prior year 2021 revenue increased 68 we maintained our strong revenue retention rate of over 90 for the year which combined with new customer acquisitions fueled growth across our segments 90 excludes cteh our emergency response business which is non recurring by definition 2021 adjusted ebitda grew 43 compared to the prior year given our strong revenue growth we converted approximately 70 of that adjusted ebitda into operating cash flow excluding the payment of acquisition related contingent considerations our continued focus on environmental innovation is evident through our r d investments and four additional patents were awarded in 2021 along with several patents filed and or awaiting review we see great long term opportunities to continue to allocate capital to support innovation with environmental solutions and we believe these investments will position as well for strong growth in the future while wage inflation and higher turnover continue to be areas of focus in the broader market our concentration on the recruitment and retention of senior level leaders was strong in 2021 especially at the director level and above i continue to be impressed by the high caliber of our team and i m proud of the positive corporate culture we built here at montrose to attract and retain such talent our m a pipeline remains strong we completed six strategic acquisitions in 2021 and one in january 2022 all of which was funded almost entirely by internally generated operating cash flow and have added to our evolving environmental capabilities and our exceptional talent pool last year we achieved our 2021 goal of acquiring 10 million to 15 million of annualized ebitda in line with our previous goals and historical cadence looking ahead our immediately accretive acquisition pipeline supports our expectation for 10 million to 15 million in acquired annualized ebitda per year including 2022 we were honored to receive an a rating from msci one of the leading esg rating agencies particularly given our commitment to environmental and social stewardship this exceptional performance during our less than two years as a public company gives us confidence in our ability to continue to outperform the market and deliver solid and stable long term growth for our investors next we ll look at our business by segment within our assessment permitting and response segment most of the revenue in this segment is driven by cteh though we were pleased to see positive contributions from our acquisitions of environmental intelligence and horizon in the second half of 2021 the leadership team at cteh continues to do a stellar job converting the pandemic response and business continuity advice into long term strategic contracts with new and large industries the technology industry in particular a key differentiator for them is their data management capability and their highly flexible labor pool which has proven to be very additive to our clients and supported their capture of market share as it relates to cteh supporting clients through the pandemic we ve mentioned on our two previous calls the revenue surge which began to modulate during q3 a trend that continued to q4 and into 2022 while demand was and is still elevated compared to their historical run rate we anticipate cteh will normalize through 2022 compared to 2021 as such we expect revenue from cteh to exceed 100 million in 2022 which is higher than their 75 million to 95 million revenue run rate but lower than their 2021 performance of over 200 million within this segment and excluding cteh our higher margin assessment permitting and ecological services business continued to see nice organic tailwinds within the measurement and analysis segment we enjoy market leadership in air quality management and our analytical lab footprint which is one of the largest in north america was bolstered by our acquisitions of vista and eci we remain upbeat about continued growth in the segment given growing environmental regulations for example our service and software advantages related to methane measurement and mitigation continue to see strong demand across the united states and canada as another example demand for specialized environmental testing specifically the developing regulatory environment around addressing pfas remains strong margins remain higher than industry averages but are closer to normal for us the anticipated normalization we shared with you before is panning out as expected and finally within our remediation and reuse segment we are seeing a continued trajectory of strong organic growth driven by demand for our pfas water treatment and renewable biogas which is negative carbon intensive energy services in particular margins are creating as we noted in prior calls and as expected but they remain below normal levels given ongoing investments as the business matures in summary our fourth quarter results marked the completion of another outstanding year for montrose we could not be more pleased with the value we have created in our business going back to our ipo in july of 2020 we ended 2021 ahead of where we thought we would be our revenue and earnings grew faster than we anticipated and select services scale faster than we thought as a result we are catching up on establishing our corporate infrastructure so we can capture the tailwinds and profitably grow during the next chapter of montrose s evolution we believe we are well positioned to continue outperforming in spite of inflationary headwinds given the strong demand driving organic revenue growth the solid m a pipeline our low leverage and mostly fixed rate debt and our pricing power through our reoccurring work with clients we are arguably more optimistic than ever as we look at 2022 before i turn it over to allan i would like to end by thanking and acknowledging all of our team members around the world for their tremendous efforts in serving our clients and achieving these outstanding results i remain grateful for the hard work they ve put in through uncertain times and our optimism for montrose s future is rooted in our confidence in our colleagues to the montrose team listening congratulations to all of you on a milestone 2021 to our investors thank you for your continued support and the opportunity to continue creating value please stay safe and well out there and we look forward to updating you on our results as we progress through this year and to 2022 with that let me handed over to allan and thank you allan dicks chief financial officer thank you vijay we are extremely pleased with our strong fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as vijay has mentioned our strong performance through the year reflects the entry discussed over the past 18 months since our ipo as well as the in demand nature of our unique environmental solutions our growth from organic revenue gains steemed as we progress through the year which reflects our expanding relationships with notable customers early success with our cross selling initiatives and strengthening exposure across geographies all of which are key to our future growth moving to our revenue performance on slide 10 in 2021 we drove strong growth across our business segments during both the fourth quarter and full year total revenues for the fourth quarter increased 32 2 to a quarterly record of 143 8 million which is particularly impressive given the fourth quarter is historically one of our weaker quarters for revenues and cteh revenue was down year over year as covid related services continued to slow full year 2021 revenues were up 66 5 year over year to a record 546 4 million the primary driver of revenue growth in both periods was organic growth for the full year organic growth was 37 including our cteh response business excluding cteh organic growth with 17 we generally don t focus on organic growth on a quarterly basis as year over year quarterly comparisons can be misleading in addition to organic growth our full year 2021 results benefited from a full 12 months of cteh compared to nine months of results in 2020 our outperformance in both periods was also driven by our six strategic acquisitions completed during 2021 as we ve discussed from prior calls mainly in response to the covid 19 outbreak we discontinued certain service lines at the end of the first quarter in 2020 this process was completed early in the second quarter of 2020 was partially offset at 2021 comparisons excluding discontinued service line revenues would have increased 68 for the year in 2021 looking at our adjusted ebitda performance on slide 11 fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was up slightly to 18 4 million and the adjusted ebitda margin was 12 8 full year 2021 adjusted ebitda grew 42 5 to 77 6 million and the adjusted ebitda margin was 14 2 of revenue the margins for both periods were pressured mainly due to the business mix including the lower margin pandemic response services provided by cteh the planned and expected normalization of margins in certain business lines following the reversal of covid 19 related initiatives and investments in corporate infrastructure our full year margins were also impacted by full year public company costs in the current year that existed during on year portion of the prior year i ll reemphasize the point vijay made earlier he said montrose s performance needs to be assessed annually this is how we evaluate the business since the demand for environmental services is not driven by specific or predictable quarterly passes and stronger predictability on an annual basis this is consistent with how we hire staff allocate resources and manage the company turning to our business segment on slide 12 in our assessment permitting and response segment full year revenue grew to 261 9 million from 98 5 million in the prior year adjusted ebitda improved to 57 1 million from 24 2 million in the prior year the significant year over year increases in both revenue and adjusted ebitda were mainly driven by cteh which saw sustained demand well above trend through the year to provide pandemic response related services cteh contributed full year revenues of 231 5 million compared to 82 4 million in the prior year cteh was largely benefited from greater covid 19 related response work performed in the full year 2021 the acquisitions of environmental intelligence and horizon in the third and fourth quarters respectively also contributed to 2021 results in the segment the decline in segment adjusted ebitda margin to 21 8 was largely a result of an increase in lower margin covid response work performed by cteh in 2021 in our measurement and analysis segment full year revenue increased 1 1 to 153 2 million primarily attributable to the acquisitions of vista and environmental chemistry in the second and third quarters respectively partially offset by a decline in revenues from discontinued service lines and the timing of projects adjusted ebitda margin declined to 20 4 due to business mix and the reinstatement of certain costs that had been temporarily suspended at the outset of the covid 19 pandemic and finally in our remediation and reuse segment full year revenues increased 68 year over year to 131 3 million reflecting a significant increase in demand for the pfas water treatment services organic growth in our biogas business and the acquisition of msci in the first quarter the 320 basis point increase in remediation and reuse adjusted ebitda margin to 14 7 was a result of higher revenues adjusted ebitda margin in this segment continues to reflect the impact of elevated fixed costs and investments in anticipation of growth and geographic expansion looking at our review of our business trajectory on slide 13 as we discussed last quarter we believe our cteh business has an expected annual revenue run rate of 75 million to 95 million although cteh revenue continues to normalize cteh revenues were 70 6 million in q1 and fell sequentially each quarter during the year to end at 41 4 million in q4 cteh revenues remained elevated as a result of heightened demand for covid 19 related services that said demand for the services and the revenue they produce is expected to be transitory in nature and is not expected to reoccur at the same level in the coming years as the impact of covid 19 related demand continues to win when excluding the above trend revenue from cteh the remainder of our revenue is what we refer to as our base business which includes the normalized revenues we would expect to see from cteh our base business continues to experience a solid trajectory reflecting the organic tailwinds we ve discussed on this call moving to our capital structure on slide 14 we were thrilled to see a step change in our operating cash flow generation for the full year 2021 which increased to 37 6 million compared to 1 9 million last year cash from operations includes the payment of acquisition related contingent consideration of 15 6 million and 6 4 million in the current and prior year respectively excluding the acquisition related payments full year cash from operating activities was a record 53 2 million in 2021 compared to cash from operating activities of 8 3 million in 2020 an increase of 44 9 million this increase was driven primarily by significantly higher full year earnings before contingent consideration payments and non cash items partially offset by an increase in working capital of 9 8 million our strong cash flow generation capabilities resulted in a nearly 70 conversion of adjusted ebitda into operating cash flow for the year in line with our previously communicated expectations for a long term conversion of adjusted ebitda into operating cash flow at a rate in excess of 50 these strong cash flows reflect our ongoing focus on the balancing of the generation of cash with investments in technology r d and corporate infrastructure to ensure continued scalability our leverage ratio as of december 31 2021 which includes the impact of acquisition related contingent earn out obligations was at 0 8 times unchanged compared to q3 despite the two acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter our leverage ratio was 2 7 times at the end of the prior year in january 2022 we entered into an interest rate swap transaction fixing the variable component of our interest rates on 100 million of borrowings until january 2025 moves such as this and our follow on equity offering in october 2021 gave us further financial flexibility to execute our growth objectives as a reminder our series a 2 preferred stock has no maturity dates and we have the option but not the obligation to redeem the preferred shares at any time for cash subject to a make whole payment if prepaid prior to april 2023 we view this preferred equity instrument as favorable to the value creation potential in the business given its flexible dynamics if you include the 182 million balance of the series a 2 equity in our market cap our total equity capitalization stands at approximately 1 5 billion moving to our full year outlook on slide 15 based on the strong momentum in our business in 2021 and into 2022 we are confident in our ability to drive based business growth in the full year 2022 we are introducing our outlook portfolio 2022 revenue to be in the range of 520 million 570 million and adjusted for that to be in the range of 73 to 78 million our 2022 outlook is based on a combination of double digit organic growth excluding cteh plus the contribution of acquisitions we ve already completed we expect cteh s full year revenue to exceed 100 million due to some continuation of covid 19 related services particularly in the first half of 22 higher than its 75 million to 95 million annual revenue run rate but substantially lower than its 2021 performance while full year 2021 margins were lower compared to full year 2020 due to business mix the reversal of prior cost containment efforts and full year public company costs our outlook remains unchanged for continued consolidated adjusted ebitda margin expansion over a four to five year period i will provide some of the building blocks in relation to our margin expectations over that time frame in our assessment permitting and response segment we expect normalized adjusted ebitda margins to run between 25 and 30 in our measurement and analysis segment we expect adjusted ebitda margins to continue to run around 20 over the long term and finally the remediation and reuse segment which is immature margins currently due to investments in infrastructure and personnel to support significant anticipated growth should run in the low to mid 20 adjusted even to margins at scale lower corporate costs of energy revenues are expected as our corporate infrastructure matures in summary 2021 was another milestone year for montrose demand for our differentiated environmental services remains resilient and we saw acceleration across our key business lines during the year as results began to normalize to pre covid 19 levels our investments in talented team members immediately accretive m a transactions and our ip portfolio have driven our exceptional results in the year and put us on a strong footing entering 2022 we are increasingly optimistic in our integrated solutions to address greenhouse gases pfas and renewables as well as evolving rules and regulations which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our growth objectives in the years to come we look forward to the opportunities we see ahead and to updating you on our financial progress over the year as we work to create further value and capture additional market share in our fragmented industry we sincerely appreciate your interest in montrose and thank you all for joining us today operator we are ready to open the lines to questions questions answers operator thank you our first question is from jim ricchiuti with needham company please proceed jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst hi thanks good morning so i just want to vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer hey jim jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst how are you i wanted to talk to you a little bit about the investments you re making overall the infrastructure of the business just to support the growth there is that i wonder if you could talk in terms of where you are but the follow up question really relates to the inflationary pressures the rising compensation costs that are impacting presumably are impacting the business like everyone else and i m wondering to what extent are you able to offset some of these pressures perhaps through just the even revised pricing initiatives with your clients vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer hey jim this is vijay why don t i take that and then allan certainly jump in on the inflationary pressures in terms of pricing we have a fair degree of confidence that we will be able to pass the price increases on jim our relationships with the customers are great they clearly are seeing the same environment we re seeing in businesses like our advisory businesses it s a multiple of compensation so our cost so as compensation goes up those costs get passed on in other aspects of our business like the water treatment or biogas business it s not quite as linear or direct but we re seeing similar ability and certainly on the testing side as well so we re not worried about our long term margin expansion in the context of this inflationary environment the first part of your question around investments is partially a function of those that are necessitated by being public so we ve seen a material scale up in year on year comparison and costs for being a public company so the fact that we ve grown and gotten bigger than we at a pace is quicker than we thought has caused us to lose our emerging growth status right sox compliance faster filing esg reporting additional audit fees i mean the list goes on and on so some of that is just necessary and certainly will stabilize in the very near future so that s part of it and then the other part that s more voluntary is we got to 0 5 billion in revenue at a much quicker clip than we thought jim and so we are putting in place additional compliance measures right as we bolster some of our regulatory affairs capabilities safety infrastructure technology business development marketing and the way i would characterize that spend is corporate as a percentage of revenues we watch that very very closely and we took advantage of the fact that we had dramatic outperformance last year to put some of those investments in place so as we look forward to getting to 1 billion of revenue we have some of that infrastructure in place to get there does that make sense jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst it does thank you and maybe my follow up question this may it may have been allan who alluded to this the early benefits that you re seeing some early success from cross selling anything you can elaborate on in terms of talking about the progress you re making in this area vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer yeah we re making great progress jim and if nothing else you re very consistent you asked that question repeatedly and i think what we promised here is that at the end of q1 of 2022 we will have kind of our first full year of a quarter on quarter comparison given we put in place the sales force tools at the beginning of last year so when we talk to you in may i think we ll have some more discrete data points but with the sales and marketing efforts that have been underway now for a while we have seen an incredible amount of collaboration between our remediation reuse and our advisory segments into our testing segments in particular so as a small illustrative example we re winning business on both the advisory side and on the treatment side and as part and parcel with that one business we are able to position our testing business as an additive service that is unique in the market but also creates kind of a compelling cross sell opportunity so we re seeing a lot of that type of activity and we ll elaborate more in terms of both dollars and case studies when we speak to you and may jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it ok look forward to hearing vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer and you can see and jim the one other point i would make there is the organic growth surge that you re seeing is partially also a function of that very cross selling effort that we talked about kind of at ipo with you where we didn t necessarily have the infrastructure to do it and now the investments are paying off jim ricchiuti needham and company analyst got it thank you operator our next question is from tim mulrooney with william blair please proceed unknown speaker william blair analyst hey guys this is sam going for tim thanks for taking our questions here hoping you re doing well vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer hey how are you unknown speaker william blair analyst doing good doing good maybe to start we ll be some current event questions here but has the ukraine crisis and the resulting sanctions changed how you think about the long term domestic biogas opportunity and maybe more broadly here are there any areas of your business that you were thinking about differently as a result of what s going on in europe vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer no as everyone is we re really dismayed at what s going on in europe and we certainly hope that the situation resolves soon for all the obvious reasons no we really have very little exposure if at all to any of that where we would be impacted as if the us or european governments change their policy materially both in terms of their fiscal and monetary policy or their regulatory policy but as of this point we haven t really seen any shift that impacts montrose in any way in terms of the biogas business in particular i think the long term trends in terms of demand for negative carbon intensity gas and we do think gas is going to play a more prominent role as the world transitions from one phase of energy to the next that s continuing apace the organic growth the 17 that we posted excluding cteh includes continued momentum in that space and so we think that s there are other trends they re driving that is more fundamental to montrose than ukraine and russia and if anything it ll be on the margin additive to that so whereas bullish as we ve ever been we re really saddened by what s happening in eastern europe but really no impact montrose of note unknown speaker william blair analyst ok great that s great to hear maybe pivoting a bit here then can you talk more about your leak detection business and how that performed overall in 2021 and maybe what your expectations are for that business how do think in 2022 vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer yeah unknown speaker william blair analyst will we expect to see some in this business from the new epa proposal or anything from that nature vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer yes i mean i would characterize the leak detection more broadly as just our greenhouse gas measurement and methane measurement capability and it is growing faster than our historical organic growth rate that team is doing a spectacular job several of those folks have taken on more prominent roles and promoted into more prominent roles across montrose with a kind of national and global oversight the business is still small relative to the macro montrose but growing at double digits organically and we see no reason to see that have that change into the foreseeable future the regulatory environment is only more favorable our relative market advantages are more prominent and the markets moving in our direction so we re as bullish as we ve ever been and as should be apparent in allan s guidance our conviction and continued acceleration of organic if you go back to kind of our historical averages of 7 to 9 we think we ll continue well above that and the greenhouse gas and leak detection piece of it is part of that unknown speaker william blair analyst one more for us to really more to pfas we ve seen quite a few articles about the concern around pfas lingering in air particles have any clients brought this issue up to you and do you guys have any capabilities to address this in your air emissions portfolio and just how do you see the growth opportunities related to that piece vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer yes and yes clients have come to us about it we have some of the most advanced capabilities in that space and we re intimately involved in helping folks solve it test for it on the air side as well we happen to have our first organically developed pfas lab right next to one of our largest environmental lab networks in north carolina which also happens to be administered regan s former home state and he was involved in some of the aerosolization issues associated with incinerating pfas back there and so we re well aware of what happens and how to mitigate some of that and some of our capabilities put us on the leading edge of that so it s that s inherent and implicit in our numbers already on the measurement analysis side unknown speaker william blair analyst excellent i appreciate the answers guys best of luck on the next full year vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer thank you allan dicks chief financial officer thank you operator our next question is from andrew obin with bank of america please proceed emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning guys this is emily shu on for andrew obin vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer hey emily allan dicks chief financial officer hey emily emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey so i m curious with omicron in december how much did the covid related business cteh sort of outperform your prior forecast and then how are you thinking about the covid business for cteh in the first quarter given that omicron omicron cases were still high in january if it should be running above that 100 million run rate thanks vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer yeah emily why don t i just kind of talk more holistically and then allan jump in with specifics cteh is a broad business they have broad based capabilities across response toxicology and i think as you heard us talk about their software and their flexible workforce gives them some pretty incredible advantages and so we re really proud of kind of how they performed and the team as a team is incredible the reason i give you that long preamble is and for all the reasons we talked about with you emily when we went through some of your modelings they expected and anticipated deceleration in their covid response work through the course of last year so if you kind of think about where they were in q1 of 2021 north of 70 million in revenue they were actually quarter on quarter q4 down about 10 but all in that predicted and anticipated way and some of that is due to their team performing so well that they were dealing with a significant amount of fatigue and need to kind of catch their breath and so as we think about 2022 some of that demand continues and it s as much about omicron as it is about just broader preparedness and mitigation measures being put in place and so as we put forth our forecast for this year if you go back to the 75 million to 95 million run rate that we would expect from the year in year out they re running about 25 north of that because of the covid response work which we think is weighted toward the first half of this year so it s certainly modulating because they did over 200 million last year but they continue to be very elevated continue to perform really well and we do think some of that is going to continue through the first half of this year which is implicit in our guidance both on the revenue side and margin side does that answer your question emily emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah that does it s super helpful and then follow up question just on the 2022 organic growth outlook sort of what gives you the confidence for the outperformance versus the historical high single digit rate and then is this double digit organic growth rate sustainable over the next three to five years thanks that ll be it for me vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer yeah we re not giving guidance for the next three to five years emily i think we are going to stick to kind of our broader message that we re really bullish on the macro opportunity but for this year we have a conviction for a couple of reasons on the pfas treatment and testing side our business has performed really well we are seeing a lot of private sector demand so unlike some others that you ve alluded to in conversations with us we re not dependent on future regulations or future project cycles it s already in our numbers today on the renewable energy biogas side that i talked about in the earlier comment we re seeing some really nice demand there and on the greenhouse gas emission intensity measurement side we re seeing some really nice demand there those three levers are already performing really well for us they re part of the reason we were at 17 last year and so we have conviction this year on the back of those three specific business segments emily shu bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok great i ll pass it on good luck guys vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer thanks emily operator our next question is from noelle dilts with stifel please proceed noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst thanks guys vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer hey noelle noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst hey so i appreciate the color you just gave emily on cteh revenue i was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on how we should think about the ebitda margin contribution as we move from the kind of the dilutive effect of the covid work to a more normalized margin level that s it for me thanks vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer i will take that or do you want me to allan dicks chief financial officer yeah well so as we look into 2022 in the first half we anticipate we ll see some continued elevated demand and that elevated demand is likely going to be a similar margin to 2021 so depressed versus a typical run rate and then as they return to a more normalized level of earnings post a lot of the covid work we expect the margins are going to expand back to normal which is that kind of mid 20s range so you ll see the lower back of revenue from them but higher margin percentages in the back half versus the front half noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst i guess more specifically could you give us the ebitda dollar contribution from cteh this in 2021 or are you not giving that specific vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer they well noelle maybe a new way to do it and allan let me know if this helps because it sounds you re trying to modulate their business ran high teens margin in q4 in terms of ebitda and so if you kind of think about the impact of that margin profile on our macro segment profile which allan in his comments talked about being in that 25 to 30 range you can see how it s a little bit of a tragedy of riches they did incredibly well but because they were so big in that segment it s kind of the overall margin profile so hopefully that allows you to model it a little bit more effectively i think just stepping back noelle i suspect this is a question that s going to come up over and over again we re really bullish on our ability to accrete margins and the issue we re having in articulating this as we go forward is really kind of twofold our revenues surged in specific areas where margins are a little lumpy so part of that is cteh which we just talked about right but part of it is also our remediation reuse business so we are seeing a rapid acceleration on the pfas treatment and biogas side and so you can see those margins accrete from allan correct me if i m wrong 11 to 15 but that is still way below what would be normal for that business which is kind of low to mid 20s and so we re seeing disproportionate growth in parts of the business that are growing that are also margin dilutive in the temporary phase of the business so as that matures on the remediation and reuse side as cteh normalizes our adjusted ebitda excluding corporate will accrete really nicely into the mid 20s if that makes any sense and so you ll see some volatility there as different parts of the business ebb and flow and that s why we keep using this nomenclature business mix but as we look forward over three to five years we re really bullish on being able to get to that mid 20s operating ebitda margin and then corporate as a percentage of revenue will come down as we get bigger noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst okay thank you operator we have reached the end of our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to vijay for closing comments vijay manthripragada president and chief executive officer we really appreciate all of your time thank you for joining us today stay safe out there

the invasion of ukraine by russian forces has spurred europe s worst security crisis in decades but while most analysis is rightly focused on the immediate situation it is equally important to forecast the war s multiple possible trajectories and outcomes anticipating the uncertainties that this war will bring is a critical step toward successfully navigating its possible consequences although the situation in ukraine is fluid the scenarios outlined here offer four plausible ways in which the conflict might end even the rosiest of these possibilities which we ve dubbed the miracle on the dnipro is fraught with danger the united states its transatlantic allies and partners and indeed the entire world now likely face a difficult period of sustained contestation with russia scenario 1 miracle on the dnipro bolstered by defensive assistance from nato members ukraine s military and civilian resistance overcome the odds and grind moscow s advance to a halt preventing russian president vladimir putin from toppling kyiv s democratic government and establishing a puppet regime the determination and skill of the ukrainian resistance forces a stalemate on the battlefield that favors the defenders soon it becomes obvious to the kremlin that russia will pay an exorbitant price for its adventurism including the prospect of a long and costly slog in ukraine coupled with economic collapse and diplomatic isolation putin sullenly orders a withdrawal of his troops ukraine remains a sovereign democracy while moscow s defeat accelerates domestic discontent that has already begun emerging across russia putin turns to focusing on the growing internal threats to his power meanwhile nato is faced with an improved security situation as russia is chastened and ukraine grows ever closer to the west however the security situation in europe does not return to the prewar status quo the short war has claimed thousands of lives on both sides leaving widespread bitterness in its wake and although a democratic ukraine emerges intact if not unscathed its still dangerous neighbor faces an uncertain future with the russian political landscape at a tipping point whether the country leans toward greater authoritarianism under putin or away from him altogether will largely determine how russia behaves with the rest of the world scenario 2 a quagmire after weeks of intense fighting in kyiv and other major cities russia manages to topple ukraine s government and install a puppet regime however neither ukraine s armed forces nor its population are ready to surrender far from it instead the ukrainian population mounts a broad based well armed and well coordinated insurgency against the invaders although ukraine s regular forces are diminished over time and although major cities such as kyiv are occupied russia s victory is a pyrrhic one repeating a pattern seen elsewhere in the world the ukrainian insurgency forces a significant sustained human and financial toll on russia which is forced to devote far more of its resources over a much longer period of time than it had anticipated its headache is compounded by external support for the insurgents with nato countries providing covert but very robust defensive assistance to the ukrainian resistance the conflict drains moscow s coffers and resolve ultimately forcing a withdrawal after much violence and death putin and senior russian elites realize they are having their own brezhnev moment having overreached in their pursuit of maximalist aims in ukraine just as soviet premier leonid brezhnev led his country s forces into a long costly slog in afghanistan russia has once again fought an unwinnable war the proverbial quagmire that has trapped many powerful states through history just as badly in the eyes of most of the world russia has become a pariah state ukraine might be devastated but putin s prestige suffers and his domestic position becomes precarious as elites doubt his judgment and the broader populace expresses anger at russia s economic situation and reduced global standing scenario 3 a new iron curtain ukraine eventually collapses under the weight of the russian invasion despite intense opposition russian forces manage to take control of the country through the use of increasingly heavy handed weapons and tactics resistance against a putin installed puppet government is simmering and omnipresent but it is put down with brutal force and does not prove strong enough to pose a significant challenge to the substantial russian forces that remain in ukraine a new iron curtain descends in eastern europe running along the borders of the baltic states in the north through those of poland slovakia hungary and romania in the south while russia faces steep economic costs putin solidifies his hold on power internally quashing domestic dissent even more forcefully nato is more united in the face of an emboldened moscow but is forced to accept that it has very limited options to reverse the loss of ukraine in the wake of the crisis sweden and finland join the alliance to bolster their security against moscow s revanchist designs as with the first iron curtain the new schism through the heart of europe brings with it a familiar list of dangers and uncertainties newly suspicious nato and russian troops now stare at one another across a suddenly militarized border once again raising the prospects of direct conflict by accident or design intermittent security crises ebb and flow as russia repeatedly launches additional military adventures and much more aggressive hybrid warfare operations against nato allies the antagonists prepare themselves for a long bumpy standoff with no clear outcome and no guarantee of a peaceful resolution scenario 4 a nato russia war the most dangerous scenario for the future of europe and the global order is one in which the ukraine conflict sets the stage for a direct military conflict between nato and russia there are multiple pathways toward such an outcome including nato could decide to escalate its involvement in ukraine by for example attempting to implement a no fly zone or another form of direct intervention for now the united states and other nato allies have rejected implementing a no fly zone but that calculus could change if russia continues to escalate its bombardment of civilians russia would be forced to decide whether to back down or directly engage alliance military forces if it chooses the latter the risk of an escalating armed conflict between nato and russia would increase substantially russia could inadvertently strike a nato member s territory for example through imprecise targeting or erroneous identification of friend and foe prompting countermeasures from the alliance russia already has attacked targets close to the polish border as the russian military s stock of precision guided munitions starts to dwindle the risk of such an accident leading to an inadvertent escalation with nato rises this scenario would see the beginnings of direct conflict perhaps air to air or air to ground in border regions of ukraine in turn this could set off a tit for tat cycle of strike and counterstrike leading to open hostilities a fearful prospect concerns the possibility that putin has broader designs well beyond ukraine if russian forces make rapid progress in ukraine and achieve effective control over the country putin may turn his attention to states that he covets as part of a desire to reconstitute a sphere of influence that broadly aligns with the territory of the former soviet union the obvious candidates to test his designs and the resolve of nato itself would be the baltic states all of which are members of the alliance putin might harbor a belief that nato will back down if pushed nato insists it will fight any russian military incursion on a member state the fog of war early evidence suggests that this war is turning in the west s favor for three reasons the raw aggression of the russian invasion and the spirited ukrainian resistance have inspired popular support for ukraine across europe russia and putin appear to have badly underestimated both ukraine s determination and the global outrage against moscow finally democratic governments on both sides of the atlantic have made far reaching policy choices economic financial diplomatic and security that reflect a boldness of purpose and a newfound solidarity yet the world remains in a dangerous and highly uncertain moment what happens after this conflict is as much a question mark as how when and where the fighting ends these four scenarios reflect plausible outcomes but they hardly exhaust all possibilities putin could end up strengthened or weakened within russia depending on domestic developments a popular uprising or coup and external ones china bolstering or reducing its support for putin himself he could make a play for moldova or georgia or even attempt to take the suwalki gap between russia s baltic enclave of kaliningrad and belarus wars once begun rarely follow a script more frequently they lead combatants and non combatants alike down unanticipated pathways with occasionally world changing results russia s invasion of ukraine appears to have the seeds of such a conflict

the latest cnbc surveymonkey small business confidence index remains near an all time low but has not declined further even as inflation deepened and hit small businesses harder yet only 33 of small business owners say they approve of biden the lowest the survey has recorded since biden took office and an equal percentage describe business conditions as good biden s approval rating lost the most ground with democrats in the recent survey while support among independents ticked up though other recent public polling shows declining support among independents and economic issues weighing on approval numbers as president joe biden prepares to deliver his state of the union address on tuesday night amid a war in ukraine that has enflamed global tensions added to stock market volatility and increased inflationary pressures on the economy small business owners are among the audiences that biden needs to win back biden s approval rating with small business owners remains underwater according to the recent cnbc surveymonkey small business survey for q1 2022 one third 33 of small business owners approve of the way joe biden is handling his job as president while 67 disapprove slightly lower than where his approval rating was in q4 2021 and the lowest approval marks for the president since he took office feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here while the small business community skews conservative overall and biden s approval rating is extremely low among republicans 5 in q1 it slipped the most among small business owners who are democrats 89 in q4 83 now however biden s approval increased among independents 33 in q4 42 now which is in contrast to other recent public polling of americans who don t affiliate with either major party along racial and ethnic lines biden s approval rating is lowest among white business owners net 42 but he still gets high marks from black small business owners net 22 biden s overall approval from small business owners matches the 33 of owners who describe current business conditions are good the survey was conducted among over 2 000 small business owners across the u s before the outbreak of war in ukraine the war will be a dominant theme in the speech but with oil prices hitting a seven year high on tuesday and wheat prices surging to a level not seen since 2008 as a result of the conflict biden will also be pressed to address the inflationary pressures that were already sweeping through the small business sector and impacting business decisions and confidence on main street the white house has been signaling that in addition to a focus on russia and ukraine president biden will use the speech to make his case for a strong economy while acknowledging inflation as cnbc and nfib surveys show small business owners continue to struggle with economic headwinds including workforce shortages rising inflation and supply chain disruptions with little relief in sight said kevin kuhlman director of government relations at nfib early materials and messaging appear that president biden will acknowledge the challenges of inflation he said but he added that nfib remains worried about policy proposals including paid family and medical leave mandates and federal minimum wage hikes which could further pressure small businesses and continued focus on union friendly legislation the white house highlighted paid leave mandates a higher minimum wage as well as its support for the labor union supported pro act in an outline of economic priorities on monday things have changed dramatically on the international front which raises the stakes even more for the president at home said karen kerrigan president ceo of the small business entrepreneurship council at a critical time such as this our president needs the confidence and support of the american people behind him for the small business community she said this means a speech that addresses priority concerns like inflation health care and healing the economy rather than major tax or regulatory policies that will drive costs higher or fuel inflation further for small businesses the american people will hear a lot about how he s going to lower their costs how he s going to continue to build a strong economy over the long term white house press secretary jen psaki said in an msnbc interview this week we ve seen and heard from members about squeezes in supply chains and more corporate concentration further stifling supply chains and driving up prices said didier trinh the director of policy and political impact for the progressive small business trade group main street alliance he cited shippers as one example of an issue where biden can reach out to small business and the president is expected to highlight efforts to target the shipping industry trinh said tax fairness and a focus on large corporations remain an issue where progress is also possible to benefit small businesses small business are maybe not in an emergency situation like a year ago but they are far from fully recovered trinh said he and other small business experts cited support for small business health care costs related to the affordable care act legislation and tax credits as another area for bipartisan cooperation an increasing number 47 of small business owners are raising their prices to offset increases in the costs of supplies and more 32 plan to do so if inflation remains elevated which is their expectation according to the survey over 80 of small business owners expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now 55 say that is very likely while just 28 of small business owners are confident in the federal reserve s ability to control inflation overall 31 of small business owners say inflation is the biggest risk to their business now topping supply chain disruptions 23 covid 19 20 and labor shortages 12 inflation messaging president biden attempt to highlight a strong economy was outlined in an administration fact sheet posted ahead of the address and which emphasized that entrepreneurship and business investment rebounded the economy achieved its fastest job growth in american history the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years and that there was a historic shift from the old outdated trickle down approach to one that centers on workers families and small businesses but inflation remains the polling issue that dominates over broader economic gains inflation is an issue no incumbent administration wants in the headlines because they get blamed for it and can t control it certainly not in the short term said charles franklin director of the marquette law school poll it is also a great issue for the opposition party since no one likes inflation they don t have to have a specific cure for it and they can blame the incumbents jeff jones gallup senior editor said its data shows varying economic sentiment depending on the specific economic issue such as jobs and the stock market but overall views of the economy have turned more negative since inflation became a greater concern the job market is right up there with the best we ve ever seen so it is definitely a positive but it looks to me like inflation is overshadowing everything else jones said inflation is an effective issue for republicans to seize upon to think ill of biden while democrats downplay it but independents are quite concerned and that is a problem for biden and for democratic candidates franklin said although independent small business owners in the cnbc surveymonkey poll were slightly more positive quarter over quarter on biden though still expressing majority disapproval the most recent quinnipiac poll released in mid february found inflation topped the list of the most urgent issues facing the country at 27 and that independents were more closely aligned with republicans on this issue among republicans 36 cited inflation versus 13 of democrats who cited inflation as the top concern but among independents inflation was also the top issue at 32 the quinnipiac survey also found a majority of americans expecting russia to start a war the quinnipiac polling finds that 6 in 10 americans feel the economy is getting worse even though the majority describe their financial condition as good or excellent nearly three quarters 72 say increased prices on food and gas have caused them to change spending habits in its polling more than half of independents say they disapprove of the way biden is handling his job his overall approval rating in the quinnipiac survey of 35 in february was consistent with approval ratings since october which was the first time quinnipiac saw biden s approval rating dip below 40 it hasn t been able to get up above since then and independents are not helping those numbers said mary snow quinnipiac polling analyst similar to the cnbc survey biden s approval rating on the economy in the quinnipiac poll 33 was the lowest it has been since he took office it is up to him to re set his policies and political strategy by working across the aisle and to govern as a moderate like he said he would when he ran for office kerrigan said to learn more and to sign up for cnbc s small business playbook event click here

company and lemonade insurance agency llc overview lemonade is rebuilding insurance from the ground up on a digital substrate and an innovative business model by leveraging technology data artificial intelligence contemporary design and behavioral economics we believe we are making insurance more delightful more affordable more precise and more socially impactful to that end we have built a vertically integrated company with wholly owned insurance carriers in the united states and europe and the full technology stack to power them a brief chat with our bot ai maya is all it takes to get covered with renters homeowners pet car or life insurance and we expect to offer a similar experience for other insurance products over time claims are filed by chatting with another bot ai jim who pays claims in as little as three seconds this breezy experience belies the extraordinary technology that enables it a state of the art platform that spans marketing to underwriting customer care to claims processing finance to regulation our architecture melds artificial intelligence with the human kind and learns from the prodigious data it generates to become ever better at delighting customers and quantifying risk in addition to digitizing insurance end to end we also reimagined the underlying business model to minimize volatility while maximizing trust and social impact in a departure from the traditional insurance model where profits can literally depend on the weather we typically retain a fixed fee currently 25 of premiums and our gross margin is expected to change little in good years and in bad at lemonade excess claims are generally offloaded to reinsurers while excess premiums are usually donated to nonprofits selected by our customers as part of our annual giveback these two ballasts reinsurance and giveback reduce volatility while creating an aligned trustful and values rich relationship with our customers see business our business model and business our product offerings giveback feature lemonade s cocktail of delightful experience aligned values and great prices enjoys broad appeal while over indexing on younger and first time buyers of insurance as these customers progress through predictable lifecycle events their insurance needs typically grow to encompass more and higher value products renters regularly acquire more property and frequently upgrade to successively larger homes home buying often coincides with a growing household and a corresponding need for life or pet insurance and so forth these progressions can trigger orders of magnitude increases in insurance premiums the result is a business with highly recurring and naturally growing revenue streams a level of automation that we believe delights consumers while collapsing costs and an architecture that generates and employs data to price and underwrite risk with ever greater precision to the benefit of our company our customers and their chosen nonprofits 87

july 7 2020 we completed our initial public offering of common stock or ipo which resulted in the issuance and sale of 12 650 000 shares of common stock at the ipo price of 29 00 including the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares and generated net proceeds of 335 6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs on january 14 2021 we completed a follow on offering of common stock the follow on offering which resulted in the issuance and sale of 3 300 000 shares of common stock by us and 1 524 314 shares of common stock by certain selling shareholders and generated net proceeds to us of 525 7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs on february 1 2021 the underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares which resulted in the issuance and sale of an additional 718 647 shares of common stock by us and generated additional net proceeds of 114 6 million to us after deducting underwriting discounts key factors and trends affecting our operating results our financial condition and results of operations have been and will continue to be affected by a number of factors including the following seasonality seasonal patterns can impact both our rate of customer acquisition and the incurrence of claims and losses based on historical experience existing and potential customers move more frequently in the third quarter compared to the rest of the calendar year as a result we may see greater demand for new or expanded insurance coverage and increased online engagement resulting in proportionately more growth during the third quarter we expect that as we grow our customers expand geographically and launch new products the impact of seasonal variability on our rate of growth may decrease additionally seasonal weather patterns impact the level and amount of claims we receive these patterns include hurricanes wildfires and coastal storms in the fall cold weather patterns and changing home heating needs in the winter and tornados and hailstorms in the spring and summer the mix of geographic exposure and products within our customer base impacts our exposure to these weather patterns 88 table of contents covid 19 impact in december 2019 covid 19 was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the world health organization the global pandemic has severely impacted businesses worldwide including many in the insurance sector insurers of travel events or business interruption may be directly and adversely affected by claims from covid 19 or the lock down it engendered other insurers in lines of business that are not directly impacted by covid 19 may nevertheless be dependent on office based brokers in person inspections or teams that are poorly equipped to work from home all of which can translate into value erosion finally the broader financial crisis may hurt insurers in other ways too with interest rates at all time lows many insurers may see their return on capital drop while those selling premium or discretionary products may see an increase in churn and a decrease in demand against this backdrop it is noteworthy that our business has continued to grow and the key drivers of our business have continued their positive progress despite the pandemic lemonade writes insurance in lines that have so far been largely unaffected by covid 19 or indeed historically by recession our systems are entirely cloud based and accessible to our teams from any browser anywhere in the world customers phone calls are routed to our team s laptops and answered and logged from wherever they happen to be internal communication has been via slack and zoom since our founding the upshot is that while we all enjoy each other s company our teams are able to access systems support customers and collaborate with each other from anywhere much as they did before the pandemic our customers experience with lemonade is likewise largely unaffected by the turmoil as ai maya and ai jim chat with customers wherever they may be without triggering concerns about social distancing this resilience is reflected in our results as of december 31 2021 our in force premium or ifp was about 78 higher than it was on december 31 2020 and december 31 2020 was 87 higher in comparison to december 31 2019 the comparable pre pandemic period for information regarding how we calculate ifp see key operating and financial metrics in force premium while the global economy began to reopen in the first quarter of 2021 and continues to show positive economic growth in the u s as the vaccination roll out has reduced the spread and severity of covid 19 and variants of the virus there remains to be an uncertainty about the duration and ultimate impact of covid 19 and variants of the virus including the length of time needed to vaccinate significant segment of the global population and effectiveness of the vaccines with respect to the new variants of the virus management continues to monitor and cannot definitively determine the ultimate financial impact of covid 19 and variants of the virus and the related economic conditions at this time with respect to our investment portfolio which showed a diversified mix in securities beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and given the conservative nature of our portfolio and investment in high quality securities we do not expect a material adverse impact in the value of our investment portfolio or long term negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows as it relates to covid 19 and variants of the virus see risk factors risks relating to our industry severe weather events and other catastrophes including the effects of climate change and global pandemics are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition 89 table of contents reinsurance we obtain reinsurance to help manage our exposure to property and casualty insurance risks although our reinsurance counterparties are liable to us according to the terms of the reinsurance policies we remain primarily liable to our policyholders as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured see risk factors risks relating to our business and risks relating to our industry as a result reinsurance does not eliminate the obligation of our insurance subsidiaries to pay all claims and we are subject to the risk that one or more of our reinsurers will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations that the reinsurers will not pay in a timely fashion or that our losses are so large that they exceed the limits inherent in our reinsurance contracts each of which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices which may limit our ability to write new business through june 30 2021 we had proportional reinsurance covering 75 of our business under the proportional reinsurance contracts which cover all of our products and geographies we transferred or ceded 75 of our premium to our reinsurers proportional reinsurance contracts in exchange these reinsurers paid us a ceding commission of 25 for every dollar ceded in addition to funding all of the corresponding claims or 75 of all our claims this arrangement mirrors our fixed fee and hence shields most of our gross profit margin from the volatility of claims while boosting our capital efficiency dramatically we have opted to manage the remaining 25 of our business with alternative forms of reinsurance a portion of lemonade s proportional reinsurance program expired on june 30 2021 we renewed the majority of the expiring reinsurance contracts at terms that are very similar to the prior agreements as the business continued to grow and diversify and with stability in our insurance results we decreased the overall share of proportional reinsurance from 75 of premium to 70 in addition we purchased a new reinsurance program to protect us against natural catastrophe risk in the u s that exceed 60

written premium is the amount received or to be received for insurance policies written by us during a specific period of time without reduction for premiums ceded to reinsurance the volume of our

potential losses as well as to provide additional capacity for growth ceded written premium is earned over the reinsurance contract period in proportion to the period of risk covered the volume of our ceded written premium is impacted by the level of our gross written premium and any decision we make to increase or decrease in reinsurance limits retention levels and co participation our ceded

investment manager our cash and invested assets are primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities and may also include cash and cash equivalents equity securities and short term investments the principal factors that influence net investment income are the size of our investment portfolio and the yield on that portfolio as measured by amortized cost which excludes changes in fair value such as changes in interest rates the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of our invested equity capital along with premium we receive from our customers less payments on customer claims

commissions as of the period end date a customer that has more than one policy counts as a single customer for the purposes of this metric we view customers as an important metric to assess our financial performance because customer growth drives our revenue expands brand awareness deepens our market penetration creates additional upsell and cross sell opportunities and generates additional data to continue to improve the functioning of our platform in force premium we define in force premium ifp as the aggregate annualized premium for customers as of the period end date at each period end date we calculate ifp as the sum of i in force written premium the annualized premium of in force policies underwritten by us and ii in force placed premium the annualized premium of in force policies placed with third party insurance companies for which we earn a recurring commission payment in force placed premium currently reflects approximately 2 of ifp 93 table of contents the

historical revenues deferred revenues or any other gaap financial measure over any period ifp is not a forecast of future revenues nor is it a reliable indicator of revenue expected to be earned in any given period we believe that our calculation of ifp is useful to analysts and investors because it captures the impact of growth in customers and premium per customer at the end of each reported period without adjusting for known or projected policy updates cancellations rescissions and non renewals we use ifp because we believe it gives our management useful insight into the total reach of our platform by showing all in force policies underwritten and placed by us other companies including companies in our industry may calculate ifp differently or not at all which reduces the usefulness of ifp as a tool for comparison premium per customer we define premium per customer as the average annualized premium customers pay for products underwritten by us or placed by us with third party insurance partners we calculate premium per customer by dividing ifp by customers we view premium per customer as an important metric to assess our financial performance because premium per customer reflects the average amount of money our customers spend on our products which helps drive strategic initiatives annual dollar retention we define annual dollar retention adr as the percentage of ifp retained over a twelve month period inclusive of changes in policy value changes in number of policies changes in policy type and churn to calculate adr we first aggregate the ifp from all active customers at the beginning of the period and then aggregate the ifp from those same customers at the end of the period adr is then equal to the ratio of ending ifp to beginning ifp we believe that our calculation of adr is useful to analysts and investors because it captures our ability to retain customers and sell additional products and coverage to them over time we view adr as an important metric to measure our ability to provide a delightful end to end customer experience satisfy our customers evolving insurance needs and maintain our customers trust in our products our customers

non gaap financial measures the non gaap financial measures below have not been calculated in accordance with gaap and should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin ratio of adjusted gross profit to gross earned premium and adjusted ebitda should not be construed as indicators of our operating performance liquidity or cash flows generated by operating investing and financing activities as there may be significant factors or trends that they fail to address we caution investors that non gaap financial information by its nature departs from traditional accounting conventions therefore its use can make it difficult to compare our current results with our results from other reporting periods and with the results of other companies our management uses these non gaap financial measures in conjunction with gaap financial measures as an integral part of managing our business and to among other things i monitor and evaluate the performance of our business operations and financial performance ii facilitate internal comparisons of the historical operating performance of our business operations iii facilitate external comparisons of the results of our overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels iv review and assess the operating performance of our management team v analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and vi plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin we define adjusted gross profit a non gaap financial measure as gross profit excluding net investment income plus fixed cost and overhead associated with our underwriting operations including employee related expense and professional fees and other and depreciation and amortization allocated to cost of revenue after these adjustments the resulting calculation is inclusive of only those variable costs of revenue incurred on the successful acquisition of business and without the volatility of investment income we use adjusted gross profit as a key measure of our progress towards profitability and to consistently evaluate the variable contribution to our business from underwriting operations from period to period we define adjusted gross profit margin a non gaap financial measure expressed as a percentage as the ratio of adjusted gross profit to total revenue the following table provides a reconciliation of total revenue to adjusted gross profit and the related adjusted gross profit margin for the periods presented year ended december 31 2021 2020 in millions total revenue 128 4 94 4 adjustments loss and loss adjustment expense

contents ratio of adjusted gross profit to gross earned premium the ratio of adjusted gross profit to gross earned premium measures the relationship between the underlying business volume and gross economic benefit generated by our underwriting operations on the one hand and our underlying profitability trends on the other we rely on this measure which supplements our gross profit ratio as calculated in accordance with gaap because it provides management with insight into our underlying profitability trends over time we use gross earned premium as the denominator in calculating this ratio which excludes the impact of premiums ceded to reinsurers because we believe that it reflects the business volume and the gross economic benefit generated by our underlying underwriting operations which in turn are the key drivers of our future profit opportunities we exclude the impact of ceded premiums from the denominator because ceded premiums can change rapidly and significantly based on the type and mix of reinsurance structures we use and therefore add volatility that is not indicative of our underlying profitability for example a shift to a proportional reinsurance arrangement would result in an increase in ceded premium with offsetting benefits to gross profit from ceded losses and ceding commissions earned resulting in a nominal overall economic impact this shift would result in a steep decline in total revenue with a corresponding spike in gross margin whereas we expect that the ratio of adjusted gross profit to gross earned premium would remain relatively unchanged we expect our reinsurance structure to evolve along with our costs and capital requirements and we believe that our reinsurance structure at a given time does not reflect the performance of our underlying underwriting operations which we expect to be the key driver of our costs of reinsurance over time on the other hand the numerator which is adjusted gross profit includes the net impact of all reinsurance including ceded premiums and the benefits of ceded losses and ceding commissions earned because our reinsurance structure is a key component of our risk management and a key driver of our profitability or loss in a given period we believe this is meaningful therefore by providing this ratio of adjusted gross profit to gross earned premium for a given period we are able to assess the relationship between business volume and profitability while eliminating the volatility from the cost of our then current reinsurance structure which is driven primarily by the performance of our insurance underwriting platform rather than our business volume the following table sets forth our calculation of the ratio of adjusted gross profit to gross earned premium for the

based compensation net investment income and other transactions that we would consider to be unique in nature we exclude these items from adjusted ebitda because we do not consider them to be directly attributable to our underlying operating performance we use adjusted ebitda as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other customers of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance adjusted ebitda should not be viewed as substitute for net loss calculated in accordance with gaap and other companies may define adjusted ebitda differently the following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss for the periods presented year ended

270 6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 801 8 million in investments from the date we commenced operations we have generated negative cash flows from operations and we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of equity securities on january 14 2021 we issued and sold 3 300 000 shares of common stock and generated net proceeds to us of 525 7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs on february 1 2021 the underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares which resulted in the issuance and sale of an additional 718 647 shares of common stock by us and generated additional net proceeds of 114 6 million excluding capital raises our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums investment income reinsurance recoveries and proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets these funds are primarily used to pay claims operating expenses and taxes we believe our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2021 will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs over at least the next 12 months our cash flows used in operations may differ substantially from our net loss due to non cash charges or due to changes in balance sheet accounts the timing of our cash flows from operating activities can also vary among periods due to the timing of payments made or received some of our payments and receipts including loss settlements and subsequent reinsurance receipts can be significant therefore their timing can influence cash flows from operating activities in any given period the potential for a large claim under an insurance or reinsurance contract means that our insurance subsidiaries may need to make substantial payments within relatively short periods of time which would have a negative impact on our operating cash flows we are a holding company that transacts a majority of our business through operating subsidiaries consequently our ability to pay dividends to stockholders meet debt payment obligations and pay taxes and operating expenses is largely dependent on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries and affiliates whose ability to pay us is highly regulated our u s and dutch insurance company subsidiaries and our dutch insurance holding company are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without the prior approval of their respective competent regulatory authorities as of december 31 2021 cash and short term investments held by these companies was 184 2 million insurance companies in the united states are also required by state law to maintain a minimum level of policyholder s surplus insurance regulators in the states in which we operate have a risk based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of the insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premium insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action as of december 31 2021 the total adjusted capital of our u s insurance subsidiary was in excess of its respective prescribed risk based capital requirements the following table summarizes our cash flow data for the periods presented year ended december 31 2021 2020 in millions net cash used in operating activities 144 6 91

144 6 million for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 52 9 million from 91 7 million for the year ended december 31 2020 this reflected the 119 0 million increase in our net loss primarily offset by increases in unearned premium funds held and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense that exceeded the increase in prepaid reinsurance premium premiums receivable and amounts expected to be recovered from our reinsurance partners the increase in cash used in operating activities from year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to claims payments settlements settlements with our reinsurance partners and increased spend related to growth and expansion cash used in operating activities was 91 7 million for the year ended december 31 2020 this reflected the 13 8 million increase in our net loss including the 12 2 million one time non cash share contribution expense partially offset by increases in funds held for reinsurance treaties

and amounts expected to be recovered from our reinsurance partners investing activities cash used in investing activities was 804 8 million for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to purchases of u s government obligations corporate debt securities short term investments and purchases of property and equipment during the year cash provided by investing activities was 50 1 million for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to the proceeds from sales or maturities in excess of purchases of short term investments financing activities cash provided by financing activities

more fully discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses the estimation of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on various complex and subjective judgments actual losses paid may differ perhaps significantly from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements similarly the timing of payment of our estimated losses is not fixed and there may be significant changes in actual payment activity the assumptions used in estimating the likely payments due by period are based on our historical claims payment experience and industry payment patterns but due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of such payments there is a risk that the amounts paid can be significantly different from the amounts disclosed 103 table of contents the amounts in the above table represent our gross estimates of known liabilities as of december 31 2021 and do not include any allowance for claims for future events within the time period specified accordingly we expect that the total amounts of obligations paid by us in the time periods shown will be greater than those indicated in the table to the extent our future operating cash flows are insufficient to cover our net losses from catastrophic events we had 1 072 4 million in cash and investment securities available at december 31 2021 we also have the ability to access additional capital through pursuing third party borrowings sales of our equity issuance of debt securities or entrance into new reinsurance arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period we evaluate our significant estimates on an ongoing basis including but not limited to estimates related to unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reinsurance assets stock based compensation income tax assets and liabilities including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset income tax provisions and certain non income tax accruals we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for further information see note 4 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense the reserves for loss and lae represent management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses and lae incurred through the balance sheet date unpaid losses and lae are based on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate indicator of future events the incurred but not reported portion of unpaid losses and lae is based on past experience and other factors the estimate of the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense relies on several key judgments the determination of the actuarial models used as the basis for these estimates the relative weights given to these models the underlying assumptions used in these models and the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and in some cases the disaggregation of dissimilar losses because actual experience can differ from key assumptions used in establishing reserves there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves for property coverage the nature of claims is generally a short reporting period with volatility arising from occasional severe events the process for estimating and recording unpaid losses and lae is dependent on historical reported claims industry information the frequency and latency of claims reported and assumptions of current environmental factors 104 table of contents the following tables summarize our gross and net reserves for unpaid loss and lae as of december 31

of potential reserve deviations from our carried reserve at december 31 2021 we applied sensitivity factors to incurred losses for the three most recent accident years and to the carried reserve for all prior accident years combined due to our contractual arrangements with our reinsurers the sensitivity analysis results in no change to our previous income or stockholders equity the amount by which estimated losses differ from those originally reported for a period is known as development development is unfavorable when the losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on unresolved claims development is favorable when losses ultimately settle for less than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reducing loss reserves on unresolved claims we reflect favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed

reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and consequently are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties this estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include paid and unpaid amounts recoverable whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection the financial condition of a reinsurer i e liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction and the collectability of the reinsurance recovery for factors such as amounts outstanding length of collection periods disputes any collateral or letters of credit held and other relevant factors income tax assets and liabilities including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed 106 table of contents we consider a number of factors to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize nols foreign tax credits realized capital loss and other carryforwards these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and company specific conditions and events we subject the forecasts to stresses of key

among other things lowering corporate income tax rates from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 gaap requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment we evaluated all available information and made reasonable estimates of the impact of tax reform to substantially all components of our net deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017 we finalized our accounting for the tax act during 2018 with no significant impact to earnings or deferred taxes stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic 718 compensation stock compensation stock options are mainly awarded to employees and members of our board of directors and measured at fair value at each grant date we calculate the fair value of share options on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and the expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest using the straight line method the requisite service period for share options is generally four years we recognize forfeitures as they occur prior to the ipo the fair value of common stock underlying the options was historically determined by our board of directors with input from management and considered third party valuations of our common stock because there was no public market for our common stock prior to the ipo our board of directors determined its fair value at the time of grant of the option by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including financing investment rounds operating and financial performance the lack of liquidity of share capital and general and industry specific economic outlook among other factors our board of directors determined the fair value of common stock based on valuations performed using the option pricing method opm and the probability weighted expected return method pwerm subject to relevant facts and circumstances for the year ended december 31 2019 see

summarize some highlights for the fourth quarter and current outlook and then provide an update on our low carbon energy initiatives before turning it back over to elijio to discuss cash flow the balance sheet and liquidity let me start by thanking all of our tetra employees for delivering strong fourth quarter operating results and a solid year given the number of extraordinary headwinds we faced including a second year of covid 19 pandemic unprecedented inflation a record breaking first quarter freeze and a devastating third quarter hurricane despite all of this we finished another year of positive cash flow 13 adjusted ebitda margins and strong momentum in the fourth quarter with the best quarterly operating results not including the mark to market gains from standard lithium and csi compressco in the last seven quarters and since the start of the pandemic for the year 2021 we delivered 50 million of adjusted ebitda on 388 million in revenue with the pandemic largely behind us in the past two years we were able to achieve positive free cash flow significantly reduced total debt outstanding and improved adjusted ebitda margins to nearly 13 despite an average 32 revenue drop from 2019 and before the impact of covid 19 this again shows the resiliency and strength of our business model in the last in the severest of downturns but as importantly coming out of the downturn from the prior two years we are a stronger company with a much improved balance sheet well positioned for a recovering oil and gas industry and the opportunity to execute on a high growth energy transition market revenue for the fourth quarter of 113 million grew 19 sequentially and 50 year on year we generated over 13 million of adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter in the face of continued inflation and global logistics challenges excluding the realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments for standard lithium and csi compressco this was the highest adjusted ebitda since the pre pandemic first quarter of 2020 we generated 7 4 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and again reduced our term loan this time by 13 million for a total of 68 5 million over the past two years water and flowback has seen a significant recovery from the negative impacts of covid 19 as fourth quarter revenue of 53 million increased 14 sequentially and 70 from the fourth quarter of 2020 fourth quarter revenue was down only 7 from the pre pandemic first quarter of 2020 this compares to the u s rig count and active frac fleet count down 29 and 36 sequentially respectively from the same period overcoming inflation we were able to improve our adjusted ebitda margins by 200 basis points from the third quarter and the 12 9 adjusted ebitda for the quarter was the best since the third quarter of 2019 again on much lower activity levels these results comparing to pre pandemic numbers reflect the strength of our business through market share gains ongoing pricing improvements efficiency through our automation technology a strategy focused on treatment and recycling of produced water leading proprietary technology such as sandstorm and tetra steel and another record quarter with 62 integrated water management projects regarding sandstorm we gained 24 new customers in 2021 11 of which were gained in the fourth quarter argentina continues to be a bright spot as the most active unconventional share market outside of the u s in addition to our current fully deployed sandstorm in argentina we were awarded two significant early production facilities that will positively impact us beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and which will also include additional sandstorms as part of those facilities in addition to the significant increased interest in produced water recycling for frac reuse in part due to the increased seismic activity in key disposal areas we are also seeing a new area of interest from both the operators and the midstream companies for extracting key minerals from produced water tetra s core competency in aqueous chemistry and experience with extracting and manufacturing products from such minerals is a good fit with this growing opportunity overall i m pleased with the continued improvement in our water and flowback services business and our performance demonstrates we are a much stronger business heading into a recovery market in 2022 i m optimistic we will surpass our next level adjusted ebitda margins target of 15 earlier in 2022 than we previously anticipated completion fluids and products fourth quarter revenue increased 23 sequentially and 36 year over year as we saw a strong demand from our previously mentioned gulf of mexico and international deepwater awards on top of the recovery from the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico our eastern hemisphere energy services revenue more than doubled from q3 and we believe is indicative of improved international market activity going forward although q4 had mild weather for our seasonal calcium chloride sales january and february weather has changed dramatically in our favor and will contribute to even stronger revenue for the first quarter of 2022 excluding the benefit of the realized mark to market gains completion fluids and products adjusted ebitda increased 14 sequentially with 20 4 ebitda margins this represents the 11th straight quarter of adjusted ebitda margins of over 20 despite double digit inflation across most of our raw materials energy prices for the plants and global logistics as we look toward the first quarter of 2022 we expect further double digit over the fourth quarter from a recovering double digit growth over the fourth quarter from a recovering oil and gas market and strong chemical sales supported by a five year distribution agreement with a new industrial chemicals customer for the western u s and a ramp up of our pureflow zinc bromide sales for energy storage we secured our first generation one cs neptune job for the north sea which is scheduled for completion in the second quarter as a reminder the typical cs neptune job in the north sea will be considerably smaller than what we have historically seen in the gulf of mexico but is an indication of continued acceptance of our technologies outside of the gulf of mexico the previously mentioned planned investment in northern europe for a 25 increase in calcium chloride production capacity continues to be on track for completion in the third quarter of 2022 for the full year and beyond deepwater is showing signs of recovery as well and given the new outlook on much lower u s shale growth production compared to the years from 2014 to 2019 we believe deepwater activity will be key to support oil and gas demand for years to come considering that the 2021 global active drillship rig count was 58 below the 2014 to 2015 peak there is considerable deepwater growth potential at current oil and gas prices in a review of our cs neptune pipeline in the pre pandemic period of q1 2020 we found that nearly every cs neptune project we have been tracking at that time is still in our pipeline but in nearly every case the pandemic had dramatically slowed or even paused the projects from moving forward that now seems to be changing as the customer dialogue on these key projects is active again this is supported by the fact that the first 20 000 psi rated ultra deepwater drillships is scheduled for a gulf of mexico project later this year followed by the second drillship for an additional project in early 2023 other than the north sea jobs scheduled for the second quarter that i mentioned previously we do not yet have additional wells confirmed for this year but the project pipeline and the customer discussions are encouraging compared to the past two years we do expect that the continued supply chain challenges to have some impact on the timing of customer deepwater projects as well in the meantime we continue to strengthen our ip position for cs neptune with over 13 patents granted and 10 patents allowed our low carbon energy business initiatives continue to progress at a rapid pace on december 16th 2021 we announced our long term partnership with eos energy a leading u s provider of safe scalable efficient and sustainable zinc based long duration energy storage systems this partnership aligns well with our strategy to utilize our aqueous chemistry core competency and u s manufacturing capabilities to enable the supply chain for low carbon energy solutions tetra s supplying eos with our high purity zinc bromide pureflow to support the manufacturing of eos innovative zinc aqueous zinc battery from the recent eos q4 earnings call they will be increasing their revenues from 5 million in 2021 to 50 million in 2022 with a backlog of 148 million booked orders they also increased their opportunity pipeline from 3 7 billion at the end of the third quarter to 4 1 billion or 25 gigawatt hours of energy storage to put this in perspective 25 gigawatt hours of energy storage translated into pureflow volumes would equal more than 20 of the current annual production of bromine globally for all industries for this reason along with our ability to recycle the end of life electrolyte a collaborative long term strategic relationship is important for both parties which brings us to our arkansas brine leases and plans we re currently drilling an exploratory well on our arkansas leases in the area where tetra retains 100 of the lithium and bromine rights we expect this well to be completed this month and expect the information and data gain will satisfy requirements necessary for an inferred resources report in the second quarter for our current exploration target of 2 54 million to 8 58 million tons of bromine and exploration target of 85 000 to 286 000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent from these results we expect to initiate a preliminary economic assessment or pea to produce lithium carbonate and elemental bromine from our acreage in december of 2021 we invested 5 million and signed a joint intellectual property agreement with carbonfree a co2 capture and mineralization technology company for co2 free calcium fluoride production solution to enable carbonfree skycycle co2 capture technology this will allow us to participate in the equity upside as carbonfree continues to make progress in commercializing its skycycle proprietary technology and we continue to advance our long term business relationship jointly working on plans to source and provide substantial volumes of calcium chloride carbonfree successfully mineralized co2 in its san antonio skycycle pilot plant this process requires large volumes of calcium chloride as a key part of the conversion chemistry and tetra will bring its global leadership in the production of calcium chloride supply chain network and technical expertise to the partnership with that i ll turn it over to elijio to provide some additional color and we ll close with some comments and then open for some questions elijio serrano chief financial officer thank you brady fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were breakeven compared to a 0 03 loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 loss from continuing operations was 703 000 a significant improvement from the loss of 7 1 million in the fourth quarter of last year during the fourth quarter we sold the shares that we own in standard lithium which resulted in a realized gain of 4 6 million in the fourth quarter that was included in our adjusted ebitda the fourth quarter also included a 3 2 million unrealized mark to market loss on the common units that we own in csi compressco the net of the two is a benefit to adjusted ebitda of 1 4 million in the fourth quarter as you recall in the third quarter the unrealized mark to market gains reflected in adjusted ebitda was 6 2 million from both standard lithium and csi compressco as a reminder we still own slightly over 5 2 million common units for csi compressco with a current value of 7 3 million and we have no restrictions on our ability to monetize this asset we excluded from fourth quarter results unusual items that totaled 891 000 in nonrecurring expenses net of nonrecurring income fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations was 7 4 million despite a 12 million sequential increase in accounts receivable on the back of the 19 sequential fourth quarter increase in revenue fourth quarter free cash flow benefited from the 17 6 million in proceeds from the sale of the 1 6 million shares of standard lithium that we announced in the 8 k filing earlier in the quarter in that 8 k filing we had mentioned that we had monetized 1 5 million shares and shortly after the 8 k was issued we sold the other 100 000 shares that we own in total we sold 1 6 million shares at an average price of 11 02 compared to the standard lithium share price today of 6 50 we expect to be receiving another 400 000 shares of standard lithium before the end of april as part of an option agreement that we have with standard lithium these 400 000 shares will be in addition to 1 million of cash that we received at the end of december at 6 50 per share the value of the shares to be received from standard lithium are approximately 2 6 million on top of the cash that we received in december adjusted free cash flow for the year was 9 3 million reflecting the proceeds of the sale of the shares of standard lithium working capital at the end of december was 81 7 million a change of 6 9 million from year end 2020 as you recall from 2020 when business slows down we can generate significant free cash flow as we monetize working capital when the markets pull back and as brady mentioned we invested 5 million in carbonfree in the form of a convertible note that will enable us to participate in the equity upside as they commercialize their skycycle carbon capture technology and if carbonfree goes public our 5 million investment converts into common stock total debt outstanding was 152 million at the end of december down from a high of 222 million in the third quarter of 2019 while net debt at the end of the year was 120 million we have reduced our term loan by 13 million in the fourth quarter primarily using the proceeds from the sale of our shares in standard lithium consistent with what we previously communicated the 26 reduction in the term loan has reduced our annual interest expense by at least 4 million a year as a result of the improved ebitda proceeds from the sale of standard lithium and the reduction in the term loan we have improved our net debt ratio to 2 7 times which is the lowest since the third quarter of 2020 we have less than 1 million outstanding as of the end of february on our 80 million asset based revolver liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter was 68 million at the end of the fourth quarter unrestricted cash was 32 million and availability under our credit facility was 36 million we have been aggressively paying down debt to create borrowing capacity as we move toward bringing to market our arkansas smackover formation bromine and lithium assets or potentially invest in calcium chloride production facilities to support carbonfree also in preparation to expand into the low carbon energy initiatives and to source the most cost effective capital we have been having discussions with the department of energy exploring opportunities for grants and low cost loans to date we have had three very promising virtual meetings with different individuals and departments within the department of energy we are taking the steps to apply for various loans and grants to help us advance some of the lithium battery storage with pureflow and carbon capture initiatives that we have been discussing this year we will spend between 2 5 million and 3 million to drill the brine well that brady mentioned and to conduct studies to further refine our exploratory target assets to more tightly defined inferred resources for bromine and lithium assets in arkansas we then expect to complete the preliminary economic assessment that will further define the investments required and the related returns on capital as we move toward developing our bromine and lithium assets in arkansas this pea will help us quantify the potential revenue ebitda cash flow and capex from our assets in arkansas we will publicly announce the results of the inferred resources target and the pea when they are complete finally we reached agreement with our insurance underwriters for a claim on one of our gulf of mexico properties that sustained that hurricane damage last year as a result we expect to receive cash proceeds of 3 75 million in march of this year that will further improve our liquidity and cash position we encourage everyone to read our news release that we issued yesterday and the 10 k that we filed last night with all the supporting details and additional financial and operational metrics with that let me turn it over to brady for closing comments brady murphy president and chief executive officer thank you elijio so in closing overall despite the challenges that we discussed earlier we had a strong quarter but more importantly we are a much stronger and more diversified company than we were a few years ago both of our business segments are approaching pre pandemic financial metrics well ahead of pre pandemic activity levels we re very well positioned from improved results from improving u s and argentina oil conventional shale markets an improving outlook on deepwater activity and rapidly growing markets for lithium energy storage and carbon capture supported with what we believe is our strongest balance sheet since 2012 in just one year since announcing our low carbon energy initiatives we re generating profitable results with minimal additional capital investment and we expect this emerging business will grow significantly over the coming years so with that we ll open it to questions thank you questions answers operator thank you and today s first question comes from stephen gengaro with stifel please go ahead stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst thanks good morning brady murphy president and chief executive officer good morning stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst just sort of i just wanted to start with the arrangement you have with eos and when you think about and maybe not 22 but in 23 i think people expect them to do about 200 million in revenue as an entity based on the consensus for eos is that i mean are we thinking about it right if we think that translates to 30 million or 40 million in revenue for you guys like i m trying to correlate the two and i was curious if you could give us some color i imagine your product has to be a pretty big input cost to what they re doing elijio serrano chief financial officer good question stephen we clearly don t want to comment on what eos consensus or revenue expectations are but we clearly believe that if they increase proportionate in the coming years that our increase in the sale of pureflow will be proportionate to the increase in revenue so if they re going from 5 million this year too call it 50 million for the sake of argument we expect that we re going to increase by the same magnitude now they also have not divulged to us and we re not privy to what percent pureflow represents as a percent of their cost of goods sold or as a percent of revenue but we think we are a meaningful part of that number stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst ok thanks and then two others one is and you touched on this a little bit in the opening remarks your fluids business had a 10 million sequential increase in revenues and the margins slipped a bit i think adjusted margins went down about 200 basis points so like 20 5 on the ebitda line and i think it s raw materials but can you just talk about how you think that shakes out going forward and how are you doing recovering those higher costs with pricing brady murphy president and chief executive officer right yeah so we did see a small drop in the margin on our completions in the fourth quarter and that was nearly all inflation related stephen energy costs raw materials cost and global logistics kind of all in the double digit range and it got a little bit ahead of us in terms of being able to get our pricing improvements out i would say in the fourth quarter inflation was out ahead of us in terms of getting our pricing increases with our customers i think as we go into q1 assuming inflation doesn t continue to grow at least flattens out somewhat we were getting ahead on the pricing side so we do expect our margins to improve as we go from q4 to q1 and then we ll just have to see how inflation either stabilizes or starts going down hopefully in the second half of the year and how that plays out elijio serrano chief financial officer and brady i ll also add and remind everybody that the second quarter is our peak for northern europe calcium chloride sales and historically we ve seen about a 15 million sequential increase q1 moving to q2 and the ebitda impact has historically been in the 4 million range and we don t see any shift in that seasonal pattern this year so we ve got a couple of good quarters we think coming up to demonstrate sequential improvements stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst and elijio just you said about 15 14 million 15 million in revenue or ebitda elijio serrano chief financial officer that s correct that s what we have seen historically with the ramp up stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst ok and then just one final one the water business has had a very good third quarter should we just think about that as kind of obviously you have some international stuff but kind of mimicking what s going on in the u s land side and you should i would imagine your incremental ebitda margins there should be 25 30 range as we go through 22 if you continue to see growth there elijio serrano chief financial officer we re gaining traction with pricing we re gaining traction with the sandstorm technology we re seeing a ramp up of sandstorms also in latin america that brady mentioned all three we think are going to contribute to the goal that we set out and we communicated in the press release of 15 margin for this business this year stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst all right and just a clarification did you say double digit fluids growth in the first quarter sequentially brady murphy president and chief executive officer yes over q4 stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst ok thank you brady murphy president and chief executive officer and then as elijio said the second quarter we ll see our european revenue ramp up from the numbers that elijio discussed 15 million stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst great thank you gentlemen brady murphy president and chief executive officer thank you stephen operator and our next question today comes from samantha hoh with evercore isi please go ahead samantha hoh evercore isi analyst hey guys brady murphy president and chief executive officer good morning samantha hoh evercore isi analyst quick question about the capex plan i think you were outlining how much you were spending on the brine well but i think a lot of capex last year went toward growing the water business and with the expanded argentina contract we have awards for the two early production studies i m just kind of wondering how much you re dedicating capex to really growing your capacity in the water space again elijio serrano chief financial officer samantha good question the majority of our additions on the water management and flowback are either sandstorm related or related around the epf because we announced that we secured two significant epfs in south america and they have historically been very profitable for us in the past and everything else that we re doing in north america is targeting paybacks of 18 months or better so we believe that we do have some capacity expansion coming up in north america with paybacks at 18 months or less samantha hoh evercore isi analyst any sense of what your market share is in north america for brady murphy president and chief executive officer sorry samantha just to clarify were you asking market share just on sandstorm or overall water and flowback samantha hoh evercore isi analyst both if you have that handy brady murphy president and chief executive officer yeah so we are gaining traction continuously with sandstorm sandstorm is replacing a lot of traditional production testing assets that there s a fairly significant amount of traditional pt assets in north america and sandstorm is continuing to encroach on that i would say we re probably still below 10 of the overall combined production testing and sand management or sandstorm market share but we re growing rapidly as we indicated in 2021 and even in the fourth quarter when we picked up 11 new customers and we re also now penetrating the haynesville with our 15 000 units so we expect that market share traction to continue and also a strong position in argentina overall water and flowback our strongest market share is in the permian basin where we believe we have a very strong market share one or two depending on which day in terms of the number of crews that we are following frac crews that we are following and then it varies from that around the basins in north america but certainly a no 2 position in overall across north america elijio serrano chief financial officer and samantha i would also add that in the trips that brady and i and matt have made to the field we have seen our organization make a nice inroads with the private companies the private oil and gas operators and picking up quite a bit of market share in that sector at good margins given the capital discipline on the publicly traded oil and gas operators that has also contributed to our growth in revenue and margins brady murphy president and chief executive officer and just to further clarify samantha we don t participate in the infrastructure side of water whether it s sourcing freshwater or it is pipeline disposals type assets but on the pure services where we have our integrated water management surface that s where we believe we have our strongest market share position and as i said either one or two in the permian basin just depending on the current frac count follow ups that we have samantha hoh evercore isi analyst ok that s great and i was wondering about your comments around extracting key minerals from produced water that s kind of the first i ve heard of anything like that being explored could you maybe give a little bit more details in terms of what is going on in that arena brady murphy president and chief executive officer sure as you know the u s is looking to have a security supply of key minerals particularly those that enable the energy transition so lithium obviously is would be at the top of the list but there are other key minerals that are in produced water some of them at commercial levels some of it not at commercial levels we ve been really pleased with the engagement that we ve had with multiple operators as well as midstream companies to analyze their produced water and to determine the commerciality of the minerals that are in these produced waters some of them we re very encouraged with they re very encouraged with others not so much but it s i think it s a growing trend that you re going to see a new market evolve out of the produced waters that are being produced samantha hoh evercore isi analyst so you ll be able to apply your equipment on surface and actually extract the mineral brady murphy president and chief executive officer correct yeah we have great expertise in that area samantha samantha hoh evercore isi analyst ok cool the other thing that is on the cs neptune sales into the north sea in 2q i was curious if you guys are having dialogues with cs neptune for the north sea into 2023 given that demand is expected to really in that region next year just kind of wondering what sort of advanced outlook and discussions you guys are having with the customer base at this stage brady murphy president and chief executive officer yeah the neptune market i ll separate into two different views on that the gulf of mexico are more longer term multi well very deepwater ultra high pressure project and those have a long time horizon but they also have a very significant dollar financial impact to tetra if we re successful the north sea type projects are more mature and are more spot type opportunities there are some that are specific development projects but they re really more opportunistic opportunities where our customers run into pressures that fit the neptune profile so i would consider them somewhat different markets more of a call out opportunity market in the north sea with some major projects but gulf of mexico is a very different outlook from that samantha hoh evercore isi analyst ok and i guess are you able to source neptune i mean do you have to move that from your production in the gulf or can you supply the north sea market from closer facilities brady murphy president and chief executive officer well we produce our neptune product at our west memphis facility in arkansas we can do some lending to weigh up or lower the weight of neptune in the north sea in aberdeen or other offshore bases that we have around the world but the core production product comes out of arkansas from our west memphis facility samantha hoh evercore isi analyst ok gat i think that for me brady murphy president and chief executive officer ok great thanks samantha operator our next question today is a follow up from stephen gengaro with stifel please go ahead stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst thanks two things i just wanted to i was just sort of thinking about the pace of your earnings throughout the year but it sounds like the completion fluids side given the seasonality in europe and you given the cs neptune job you mentioned am i thinking about it correctly where i mean you could see a very steep rise in 2q ebitda in fluids just off those two pieces elijio serrano chief financial officer yep stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst ok and i know you probably don t want to specifically comment on this but it seems like the consensus for the year is give or take 80 million in ebitda i know there are some puts and takes that are going on with costs etc but do you think that s in the ballpark elijio serrano chief financial officer let me answer it this way stephen i think the oilfield services group as a whole has moved away from consensus we have learned over the last five six years that there s so many moving parts beyond our control that trying to forecast that far into the future is not beneficial if you layout for us the recovery from the coronavirus the recovery of the global economics what s going to happen with the war in ukraine and whether capital discipline from the buy side on the oil and gas operators you lay out all those parameters we probably give you a fairly good number for our total year view what we can say is that our first and second quarters based on what s in front of us and the feedback we re getting with customers is that we re looking at a nice sequential improvement in revenue like we talked about a very nice step up q2 over q1 with good pull through beyond that is pure speculation and i think we will refrain from anything beyond q2 stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst ok and just one follow up though on the waterfront the could you just remind us the percentage of that which is u s land just in the ballpark i was trying to sort of calibrate what u s completion activity is doing and how we should think about that pace of revenue on that part of the business elijio serrano chief financial officer well yes so the u s has been the predominant part of it but with the sandstorm that we moved into argentina plus also the epfs that we re picking up in argentina back half of the year i think those will be a more meaningful part of our business but today we re predominantly u s and argentina with the u s being the significant part of it stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst ok great thank you very much operator this concludes today s question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to mr murphy for any closing remarks brady murphy president and chief executive officer thank you rocco this concludes our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call thank you very much for your interest and participation that ends our call operator duration 40 minutes call participants elijio serrano chief financial officer brady murphy president and chief executive officer stephen gengaro stifel financial corp analyst samantha hoh evercore isi analyst more tti analysis all earnings call transcripts

in our international business yesterday we were pleased to announce an agreement to purchase the remaining 16 8 minority interest in scotiabank chile from our local partner this purchase will add approximately 35 million per quarter to our earnings in international bank upon closing the transaction allows us to further invest in a business and an economy we know very well scotiabank chile has

franchise momentum gbm recently launched scotia red a series of state of the art electronic trading tools that provide high quality electronic execution solution for our capital markets clients

acknowledging excellence in providing customers with exceptional advice and a great banking experience while delivering for our shareholders and our communities q1 was an excellent quarter in terms of both financial performance and progress on our initiatives to continue to enhance the customer experience and further invest in scale and product capability within our simplified geographic footprint with that i will turn the call over to raj for the financial review raj viswanathan chief financial officer thank you brian and good morning everyone before i begin i d like to note that all my comments on the bank and business line results will be on an adjusted basis as i did in the past few quarters in select sections i will refer to quarter over quarter performance as for certain metrics we feel it is relevant to discuss those trends i ll also refer to numbers excluding the impact of fx in many areas as this continues to be an important factor for evaluating particularly the year over year competitors you will recall in q3 we added slide 38 which discloses the impact of fx to key income lines we believe this continues to be a relevant disclosure with that i ll begin the review of the performance for the quarter on slide 5 the bank reported another strong quarter with earnings of 2 7 billion and diluted earnings per share of 2 15 an increase of 14 year over year and 2 quarter over quarter all four business lines reported strong results again this quarter reinforcing the strength of our diversified platform return on equity improved to 15 9 this quarter while pre tax pre provision earnings increased a strong 6 compared to the previous quarter revenues were also up 3 excluding the impact of fx in addition lower investment gains and the high performance fees earned in global wealth management last year impacted the revenue growth by an additional 2 quarter over quarter revenues increased 5 with strong growth in all 4 business lines net interest income was up 3 excluding the impact of fx net interest income was also up 3 compared to last quarter driven by strong loan growth across all the business lines quarter over quarter net interest margin was relatively stable at 216 basis points on slide 6 you can see the drivers of the quarter over quarter change in net interest margin at the all bank level as well as for the canadian and international banking segments our balance sheet is naturally positioned to benefit from administrated interest rate increases that are expected to commence in canada in the next quarter there have been significant rate increases across the pacific alliance that will benefit earnings through the remainder of 2022 more specifically in mexico and chile this quarter we have provided additional interest rate sensitivity disclosures on slide 22 year over year noninterest income was up 2 excluding the impact of fx higher banking and wealth management fees and higher income from associated corporations were offset by lower investment gains trading revenues and insurance income quarter over quarter noninterest income was up a strong 7 driven by higher trading revenues banking and wealth management fees and underwriting and advisory fees the pcl ratio of 13 basis points for the quarter was a decline of 36 basis points from last year but a modest increase of 3 basis points from last quarter year over year adjusted expenses were up 2 excluding the impact of fx the increase related to growth in performance and share based compensation and other discretionary costs such as advertising and technology to support business growth on an adjusted basis the productivity ratio was 52 2 this quarter compared to 51 8 a year ago while operating leverage was negative 0 7 on slide 7 we provide an evolution of our common equity tier 1 ratio over the quarter as well as changes in risk weighted assets the bank reported a strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 12 down 24 basis points compared to the prior quarter the decrease was due primarily to buyback of approximately 12 4 million shares during the quarter under the bank s novel course issuer bid strong internal capital generation of 32 basis points was offset by organic business growth in risk weighted assets of 12 million or 29 basis points across all business lines at these levels compared to 11 cet1 ratio the bank will have excess capital of approximately 4 billion to support continued organic growth while continuing its share buyback program as brian mentioned we have agreed to purchase the remaining 16 8 of scotiabank chile from our local partner the transaction is valued at 1 3 billion and upon closing will have an impact on capital of approximately 10 basis points the transaction remains subject to customer closing conditions and regulatory approvals turning now to the business line results beginning on slide 8 canadian banking reported very strong earnings of 1 2 billion up 32 year over year pretax pre provision earnings grew 10 year over year as strong revenue growth outpaced expense growth revenue increased 9 year over year as net interest income and noninterest income grew by 8 and 12 respectively net interest income growth was driven by a strong year over year loan growth of 12 including 15 growth in mortgages and 16 growth in business loans and acceptances net interest margin declined seven basis points year over year impacted by shifts in business mix in particular the continued strong growth in mortgages the margin was however stable quarter over quarter the noninterest income year over year increase of 12 was driven by higher banking and mutual fund distribution fees expenses increased 6 the increase was driven by higher personnel costs as we continue to build teams in the retail and business banking businesses along with technology and other discretionary costs to support business growth operating leverage continued to be positive for the fourth quarter in a row at 2 1 the pcl ratio was negative three basis points compared to 23 basis points a year ago and negative 10 basis points in the prior quarter turning now to global wealth management on slide 9 earnings of 419 million were up 13 excluding the seasonally elevated performance fees in the prior year and up a strong 7 quarter over quarter canadian wealth management earnings grew 14 excluding the mentioned performance fees driven by higher investment fund fees from aum growth double digit balance sheet growth in private banking and strong fee based asset growth international wealth management grew a strong 19 on a constant dollar basis revenue grew 6 quarter over quarter underpinned by higher investment fees net interest income growth and higher fee based revenues aum and aua both increased 11 to 345 billion and 601 billion compared to last year with strong net sales and market appreciation we continue to generate positive net sales along with strong investment results for our clients with dynamic funds ranked no 1 among independent in five year returns referring to slide 10 global banking and markets global banking and markets generated earnings of 561 million this quarter up 3 year over year and a strong 12 quarter over quarter pretax pre provision income increased 25 quarter over quarter and 2 year over year revenue increased 19 quarter over quarter and 5 year over year driven by strong performance across most of gbm s business lines quarter over quarter capital markets revenue was up 33 with strong growth in ficc and equities corporate and investment banking also experienced a very strong quarter with loan growth of 5 quarter over quarter and 8 year over year combined with margin expansion underwriting and advisory fees were up 4 year over year and 19 quarter over quarter expenses were up 13 sequentially due to seasonally higher personnel costs the year over year expenses rose 9 due to increase in technology costs to support business development the productivity ratio of gbm remained strong at 47 7 for the quarter gbm latam which is reported as part of international banking had a record quarter with 200 million of earnings an increase of 15 from last year and 11 over the prior quarter revenues grew strongly in both business banking and capital markets up 18 and 46 respectively from the prior quarter again this quarter we maintained our no 1 position in bloomberg s loan syndication lead tables slide 11 shows the international banking results my comments that follow are on an adjusted and constant dollar basis international banking reported net income of 552 million up 50 over q1 last year and 5 quarter over quarter pretax pre provision earnings grew 4 year over year and 7 quarter over quarter pretax pre provision earnings in the pacific alliance grew a strong 9 quarter over quarter while pre tax pre provision earnings in mexico and chile are well above pre covid levels while peru s pre tax free provision earnings grew 15 quarter over quarter the segment s net income continues to grow in line with economic recovery and has steadily delivered improving results for the last six quarters quarter over quarter loans grew 3 with commercial up 2 and mortgages up a strong 5 while personal loans and credit card balances increased 2 for the first time in eight quarters revenue was up 5 over the prior quarter as the positive trend in net interest income continued nii increased 5 quarter over quarter driven by strong loan growth and margin expansion net interest margin improved seven basis points from the prior quarter to 3 76 driven by spread increases offset slightly by business mix changes noninterest revenue was up 4 year over year and 5 over the prior quarter mainly driven by strong capital markets results banking and card fees across the pacific alliance and the caribbean provisions for credit losses ratio declined quarter over quarter by 14 basis points to 77 basis points driven primarily by lower provisions for unpaid loans resulting from lower formations mainly in peru and mexico noninterest expenses declined 2 year over year but increased 3 quarter over quarter due to higher seasonal expenses in the caribbean and due to higher performance based compensation this was partly offset by the benefits of the q4 2021 restructuring charge the business generated positive operating leverage of 1 8 now turning to the other segment we reported an adjusted net loss of 67 million as compared to a loss of 35 million in the prior quarter and a gain of 47 million in the prior year year over year the change was a result of significantly lower investment gains and lower contribution from asset liability management activities partially offset by the scene loyalty program payment in 2021 i ll now turn the call over to phil to discuss risk phil thomas chief risk officer good morning raj good thank you raj and good morning everyone credit performance has trended better than expectations we laid out at fiscal 2021 year end our credit portfolio is healthy and well balanced driven by a favorable business mix shift toward more secured and higher quality affluent customers especially in international banking our focus will continue to be our customers with strong individual balance sheets and investment grade corporate clients i m pleased to outline the details for the quarter beginning on slide 14 gross impaired formations and net write offs continued to decline we continue to see a positive trend with lower impairments across all portfolios and quarter over quarter the gil ratio has improved three basis points to 64 basis points our net write off ratio also improved 27 basis points down by seven basis points quarter over quarter additionally write offs were 457 million mainly driven by improved performance in underlying credit quality in international banking and are expected to be stable for the remainder of the year from a balance sheet perspective we ended the quarter with allowances for credit losses of 5 6 billion down approximately 150 million from the prior quarter we are suitably provisioned and our coverage ratio reflects the high quality nature of our portfolio including a higher mix of secured lending our acl ratio will continue to improve and is now 80 basis points this is down six basis points compared to the prior quarter turning to slide 16 i will speak to our pcl performance this quarter for q1 2022 all bank pcl is 222 million or 13 basis points driven by net reversals from performing loan pcls and lower formations international retail continues to improve mostly driven by personal loans and credit card performance performing pcl had a net reversal of 183 million and impaired pcls reported 405 million in q1 down 106 million from last quarter overall our credit portfolio remains strong and we continue to thoughtfully expand our balance sheet with a focus on high quality credit customers our provisioning approach incorporates multiple scenarios for economic factors such as gdp growth inflation and changes in rates thus providing us with comfort with our provisioning and our total allowances for credit losses i will now turn the call over to brian for closing remarks brian porter president and chief executive officer thank you phil we are encouraged by our start to 2022 and we are confident in our ability to exceed our medium term objectives we expect the earnings growth in our canadian banking business to continue driven by loan growth and additional fee income as the year progresses we expect the strong momentum in our international banking business to accelerate in the pacific alliance countries and the renewed growth in the caribbean to continue for the balance of the year we expect pre tax pre provision growth to continue from higher revenue and our ongoing focus on cost efficiencies strong franchise momentum continues in our global wealth businesses resulting from industry leading investment management performance and gains throughout our advice channels and our private banking businesses gbm s earnings continue to grow with strong contributions from capital markets businesses and corporate and investment banking results driven by loan and advisory revenue growth our advisory pipelines remain strong the benefits of our diversified trading businesses a strong advisory pipeline and a rebound in financing activity throughout our footprint support our constructive outlook we are confident that each of our four business lines are well positioned to deliver growth and continue to believe that 2022 will be a year that clearly demonstrates the full earnings power of scotiabank with that i ll turn the call back to john for q a john mccartney thank you brian we ll now be pleased to take your questions operator can we have the first question on the poll please questions answers operator the first question is from doug young desjardin capital markets please go ahead doug young desjardins capital markets analyst hi sorry good morning just wanted to go to the international banking side and i guess this is a two part question i think raj you mentioned rate increases in mexico and chile should benefit international banking for the rest of the year can you put this into context in terms of what the nim impact could be or in terms of dollar figures and then the second part of the question on international banking is we did see a sequential increase in pre tax pre provision earnings in peru and colombia and i get the last quarter was low but it is still encouraging to see the sequential increase have we made that pivot should we expect that momentum sequentially to continue and what are some of the drivers raj viswanathan chief financial officer yes sure doug i ll start about rate increases like we indicated last quarter 25 basis points is roughly about 20 million of niat in the international bank but that assumes a reasonable change in the slope of the rate curve as we ve disclosed this year sorry this quarter in our prepared analyst deck the rate situation both in chile and mexico which is where we are most rate sensitive now the long end of the curve has remained flat we ve seen significant improvement in the short end of the curve and we have also seen significant rate increases which you have seen 475 basis points in chile and 175 basis points in mexico and so on so this quarter we did benefit because the 7 basis points equates as you can tell if you did this the math to the earning assets and so on 23 million of net interest income that has come through as we see the rate curve move up we should see significant benefits happening for the rest of the year it s a little difficult to give you specific guidance by country because there s multiple factors that moved the rates and therefore the impact on nii nacho you want to take the question on colombia mexico nacho deschamps group head international banking and digital transformation and peru yes yes it s really good to see peru and colombia recovering had a strong recovery in the quarter it is coming on the back of very strong gdp growth over 10 in 2021 in both countries and we are seeing that reflected in strong loan growth of 3 in peru 5 in colombia margin expansion and what i m very pleased is to see the overall performance of all geographies in international banking this quarter because strong loan growth was 3 for the second consecutive quarter with also revenue acceleration of 5 q over q both in net interest income and net interest revenue nim expansion as you have lighted of seven bps this quarter and strong ptpp growth in all geographies improved credit quality and a positive operating leverage so that in addition to the acquisition of the scotiabank chile shares of our parties there is going to also add around 35 million in incremental niat in international banking when we close this transaction so looking forward i see very good momentum for growth based on the macro outlook and the business performance doug young desjardins capital markets analyst thank you operator the next question is from gabriel dechaine national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst yes sticking with international the margin was up there was a bit of a headwind from mix and i know mortgage growth commercial growth is outpacing other categories but i also want to revisit the whole strategy to downsize or exit certain lending activities and if we can talk a bit about exactly what those are how big they are and what sort of financial impact you expect from them nacho deschamps group head international banking and digital transformation well i would follow up on what i was saying gabe we are seeing a very positive growth we grew 3 in the quarter in international banking very strong growth 5 in mortgages 2 in commercial and for the first time we also saw a growth of 2 in personal loans and credit cards so overall we see within our risk appetite it s a very positive momentum for growth also positive in terms of revenues nim expansion that we increased seven bps this is equivalent to 30 million in net interest income and as we mentioned the last time we expect to continue growing our net interest income raj if you would like to raj viswanathan chief financial officer yes sure gabe if you go to the outlook that we talked about asset growth in international banking and we talked about high single digit growth primarily in commercial right with call it 6 to 9 in that range likely double digit growth in mortgages and unsecured lending we said will be in the mid single digit growth that s exactly how this quarter has played out with momentum like nacho mentioned we re seeing growth in the unsecured lending space which is personal and credit card we expect that to actually accelerate for the rest of the year so the risk appetite hasn t had a big change other than like phil mentioned we have a lot of what we call affluent customers so we re originating better quality and our stock is of better quality too so you re seeing the effects of that on acl unlikely you ll see the effect on growth but not to mute in any factor other than metrics like nim and so on like we mentioned earlier like we will not get to the 450 basis point range but you re going to see nim expansion throughout the year gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst so there s nothing changing in the i mean i thought i heard last quarter there was some and i wanted to revisit that brian porter president and chief executive officer yes gabe it s brian last call we made a comment about a consumer finance business in peru as you know we were in the business in the dr we exited we sold the business and the same thing in chile peru was the last business we had outstanding we were close to having it sold pre pandemic that process is ongoing it s relatively small it s not material for the bank we having said that we didn t like how it performed throughout the pandemic but it would be roughly 400 million of outstanding so it s relatively small so that s the only change in the product lineup gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst ok all right i thought it could be something more substantial but that s not the case brian porter president and chief executive officer yes gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst thanks ok operator the next question is from scott chan canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst thanks brian you talked about in your earlier comments that you got full earnings power into 2022 and if i look at your adjusted roe this quarter at 15 9 it continues to improve sequentially every quarter since the start of the pandemic so when i think about roe potential in 22 23 considering the project is slow is it feasible that your roe trajectory continues to improve brian porter president and chief executive officer yes look scott thank you for the question the answer is yes and it s we re very bullish about the outlook of the bank and if you look at it by business line i ll give you a couple of samples in dan s business in canadian banking auto is improving but it s still not where you expect it to be and there s issues there around supply chain and availability of cars and things like that the credit card business is coming back and you re seeing that in our numbers but you ll see the full earnings power of the canadian bank as well as it pertains to international banking nacho has articulated how business in the pacific alliance continues to improve the caribbean is still playing catch up here a bit we re a major bank in the caribbean as tourism improves fee business improves for our credit card business there and day to day banking will improve so there s lots of things that will leverage the roe going forward and you ll see our roe through 16 scott chan canaccord genuity analyst 16 good and then maybe dan just on the auto loans in canada obviously supply chain issue seems significantly higher used car prices just wondering on that growth out front it s kind of paused right now and as your underwriting standards changed recently dan rees group head canadian banking yes thank you it s dan here no our credit appetite remains open for business but hasn t changed in the last number of quarters as you mentioned given the supply chain issues there is a greater appetite for used cars we anticipate to be clear that lgds for used vehicles will be better in this part of the cycle than they would have been pre covid as brian mentioned there s lots of opportunity to come when full supply comes to dealers in canada we have seen bookings rise as of q1 up year over year 7 so that s a very encouraging trend notwithstanding dealers having challenges getting products to their floor plans so we are seeing some softness on the commercial side the bulk of our revenue is driven by retail paper and we had a record revenue year in fiscal 21 in auto we saw that continue in q1 and the case really is when are we going to see the full torque of this business is it q3 is it q4 it s certainly coming it s a mainstay of our franchise and we re open for business in auto scott chan canaccord genuity analyst ok thank you very much operator the next question is from mike rizvanovic from stifel gmp please go ahead mike rizvanovic stifel financial corp analyst good morning i had a question for dan i wanted to go to slide 32 in your presentation so thanks for this additional color what i wanted to ask about is with respect to the mortgage originations that come from the non branch channels is there any way you could give us a little bit of insight into the cross sell so if it s coming in from the broker dan rees group head canadian banking yes sorry i think you may have dropped off there i think assuming the rest of your question was sources of growth in mortgage given we had a particularly robust balanced quarter our one of my primary objectives in retail is to improve our direct ownership over the customer opportunity and so we ve been very intentional about growing the sales force in our proprietary mortgage specialist channel i m pleased to say in the last two years we ve added 50 more salespeople and dollar balance volume through that channel is up 100 and so it s been a major source of growth for us over the last number of quarters and you saw that appear again in q1 on the question of cross sell i would like to demystify the perspective that market brokers do not offer cross sell opportunities the dealt it between our proprietary channel and mortgage broker in cross sell is indistinguishable and i think in the last 6 months in particular our pickup on day to day checking and savings accounts of mortgages in general has been at levels we haven t seen in years we do believe that we continue to have opportunity to convert more of these net new customers into full franchise scotia customers and that s our game plan and you ll see us continue to invest in this anchor product from here i hope that answers the full part of your question mike rizvanovic stifel financial corp analyst yes that s very helpful dan so basically not much of a difference between what you can cross sell through a branch originated mortgage versus one that comes to the broker channel dan rees group head canadian banking that s correct as others have heard me speak of in the past our unique market leading step program scotia total equity program the broker channel i m pleased to report originates 80 of new product in that step program which sets us up with a global limit for drawing customers into our revolving product including the high roe credit card position mike rizvanovic stifel financial corp analyst thank you that s super helpful thanks very much dan rees group head canadian banking welcome operator the next question is from paul holden from cibc please go ahead paul holden cibc analyst thank you good morning so going back to international banking nacho just a common question i m hearing is regarding the pace of rate increases in the pacific alliance countries and potential for demand destruction as a result of that so just wondering if you can help us think through demand loan demand sensitivity relative to borrowing costs nacho deschamps group head international banking and digital transformation thank you for your question well we have seen increased interest rate increases but i believe this is also at the same time with a significant change in the economic environment strong economic growth credit demand has been low particularly for some retail products so we are seeing the opposite at this point pick up in general in credit demand in all products i would say that we expect this loan growth momentum to continue also in the case of interest rates for retail products there s much less sensitivity to these interest rate increases is more of course more relevant on the commercial segment but overall i m very optimistic about loan growth we are growing at 3 as i said in this for two quarters already so that is going to that is our expectation that we will continue to grow 2 to 3 per quarter which is similar to pre covid loan growth levels paul holden cibc analyst ok great that s helpful thank you operator the next question is from lemar persaud from cormark please go ahead lemar persaud cormark securities analyst i want to circle back to the discussion on international banking margin so it feels like you guys can come in above the low end of the 380 to 390 basis point range as offered last quarter quite easily frankly considering the seven basis point increase this quarter and that is the rate so maybe provide an update on the 390 basis point range and then maybe take that discussion up to the all bank level and offer an outlook on nims there raj viswanathan chief financial officer sure thanks lemar happy to take that question i ll start with in the order that you asked international banking margin as you know is very complicated we ve got inflation impacts over there we ve got rate caps we ve got obviously big increases that have come through fairly quickly in the administered rates and we re seeing a flattening rate so so there s a lot of things going on over there product mix is standing from our perspective as well so i wouldn t update the outlook that we gave the 380 to 390 basis points at this time likely we ll talk more about it in q2 because it s more trends but what i can tell you is it s trending better than what we thought when we gave the outlook in q4 2021 so i ll leave it at that specifically to the international bank so there s more to come like i mentioned a little earlier we think there is more goodness that will come through the process but it depends a lot about how the rate curve shapes as we go through these months looking forward the bank story is slightly different i think the bank we manage our net interest margin as i mentioned before by actively positioning the balance sheet appropriately so that continues and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we are positioned to benefit from rate increases across the footprint and we should see some of that benefit coming through the canadian banking business which has had pretty modest margin compression and that s mostly driven by business mix as credit cards and personal loans start growing as well that will have an impact on nim like i mentioned in the outlook in november the bank s margin should grow modestly throughout the year this year a lot of it will depend on how the business mix shift happens and how soon it happens in our p c businesses and of course the rate curve situation depending on how soon rate increases come in canada and how does the long end of the rate curve shape itself so i think it will be positive it won t be a headwind for us for the rest of the year but it s a little difficult to predict in this environment how soon and how much the rate increases will be at the all bank level lemar persaud cormark securities analyst ok thanks that s it for me operator the next question is from sohrab movahedi from bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you glen it was mentioned that there is some work getting done with global wealth and canadian banking to generate some i guess some new business opportunities are there such opportunities also that you could talk about in the international banking segment between the international wealth and then maybe give us an update on plans to add some capabilities maybe acquire some capabilities in the u s where are you on that part glen gowland group head global wealth management sure thanks very much rob i would say if we look at international and the growth we have there i really think canada as a blueprint is a good place to look so we re obviously very proud of the strong results we had this quarter but the real story is really the breadth across the various business lines so as i look across the business line before beyond the performance fees raj mentioned in asset management the industry leading investment results are helping drive those market share gains and positive net sales across all our internal and external channels and that s actually moved us to no 2 among canadian banks and retail mutual fund assets in canada and that engine is a really important one because our asset management business is quite global by nature and as we look to build out within our international footprint in conjunction with nacho that s going to play a very big role in that similarly when we look across our advisory businesses and our total wealth offerings in canada the growth of our private banking and the advisory businesses more broadly is a really good blueprint that we ve already started to launch in international and so that led to that 19 growth we re already starting to see early results there last thing i ll mention on the u s nothing to announce at this point but certainly as we look to develop u s capability is something that we continue to look in more on that later sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst and glen just to be abundantly clear some of the opportunities you were talking about with the international segment for example is that contingent on a u s capability or will the u s capability be additive to that glen gowland group head global wealth management yes that s an important question sohrab it s actually not so the biggest opportunity that we have we ve already got existing wealth management businesses in international but as we build out and leverage our footprint across specifically the pacific alliance countries that s really where the primary benefit is in onshore so the u s capability would help us in the ultrahigh net worth space for that for those clients both in latin america as well as canada but it s not contingent on that at all sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst ok thank you operator thank you there are no further questions on the line at this time brian porter president and chief executive officer well thank you everyone for participating in our call today we re very pleased with the strong start to the year with earnings momentum across all our businesses on behalf of the entire management team i want to thank everyone for participating in our call today and look forward to speaking

s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 20 2022 at this time i would like to turn the call over to our president and chief executive officer mike sherman mike sherman president and chief executive officer thanks michelle good morning everyone and thanks for joining us reflecting on 2021 it was certainly a pivotal year for the company as you know the foundation of our strategy has been built around the tembexa program which will satisfy of course a critical need to protect the population from the threat of a smallpox outbreak public awareness of this threat has certainly increased in the last couple of years the human health and economic consequences would be substantial the tembexa program is also strategically important to the company as it is expected to provide access to considerable non dilutive capital to fund our oncology drug development this potential long term source of capital is particularly valuable and somewhat unique among our peers in this period of financial market uncertainty with the fda approval in june and then the barda request for proposal in december this strategy is coming to fruition the fda s summary of tembexa s approval provided a very attractive and an independent perspective on the value of this drug easily administered in a crisis situation indicated for all ages and with a robust resistance profile as expected barda s requests called for up to 1 7 million courses of treatment the contract will cover procurement of tembexa for the strategic national stockpile as well as the execution of post marketing approval commitments the most important elements of the negotiation include product pricing and initial order quantities and we ll report on the outcome of the negotiation as it concludes we remain well positioned financially ahead of the first shipment which we are poised to trigger upon the signing of a contract we started 2021 with the acquisition of oncoceutics which brought to the organization some outstanding people and a pipeline of promising oncology assets compelling response data had already been reported for onc201 in glioma although it had not been confirmed and during the course of the year we were able to confirm that response data through a rigorous regulatory quality blinded independent central review and in the process we revealed an even stronger dataset to support this drug as a treatment for h3 k27m mutant glioma in particular those responses were more durable than expected initial response of at least 50 tumor reduction was achieved at a median of just over eight months after the start of treatment and was followed by a median of an additional 11 months of durability importantly it was apparent that these responses mattered as they were associated with performance status improvement a reduction in steroid use and longer survival it s always reassuring when the data has this internal consistency across the endpoints the fact that many of the patients continued to receive onc201 even after progression is probably the most compelling evidence for the safety profile of the drug but also is a sobering confirmation of the lack of treatment options for these patients during 2021 we held a number of meetings with the fda to discuss our preparations for a potential new drug application for onc201 and have been executing on those deliverables in the meantime this work includes important cmc and clean farm activities as well as the collection and validation of safety data from more than 200 patients we re also engaged with the fda in the review of a frontline randomized trial design we plan to initiate in the second half of this year in this h3 k27m population we want this trial to be up and running during fda s review of a potential nda we ve also collaborated with the fda on a natural disease history study because the h3 k27m mutation is relative but relatively newly discovered we plan to submit data related to what the field and frankly the w h o have already recognized the fact that it is rare to observe responses from current standards of care in this post radiation setting we ve initiated this work in sites under a protocol which was submitted to the fda and we re actively gathering that data now for patients to meet the same criteria as was used for the 50 patient efficacy analysis in this case of course these patients were not treated with onc201 you can imagine this won t be a large data set as awareness of onc201 has been high and many patients sought out treatment with onc201 through clinical trials or expanded access we ll know more about the size of that dataset in the next couple of months as that information is collected and verified keep in mind this is a retrospective study which will collect data from previously treated patients so the response analysis we plan to subject this data to the same blinded independent central review process we use for the onc201 efficacy analysis we expect to be far enough along in each of these work streams and ongoing consultation with the fda to provide guidance on our regulatory timelines by mid year now let me turn to our dstat program the dash phase 3 trial in front line aml enrollment of this study has proceeded more slowly than expected due to the ongoing hospital staffing shortages related to covid 19 and the competitive environment for enrolling subjects in this population as a result we don t expect to complete enrollment of the first 80 patients by year end and are currently reviewing a number of options to accelerate these steps development one tailwind in that in that space in aml in particular the momentum we anticipated supporting mrd as a potential point has materialized and this may serve to help accelerate our longer term development with that i d like to hand the call over to dr lanier to discuss recent developments with cmx521 you ve heard me mentioned previously that while our focus has shifted to oncology we expected that we may be sitting on potential value with our legacy antiviral library as the world begins to focus on pandemic preparedness by identifying molecules that have potential against entire families of viruses the potential value of this library has been highlighted this collaboration with the university of north carolina has really been phenomenal in helping us identify that value without losing focus on other projects as this highly credible team of collaborators saw the results of initial experiments this project became their highest priority and the subsequent work has progressed very quickly let me stop there and let randall share what we ve learned on one of the more mature assets from this library randall randall lanier chief science officer thanks mike we ve recently generated some very promising preclinical efficacy data and an established animal model of covid 19 with one of our proprietary drugs this was done by exciting collaboration with readdi the rapidly emerging antiviral drug development initiative at the university of north carolina chapel hill readdi and unc have deep expertise in this area and have been actively involved in efforts to develop other agents for the current pandemic including data of the sars cov 2 antiviral which received emergency use authorization late last year they are continuing to explore novel therapies with improved activity and resistance profiles to address anticipated variants of sars cov 2 our collaboration with them has enabled several key studies of cmx521 and this is a nucleoside analog from our chemical library for activity against sars cov 2 cmx521 is particularly attractive because it was developed through a phase 1 healthy volunteer study for another indication the build up to that study included standard help and safety gmp manufacturing and all the other myriad studies needed to start human trials this previously completed were de risks many of the common pitfalls of early drug development the most important of which often involves safety cmx521 has a very favorable safety profile in animals and humans it s not genotoxic cytotoxic or mitotoxic and was well tolerated up to very high levels of 2 4 grams in a healthy volunteer phase 1 study for these reasons and the efficacy data i ll describe in a minute the program can be moved into a human proof of concept study for covid rather quickly the completed non clinical studies of sars cov 2 demonstrate a very compelling activity in a well studied mouse model of covid and in the mouse model one day in the mouse model is roughly equivalent to a humans administration of inhaled aerosolized cmx521 enables direct delivery to the lungs while minimizing systemic exposure and we think this improves both efficacy and safety in the mouse model aerosolized cmx521 placebo was administered at various times relative to sars cov 2 infection to explore the potential for both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy prophylactic administration of cmx521 starting eight hours prior to infection to one dose eight hours prior to infection reduced average viral titers in the lungs on day four by more than 3 5 logs for about 99 99 and preventing weight loss and clinical progression versus placebo treatment studies of cmx521 initiated at the time of infection or 8 hours or 16 hours post infection also significantly reduced viral load titer at day four cmx521 treatment protected mice from clinical symptoms of disease significantly reducing the weight loss associated with the disease and decreasing the lung pathology compared to placebo just as an example cmx521 initiated 16 hours post infection reduced average viral lung titer the amount of sars cov 2 in the lungs by more than 2 5 logs or more than 99 importantly contemporary modeling methods to estimate the translation of these efficacious doses in mice to target clinical doses predicts the doses in humans should fall within a range that could be delivered with commonly used systems like battery powered portable nebulizer or dry powder inhalers additional studies are currently planned or underway to assess efficacy at lower doses and less frequent administration to compare with other antivirals in this model system and to evaluate efficacy in combination with other antivirals briefly all the signs point to a proven virus specific mechanism of action broad variant coverage a safety profile that looks clean enough for prophylactic use and excellent efficacy in the animal model furthermore we have kg of gmp drive ready for development excellent patent life and a simple potentially of short path to proof of concept in humans while we focus on the advancement of our oncology pipeline and progress toward a tembexa procurement agreement with barda this collaboration with readdi allowed us to efficiently evaluate our antiviral library and cmx521 looks very promising we have an upcoming or presentation later this month at the international conference on antiviral research in seattle where we ll discuss this data in greater detail and with that i ll turn the call over to mike andriole mike andriole chief financial and business officer thanks randall and good morning everyone earlier today we issued a press release containing our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 starting with our balance sheet at the end of december 2021 we had approximately 90 million in capital to fund operations in january we paid a 14 million note payable related to the acquisition of oncoceutics in january of 21 importantly we do not allow any further payments related to that transaction until u s or eu approval of onc201 also to provide additional financial flexibility last month we entered into a 50 million revolving credit line with silicon valley bank we have not drawn down on this facility to date and have no obligation to use the facility we do see it as a tool to supplement our financial position by providing an alternative source of capital that can be utilized on an as needed basis for example in advance of an anticipated or future shipment of tembexa to barda we could potentially use this credit facility to bridge the gaap between procurement orders as we look forward to 2022 this year is expected to be a pivotal year for the company in many ways and certainly from a financial perspective as we expect our first commercial product sale of tembexa to the u s strategic national stockpile to occur likely during the second quarter as mike have mentioned we have submitted to barda our response to their rfp which details our proposal for price quantities and delivery schedule of 1 7 million treatment courses of tembexa we expect the potential revenue from the sale of tembexa this year and in future years to enable us to fully invest in our oncology pipeline and build a u s sales and marketing organization for potential onc201 commercialization as we have confirmation on the specifics of a potential barda procurement we will provide more precise financial guidance turning to our statement of operations the company reported a net loss of 39 5 million or 0 45 per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with a net loss of 11 7 million dollars or 0 19 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020 the fourth quarter included a 20 million success milestone payment to the legacy oncoceutics shareholders in relation to the achievement of a 20 overall response rate by rano hgg for onc201 revenues for the fourth quarter of 21 decrease to 46 000 with the completion of the barda 2011 research and development contract as compared to 1 1 million for the same period in 2020 research and development expenses increased to 34 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with 8 7 million for the same period in 2020 again this increase is primarily related to the 20 million success payment for onc201 general and administrative expenses also increased to 5 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 4 2 million for the same period in 2020 with that overview i ll turn the call back to mike for closing remarks mike mike sherman president and chief executive officer thanks mike we certainly have an exciting year ahead with catalysts in both the tembexa and onc201 programs in addition now to cmx521 which wasn t really on the radar even a few months ago we look forward to building on this momentum during the year with that elizabeth ready to open the call to questions questions answers operator our first question comes from maury raycroft with jefferies maury raycroft jefferies analyst hi good morning congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my questions i was going to ask as barter process just checking how competent you are that the negotiations could occur and finalize over the next couple of weeks or months i guess if you can put any finer points on the timeline there and what are your latest thoughts on dialog with barda particularly with our pricing premium versus mike sherman president and chief executive officer i think typically you see these processes play out over 60 days to 90 days i don t know that we have much more insight into that process i would say that the elements of negotiation are pretty focused as i mentioned it s really pricing and delivery schedule the rest is is really about reimbursement for activities and ends up being a small portion of the contract we feel really good about our proposal for pricing and supported that analytically and of course we work with experts and former barda officials who can ensure that we re making that or building that case in a way that is compelling to the reviewers so we ll know soon enough how they how they respond to that but i feel very good about what was a very comprehensive response to the rfp maury raycroft jefferies analyst got it and also once the barda contract is secured are you saying whether you will actively pursue business development as a means to grow your pipeline or do you plan to focus internally with the 206 212 and then the newer agent by 21 mike andriole chief financial and business officer yeah maury it s mike andriole we do as you know continuously evaluate the external landscape for business development opportunities that haven t been said the pipeline continues to grow and in the case of cmx521 growing organically onc206 and 212 are now organic programs that may well require additional investment as well and so we ll continually evaluate the pipeline internal project opportunities and compare them to the external landscape but i would say the barda bring in additional external innovation right now is a little higher than it was say last year or the year before but we do continuously evaluate it maury raycroft jefferies analyst got it ok thanks for taking my questions i ll have back in the queue operator our next question comes from naureen quibria with maxim group naureen quibria maxim group analyst hi good morning congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my question so i guess i also have a question on the barda contract and it s really rather very basic let s say moving forward you already have the contract prices are negotiated what triggers that procurement is that part of the negotiation or how do you know is it automatic i guess that s what i meant when i asked mike sherman president and chief executive officer yeah that s part of the negotiation is essentially a commitment on that first that first shipment quantities so the quantity is this part of the negotiation along with the pricing future shipments are essentially identified we propose a way then to have an implied manufacturing schedule that prepares for those shipments over the course of as we ve always said four to six years and of course our our proposal is within that timeframe those are then subject to barda triggering those those orders as they go and we ve done a lot of research on that you can see other companies who operate in this space and have barda contracts and they re pretty predictably and reliably executed over that timeframe but that the initial shipment is part of the initial agreement so you would know that and essentially that would be committed upfront naureen quibria maxim group analyst ok that s very helpful and then with regards to onc201 filing can you talk about the various components i think you have but that s needed for regulatory filing what else remains apart from the natural history study data mike sherman president and chief executive officer so there are a few workstreams there that have been ongoing really since last year post acquisition they include activities cmc activities and we re also gathering the data to support the what s a broader safety database than just the 50 that comprise the efficacy analysis recall that we ve treated far more patients than the 50 with onc201 and in fact the the central benefit for the drug goes far beyond the very narrow criteria that we re used to select patients that that criteria that was defined by the fda was intended to isolate these single agents response data and that s why that data sets narrow that having been said the safety database it will be much broader to support that submission you mentioned the other element natural disease history which is underway there s quite a bit of alignment among those in the field that this mutation obviously is a challenging one to treat and yet it s relatively new and so the having data to support those that that assumption is going to be helpful and supportive of the application so we re gathering that both for patients that precisely meet the same criteria as in our efficacy analysis as well as even a more broader population which frankly will be helpful as we think about future development of the drug to identify which prognostic factors demographic factors are important in predicting the activity and outcomes in these patients and then the final piece we referenced is it s important to have alignment as you re going into a potential nda review on a confirmatory trial which if we are able to secure an accelerated approval you would want to have a confirmatory trial up and running and so we are collaborating with the fda to ensure we have alignment on that design and that that dialog is underway naureen quibria maxim group analyst well that s actually very helpful i was just going to ask about the complimentary file but you just answered it thank you that s it for me operator our next question comes from ed white with h c wainwright ed white h c wainwright analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions so maybe just to continue on with the onc201 you re going to discuss the with the fda the first line randomized placebo controlled phase 3 trial do you need any of that safety data for this submission i know you re going to be running it concurrently with the submission i m just curious about that and anything you can tell us about what your expectations are for that study perhaps the size of the study length of time to completion etc thank you mike sherman president and chief executive officer yeah i think i can i ll answer that and allen or josh you want to add to it we do not expect that safety data from that trial would be required as part of the the nda submission we have identified the population of patients and number of patients that would be part of that submission in prior discussions with the fda and then particularly given the safety profile we ve seen on this drug we think that will be sufficient aside from describing this as a front line combination with radiation trial and randomize i think it would be prudent to wait to have feedback from the fda on things like endpoints and size which would then determine the timeline to enroll that for a future update josh allen chief technology officer imipridones this is josh i would just add that the safety of onc201 has already been evaluated in this population in the pediatric setting where a similar dose as was used in monotherapy was found to be appropriate for moving forward so there is that cpd that s already leverage from prior experience ed white h c wainwright analyst thanks and then a tembexa question just wanted to get your thoughts on demand outside the u s with the ongoing war in the ukraine just wondering if you were getting any inquiries from outside the u s for other national stockpiles and then how should we be thinking about the manufacturing in the first delivery are you ready at this point you had said you expect the the rpm first delivery in the second quarter how much are you prepared to deliver right now could you deliver the full year worth in the quarter or should we expect to see it be spread out over the last three quarters of the year mike andriole chief financial and business officer mike maybe i ll start with the first part of that question and others can chime in as we get to the second but the international opportunity it is as we have said really all along the case for pandemic preparedness has never been stronger than it is now we ll start that work in canada and explore registration there and potential stockpiling in canada there have been other countermeasures that have successfully been stockpiled in canada as it relates to europe hera the health emergency and response authority is in the process of being organized and capitalized it s essentially the european equivalent of barda in the united states i think that could be a centralized procurement mechanism for europe over the lifecycle of tembexa and yet in the near term it s probably going to be member country specific where there could be opportunity but we re continuing to explore and prioritize those opportunities and the geopolitical uncertainty in eastern europe is certainly a consideration for folks on this topic but we don t see that as probably a 2022 opportunity but likely after that mike sherman president and chief executive officer and the second part of your question we indeed have prepared and are in a position to ship roughly a fifth of that for 1 7 million the question remains as to whether barda how much of that they want to take on right away and the pricing associated with that so that ll be one of the first key search terms that s part of the negotiation ed white h c wainwright analyst ok thanks mike and perhaps just the last question on 521 we saw the impressive data and you reviewed it again i m just curious as to how we should be thinking about the timing for initial studies and when we can see the human data mike sherman president and chief executive officer yeah i may just defer that question perhaps to our next call the data is pretty fresh and there s actually data ongoing i will say that given the prior development that s already been in humans and really attractive safety profile we think that we d be able to move very quickly on that but i think in our in a subsequent call we ll give you a little bit more granularity to that we re looking at all strategic options for how we move that one forward of course ed white h c wainwright analyst ok thanks mike for taking my question operator our next question comes from soumit roy with jonesresearch soumit roy jonesresearch analyst hi everyone thank you for taking the question and congrats on the progress i wanted to ask a little bit if you can elaborate on the natural history study what are you looking at if you can give us the size of the study you re doing you re going to look at progression of the disease after front line second line treatment and when should we expect that data to be available mike andriole chief financial and business officer and maybe i ll have allen can describe the nature of this study in both part a and then part b and we can come back to the timing allen melemed chief medical officer sure thanks this is allen we are looking at in two separate cohorts the first cohort is we re looking at a population that exactly mirrors the data that we have for the onc201 in the registration card so essentially we re looking for a similar number of patients that we saw in the registration cohort and in that analysis again it s a retrospective study we re going to be doing a blinded independent review to see what you would expect for not just response rates but also duration response in a population the most representative of what you d expect to see as an activity with some other age beside onc201 as you can imagine with a small sample size you have less understanding about prognostic variables such as and survival because there are a lot of factors that could be aberrant therefore we re doing a second cohort which is a much larger study which will include more broader populations regardless of their line and lineage to really understand more of overall survival and progression free survival in a population that is not going to be blinded review and we re going to be looking more to see general characteristics of the disease that can help us understand the prognostic and predictive variables better just in this specific population and i ll pass it back to mike presenting questions on the timing mike sherman president and chief executive officer yeah and what s interesting is the fda has really been engaged on all of these programs and eager for data so it may be somewhat contingent on the pace with which they want to see this data as it s generated it s possible even that we assess that that first cohort of patients the one that matched the criteria used for the 50 patient cohort that we evaluate that in two steps so that we can share that with the fda as we go what we ll do is essentially near our public communications of that data as we share with the fda so and expect to be able to give an update on that here and before before the middle of the year soumit roy jonesresearch analyst ok ok so the first tough talk with the fda on the front setting trial will that talk include the conversation about the nda natural history filing or they re going to be two separate meetings mike sherman president and chief executive officer yeah we actually have had conversations with the fda on natural disease history and that s actually ongoing so it will it will touch both soumit roy jonesresearch analyst ok got it and one last question is you mentioned the progress on the mrd negative being a potential endpoint in aml could you elaborate on that do we think that could be a go forward strategy for your aim of frontline aml trial mike sherman president and chief executive officer yeah it s something we ve talked about before when we acquired dstat mrd was not really recognized as well and still isn t recognized formally as an endpoint or endpoint in aml and yet we had seen early data that suggests that its power in terms of predicting both durability of responses event free survival and overall survival and so we incorporated that into our trial design both as an early point assessment as well as had conversations with the fda about using it as a primary endpoint for the overall trial it would ve allow us to essentially run a much smaller trial and faster to endpoints they were not ready to agree to that at the time and so we use alternative endpoints event free survival and overall survival for that trial and yet they left the door open and i think you ve seen at least one other company is using mrd as a primary endpoint in that setting and they ve left the door open that if we re able to provide some additional data in particular from the early cohort of this trial that can support that then then they would be open to that as long as that trial hadn t or the portion of the trial that you use for submission hadn t been unblinded so the reference there is that as that development continues it may be that s always a lever that we can pull to potentially accelerate the timelines both smaller trial size than is currently contemplated as well as a more more rapid time to an endpoint assessment allen melemed chief medical officer and just to just to add in this fda has not approved a drug for a aml based but i think there is becoming a potentially more openness to be looking at complete response rate and other measures again we ll need to continue with this research and really show a clinically meaningful difference to have a conversation with fda soumit roy jonesresearch analyst right really appreciate the color and thanks again for taking the questions thank you operator our next our next question comes from troy langford with cowen troy langford cowen and company analyst hi congrats on the progress and thanks for taking our questions i just have a couple of quick ones on onc201 and then i have a follow up question so first onc201 it looks like you ll need anything of an alignment from the fda on the analysis of the natural history data in comparison with the onc201 registration cohort or do you think you have a pretty good idea of what they want and then how quickly after the completion of the natural history study do you think you could file for approval mike andriole chief financial and business officer yeah that s part of the discussion that will have is exactly what kind of analysis is expected with the small data sets in both cases i think there s some limitations obviously on what you can do with that data and that having been said we would expect to conclude from that data that again responses are rare and if they do occur with current standards of care that they re not not durable as we see with onc201 so part of these ongoing discussions are just clarification for how the fda will be looking at that data and as for the timeline to be able to submit that s the update that will give you here before mid year we ll have these discussions with the fda have been pretty continuous and so we ve got a nice open dialog as we make progress and are able to share data as it comes from the work that we re doing on all of those work streams and so by middle of the year we ll be able to give you a guidance on the timelines for a potential nda submission troy langford cowen and company analyst ok great and then just one quick question on the pipeline has any update on the worker onc206 do you think we still see data from this program possibly this year mike andriole chief financial and business officer maybe i ll let josh give an update on that program josh allen chief technology officer imipridones sure so just as a quick reminder onc206 proceeding through dose escalation currently in two advanced oncology trials really both focused on brain tumors one of the sponsors study conducted at the nih and adult recurrent cns tumors the other is the more recently launched trial in the pediatric brain tumor setting both of those are aimed at efficiently and effectively proceeding up until a maximum tolerated dose in the preceding dose expansion cohorts where experience is to be gained in brain tumors that hold promise for this drug based on the clinical studies due to the nature of both of those the timelines and outcomes of the study are really dependent on the clinical data that emerges as they come so at this point we expect those studies to continue dose escalation i think we ve guided in the past that we expect that to play out throughout the course of the year and once we get to the end of that we ll be able to share that data but in the meantime you can just assume that we re continuing along in dose escalation as would be expected troy langford cowen and company analyst ok great thanks allen melemed chief medical officer troy that surveillance we re also continuing to that onc212 which is we ve had given guidance on that but we re not just stopping on just one troy langford cowen and company analyst ok that s really helpful thanks a lot for all the color operator that concludes today s question and answer session i d like to turn the call back to mike sherman for closing remarks mike sherman president and chief executive officer great thanks again everyone for your time this morning look forward to continue to

in all 31 member countries agreeing to release 60 million barrels of oil from their strategic reserves russia s invasion of ukraine has also put more pressure on agricultural commodity prices which were also already getting pushed higher with rising inflation wheat and corn prices rose more than 5 per bushel and are already up more than 20 so far this year ukraine is a key exporter of both crops a whole confluence of factors are impacting markets said bill northey senior investment director at u s bank wealth management we see that manifesting not only in stock markets right now which

detroit michigan based fleet cost care is pleased to share their new blog post on six strategies for effective fleet inventory management since the company was founded in 1993 fleet cost care has been serving the heavy equipment industry across the globe north america australia new zealand africa the middle east and the caribbean jeff curran from fleet cost care says in the crane and rigging industry ensuring that you are staying on top of inventory management can sometimes feel like a headache without a reliable and organized system keeping track of the thousands of parts you are purchasing from a hundred different manufacturers is just impossible if somehow you are managing it will inevitably lead to unaccounted assets that will ultimately cut into your bottom line while fleet management platforms can be used to manage your parts inventory organization real time visibility of parts on hand and more there is a lot that you can do to improve inventory management for fleets of all sizes in the blog post the first tip the company shares is to decide on a physical organizational structure fleet cost care says that logical and intuitive frameworks are best one way to do so is to start with major manufacturers like grove manitowoc liebherr and so on and then categorize them into sub groups such as electrical hydraulic pneumatic hardware and more the company also recommends having an established alpha numeric order for all parts with clearly labeled bins to ensure that parts are received properly it can also help to have a company wide entry procedure for parts following the recommended procedure by the fleet management system will ensure that there is uniformity with all of the parts records on top of that part number description manufacturer unit of measure uom part type vendor quantity on hand and barcode information should always be entered to avoid confusion regarding details of a specific part the third strategy is to determine valid reorder points as this can help manage quantities on hand while reducing cost establishing minimum and maximum barriers to the parts records of routinely used items can help avoid overstocking or having essentials run out on top of this everyone should also ensure that they are tracking quantity on hand through management software and automated processes when possible the blog post also shares that companies should be tracking all expenditures through a fleet management software system purchases should be justified in a particular order and organizations should develop usage information unique to their fleet and their particular needs to aid in reducing their service department s operating costs the fifth strategy shared by fleet cost care is to closely monitor consumables ensuring that there is enough stock on hand for items like grease aerosols cleaners safety materials and so on that are used across multiple units and service activities is very important this means that it is important to manage these items efficiently staff should be aware that all items no matter their price or size should be carefully monitored and accounted for finally fleet cost care says that it is important to encourage procedural refinement and new ideas maintaining a healthy dialogue between management and staff to determine what practices are working and what are not as well as ways to improve organization can contribute a lot to the long term success of a company it can also help to evaluate costs by researching new vendors or inquiring about further discounts and determine the true necessity of items and quantities being ordered curran says while inventory management is difficult the truth is that it doesn t have to be having a good fleet management software and expert consultants can serve you greatly if you are interested in learning more about how you can manage your company s inventory more efficiently feel free to get in touch with our team today and we would be glad to help those who want to learn more about fleet cost care and the various services they provide or have been looking for reliable fleet management software can find more information on the company s website additionally the company encourages interested parties to get in touch with jeff curran directly via email or phone in addition to their website fleet cost care can be reached through their various social media platforms for more information about fleet cost care contact the company here fleet cost care jeff curran 800 281 9445 marketing fleetcostcare com 865 s fort st detroit mi 48217
hindenburg research the firm that outed nikola for overselling its technology in last year s scathing report has selected a new target the company in its crosshairs this time around is lordstown motors while the investment research firm stopped short of saying the ohio based manufacturer committed fraud it came extremely close on friday hindenburg alleged that lordstown is stringing investors along will be unable to adhere to its existing production targets and fabricated sales to make the business appear more appetizing lordstown is an electric vehicle with no revenue and no sellable product which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities reads the report the company has consistently pointed to its book of 100 000 pre orders as proof of deep demand for its proposed ev truck our conversations with former employees business partners and an extensive document review show that the company s orders are largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy that s just the opening statement hindenburg s report goes on to list numerous issues former lordstown employees apparently told the research firm that claims about in house battery production were bogus with the equipment necessary for the task still undelivered this also means the company hadn t tested anything meaning vehicles that are supposed to start assembly in september haven t been certified by the nhtsa as compliant with federal motor vehicle safety standards but that s just a production delay something manufacturers run into all the time the fact that the company is having to rejigger designs and wait on tooling isn t a bombshell announcement in itself we also hate to say this but special purpose acquisition companies spacs always seem to overpromise so the stock can be puffed up with no commercial operations these blank check firms really only exist to help raise capital through an initial public offering despite being inherently shady it s not technically illegal and hardly new hindenburg has not made it a secret that it loathes spacs and seems to lavish every opportunity to turn a profit off their demise but it also knows that it needs more if it s to make lordstown which went public in october 2020 look bad which is really what this is all about fortunately it seems to have found something while examining the company s claimed 100 000 pre orders from hindenburg research our research has revealed that lordstown s order book consists of fake or entirely non binding orders from customers that generally do not even have fleets of vehicles according to former employees and business partners ceo steve burns sought to book orders regardless of quality purely as a tool to raise capital and confer legitimacy in addition we show how in desperation to claim there was demand for the proposed vehicle he paid for customers to book valueless non binding pre orders we detail conversations with lordstown customers who were eager to explain that the letters of intent loi s with the company were promotional others assured us they were not committed to anything and that the pre order commitment size recorded by lordstown was totally impossible one ceo at a key customer told us our outreach was the first he had heard of any arrangement with lordstown we also show for the first time the actual lordstown pre order agreements which we received from former business partners while the agreements entail zero commitment on the part of the buyer they include clauses about the parties agreeing to work on press releases to announce the deals assuming the claims are accurate that s fairly damning but there are also suggestions that the endurance prototypes are undergoing massive changes numerous employees apparently told the research firm that the model is probably 3 4 years away from production and would never be manufactured by the fall of 2021 the report also goes into great detail to assassinate the character of ceo steve burns by listening to unfavorable characterizations made by his peers and some light speculation as to why he was ousted from workhorse that s less interesting to us than accusations that the company essentially fabricated orders and is actually years away from production and far less pertinent in deciding how badly lordstown motors has ventured into unsavory territory but it adds some flavor to the stew hindenburg is cooking in the hope that it can do some real damage to the share price so it can short the stock and maybe open a few eyes on how spac backed tech firms with no product operate it also appears to be working lordstown shares fell by 20 percent friday morning the full report is extensive and has some incredibly damning evidence in relation to the pre orders there s actually so much that your author has only been able to get through about half of the accompanying documentation that verifies hindenburg s claims while all seem credible the most unsettling was the litigation records that showed burns paying consultants for every truck pre order as early as 2016 while he was still ceo at workhorse considering some of lordstown s largest buyers turned out to be small operations run out of apartments with no history of fleet management it makes you wonder how much of that was going on lordstown has yet to comment on the issue and will likely take a couple of days to prepare a response

americans are reportedly now facing an even higher risk of russian cyberattacks amid russia s invasion of ukraine according to experts we are seeing more and more nation state activity due to the conflict in the ukraine said ryan wright a professor specializing in cybersecurity at the university of virginia via usa today with us sanctions setting in it is only a matter of time until the us is targeted more directly this may mean attacks on your personal device through ransomware but also attacks on the infrastructure such as your internet access or even the power grid state sponsored actors have participated in sophisticated cyberwarfare through solarwinds and colonial pipeline attacks over the past few years russia may once again attempt similar tactics to disrupt american financial systems and important infrastructure in an effort to pressure the u s to abandon sanctions saryu nayyar ceo of security firm gurucul told usa today nayyar said it s unlikely that cyber attackers would target americans individually but noted that the reality is that any cyberattack can have repercussions on individuals which kevin novak managing director of security firm breakwater solutions told usa today includes a wide range of problems such as supply shortages at grocery stores caused by power outages so while at the moment i do not believe that private us citizens should cower in fear over russia s capability of adversely impacting them via cyberattacks it is reasonable to expect that their lives will be impacted in some ways by cyber retaliatory actions that result from us sanctions and other political maneuvering novak said via usa today chris olson ceo of the digital safety platform the media trust warned that consumers must be aware that cyber actors can target them through almost any website or mobile application amid the growing threat of cyberattacks doug jacobson a professor of electrical and computer engineering at iowa state university advised americans to protect themselves by practicing cyber hygiene the cybersecurity infrastructure security agency cisa shields up campaign and several cybersecurity experts provided the following

strong new evidence on the need to use an appropriately sized cuff in blood pressure bp measurement has come from the cross sectional randomized trial cuff sz the study found that in people in whom a small adult cuff was appropriate systolic bp readings were on average 3 6 mm hg lower when a regular adult size cuff was used however systolic readings were on average 4 8 mm hg higher when a regular cuff was used in people who required a large adult cuff and 19 5 mm hg higher in those needing an extra large cuff based on their mid arm circumference the diastolic readings followed a similar pattern 1 3 mm hg 1 8 mm hg 7 4 mm hg respectively we found that using the regular adult cuff in all individuals had striking differences in blood pressure lead author tammy m brady md phd johns hopkins university school of medicine baltimore maryland told theheart org medscape cardiology and that has a lot of clinical implications dr tammy m brady she noted for example that people who required an extra large cuff and were measured with a regular cuff had an average bp of 144 86 7 mm hg which is in the stage 2 hypertension range but when the correct size cuff was used the average bp was 124 5 79 3 mm hg or in the prehypertensive range overall the overestimation of bp due to using too small a cuff misclassified 39 of people as being hypertensive while the underestimation of bp due to using a cuff that was too large missed 22 of people with hypertension so i think clinicians really need to have a renewed emphasis on cuff size especially in populations where obesity is highly prevalent and many of their patients require extra large cuffs because those are the populations that are most impacted by mis cuffing brady said the findings were presented in an e poster today at the epidemiology and prevention lifestyle cardiometabolic health epi lifestyle 2022 conference sponsored by the american heart association aha willie lawrence md chair of the aha s national hypertension control initiative advisory committee said in an interview that the magnitude of inaccuracy observed by the researchers makes this a very very important study is it the first of its kind no but it s incredibly important because it was so well done and it comes at a time when people are once again dealing with issues around equity and this study can have a significant impact on the state of hypertension in diverse communities said lawrence a cardiologist with spectrum health lakeland in benton harbor michigan previous studies examining the issue were older had few participants and used mercury sphygmomanometers instead of automated devices which are typically recommended by professional societies for screening hypertension in adults brady explained for the cuff size blood pressure measurement trial 195 adults recruited from the community underwent 2 to 3 sets of 3 bp readings 30 seconds apart with an automated and validated device welch allyn prob 2000 using a bp cuff that was appropriated sized one size lower and one size higher the order of cuff sizes was randomized before each set patients walked for 2 minutes followed by 5 minutes of rest to eliminate the potential effect of longer resting periods between tests on the results the room was also kept quiet and participants were asked not to speak or use a smart phone participants had a mean age of 54 years 34 were male 68 were black and 36 had a body mass index of at least 30 kg m2 meeting the criteria for obesity roughly one half had a self reported hypertension diagnosis 31 had a systolic bp of 130 mm hg or greater and 26 had a diastolic bp of 80 mm hg or greater based on arm circumference mean 34 cm the appropriate adult cuff size was small 20 25 cm in 18 regular 25 1 32 cm in 28 large 32 1 40 cm in 34 and extra large 40 1 55 cm in 21 brady pointed out that the most recent hypertension guidelines detail sources of inaccuracy in bp measurement and say that if too small a cuff size is used the blood pressure could be different by 2 to 11 mm hg and what we show is it can be anywhere from 5 to 20 mm hg so i think that s a significant difference from what studies have shown so far and is going to be very surprising to clinicians a 2019 aha scientific statement on the measurement of blood pressure stresses the importance of cuff size and last year the american medical association launched a new initiative to standardize training in bp measurement for future physicians and healthcare professionals previous work also showed that children as young as 3 to 5 years of age often require an adult cuff size and those in the 12 to 15 year age group may need an extra large cuff or what is often referred to as a thigh cuff said brady who is also the medical director of the pediatric hypertension program at johns hopkins children s center part of the problem is that many physicians aren t often the one doing the measurement and that others may not be as in tune with some of these data and initiatives she said other barriers are cost and availability offices and clinics don t routinely stock multiple cuff sizes in exam rooms and devices sold over the counter typically come with a regular adult cuff brady said an extra cuff could add 25 to 50 on top of the 25 to 50 for the device for the growing number of patients measuring bp remotely during the pandemic i was trying to do telemedicine with my hypertensive patients but the children who had significant obesity couldn t afford or find blood pressure devices that had a cuff that was big enough for them she said it just wasn t something that they could get so i think people just don t recognize how important this is epi lifestyle 2022 abstract presented march 1 2022 the study was funded by resolve to save lives which is funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation and gates philanthropy brady and lawrence report having no relevant financial relationships follow patrice wendling on twitter

beginning feb 21 2022 the u s government began to issue sanctions on russian officials in its continued response to the russian invasion of ukraine in its latest round of designations the u s department of treasury office of foreign assets control ofac designated president vladimir putin along with several members of his cabinet and inner circle these latest sanctions packages and other measures come on the heels of multiple prior waves of u s sanctions announced over the past week in addition to these sanctions the united states and other allies agreed to cut off russia from swift banking communication system the move is part of escalating coordinated efforts by the united states and european countries to target the russian financial sector which include sanctions from the united kingdom european union and switzerland third wave of sanctions on feb 25 2022 ofac added the president of the russian federation vladimir putin to the specially designated nationals sdn list in addition to president putin ofac designated russia s minister of foreign affairs sergei viktorovich lavrov russia s minister of defense sergei shoigu and chief of the general staff of the russian armed forces and first deputy minister of defense general valery gerasimov as sdns these measures follow an initial sanctions package announced feb 22 2022 which was targeted at the so called donetsk people s republic and the luhansk people s republic collectively the covered regions the sanctions relating to nord stream 2 were issued feb 23 2022 and the banking sanctions and export controls were announced feb 24 2022 as a result of the sanctions measures u s persons will effectively be prohibited from all dealings with president putin and the other designated russian officials direct or indirect all property and assets of president putin as well as the other designated russian officials that are located in the united states or in u s persons possession or control are now deemed frozen and must be disclosed to ofac further any entity that is owned directly or indirectly 50 or more by any restricted person is also prohibited the designation of putin and lavrov is seen as largely symbolic as putin and lavrov do not maintain significant assets in the united states and from a compliance standpoint there are significant challenges determining whether putin and lavrov are ultimate beneficial owners in entities comprised of opaque shell companies and other vehicles for obfuscating ultimate beneficial ownership around the world all transactions by u s persons or within or transiting the united states that pertain to any property or any property interests of a restricted person are prohibited unless authorized by a general license or specific license granted by ofac lastly u s persons are prohibited from receiving or contributing assets goods products or services for the benefit of restricted persons additional ofac measures announced on feb 28 2022 ofac issued russia related directive 4 under executive order 14024 russia related general license 8a a final rule and designated additional russian individuals and entities to the sdn list in addition to these

interbank financial telecommunication more commonly referred to as swift the swift system is overseen by g 10 central banks contains more than 200 countries and has the participation of roughly 11 000 banks globally russia heavily relies on the swift system primarily for its gas and oil exports in a historically significant move given its typically neutral position switzerland elected to adopt the eu sanctions against russia feb 28 2022 these sanctions include but are not limited to financial sanctions and the freezing of assets of president vladimir putin prime minister mikhail mishustin and foreign minister sergey lavrov freezing of assets of specific russian entities and closing its air space to all flights from russia with exception of flights concerning medical humanitarian or diplomatic purposes key takeaways ofac s latest round of designations limits u s persons from transacting with president putin and certain russian officials and financial entities resulting in ongoing complexity and uncertainty for u s companies with operations in or involving russia more broadly the removal of russia s central bank from swift severely limits russia s access to nearly every major global financial market making investments and transactions increasingly difficult more expensive and less secure the international response to the russia ukraine conflict has resulted in a rapidly changing sanctions landscape and companies and organizations should continue to closely monitor communications guidance from the u s department of commerce s bureau of industry and security ofac and the white house as well as from non u s governments and international organizations the latest u s measures and sanctioning of president putin are part of a multilateral sanctions response that includes measures already announced or currently considered by the uk eu switzerland canada australia japan and others given the overlapping but distinct sanctions regimes at play companies and organizations with dealings in the region should carefully consider the sanctions measures of all applicable jurisdictions

costs of using cryptocurrency could be drastically reduced by combining the digital coins with carbon offsets a new study suggested step one bitcoin and thousands of other digital currencies such as ethereum and monero are generated and verified by decentralized global networks of computers solving math problems of increasing complexity but crypto mining requires massive amounts of computing energy producing staggering environmental impacts singapore s centre for nature based climate solutions said in the study released tuesday bigger than beijing studies suggest that the total carbon from the bitcoin network alone could potentially surpass the total carbon footprint of some of the most populous cities in the world including beijing sao paulo and new delhi wrote author aakash lamba of the national university of singapore bans spread the emissions wider concerns over the power requirements and climate impacts of bitcoin mining were both partial factors in the chinese government s decision to ban the practice last fall as we reported last august ironically by pushing mining into jurisdictions with less renewable energy that displacement is leading to a greater environmental impact from cryptocurrency a recent study suggested here to stay with 2 trillion in stored value cryptocurrencies are likely here to stay meaning that we need solutions for them now lamba wrote cryptocurrencies also have the potential to evade the oversight and sanctions of central banks as has been seen in russia since the cut off of swift cnbc reported like renewables partly there have been calls to reduce these impacts by powering coin mining with renewable energy or by switching to less energy intensive methods of computation like the newer proof of stake algorithm which requires less than 1 percent of bitcoin s slower but more secure proof of work standard according to lamba s study but those solutions alone aren t enough while new cryptocurrencies can use different algorithms and privately held cryptocurrency networks can move toward using renewable power such shifts are very challenging for established distributed networks like bitcoin and ethereum in these networks mining is spread across a wide variety of jurisdictions unbound by any shared regulatory authority that can get them to switch to renewable energy lamba wrote carbon credits offer another option such proposed changes to algorithms and energy sources would work well in tandem with carbon credits which can be as decentralized as the cryptocurrencies themselves lamba wrote what are carbon credits like cryptocurrencies carbon credits are a new form of financial tool in this case designed to help companies counter their carbon emissions one credit is generated for every ton of carbon dioxide pulled out of the air or kept from being released into it by industrial forestry or ocean projects then these credits can be sold on voluntary or mandatory carbon markets as we explained in november there are accounting problems particularly with double counting which both seller and buyer of carbon credits both count the emission reduction toward their climate targets which may lead to net increase in emissions lamba wrote but despite these pitfalls he added a solution must be found because with bitcoin isn t going away any time soon given the immense wealth locked away in the network last words there is a long way to go in making bitcoins truly green lamba wrote but investors may be willing to pay a premium to offset this environmental damage he added be in the know we ve got you covered morning noon and night sign up now for the hill s new evening report taking the wheel for green change for former stock car racer leilani münter plastering her cars with graphics trumpeting the virtues of veganism and warning of the threat of mass extinction made them the ultimate vehicles for influencing public policy on the ground first words that race car was what allowed me to talk about these issues that i cared about with the environment and animal rights to a group of people a demographic of people that weren t really hearing that message she told equilibrium münter 48 sat down with equilibrium to discuss her parallel professions of racer and activist and what propels her forward today a completely different road after earning a degree in biology from the university of california san diego münter worked as a stunt double for catherine zeta jones she saved enough money to fulfill a bucket list goal of enrolling in racing school which she said took her down a completely different road from biology her first race was in 2001 in southern california where she finished fourth according to her website bio in the 18 years before she retired in 2019 she has participated in various nascar arca indy pro races and others what sparked her activism while she always tried to incorporate sustainable practices into her life münter said the 2006 film an inconvenient truth struck a chord with both her and her now husband it was no longer enough to just talk about the environment and nice things that we cared about just to family and friends münter said i needed to somehow try and use my place as a driver to address them how does she reconcile driving with sustainability münter said she pledged to adopt an acre of rainforest every time she sat in her car carbon offsetting she explained was the only way she could address the fossil fuels she was burning while racing i ended up adopting over 1 500 acres of rainforest over my career münter said adding that most recently she did so through the rainforest trust her fuel usage about 30 gallons per race across 61 lifetime races was small in comparison to what she would have been using in her daily life had she been driving a gasoline based car at home münter said she has driven the same tesla which recently hit 100 000 miles since 2013 an environmental billboard throughout her racing career münter said she prioritized sponsorships from environmental companies and groups she also ran ads through crowdfunding for the 2009 oscar winning film the cove and the 2013 film blackfish and at one point she had a vegan themed car from which she distributed vegan cheeseburgers and chicken nuggets to fans it was really my vehicle to reach people münter said once i retired i lost that i lost that billboard an ongoing green legacy not just behind the wheel münter s deep rooted environmental activism continues today even though she s no longer behind the wheel münter first became an ambassador for the national wildlife federation in 2008 advocating for clean energy legislation on capitol hill she began working in 2012 with the oceanic preservation society on their film racing extinction which explores mankind s contribution to mass extinction some of her current work includes advocating for electric cars in her home state of north carolina as well as fighting against efforts to reduce solar rooftop subsidies in other states an issue we reported on earlier this month münter also powers her house with solar panels recycles rainwater and composts organic waste the population problem concerned that the world s population growth is unsustainable münter and her husband have also decided to not have children while emissions reducing behaviors do help she expressed doubt that these efforts would be sufficient to combat the overall driving force behind species extinction all those things are increased when we continue to increase our numbers münter said last words looking back at her choices münter said she feels like racing helped her become a more effective activist than she ever could have been as a scientist you can t expect a nascar fan to show up at an environmental level film festival she added but if i put the environmental film on the hood of my race car then they might be inclined to watch the film to read our full interview with münter

driven mechanism that can cultivate water spinach by drawing water from the air while generating electricity publishing their findings in cell reports physical science on tuesday the scientists placed a solar photovoltaic panel on a top of layer of hydrogel a gel like polymer that attracts and absorbs water then they mounted the system on a large metal box to condense and collect water which they used to irrigate water spinach seeds according to the study new screening system could help make hydrogen fuel production more efficient penn state university scientists have developed a highly sensitive system for detecting hydrogen production which they said could help position hydrogen as an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels their findings published in the review of scientific instruments showed that their tool could screen promising photocatalysis materials that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gases when placed in water and exposed to sunlight and

alexis harrison of fairfield center handed out flyers to promote ct 169 strong after a hands off our zoning rally held in 2021 harrison was elected to the town plan and zoning commission last year christian abraham hearst connecticut media karen dubois walton president of elm city communities the housing authority of new haven peter hvizdak hearst connecticut media state sen saud anwar d south windsor in a file photo dan haar hearst ct media the campaign over the state s need for affordable housing and the power of mostly white suburban enclaves in one of the country s most segregated states was renewed in the general assembly on tuesday when lawmakers heard public testimony on a variety of bills including legislation that would allow housing authorities to purchase properties in adjacent towns during an afternoon long virtual hearing of the legislative housing committee property owners and managers said that state regulations are hurting them and costing them money while tenants warned that they are becoming victims at a time when landlords can force out those who pay lower rents because the owners can bring in new tenants who ll pay sharply higher amounts and in reviving last year s battle over persuading suburbs to site more affordable dwellings alexis harrison of fairfield who won election last year to the fairfield town plan and zoning commission warned lawmakers to leave alone towns that want to maintain their local character advertisement article continues below this ad our zoning commission has been very committed to creating affordable housing and has consistently worked to encourage more diversity of housing stock said harrison who as a member of the group ct169 strong successfully defeated legislative attempts last year to force towns to build more dense affordable housing units basically we want to avoid using a blunt instrument in order to achieve a laudable goal harrison said helping seniors the disadvantaged and the disabled state residents is a very good thing but unduly burdening landlords could result in decreased rental stock which would diminish the goal providing a diverse housing stock to all harrison spoke against legislation that would force towns of more than 14 000 residents to create fair rent commissions generally rent control in cities has not been successful at providing lower rents to the broader community harrison said during the virtual hearing advertisement article continues below this ad on the expansion of housing authorities to develop affordable dwellings outside their local boundaries harrison said this would further erode the local control of each zoning commission in making permanent decisions in the best interests of individual towns it would end up both regionalizing and politicizing what is inherently a local job making permanent decisions in governing the land use within each municipality but karen dubois walton president of the elm city communities the housing authority of new haven said that allowing agencies like hers to purchase and develop affordable properties in neighboring towns would be an important way to allow more people to live in high quality affordable and market rate dwellings housing authorities as originally contemplated were not in the business of development and the laws on the books currently in connecticut reflect the original housing authorities not necessarily the housing authorities of today dubois walton said out of necessity we have moved away from your old style public housing into becoming much more developers of mixed income mixed finance type of communities she said current laws limit housing authorities to work only within the borders of their municipalities at the same time we all know and this committee has been really great at looking at the issues of the lack of affordable housing in our community and trying to find pathways to expand that she said i believe this bill is a no nonsense easy opportunity to add another tool to our box about how we can create affordable housing advertisement article continues below this ad kathy flaherty executive director of the connecticut legal rights project a non profit agency that offers representation to low income adults with serious mental health conditions said in submitted testimony that while state law allows for towns and cities to create fair rent commissions only 25 municipalities have them we have observed significant rent increases that has made finding new housing extraordinarily difficult for tenants who need to relocate even tenants who are fortunate enough to have a rental subsidy many landlords are asking for rents above the fair market rents set by hud or the department of housing flaherty wrote increasing the number of fair rent commissions around the state would enable more tenants in more towns to have a way to challenge unfair rent increases the committee deadline is march 17 state sen rick lopes d new britain co chairman said the goal this session is to assure housing stability advertisement article continues below this ad a person s ability to work go to school or provide for their loved ones is all at risk if they are facing the possibility of losing their home or are unable to find long term housing lopes said in a statement before the hearing we have a chance to take a bold step forward in addressing housing loss and homelessness which impacts cities and towns across connecticut even more we can affirm that every person should be afforded the security and stability that comes from having a home state sen saud anwar d south windsor vice chairman of the committee said combating homelessness in particular is a laudable goal for the panel i have championed this cause for years because i know it will have a transformative effect on how we experience and consider housing in connecticut and beyond anwar a physician said in a joint statement with lopes homelessness is not a personal issue but a societal one and we must respond to it the same way we respond to other crises with a targeted and thorough response

to accept a declarations page of a policy in lieu of the entire policy but in doing so does not waive the right to later receive any other information required under the statute the law also provides the new obligations apply to any defendant third party defendant or defendant on a cross claim or counter claim these requirements do not apply to no fault claims the disclosure required is not an admission that the alleged damages or injuries are covered by the disclosed policy ies the new statute requires that the defendant must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the information remains accurate and complete by providing updated information at the filing of the note of issue when entering into formal settlement negotiations conducted or supervised by the court at a voluntary mediation and when the case is called for trial the above ongoing obligations exist during the entire pendency of the litigation and for 60 days after any settlement or entry of final judgment

defendant and one from the defendant s attorney in the form of an affirmation which policy ies should be identified cida as amended requires disclosure of any and all policies that may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment that may be entered italics added as it stands the term may is arguably up for interpretation some may read may to require disclosure of each and every policy of insurance in place and available to the insured client including all excess and umbrella policies regardless of the nature of the underlying case and its perceived value others could read may to allow for disclosure of only those policies reasonably at risk given a reasonable estimation of the case s value there is of course no case law regulations or learned commentary about the scope and breadth of the new disclosure rules and their requirements practitioners have only the statute to guide them ultimately the decision of what policy or policies to disclose should be a collaborative effort among defense counsel the client insured the claims handler or third party administrator and the insurer insurer obligations notably cida as amended does not specifically require anything of an insurer it is directed to the named party and its counsel nonetheless claims examiners will need to be informed of the efforts that must be taken the impact on budgeting and anticipated increase in utbms l310 expense and where they will be asked if not required by their insureds to assist such as a defense counsel will request of the claims professional everything listed in 3101 f including i insured points of contact beyond substantive witnesses ii efforts to identify and secure points of contact for the entire tower of insurance coverage which primary level claims professionals and tpas typically may not have at their fingertips iii efforts to secure copies of the policies throughout the entire tower of coverage iv details as to total limits and available limits and any erosion of the aggregate limits as identified in 3101 f and iv the measures in place to provide updates as to available limits as identified in 3101 f b insureds will look to claims examiners to assist them in gathering compiling and tracking the insured and defense counsel may need to specify their reliance on the input received from claims examiners the rules require an affidavit from the defendant party not a claims examiner and affirmation from the defense counsel so anyone that seeks an affidavit of the claims examiner is not in and of itself going to comply with the rule still that doesn t mean an insured or defense counsel will not seek one as part of their respective efforts to swear to the extent exhaustion and accuracy of their effort and disclosure as part of their affidavit affirmation insureds and third party claim defense counsel are not positioned to factually opine on all of the disclosure requirements c anticipate an influx of direct communications from plaintiffs attorneys since the claims examiners names and contact information are part of the required disclosure
russia s invasion of ukraine sent shockwaves around the world the attack drew condemnation from many world leaders and many governments quickly introduced sanctions against russia and sent aid to ukraine cryptocurrency and global equity markets initially tumbled on news of the invasion however crypto prices have since rebounded bitcoin btc fell to below 35 000 when russian forces entered ukraine but has since risen briefly above 44 000 up about 25 many have questioned what role cryptocurrency will play in this emerging conflict in particular they want to know if it could help russia get around strict economic sanctions is crypto a conflict currency reuters recently labeled crypto conflict currency in part because of the dramatic increases in crypto trading in both ukraine and russia in recent days it points out that cryptocurrency could see broader adoption as a safe haven asset in times of geopolitical turmoil cryptocurrency has been used by refugees as a way to move money for several years it can be difficult for migrants and refugees to transfer assets carrying large amounts of cash is risky and bank accounts may get frozen or be difficult to access from a new country some opt instead to put money into crypto and convert it into a fiat currency further down the line as a result crypto could be of some help to the half million ukrainians already seeking refuge in neighboring countries digital assets have also been used to raise funds and send aid to ukraine the crypto community has so far donated over 22 million in crypto to support the ukrainian government mind you there s no real reason the fund raising had to be done in crypto rather than normal money but it s a double edged sword pro russian groups can also use cryptocurrency to raise money and the sanctions mean they might otherwise struggle to receive fiat donations which brings us to the biggest issue the degree to which cryptocurrency could help russian organizations evade sanctions the sanctions imposed by the united states european union united kingdom and other countries are some of the harshest ever amongst other things they target russia s central bank and attempt to stop it from cushioning the country against the economic impact according to the economist that means some or even much of russia s national war chest can be frozen our top crypto play isn t a token here s why we ve found one company that s positioned itself perfectly as a long term picks and shovels solution for the broader crypto market bitcoin dogecoin and all the others in fact you ve probably used this company s technology in the past few days even if you ve never had an account or even heard of the company before that s how prevalent it s become sign up today for stock advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long term investment learn more and get started today with a special new member discount get started can russia use crypto to evade sanctions the wide reaching sanctions seek to block transactions with russian banks stopping them from using various international systems to process payments the moves also block trade with various sectors of the russian economy and impose controls such as freezing assets on specific individuals and businesses one of the big ideas behind bitcoin is that it doesn t need the backing of a central bank or government it s a decentralized currency that cuts out the middleman there are many ideological benefits to this but the downside of an asset that operates outside the financial system is that it s hard to control crypto may help certain russians mitigate the impact of sanctions in certain situations but it probably won t be as simple or as widespread as some headlines suggest because crypto transactions can be traced they are stored on a public blockchain and it is possible to identify specific sanctioned wallet addresses to some degree the crypto industry could implement the same economic sanctions just as it s been able to freeze wallets containing stolen funds another reason it will be difficult to evade sanctions through crypto is that many crypto exchanges have know your customer kyc and anti money laundering systems in place at some point russia will need to move its crypto into a fiat currency which it is unlikely to be able to do in large quantities without triggering alarm bells according to bloomberg the white house has already asked crypto exchanges to restrict accounts owned by sanctioned individuals on the other side russia will be able to continue mining bitcoin a large number of ransomware attacks last year originated in russia and one cybercrime group has already pledged to support the russian government in the current conflict we can assume that cryptocurrency will generate income that s not subject to sanctions it remains to be seen how much this is and how much it will dent the impact of sanctions what this means for investors the situation with russia highlights a murky aspect of the crypto world that some investors would probably prefer to ignore blockchain technology has the potential to transform whole industries but it also gets used for less salubrious causes one way to avoid the risk of handling illicit cash is to only use cryptocurrency exchanges with strong kyc requirements it isn t perfect but exchanges that verify people s identities and monitor transactions for illegal activity are less likely to be used by criminals investors would also do well to expect increased regulation sooner rather than later authorities were already concerned about the potential for digital assets to undermine economic sanctions but have not yet taken steps to address this problem the president of the european central bank says this regulation is now critically important several analysts believe the recent rise in crypto prices is due to speculation that russia might use crypto to bypass sanctions if this is the case crypto investors should be prepared for prices to drop again when it becomes clear that the reality isn t quite that simple
john kennedy capital bureau usa today network florida tallahassee gov ron desantis got what he wanted from the house redistricting committee friday which advanced congressional boundaries that eliminate a jacksonville to tallahassee district held by black democratic u s rep al lawson fellow republicans on the panel bowed to the governor s veiled threat that he d veto any map that kept the wide ranging 45 black north florida district in place instead the committee confined lawson s congressional district 5 to jacksonville s duval county and in doing so reduced the redrawn district s black voting population by 10 voters in democratic heavy tallahassee and leon county would be shifted fully into a redrawn republican leaning district held by u s rep neal dunn r panama city but chair tom leek r ormond beach acknowledged the risk that reducing cd 5 s black population could be rejected as a violation of state and federal law ultimately a court is going to have to decide that in a statement later friday lawson said he was disappointed that house leadership caved to the demands of ron desantis to push a partisan unconstitutional congressional map desantis demand hinting veto desantis pressures lawmakers to reduce black held congressional districts minority districts threatened democrats stand with al lawson in feud with desantis over wickedness in redistricting senate broke with desantis florida senate breaks with gov ron desantis on congressional redistricting map court won t give advice justices refuse to give desantis redistricting guidance he wants on district now held by black congressman two maps not one in an unusual move the panel wound up approving two maps a primary plan that confines lawson s seat in duval and a secondary proposal that would keep the general boundaries of the jacksonville to tallahassee district in place since 2015 the two map package s goal leek said is to have a back up plan in place if a state or federal court was to rule against the primary map on grounds that eliminating the jacksonville to tallahassee diminishes the ability of black voters in the region to elect a candidate of their choice diminishment is a legal conclusion leek said but he said that in his view reducing cd 5 s black voting population from 45 to 35 would not hamper minority voters ability to elect a preferred candidate a court though might not agree he suggested it is a serious legal question that we don t know the answer to the question leek said defending the two map approach we put forth a primary map and if that primary map is found to be unconstitutional then the secondary map kicks in but lawson was emphatic that never in our state s history has the florida legislature submitted two maps for review one that is clearly unconstitutional and a second in case we get caught map the proposed congressional district 5 divides minority communities of interest across north florida leaving all black voters west of jacksonville unrepresented he added in his statement following the civil war newly freed african americans remained in what is now the i 10 corridor where many of their descendants continue to reside and the desantis map den ies these communities of interest a voice in congress lawmakers wary of court clash florida lawmakers look to avoid running afoul of courts when redrawing districts meaningless probably still under questioning from rep fentrice driskell d tampa leek conceded that providing the back up plan would not guarantee that a court would endorse it even after throwing out the primary plan rep joe geller d aventura called the two map approach flawed and mocked the idea here s a new law and if it turns out that s unconstitutional then we re going to have another law he said what if we did that with every law he urged ruling republicans to make a choice as to what you think is constitutional but rep tyler sirois r merritt island who chaired the congressional redistricting subcommittee that just a week ago approved what now has been reduced to the secondary map praised the one two tactic this amendment is making the best decision we can with the information in front of us and the timetable going forward sirois said what s ahead the package will now go to the full house for approval the senate has already approved a congressional map that retains the jacksonville to tallahassee cd 5 shape along with largely maintaining the state s current political balance in congress the senate map creates 16 districts likely to elect republicans and 12 where democrats would be favored based on past voting performance florida s congressional delegation currently is divided 16 11 with republicans holding the edge the state is adding a congressional district this year because of population growth revealed in the 2020 census which prompts the once a decade redraw of house senate and congressional seats both house congressional plans approved friday expand republican dominance to 18 seats the gop could be expected to win with republicans pushing hard to regain control of congress during this year s midterm elections a potential pickup of more seats from florida could prove decisive lawmakers are struggling to finalize a congressional plan before the scheduled march 11 close of the 2022 legislative session the state house and senate plans have been approved by lawmakers and sent to the state supreme court for review the desantis strategy desantis who already has a major national profile among republicans has emerged as a controlling figure in redistricting a role never before embraced by a florida governor through his general counsel desantis submitted two congressional maps which dramatically revamp the districts held by lawson and another black democrat u s rep val demings of orlando now a candidate for u s senate demings district was made more similar to the one she currently represents in the proposals approved friday by the house panel which also are similar to the approach taken by the senate in his approach to reducing minority districts desantis appears to be relying heavily on a 2017 u s supreme court ruling in a north carolina case that found it unconstitutional to racially gerrymander a seat except in narrow instances that lawson s district may not meet lawson s seat was created by the florida supreme court in 2015 two years before the u s supreme court decision came down florida s congressional districts were crafted by state justices after three years of legal fights over the last round of maps drawing in 2012 desantis unsuccessfully sought an advisory opinion from the florida supreme court earlier this month on whether the state constitution s fair districts standards separately prohibited the redrawing of boundaries that could diminish the number of seats held by minorities in a 5 0 ruling the supreme court turned back desantis request for guidance questions linger among gop over redistricting but questions about the durability of minority districts is growing among republicans texas where gov greg abbott like desantis is viewed as a republican white house contender in 2024 has already approved redistricting maps that reduce minority representation drawing a lawsuit from the u s justice department under president biden on the redistricting committee friday rep randy fine r palm bay insisted that republicans were not doing the governor s bidding the two maps approved by the panel don t match the one from desantis but he added he does have a right to veto whatever we pass frankly if you don t talk to the governor s office whenever you re running any bill you re not doing a good job of being a bill sponsor john kennedy is a reporter

fans could be forgiven for thinking they were never going to hear another new album from tears for fears for a long time the duo themselves were challenged as they worked to figure out the next chapter the heartbreaking loss of roland orzabal s wife caroline johnston in 2017 after a decade of illnesses left him taking stock of his issues johnston had been connected to both orzabal and bandmate curt smith since the three were teenagers grieving the loss orzabal saw his friendship with smith in a new light their recent dealings had been rocky but orzabal saw no reason why the relationship couldn t be fixed they refreshed a bond over lunch that ultimately led to the tipping point the first new tears for fears album in nearly two decades for all involved it was worth the struggle before everything went so right with this album everything first had to go wrong orzabal admitted in an official release along the way they allowed themselves an opportunity to embrace that which might seem unconventional pink floyd s wish you were here every musician should listen to that record smith tells ucr purely for the fact that a vocal doesn t come in until eight minutes and 40 seconds into because you know you can do anything that album was huge as we all know but it s because it was good if you do anything well it can be successful smith spoke with ucr about the tipping point which will be supported with a summer tour featuring garbage that begins in may to borrow a bit from your first single for this album it s truly no small thing that we re holding this new album you must be really happy to finally be talking about this in a finished form i m very happy i mean it s taken us a while but the happiness level is certainly great when you love an album this album i think is wonderful you know normally when we finish records i m kind of done listening to them because i ve heard these songs so many times but this album at the end of it the journey it takes you on i still listen to it i mean i listen to it when i go walk my dog and i m like yeah we ve done something that s really good here so in that sense it s very gratifying watch tears for fears no small thing video you and roland haven t made a lot of albums together but what i always appreciate is that the ones that you have made always feel carefully considered to a certain degree i think being in search of a direction of what an album would be can sometimes be a torturous process this one was especially torturous but in that sense everything led to this album i can t really knock the process although you know we have said that it wasn t an enjoyable process and that it didn t feel right it didn t feel particularly honest but without having gone through that we would never have arrived where we arrived so in that sense it was valuable one analogy which is actually quite valid i was thinking back to when i was touring colleges with both of my children you know i ended up touring 35 colleges in america between both of my kids it was interesting that the biggest part of the process for them it appeared obvious to me by the end of it was finding out where they didn t want to be once you find out where you don t want to be you can whittle it down to the type of college you want to be at then you whittle it down from there to the one that you choose it was kind of that process we went and started doing that speed dating writing and came out with a lot of up tempo attempts at singles none of it felt particularly honest to me not that there wasn t some good things there there was and we kept some of that but most of the co writes and people that we were working with we didn t feel a particular affinity towards bar one there was one relationship which happened with sacha skarbek that ended up working well apart from that all of the other speed dating things we did just ended up sounding like these other people trying to stamp their voices or influences on us we re not comfortable with that i think by the end of it we definitely realized none of this really sounds like us it sounds like us attempting to be something else you know going through the process of finding out what it was we didn t want to do we ended up finding out what we did want to do we got together in 2020 and started fresh we kept half of the songs and worked them to a certain degree and wrote half of the album as new songs became the tipping point which we re both incredibly happy with watch tears for fears break the man video long long long time is really beautiful how did that one come together it was a weird song i mean it kind of was about us leading up to doing this album or we first started this album and how i felt our musical relationship was a little bit staid at that point in time i don t want to say it was lazy but we were taking the easy route going and working with lots of other people it s basically about a stale relationship which was how i was feeling at that time the song in reverse is actually in a time signature of seven which is highly peculiar but it works for whatever reason going into this very melodic beautiful chorus initially i tried to sing it and i was like no this really needs to be a female because then it would kind of become about a male female relationship carina round who is our singer and plays with us in our live band came in and did the vocal and then it all kind of came together and worked there s a lot of emotion tied to the subject matter of these songs what were the hardest ones to do in that regard you know emotionally well we re both singers as everyone knows so emotionally it s normally the tracks you sing that trying to sing them can be sometimes difficult i think stay was a hard song for me to do because it really does literally describe the turmoil you know you have this long term relationship that s a personal relationship and a business relationship but that it s not healthy for you at this point in time so it s a hard decision to leave that behind luckily things worked out so i didn t but it was basically talking about that turmoil it s easy enough to just walk away from something but when it s something that you ve had for this long it s a very very difficult decision to make it wasn t easy for me the first time around when i left but i knew i had to with my health it became a decision i had to make it just wasn t good for my mental health to be in the band at that point in time i think singing please be happy was really hard it s weird roland didn t want to sing it even though he wrote it about caroline but it was hard for me to sing because i d known caroline for all of those years too i guess those two tracks were the most difficult emotionally i think they should be difficult if they re not difficult then you re not putting enough emotion into them watch tears for fears mad world video roland has spoken of hearing girls on film by duran duran and how he wanted to take a crack at writing something like that which in part helped to inspire mad world it made me wonder if there are bands from the 80s that you were competitive with that you eventually found to be kindred spirits strangely enough competitiveness in the music industry was normally limited to if you were in a scene a music scene in england that would be manchester london or bristol we were the only band from bath so there was no real scene i ve never felt competitive with anyone else i think you should go and make the music that you like i don t think there s particularly a lot of commonality between us and say duran duran musically having said that knowing them personally yeah i mean i really like john a hell of a lot he s become a friend simon and i have met on a few occasions and he s a really nice guy these are just genuinely nice people i prefer to judge people on them rather than the music they re genuinely nice people we have shared history to the extent that we come from the same era so we do have stuff to talk about but the level of success they were at i guess we were up there too but i never felt that we were never fashionable we never got into that side of it
china is expected to increase its soybean self sufficiency rate to 20 percent by 2025 and see a dramatic increase in the production of soybean and oil crops in five to 10 years agricultural officials and experts said the no 1 central document for this year which was unveiled in late february as an indicator of policy priorities highlighted the project of increasing soybean and oil crop capacities among key tasks for comprehensively advancing rural vitalization tang renjian minister of agriculture and rural affairs said that although grain production in the country remains a tight balance the structure is still a big concern due to the low self sufficiency rate of soybean and oil crops the demand for soybeans increases dramatically with rising living conditions and a burgeoning livestock industry china imported 96 5 million metric tons of soybeans last year while producing 16 4 million tons which is a self sufficiency rate of less than 15 percent according to data from the general administration of customs currently domestic soybean production can meet people s food consumption needs including tofu and bean products imported soybeans which are genetically modified and have a higher oil yield are mainly used for edible plant oil and providing feed proteins in animal husbandry we strive to adjust the structure and determine to expand production of soybean and oil crops planting and harvesting as much as possible tang told a news conference after the document was released zhang wenli a researcher at the ministry s rural economy research center said it is the first time that increasing soybean and oil crop capacities has been listed as one of the tasks in the annual document eighty five percent of soybean consumption in china relies on imports mainly from brazil argentina and the united states zhang said adding that the country also imported more than 10 million metric tons of edible plant oil last year china needs to increase the self sufficiency rate due to increasing uncertainties caused by the covid 19 pandemic and trade frictions dating back to 2018 she said tang said the country will increase subsidies for corn and soybean growers and support crop rotation in the northeast the major soybean producing area in the country meanwhile rice planting in some areas where groundwater overdraft occurs is expected to be replaced by the planting of soybeans the combined planting of corn and soybeans in which two rows of corn are planted next to four rows of soybeans meets the needs of the two crops and relieves the tightness of limited planting area between them the planting method has been tested in southwestern china including sichuan province covering more than 467 000 hectares of farmland so far and will be further promoted in northern and northwestern china tang said subsidies from the central budget have been arranged to support local farmers and cooperatives in applying this method which has also been covered by agricultural insurance in some places the technique is quite mature and the next move is to promote it in larger areas and improve varieties to fit the conditions in various regions zhang said adding that better use of equipment and infrastructure such as agricultural machinery and irrigation systems is needed the country will also develop other oil crops such as rapeseed peanuts tea seed oil sunflowers and sesame tang said the ministry has asked local authorities to plant rapeseed on 330 000 hectares of idle farmland in winter with efforts in five to 10 years we will see a big improvement in the self sufficiency rates of soybean and oil crops he said by 2025 the planting area of soybeans in china is expected to reach 10 7 million hectares while the output is projected to hit 23 million tons according to the 14th five year plan for national crop production which the ministry released last year if we achieve the goal the self efficiency rate of soybeans will increase from 15 percent to 20 percent zhang said the protein content of domestic soybeans which are suitable for making bean products is relatively high but the oil yield rate of imported soybeans can exceed 20 percent around 2 percentage points higher than domestic ones we should increase domestic soybean yields and oil yield rate through integrated development of good varieties planting methods and relevant techniques zhang said the chinese academy of agricultural sciences sent a 200 member team late last month to support field management of wheat rapeseed and peanuts and to provide guidance on the combined planting of soybeans and corn the national food and strategic reserves administration will conduct auctions to release soybeans from state reserves and some edible oil will also be sold as part of its rotation of oil stocks according to an announcement on feb 22 considering the lower than expected production in major south american soybean producers due to bad weather and the recent crisis in

i say biden but what i really mean is the administration that s really running things there s not one guy in charge there s a group of people in charge and the job they re doing is so bad that the entire democrat party is suffering for it more accurately the country is suffering for it and the democrat s stock is falling among the people faster than an anvil in a vat of whipped cream this isn t an issue of circumstance democrats can blame covid putin or even trump but at the end of the day they are the ones that took a situation from bad to worse with covid solved to chaos with the border and stable to war breaking out with foreign policy but biden can solve a lot of problems in one fell swoop he can kill a lot of birds with just one stone and begin turning it all around now and he s even being given the answer all he has to do is listen to west virginia sen joe manchin and his advice about how to handle our energy problems as nick arama highlighted manchin has the right idea about how to put america back on the right course and even keep the democrat party afloat in the coming years the entire world is watching as vladimir putin uses energy as a weapon in an attempt to extort and coerce our european allies manchin said in a statement monday while americans decry what is happening in ukraine the united states continues to allow the import of more than half a million barrels per day of crude oil and other petroleum products from russia during this time of war this makes no sense at all and represents a clear and present danger to our nation s energy security he said if there was ever a time to be energy independent it is now as arama wrote biden should listen to manchin but the chances of him doing so are abysmal how do we know that because manchin has had a lot of great ideas since the beginning of the biden administration and yet no one is listening to him in fact biden s administration has been at war with manchin for some time funny enough biden s popularity is crashing and manchin s isn t herein lies the deeper issue with ignoring manchin though manchin might be a democrat and while there s a lot to disagree with him on he s clearly still looking out for the health and well being of the country the answers he s feeding to the biden administration are the ones that the administration could use to see this country rise again but they aren t they re actively ignoring manchin moreover they re actively ignoring us i ve been repeating this time and again but the theme of joe biden s administration has been abandonment he and his administration have abandoned us in many ways and it s not going to get any better biden clearly answers to a different set of orders outside of the ones we give him the radicals that have taken control of the democrat party have set us on a crash course and biden has no intention of turning away from that it would appear that even popularity isn t going to sway democrats now the state of the union tonight will feature a lot of rosy talk about the future but the future will only be good if we get the people who have no desire to answer to us out of public office this train is out of control and we need to put a lot of focus on getting it back into the hands of people who actually care about it vote accordingly

musicians promoters and supposed sponsors are all upset about the marketing associated with an upcoming performance at the smoky mountain event center in waynesville on july 30 to clarify classic rock act molly hatchet will not be playing the southern rock wood stock molly hatchet will not be at the said bobby ingram that event advertised is misleading in regards to molly hatchet we have nothing to do with event i own the trademark to the name molly hatchet and didn t give any consent to use the band name to any event except my own with its 1980 megahit flirtin with disaster molly hatchet is a well known rock entity lead guitarist of the multi platinum group since 1987 ingram and his bandmates have been touring the world nonstop for decades speaking to the smoky mountain news over the phone last week ingram in a confused and perturbed tone seemed blindsided by the advertising for the upcoming southern rock wood stock which states featuring original artists and superstars for 27 years from lynyrd skynyrd 38 special blackfoot and molly hatchet featuring original and founding members of the band well all of our original members and founding members have passed away ingram noted we played for this promoter several years ago but that was the one and only time so what about the part on one of the posters that advertises an appearance by erik lundgren from the johnny van zant band van zant molly hatchet lundgren for a brief period played lead rhythm guitar for molly hatchet 1993 1994 and to that point the finalized lineup of who will actually be onstage at the southern rock wood stock in waynesville has yet to be revealed with only lundgren specifically appearing in the advertising has been a friend of mine for many years however he has never been a member he was only a hired sideman for the road and never was on any recordings ingram said the wording on the poster is very ambiguous and misleading to many i did not authorize the use of the name molly hatchet budweiser which was listed as a sponsor in some of the online marketing and posters for the event also wants the public to know that it is in no way associated with the southern rock wood stock event budweiser of asheville anheuser busch and the budweiser brand are not and never have been associated in any way as a sponsor of this event any advertisement materials for the event including the budweiser brand logo were used without permission and they represent a false statement said chad wood sale manager for budweiser of asheville wood oversees a 12 county jurisdiction in western north carolina an independently and locally owned family business some of the biggest products contracted and distributed by the company are from anheuser busch including budweiser the promoter tried to tie in some brand names and product names in order to promote this event which is very misleading we have nothing to do with the said wood to note if any event in the 12 county jurisdiction is selling budweiser products or is sponsored by budweiser it would have to go through wood and his chain of command of sales reps and distribution channels and with that there are also very strict north carolina alcohol law enforcement rules in effect about not having alcohol brand logos on the same poster as an event my boss and i are the only ones that make decision regarding sponsorships wood said and if i saw that advertisement i wouldn t have even let that promoter through our front door the advertisement in question was an initial poster promoting the southern rock wood stock pictured on the poster is a woman wrapping herself in the confederate flag with sponsored by budweiser positioned next to the female early on the morning of january 29 i received an email with the promotional poster and my blood pressure immediately began to rise wood said we do not want to be associated with any kind of divisive symbols and we were not contacted once by the promoter in regards to sponsorship wood soon contacted chambers and said to immediately remove the sponsored by budweiser from all advertising and websites or legal action would be pursued and yet the toothpaste was already out of the tube yes the budweiser logo and sponsored by budweiser were removed by chambers from his website but the initial posters continue to float around social media platforms to this day the internet is forever and sadly the posters and advertisements are going to be online forever wood said and i m still fielding all of these phone calls from people asking about our involvement with this event in all the years that i ve been involved in the beverage industry and in sponsorship this is the first time i can recall something like this ever happening adding insult to injury the southern rock wood stock is now sold out though specific numbers weren t available on ticket sales the promoter of the event told the smoky mountain event center formerly the haywood county fairgrounds that he would be selling some 2 000 tickets plus rv and primitive camping spots and although the poster itself states tickets are 35 per person the website link to purchase said tickets says 45 per person for general admission just hearing those numbers irks ingram seeing as molly hatchet itself will be hitting the stage at the grey eagle in asheville on april 10 with a capacity of 550 the grey eagle still has plenty of tickets available to the gig with less than 100 tickets for the event already purchased this is my livelihood i have an obligation to all of the molly hatchet fans and to our entire organization to keep the band rolling year after year ingram said molly hatchet has been on the road for 43 years i ve been in the band 35 we haven t stopped touring for a single day this use of our name is affecting existing contracts for shows in these markets we have already booked to play it s causing confusion in the marketplace that confusion was also felt by jeff whitworth owner of worthwhile sounds a well respected regional promotional company who books musical acts of all sizes for the grey eagle amongst several other venues and festivals around western north carolina i actually stumbled onto the facebook advertising post for whitworth said the wording is misleading where with an initial glance it seemed like molly hatchet would be there so i sent the ad to the band s manager to make sure we didn t have any conflicts with the grey eagle show as a longtime music industry veteran whitworth immediately knew the advertising appeared misleading but that doesn t mean consumers can see or tell the difference in what s being presented on a poster and what will in reality be presented onstage i realize the actual band isn t playing that event but it still doesn t help our show and efforts to sell tickets whitworth said the whole thing is confusing it s all predicated on confusion in terms of other copyright issues that may arise southern rock wood stock could also conjure an immediate association with the iconic 1969 woodstock music art fair in 2015 the popular hillbilly woodstock gathering in maggie valley was sent a cease and desist letter from new york city law firm kenyon kenyon who were the trademark attorneys for woodstock ventures the festival has since been renamed hillbilly jam with a handful of well attended events held throughout the year at the maggie valley festival grounds and valley tavern besides the asheville live music market the southern rock wood stock meanders up and down the east coast each summer with a series of gatherings and has for 27 years according to its website other locations for the 2022 series include woodstock virginia philipsburg pennsylvania and cecil county maryland as of press time the southern rock wood stock stated tickets were selling fast and 50 sold out for the other three events aside from the confusion as to the bands listed on the southern rock wood stock poster there s the issue of the kid rock tribute act rebel soul also on the advertising although the lead singer of rebel soul appears on the poster the likeness is strikingly similar to kid rock himself the kid rock confusion is something once again emphasized by the wording and font color changes even though at the very bottom of the poster in very tiny font it states rebel soul is a tribute to kid rock the owners of the names lynyrd skynyrd 38 special blackfoot molly hatchet and kid rock are not associated with this show unfortunately there s always been a place for this in the music industry whitworth said i mean look at all of the tribute bands out there that are riding on the coattails of the actual bands my biggest beef with that specific promotion as someone like myself who has been making concert posters for years is that you can tell what they were trying to do so just who is behind the southern rock wood stock the name is clark chambers a musician in his own right who has been putting on the events for the better part of the last three decades with all proceeds going to the homeless warriors charity inc with both companies based in maryland chambers is also the front man of the southern mules another band listed in the event advertising numerous attempts were made by the smoky mountain news to contact chambers phone calls and email correspondences were not returned there were also attempts made to contact other bands and musicians listed on the posters none of which were returned since questions about the concerts arose in public forums online and in social media comment sections last week concert goers who have purchased tickets for the southern rock wood stock have contacted the smoky mountain news complaining about the advertising and asking who to turn to for a refund the event website however states there are no refunds allowed the event posters also mention that all proceeds go to homeless warriors charity according to the state of maryland s charity database homeless warriors charity inc is run by richard chambers of rising sun maryland the phone number listed for the charity matches the phone number that clark chambers provided by the smoky mountain events center the smoky mountain news was unable to find documentation indicating that richard chambers and clark chambers are actually the same person further information from the u s internal revenue service confirms that the charity s paperwork is in order and that it is indeed a valid tax exempt organization in 2020 the last year for which financial data were available homeless warriors charity inc raised 43 562 and directed 26 014 towards program costs associated with the charity s stated purpose of helping homeless veterans charity rating agencies like guidestar charity navigator and charity watch assess charity efficiency through rating systems the rating systems use among other things the percentage of every dollar donated that actually goes towards toward program costs as opposed to overhead like salaries the most efficient charities like the elizabeth glaser pediatric aids foundation and the animal welfare institute dedicate upwards of 90 of donations towards program cost and earn an a rating in the category of veteran and military charities the fisher house foundation and the intrepid fallen heroes fund also have an a rating with many others like the gary sinise foundation earning an a by comparison the innocently named purple heart foundation earned an f because only seven cents of every dollar donated to the organization actually went towards program costs in spending 59 7 of its donations on program costs homeless warriors charity inc would earn a solid c rating from charity watch the venue where southern rock wood stock is to be held the smoky mountain event center in waynesville doesn t conduct much oversight of the tenants that end up renting the space but research by the smoky mountain news suggests a lack of transparency in how the 27 acre taxpayer owned facility is run currently it s run by gene blankenship blankenship became interim manager last fall after previous work with harrah s cherokee center in asheville the billy graham training center at the cove and ringling brothers blankenship serves as the manager of a 501 c 3 nonprofit that s governed by a board because the board is a private nonprofit and not a public body it s not subject to public records laws despite managing a multimillion dollar taxpayer asset renting the facility is easy prospective tenants fill out a form online and choose one or more of seven different venues located on the premises that contain around 100 000 square feet of indoor space and almost five acres of outdoor space in addition to payment for the space tenants must provide four separate documents to blankenship in order to get the event on the schedule the rental application proof of liability insurance an acknowledgement of the facility s rules and regulation and a permit from the north carolina alcoholic beverage commission when alcohol is to be served given the controversy surrounding the concert the smoky mountain news asked blankenship for the documents on feb 24 in order to determine who was behind the event and to contact them blankenship correctly stated that he had no obligation to provide them however he did release contact information for event promoter clark chambers and said that chambers had provided all necessary documents to rent the facility all questions about the event blankenship said should be directed to chambers however blankenship did say that the event had sold out at least 2 000 tickets and all eight rv hookups and that chambers had rented the entire facility during an in person interview with blankenship on feb 25 he said he d since contacted chambers advising chambers that the newspaper is asking for the records that message from blankenship to chambers resulted in letters being sent to both to the smoky mountain event center board and to the smoky mountain news from a maryland attorney justin b hill who said he represents homeless warriors charity inc the letter to the smoky mountain event center board requests that the documents not be released the letter to the smoky mountain news references concern about social media posts made by smoky mountain news although no social media posts about the event have appeared anywhere on social media sites managed by the smoky mountain news comments such as these can result in damages and cause greater conflict than need be hill wrote we hope that this letter will suffice before any further conflict can arise blankenship was again asked for the documents and again refused to provide them when the second request was made for the documents blankenship said he wouldn t release them because of the letter from hill initially blankenship told the smoky mountain news via email that the reason he wouldn t release the documents is because he didn t have to release them when asked about the confusing marketing on the event s posters blankenship said that he doesn t review an event s marketing for content prior to accepting rental applications or posting the materials on the event center s website we just take the poster like anyone else that comes here they give us a poster that is for their event and we put that up on our front page blankenship said however as of press time on tuesday march 1 the poster had been removed from the smoky mountain event center website likewise blankenship said he s not regularly called before the haywood county board of commissioners to give updates on the state of the county s asset and that he doesn t always bring specific events to the attention of the smoky mountain event center board because most are fairly routine and non controversial blankenship said he mentioned the southern rock wood stock event to the smoky mountain event center board in the context of a routine manager s report that details the last 30 days of activity at the facility as well as the upcoming 30 days the report typically includes details about events that have recently taken place events that will take place and new rental applications the smoky mountain event center board holds monthly meetings but does not publish minutes from those meetings the minutes are not public record when asked for the minutes of the meeting where he supposedly presented the event to the board blankenship said he didn t have them because they re prepared by the board s secretary during the normal course of any board s operation minutes from the previous meeting are presented for approval in accepting the previous meeting minutes by board vote the board affirms that the minutes are a true and accurate depiction of what happened in the previous meeting when the smoky mountain news inspected meeting minutes obtained from another source no mention of southern rock wood stock could be found

for some foundations making esg investments isn t enough at least two organizations have gone a step further and set up separate pools of capital that can only be invested in accordance with their missions in 2021 the robert wood johnson foundation created a 200 million impact investing pool that has been actively allocating capital to projects ranging from funding for small businesses hit by covid 19 to research on social bond issuances rwj s program is reminiscent of a similarly sized impact pool set up by the mcknight foundation in 2014 today 40 percent of mcknight s 3 billion in assets are in mission related investments in an environment dominated by the desire to find the right way to go about esg investing these foundations have taken a unique approach to doing good linking their grant making focus to their investment prowess kimberlee cornett joined the robert wood johnson foundation in early 2020 to lead this effort after spending nine years at the kresge foundation in a similar role before i came the board made available 200 million as an initial foray into impact investing cornett said it s not out of the endowment it s a separate pool of capital on the charitable giving side of the ledger in the past year the impact pool made a 2 million guarantee to new jersey community capital a nonprofit community development financial institution the investment will support local businesses hurt by covid 19 with a focus on people of color the team also recently announced that via a 4 million grant the foundation is funding work to bring transparency to social municipal bond issuance every pension fund has exposure cornett said of social bonds one of the things that the market doesn t easily make visible is who an issuance is benefiting and how that s being repaid according to cornett there has been a 40 percent rise in social bond issuance and they ve been oversubscribed five times over but it s like what we saw when green bonds started coming out cornett explained whether it was a light green a lime green or a forest green it was all just green there was no distinction certain social bond issuances are being repaid by fines charged to lawbreakers however those laws are often disproportionately applied to communities of color effectively making the social benefits of those bonds moot cornett said that robert wood johnson has made the grant to help build a framework that will allow institutions to assess these bonds one of the benefits of building a practice like this is that you do become a bridge between the other two arms of the house cornett said nirvana for us is finding those areas where we can activate the grant making side and then we may find a market rate opportunity for investment in 2014 the mcknight foundation set aside 10 percent of its portfolio at the time 200 million for an impact investing pool the foundation hired elizabeth mcgeveran who has since become its director of investments to lead the effort by 2018 the foundation had fully committed the pool of capital 75 million to public equities 75 million to private investments and 50 million to program related investments that were considered concessionary the program s returns were strong so the board decided to treat that 10 percent of its portfolio as a floor rather than a ceiling for impact related investments the result today 40 percent of mcknight s endowment is mission aligned the fixed income portfolio worth 200 million has no exposure to coal and oil sands the fund has also invested with esg managers and continuously monitors and makes suggestions for its existing investment managers we periodically assess our existing portfolio and fund managers to understand how much esg risk they introduce she said we look at products that we re already in and think about ways to become more aligned mcknight has also made its own direct impact investments one example is mcknight s investment in arcadia a utility company that helps both renters and homeowners in any state buy renewable power for their homes because the investment has a strong overlap between impact and return mcgeveran called it a bull s eye for mcknight we like that it creates an option for renters who are often excluded from renewables mcgeveran said of arcadia and in some markets arcadia can save you money on your utility bill in other markets it s about the same they re building community solar to feed into the grid today the endowment is continuing to look for investments like these having benefited from the growth of that initial impact pool established in 2014 when we built this program it was separate mcgeveran said it was very ring fenced off now our investments are much more integrated and the way we manage them is much more integrated the distinction is no longer a bright line
