published may 30 2022 06 00 ist suddenly inflation is back in the global headlines after a long period when it seemed to drop out of the policy discussion in advanced capitalist economies and did not seem to be much of an issue even in many low and middle income countries this was the period described as the great moderation roughly between the mid 1980s and the years leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008 when fluctuations in economic activity in the developed world were reduced and less severe and when inflation rates were low and sometimes even negative in many economies of course this was not the case in all parts of the world some countries experienced very rapid inflation in certain years such as russia in the early 1990s or the democratic republic of congo or venezuela or even hyperinflation like zimbabwe inflation refers to a general increase in prices not just in specific goods and services but an all round increase that is spread across different sectors it matters to ordinary people particularly when their money incomes do not go up as fast as prices do which is described as a loss of purchasing power this is described as a decline in real income or real wages which can happen even when money incomes are increasing globally prices of essential commodities such as foodgrains and of fuel or energy which enters directly into prices of all other goods and services have been rising since the middle of 2021 and have accelerated sharply since the ukraine war as a result of this advanced economies have experienced rates of overall inflation that are higher than they have been for decades things may be worse for low and middle income countries even when their inflation rates do not appear to have increased so much because money incomes of workers peasants and other self employed people have barely increased and in many cases have fallen the debate on the causes of inflation has divided economists and policymakers for at least a century if not longer traditional monetarist economists have tended to believe that inflation results from excess money supply creation too much money chasing too few goods they argue that increases in credit creation or liquidity will result in higher inflation rates since the level of economic activity by real supply is determined by other factors so the way to control inflation is to limit the creation of credit in an economy by curbing the expansion of reserve money reducing credit to government and limiting banks ability to extend credit according to them this would reduce the amount of money in circulation and thereby force prices down conceptual flaws there are at least two basic conceptual flaws in this argument the first is the idea that the total economic activity or supply is given exogenously by available labour and institutional factors so that it cannot be affected by macroeconomic policy instead since most economies are not at full employment macroeconomic policies can affect the level of economic activity the second flaw in the idea is that the total money supply is a stock that can be fixed by policy in reality governments can affect only the base or reserve money and some of the credit provided by the banking system in general once that is determined economic activity determines the actual amount of credit or liquidity in the system by changing the velocity of circulation or the number of times the base money directly or indirectly changes hands through different transactions so the final supply of money or liquidity in the system is an outcome of the economy s functioning not a policy variable in the hands of the central bank or the government what the central bank can and does do is change its base interest rate which is the floor for all other interest rates in the economy that is why other economists especially those with keynesian and structuralist perspectives take a completely different view on the causes of inflation in the keynesian approach inflation reflects the excess of spending over income at the macroeconomic level this imbalance can result in either a balance of payments deficit or domestic inflation so if there are supply constraints or bottlenecks that prevent output from rising when there is more demand in the system but total spending does not adjust accordingly that can cause inflation upward spiral structuralists point out that inflation results when different groups in the economy fight over their shares in national income firms workers agriculturalists and other primary producers and governments for example if imported input costs rise firms may try to increase their output prices to maintain their profit margins but if workers who feel that their real wages would fall as a result of this are able to fight to increase their money wages then that adds further to costs and firms could seek to increase prices further as a result this can lead to an upward spiral if both groups are able to seek to maintain their real incomes this is more likely when such groups are stronger and if more incomes are indexed to the inflation rate as it sometimes happens when unions are able to build this into their wage bargains or when businesses are able to insist on maintaining their profit margin by raising their prices high inflation rates are obviously very destabilising but they can reflect the ability of more sections of the economy to fight back to at least maintain their real incomes when expectations of inflation become more widespread then all groups that can do so try to raise their own prices so as not to lose out in real income terms this can generate inflationary spirals because such expectations become self fulfilling by contrast in economies like india with a very large proportion of informal workers with little or no bargaining power such increases in production costs and prices just get passed on to workers who are not able to demand higher money incomes as a result this means the inflation rate may remain relatively lower but it would have possibly a worse impact on living standards because real incomes fall inflationary episodes different inflationary episodes can be classified according to whether they are demand pull or cost push the distinction is important because it should affect how governments respond demand pull inflation is when the money demand for goods and services rises too fast relative to available supply sometimes called overheating usually this is seen to call for a rise in central bank interest rates or tighter monetary policy that will make it more expensive or difficult to access credit thereby reducing spending cost push inflation can result from specific costs going up possibly because of supply bottlenecks in specific sectors or rising prices of imported inputs either because of world price changes or exchange rate depreciation in this case raising interest rates will not address the cause of inflation but instead can cause economic activity to decelerate and even decline in the worst case this policy can generate stagflation the combination of slow or falling economic activity and rising price levels the period from the global financial crisis to 2021 should have conclusively refuted the monetarist argument that just releasing liquidity into an economy will generate inflation since that crisis just four major banks the united states federal reserve the european central bank the bank of england and the bank of japan released unprecedented amounts of liquidity such that their total assets increased from around 4 trillion in january 2008 to more than 26 trillion in 2021 but throughout this entire period until mid 2021 inflation rates remained low in the advanced economies declining and even turning negative in some countries the recent inflation in the advanced economies and therefore in the global markets originated with cost push factors specifically the supply chain issues that originated in covid 19 related lockdowns and closures the ukraine war made matters worse by affecting oil wheat and fertilizer supplies and impacting on certain established trading routes but these are not enough to explain the significant rise in prices it has also been driven by corporate profiteering and accelerated by financial speculation in commodity futures markets oil companies have seized the opportunity to push up prices beyond what is justified by their own cost increases just like big pharma companies profiteered from the covid 19 pandemic meanwhile financial activity in commodity futures markets increased substantially between january and march 2022 driving up futures prices in wheat and other commodities and thus affecting current spot prices as well this pattern is clearly evident in the united states in the three decades 1979 2019 when inflation rates were not so high rising unit labour costs which reflect rising wages contributed to 62 per cent of the total price increase compared with 27 per cent because of other input price increases and 11 per cent because of more profits but in the recent and ongoing inflation the ratios have been reversed between april june 2020 and october december 2021 when inflation has accelerated to much higher levels corporate profits accounted for 54 per cent of the total price rise while labour costs contributed only 8 per cent and other inputs costs 38 per cent source economic policy institute this suggests that the current macroeconomic policy responses to inflation in the advanced economies which are all about tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates are wrongly directed they do not address the real causes of this inflation they are more likely to cause economic recessions and will also generate more financial volatility low and middle income countries will once again be the worst affected as they will experience capital outflows in addition to all their other current woes

organic or gmo experts explain food lingo consumers are constantly faced with an overwhelming amount of industry diet terms and food lingo 30 may 2022 30 may 2022 6 minute read 6 minute read north america experts from the robert m kerr food and agricultural products center at oklahoma state university clarified some of the most common references organic the difference between conventional non organic and organic food involves how it is grown and manufactured while both foods follow regulations and guidelines to make them equally safe to consume organic food regulations are different organic produced foods rely on the use of natural substances and methods throughout the entire food production process while conventionally grown foods allow for the additional usage of approved synthetic substances and methods said renee albers nelson fapc milling and baking specialist because there are many opinions of what natural is the u s department of agriculture created the national organic program a federal regulatory program to develop and enforce federal standards for organically produced products sold in the u s the usda nop inspects farms and food manufacturing facilities to approve their use of the usda organic seal there are four types of usda organic claims that can be made and they are defined by the usda nop as follows 100 organic used to label any product that contains 100 organic ingredients organic any product that contains a minimum of 95 organic ingredients up to 5 of ingredients may be non organic made with an organic item product contains at least 70 organically produced ingredients specific organic ingredient listings specific organic ingredients may be listed in the ingredient statement of products containing less than 70 organic contents gluten free in august 2013 the u s food and drug administration issued an official definition of gluten free the regulations must be fully met for a product to say gluten free on the label gluten free is a food that is naturally gluten free or does not contain an ingredient that is a gluten containing grain wheat rye barley spelt or some crossbreed of these grains or derived from a gluten containing grain that has not been processed to remove gluten wheat flour or derived from a gluten containing grain and that has been processed to remove gluten wheat starch if the use of that ingredient results in the presence of 20 parts per million or more gluten in the food additionally any unavoidable presence of gluten in the food must be less than 20 parts per million meeting the requirements of gluten free is important for people with celiac disease a life threatening illness if they consume gluten albers nelson said label claims such as gluten free free of gluten without gluten and no gluten are acceptable as long as the fda gluten free requirements are met placing gluten free on a label is voluntary people with celiac disease should read and study food ingredient statements also albers nelson said the term gluten friendly is not a term recognized by the fda and has no official definition it does not mean a food is free of gluten or safe for consumers who suffer from celiac disease she said gmo according to the fda gmo stands for a genetically modified organism and is used to describe a plant animal or microorganism that has had its genetic material dna altered with technology modification includes the transfer of specific dna from one organism to another the usda s animal and plant health inspection service the u s environmental protection agency and the fda are responsible for guaranteeing that biotech products are safe as a food for humans and animals as well as the environment with the passage of the national bioengineered food disclosure law in 2018 as of jan 1 2022 manufacturers importers and retailers with annual receipts of 2 5 million or more will be required to disclose to the consumer if a food or ingredient is bioengineered the usda defines a bioengineered food as one that contains detectable genetic material modified through lab techniques a bioengineered food cannot be created through conventional breeding or be found in nature approved methods of label disclosure are guided by the nbfds usp verified the u s pharmacopeial convention was founded in 1820 in washington d c as a nonprofit scientific organization that develops and disseminates quality standards for medicines and other related substances such as dietary supplements it does not have any law enforcement power usp verified is a voluntary program for manufacturers audits are conducted and if a product receives the usp verified mark the following requirements are met the manufacturer follows fda good manufacturing practices the product contains the ingredients listed on the label in the correct amounts and potency does not contain harmful contaminants will break down and release into the body within a specified amount of time allergen free the description allergen free is not a recognized statement by the fda and has no regulatory basis the usage of this term implies the food does not contain any of the eight allergens listed under the food allergen labeling and consumer protection act milk eggs crustacean shellfish tree nuts peanuts wheat and soybeans also sesame will be added to the major allergen list beginning jan 1 2023 consumers can be allergic to many other ingredients or foods albers nelson said implying a food is allergen free is good marketing but too broad of a statement to make implying that nothing present will cause anyone an allergic response paleo the paleo diet is a reference to the paleolithic the stone age or caveman period of history the diet s theory is that humans have moved too far away from what they assume their human ancestors ate meat from hunted animals fish and vegetables and the result is an increase in chronic diseases followers of the paleo diet do not consume grains dairy products legumes and sugar instead they focus on meat fish eggs vegetables fruits nuts seeds herbs spices and healthy fats keto a ketogenic diet also known as keto encourages the consumption of high fats moderate proteins and low carbohydrates carbohydrates serve as the primary source of energy in body tissues in the form of glucose when glucose availability is not present or very low ketogenesis is initiated to provide an alternate energy source from fat in the form of ketones ketogenesis reduces the body s need to stimulate fat and glucose storage in the short term the keto diet is effective in weight loss albers nelson said but it s not considered a long duration diet due to health concerns vegetarian versus vegan other frequently used food terms include vegetarian which is a person who excludes meat poultry fish seafood insect or animal by products such as gelatin or stock fat from animals from his or her diet a vegan diet is a continuation of the vegetarian diet vegans do not consume dairy products and eggs and they also don t use any animal byproducts for food clothing or other purposes janice hermann an osu extension specialist in nutritional sciences said understanding terms and labels benefits the consumer using the nutrition facts label can help you make healthier food and beverage choices she said the nutrition facts label and ingredient list are the safest most important labels to read and are regulated by the fda
four green trends to watch in financial markets earth day 2022 followed a report months earlier from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that warned global temperatures could rise more than 2 c during the 21st century this together with the agreement signed at cop26 in november 2021 shows the magnitude of the climate challenge several trends in financial markets show a growing awareness of the need for environmentally sustainable solutions following are four areas worth a closer look esg solutions in equity index markets the shifting biofuels market a thriving battery metals market fuelled by electric cars and the growth of the voluntary carbon offset market esg equity index as the environmental social and governance esg ecosystem evolves esg investments must keep the pace to continue providing robust solutions to market participants in the equity space this evolution translates to index providers ensuring their indices reflect the overall trajectory of esg investing underlying this esg evolution is tremendous growth in esg investments including derivatives like cme group s e mini s p 500 esg index futures which have become the most liquid esg equity index futures contract globally to further align to the rapidly evolving esg landscape s p dow jones indices s p dji will amend the eligibility requirements for their esg indices beginning in may 2022 the updates to exclusions and eligibility requirements reflect the growing need for index providers to properly account for companies business activities which ultimately ensures esg investors can accurately assess the behavior of those companies within the index recent trends in e mini s p 500 esg index futures illustrate how investors can find solutions that fit their esg needs average daily volume adv in esg futures is up over 100 already in 2022 and has steadily grown since the contract s launch since their launch in november 2019 esg futures contracts have surpassed 94 billion of traded notional and in mid april 2022 surpassed 13 500 contracts of open interest equivalent to nearly 3 billion the rise of evs with the help of advanced technology and electric vehicles evs continuing to increase their share of the global automobile market it seems clear that cobalt and lithium are critical to meet growing ev demand and satisfy large scale efforts to move from the internal combustion engine to battery powered transportation according to the international energy agency iea electric car sales more than doubled between 2020 and 2021 in total 6 6 million evs were sold this past year amounting to nearly 10 of the global market china is the largest market for evs with sales increasing 179 to 3 4 million new car registrations and thereby overtaking europe at 2 3 million units 64 year over year while smaller than china or europe the american ev market also showed strong growth increasing 123 year over year to 700 000 units seen in a wider context higher ev penetration is part of the transition to a low carbon economy this transition is gathering pace as world leaders are signing up to emission reductions and net zero targets as has been widely commented the decarbonization of transport and energy generation will require a significant amount of metal aluminum copper nickel cobalt and lithium should all be in high demand the iea estimates that demand for lithium may increase up to fortyfold in 20 years time and demand for cobalt by a factor of 20 25 if governments across the globe are serious about reaching the goals set out in the paris agreement there is a level of uncertainty around the exact growth rates since these are influenced by evolving technology as well as governmental climate policies but it is hard to imagine a scenario where cobalt and lithium markets do not grow to accommodate the energy transition cme group offers trading in both cobalt and lithium futures with demand growing rapidly prices in both contracts have trended higher cobalt is now trading at 34 kg more than twice the level it was at launch in december 2020 lithium prices have increased even faster from 13 kg in may 2021 to above 40 in february 2022 rising use of bioenergy the growth of bioenergy is expected to become a bigger feature of the markets as economies look to further decarbonize in the european union eu the recently expanded renewable energy directive ii red ii boosts further usage in both biofuel feedstocks and waste feedstocks the eu has targeted a minimum level of 40 share for renewable energy sources by 2030 up from 32 under previous iterations of the directive the eu has also promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55 by 2030 these more stringent targets are expected to be a boost for the bioenergy markets the u s is also leading the charge in the production of renewable diesel these initiatives are expected to further pull on the supply of agricultural based feedstock and waste based markets which will be needed to meet the growth projections for u s renewable diesel and european hydrotreated vegetable oil hvo production the rise of voluntary carbon markets strong demand for voluntary carbon markets continues driven in part by the commitments of corporates to reduce their carbon footprint to help achieve net zero carbon emission goals by 2050 in 2021 cme group launched the global emission offset geo future a volume record of 1 810 contracts the equivalent of 1 81 million carbon credits was reached on march 10 the nature based carbon offset ngo futures contract traded a record 4 277 contracts or 4 27 million carbon credits a week later on march 16 ing bank estimates that the growth in demand for voluntary offsets could increase 15 times the 2020 levels by 2030 and 100 times the 2020 levels by 2050 as interest grows this will remain a market to watch in all of these markets equities biofuels metals and carbon offsets we see market participants addressing risks around an evolving set of climate challenges new tools have emerged to help manage those risks across several asset classes this shows not only strong demand for risk management solutions but also how nearly all markets are affected

week it has really lacked direction which is not surprising given the continued volatility remember as i stated previously this doesn t necessarily mean the market will be bearish nor does it mean it will be bullish it just means that right now it is time to be patient in my last report i indicated that i still believed most if not all of the fall had already occurred but that this was unconfirmed which is still the case the more our market rises over the next few weeks the higher the probability it will hold above the recent low of may 12 at 7 157 points before the market turns to test the low which it will do at some point in time if the market does fall away over the next few weeks it needs to hold above the low of may 12 if we are to see a bullish market into the third quarter of 2022 while there are opportunities currently unfolding in the market i continue to urge investors to exercise caution as the current mood can change quickly so until a direction is confirmed it is wise to sit back and wait until the dust settles no demerger for agl agl energy asx agk limited will not demerge and its chief executive graeme hunt and chairman peter botten will leave the company following

and nearly three quarters have fired a gun the prevalence of gun violence and gun ownership has made gun control among the most hotly and frequently contested issues in the united states advocates for gun control want tighter restrictions on the sale possession and use of firearms while advocates of gun rights see ownership as an essential right protected by the second amendment to the u s

control everytown for gun safety founded by former new york city mayor michael bloomberg has spent millions of dollars to promote gun control through ballot initiatives and state elections from 2017 to 2019 there was a rise in the amount of americans who support stricter gun laws meanwhile more hardline groups such as gun owners of america fight hard in washington d c for lawmakers support gun

children and six adults at sandy hook elementary school in newtown conn a shooting in 2016 at a nightclub in orlando fla that left 50 dead was the deadliest until the following year when a gunman killed 59 people at a las vegas music festival in 2018 a gunman killed 17 people at a parkland fla high school and 22 people were killed in august 2019 at a walmart in el paso texas while these deadly events were less frequent during the height of the covid 19 pandemic 2022 has seen more than 200 mass shootings as of late may the deadliest of which was at robb elementary school in uvalde texas which left at least 19 students and two teachers dead it took place just 10 days after a gunman opened fire at a supermarket in buffalo new york killing 10 people bump stocks a bump stock is an attachment designed to make a semiautomatic rifle fire faster it replaces the weapon s stock the part held against the shoulder freeing it to slide back and forth rapidly and harness the recoil energy a dozen of the rifles used by the gunman in the 2017 las vegas mass shooting were modified with bump stocks allowing him to fire over 1 100 rounds in 11 minutes as of mar 2019 bump stocks are illegal for almost all u s civilians but there are multiple lawsuits that challenge that are still pending binary trigger like a bump stock a binary trigger increases a weapon s firing speed unlike a bump stock it is legal in many states a binary trigger allows the firearm to shoot one bullet when the trigger is pulled and one when it releases using a binary trigger a 30 round magazine can be emptied in about three seconds pistol grip a pistol grip is considered a defining feature of an assault weapon it is used to improve stability against a weapon s recoil gun control advocates say a pistol grip helps shooters who are spray firing from the hip and the feature was prohibited under the assault weapons ban flash suppressor a flash suppressor also is a feature of assault style weapons it allows hot air and gas to escape from the gun barrel creating a smaller flash as the bullet is fired it is designed to improve visibility for the shooter high capacity magazine definitions vary but generally a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition is considered high capacity the gunman in the august 2019 dayton ohio mass shooting that killed nine people had a 100 round magazine using high capacity magazines is legal in many states gun control advocates say that while restrictions on magazine size may not stop mass shootings they may limit the carnage if the shooter must pause to reload open carry open carry refers to the practice of carrying openly visible firearms in public thirty one states allow open carry without any license or permit although in some cases the weapon cannot be loaded forty five states allow the open carry of a long gun such as a rifle or shotgun although some states do not allow the weapons to be loaded background checks under federal law background checks are required to buy guns from a licensed vendor which includes retailers among those ineligible to buy a gun are felons those dishonorably discharged from the military and people convicted of domestic violence a background check is not federally required to buy a gun from a private unlicensed seller including online and at gun shows gun control advocates want background checks expanded while the

finland signed the moscow armistice in september 1944 one of the agreements was that finland would expel all german forces in their country they did so and the nation that was once their ally against the soviets now became their enemy in what was known as the lapland war unfortunately the agreement also required finland to demobilize its military this left torni unemployed in november 1944 leaving only a few left to deal with and fight against the germans in 1942 he was severely wounded after accidentally skiing over a mine that of course didn t slow him down during the continuation war in 1944 he again fought and led a light infantry battalion and was even awarded the mannerheim cross the equivalent of the medal of honor lauri allan torni was born in finland in viipuri viipuri province his father was ship captain jalmari torni and his mother was named rosa he had two sisters named salme kyllikki and kaija iris he was athletic as a youth before he attended business school and served with the civil guard he was 19 when the winter war broke in november 1939 and he enlisted and fought against the soviet union his impressive ability during combat allowed him to rise quickly to the rank of captain he took command of a group of ski troops skiing their way into battle against the soviet forces how many wars could one man fight and under how many flags does he need to carry throughout his life before we could say that he s fought enough the imaginary other half of this conversation answers one but not if you ll ask lauri törni larry lane or larry thorne who all happened to be the same person in his lifetime he fought multiple wars under three different flags finnish nazis and the american larry lane torni did not exactly like the decision of expelling the germans in favor of the soviets as the germans had provided lots of aid and equipment to finland in fighting the russians so when a pro german resistance approached him in 1945 he welcomed them with open arms fearing that the soviets would end up invading and occupying finland torni joined a volunteer unit in the german army more specifically he joined the wiking division of the waffen ss while in germany he trained to be an effective saboteur reversals for germany on the eastern front resulted in his training being cut short and now torni found there was no easy way of getting back to finland so he ended up joining a finish battalion of the ss wiking division which was made up of norwegians swedes fins and others of presumably viking stock torni now going by the name of lane went back into the fight against the soviets near schwerin in germany in the end germany was defeated and lane managed to surrender to british troops rather than the russians and face certain death and was sent into a prison camp in lubeck as unstoppable as he was he escaped the prison and returned to finland in june of 1945 the finnish government promptly arrested him for fighting for the germans he was charged with treason and detained perhaps it was the lack of security in prisons at that time or maybe it was lane s determination but he was able to escape that prison as well he was recaptured in april 1946 and sentenced to six years in prison he re escaped and was recaptured for the second time perhaps finland got tired of him or the mood in the country became more forgiving as the soviets brought the iron curtain down in eastern europe but president juho paasikivi decided to pardon him in december 1948 lane s name was still mud in finland and he decided to move to sweden the very next year and from there boarded a cargo ship to venezuela true to form torni assumed the alias of a swedish merchant seaman and hired onto another vessel heading for the us in the gulf of mexico off the coast of alabama torni jumped overboard and swam ashore to claim political asylum as a finn again before long he managed to get himself a permanent resident visa aided by the law firm headed by bill donovan that would be the wild bill donovan of oss fame in wwii larry thorne the lodge philbin act of 1950 enabled thorne to join the us military as this act allowed foreigners to enter the army and allowed them citizenship after honorable service of at least five years yearning for action and still consumed with hatred for the soviets and communism he joined the special forces as a commissioned officer where he taught survival skills and guerrilla tactics all that he gained from his prior experiences he was sent to south vietnam in 1963 during the vietnam war where he earned his two purple hearts and one bronze star medal on october 18 1965 thorne was in a clandestine operation as part of military assistance command vietnam studies and observations group macv sog when his helicopter crashed his body was not found initially and they thought he either escaped or became a pow until in 1999 a joint us finnish mission found his body on the crash site he was buried and can now be found at the arlington national cemetery

once a poor skinny kid from malaysia hock tan was going head to head with a legendary us technology mogul for a transformative acquisition tan placed a call earlier this month to vmware inc chairman michael dell also the chief executive of computer maker dell technologies inc he proposed one of the biggest tie ups in the history of the technology sector broadcom inc the chip maker that tan leads was willing to acquire vmware a cloud software company for 61 billion s 83 billion for tan now 70 the deal would be the culmination of a string of acquisitions that has helped him turn broadcom into a technology conglomerate worth 225 billion along the way building a reputation as an astute dealmaker and ruthless cost cutter dell who personally owns 40 per cent of vmware and controls it together with buyout firm silver lake had a decision to make hold out for a better deal or risk losing out as technology stocks plunged amid concerns about a looming economic slowdown and rampant inflation broadcom offered 61 billion in cash and stock for vmware a 50 per cent premium to where the shares of the latter were trading to clinch the deal tan also agreed to give vmware 40 days from the signing of the deal to search for another suitor who may offer a better price vmware said yes this account of the negotiations is based on people involved in the deal who requested anonymity broadcom had been eyeing vmware for months but held off from making an approach because it was concerned that dell and silver lake would not engage due to the timing of vmware s spin off from dell technologies in november 2021 shareholders risk losing the tax free status of their spin off if their company engages in sale talks in the first six months after the separation tan s cost cutting reputation prompted vmware s chief executive raghu raghuram to write to his employees on the deal s announcement to assure them that the perception of broadcom putting profits ahead of innovation was inaccurate he wrote that tan is committed to cultivating a shared culture of innovation that reputation stems from tan s strategy of acquiring businesses he calls franchises and then slashing what he sees as excessive sales and marketing expenses and unnecessary investments he is also quick to jettison parts of those businesses that underperform he runs broadcom like an investment portfolio they are all independent fiefdoms said a former employee at the company who worked closely with tan if he has a dominant position in any market he ll go in and raise those prices tan and broadcom did not respond to requests for comment tan has said he was an 18 year old skinny kid growing up in malaysia when he won a scholarship in 1971 to attend engineering school at mit his parents could not afford to send him to college he went on to earn an mba from harvard university he held several executive positions in malaysia and the united states before joining chip maker integrated circuit systems in 1994 rising to become chief executive in 1999 it was silver lake that helped recruit tan as chief executive of the company that would go on to become broadcom in 2006 tan joined avago technologies a semiconductor company that silver lake and kkr co inc another buyout firm had acquired the year before for 2 66 billion a spate of deals followed as tan embarked on consolidating the semiconductor industry often with backing from silver lake in 2014 avago paid 6 6 billion for storage chipmaker lsi corp in 2015 it acquired broadcom for 37 billion and took its name in 2016 broadcom acquired network gear maker brocade communications systems inc for 5 9 billion qualcomm bid thwarted in 2017 broadcom launched a hostile 117 billion takeover bid for rival chipmaker qualcomm inc that would have been the largest technology deal of all time it was thwarted by the us government over concerns that broadcom which was at the time headquartered in singapore would become too dominant in the us semiconductor industry at the expense of innovation tan then turned his attention to software companies which like semiconductors can generate reliable cash flow broadcom took over business software firm ca technologies inc for 18 9 billion and acquired symantec corp s security division for 10 7 billion following every acquisition broadcom paid down much of the debt it had taken on to help fund it using the cash flow of its businesses this has emboldened tan to carry on with his spree of acquisitions said matt britzman analyst at hargreaves lansdown broadcom has de levered quickly after each large acquisition britzman said
iterâ s fusion energy experiments will take place inside the vacuum vessel of a donut shaped machine called a tokamak saint paul lez durance france â from a small hill in the southern french region of provence you can see two suns one has been blazing for four and a half billion years and is setting the other is being built by thousands of human minds and hands and is â far more slowly â rising the last of the real sunâ s evening rays cast a magical glow over the other â an enormous construction site that could solve the biggest existential crisis in human history it is here in the tiny commune of saint paul lez durance that 35 countries have come together to try and master nuclear fusion a process that occurs naturally in the sun â and all stars â but is painfully difficult to replicate on earth fusion promises a virtually limitless form of energy that unlike fossil fuels emits zero greenhouse gases and unlike the nuclear fission power used today produces no long life radioactive waste mastering it could literally save humanity from climate change a crisis of our own making if it is mastered fusion energy will undoubtedly power much of the world just 1 gram of fuel as input can create the equivalent of eight tons of oil in fusion power thatâ s an astonishing yield of 8 million to 1 atomic experts rarely like to estimate when fusion energy may be widely available often joking that no matter when you ask itâ s always 30 years away but for the first time in history that may actually be true in february scientists in the english village of culham near oxford announced a major breakthrough they generated and sustained a record 59 megajoules of fusion energy for five seconds in a giant donut shaped machine called a tokamak it was only enough to power one house for a day and more energy went into the process than came out of it yet it was a truly historic moment it proved that nuclear fusion was indeed possible to sustain on earth this was excellent news for the project in france the international thermonuclear experimental reactor better known as iter its main objective is to prove fusion can be utilized commercially if it can the world will have no use for fossil fuels like coal oil and gas the main drivers of the human made climate crisis there has been a huge sense of momentum at iter since the success in the uk but the people working on the project are also undergoing a major change their director general bernard bigot pronounced bi goh in french died from illness on may 14 after leading iter for seven years before his death bigot shared his infectious optimism for fusion energy from his sunny office which overlooked the shell of iterâ s own tokamak a sci fi like structure still under construction â energy is life â bigot said â biologically socially economically â when the earth was populated by less than a billion people there were enough renewable sources to meet demand bigot said â not anymore not since the industrial revolution and the following population explosion so we embraced fossil fuels and did a lot of harm to our environment and here we are now 8 billion strong and in the middle of a drastic climate crisis â he said â there is no alternative but to wean ourselves off our current main power source â he said â and the best option seems to be the one the universe has been utilizing for billions of years â mimicking the sun fusion energy is created by forcing together two particles that by nature repel after a small amount of fuel is injected into the tokamak giant magnets are activated to create a plasma the fourth state of matter which is a bit like a gas or soup that is electrically charged by raising temperatures inside the tokamak to unfathomably high levels the particles from the fuel are forced to fuse into one the process creates helium and neutrons â which are lighter in mass than the parts they were originally made of the missing mass converts to an enormous amount of energy the neutrons which are able to escape the plasma then hit a â blanketâ lining the walls of the tokamak and their kinetic energy transfers as heat that heat can be used to warm water create steam and turn turbines to generate power this all requires the tokamak to contain serious heat the plasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees celsius 10 times hotter than the core of the sun it begs the question how can anything on earth hold such high temperatures itâ s one of many hurdles that generations of fusion energy seekers have managed to overcome scientists and engineers designed giant magnets to create a strong magnetic field to keep the heat bottled up anything else would simply melt what those working on fusion have been trying to do inside their machines is essentially replicate the sun the sun is a perpetual fusion factory made up of a gigantic burning ball of plasma it fuses several hundred tons of hydrogen into helium each second plasma is the stuff 99 9 of the universe is made of including the stars our sun and all interstellar matter down here on earth for instance itâ s used in televisions and neon lights and we can see it in lightning and the aurora as awesome as that all sounds generating fusion energy in itself isnâ t actually the hard part several experts at iter said humanity has been pulling off nuclear fusion reaction ever since the invention of the h bomb after all the main challenge is sustaining it the tokamak in the uk â called the joint european torus or jet â held fusion energy for five seconds but thatâ s simply the longest that machine will go for its magnets were made of copper and were built in the 1970s any more than five seconds under such heat would cause them to melt iter uses newer magnets that can last much longer and the project aims to produce a 10 fold return on energy generating 500 megawatts from an input of 50 megawatts but iterâ s goal isnâ t to actually use the energy for power but to prove that it can sustain fusion energy for much longer than jet was able to success here will mean commercial scale machines can start generating fusion in the future while the sun fuses hydrogen atoms to create helium the jet project used two hydrogen isotopes called deuterium and tritium which iter will also use these isotopes behave almost identically to hydrogen in terms of their chemical makeup and reactions both deuterium and tritium are found in nature deuterium is abundant in both fresh and saltwater â the deuterium from just 500 milliliters of water with a little tritium could power a house for a year tritium is rare but it can be synthetically produced at the moment only 20 kilograms of it exist in the world and demand amounts to no more than 400 grams per year but at a yield of 8 million to 1 only tiny amounts of both elements are required to generate a lot of fusion energy tritium is an exceptionally pricey substance a single gram is currently worth around 30 000 should nuclear fusion take off demand will go through the roof presenting the worldâ s fusion masters with yet another challenge a 10 million part project from afar iter looks like a project ready to go from up close itâ s clear itâ s still a ways off the construction â across 39 building sites â is incredibly complex the main worksite is a markedly sterile environment where tremendous components are being put into place with the help of 750 ton cranes workers have already put together the shell of the tokamak but they are still awaiting some parts including a giant magnet from russia that will sit at the top of the machine the dimensions are mind blowing the tokamak will ultimately weigh 23 000 tons thatâ s the combined weight of three eiffel towers it will comprise a million components further differing into no fewer than 10 million smaller parts this powerful behemoth will be surrounded by some of the largest magnets ever created their staggering size â some of them have diameters of up to 24 meters â means they are are too large to transport and must be assembled on site in a giant hall given the huge number of parts involved thereâ s simply no room for error even the digital design of this enormous machine sits across 3d computer files that take up more than two terabytes of drive space thatâ s the same amount of space you could save more than 160 million one page word documents on wartime nuclear fusion behind hundreds of workers putting the iter project together are around 4 500 companies with 15 000 employees from all over the globe thirty five countries are collaborating on iter which is run by seven main members â china the united states the european union russia india japan and south korea it looks a little like the un security council though the late bigot among others have tried hard to keep geopolitics out of iter entirely but as russia seeks to redraw europeâ s map with its war in ukraine and even challenge the post war world order there are concerns over the countryâ s continued role in iter and just as many over its potential exclusion russia has been cut out of a number of other international scientific projects in the fallout of its war but the european commission has explicitly made an exception for iter in its sanctions part of this is because russia is inextricably linked with not only the project but fusion energy historically countries began seeking fusion energy in the 1930s building all sorts of machines over decades but it was the tokamak created in the soviet union that proved most successful in 1968 soviet researchers made a huge fusion breakthrough â they were able to achieve the high temperatures required and contain the plasma for a sustained period which had never been done before the tokamak became the machine to replicate even the word tokamak â a portmanteau for â toroidal magnetic confinementâ â is from the russian language russia has also provided some of the most critical elements of the iter project and is one of its main funders the magnet for the top of the tokamak for example was made in st petersburg and waits there ready to be sent to france said iterâ s head of communications laban coblentz so far russiaâ s involvement in the project hasnâ t changed in any way he said iter is really a child of the cold war â coblentz said â it s a deliberate collaboration by countries that are ideologically unaligned who simply share a common goal for a better future â he pointed out that the seven main members have been through many tense events since iterâ s conception in 1985 â before anything around the latest russia circumstances that has to date never affected the collaborative spirit i think it is not an exaggeration to say that iter is a project of peace â he said but coblentz conceded that the war in ukraine was â unprecedentedâ and that he couldnâ t predict what it might mean for russia s future in iter â something that will be a delicate issue for the next director general part of bigotâ s job was to coordinate the seven main members and their often differing views on the handling of various political ideological and economic issues when asked before russiaâ s invasion of ukraine whether managing these differences got challenging bigot gave a wry smile â now that is truly no small feat â he said â but our joint commitment remains as strong as ever i can say that from the beginning of my involvement with the project daily politics has had virtually no impact on our endeavors â he said â each of the partners seems quite aware dropping the ball could easily mean the demise of the entire project this of course is a tremendous responsibility â geopolitics has always played a role in iter just finding the right location for it took years and involved more than a decade of technical studies political bargaining and diplomatic fine tuning franceâ s saint paul lez durance was finally made the official site in 2005 at a meeting in moscow and the agreement on construction was signed in paris a year after as the diplomacy and technology fell in step building began in 2010 the foundations were laid and in 2014 the first construction machines were switched on time is running out the scale and ambition of the iter project may seem enormous but it is at the very least a proportional response to the mess humans have made of the planet since 1973 global energy usage has more than doubled by the end of the century it might actually triple seventy percent of all carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere are created through humansâ energy consumption and 80 of all the energy we consume is derived from fossil fuels now the earth is barreling toward levels of warming that translate into more frequent and deadly heat waves famine inducing droughts wildfires floods and rising sea levels the impacts of the climate crisis are getting harder and harder to reverse as entire ecosystems reach tipping points and more human lives are put on the line the world is now scrambling to rapidly decarbonize and speed up its transition from planet baking fossil fuels to renewable energy like solar wind and hydropower some countries are banking on nuclear fission energy which is low carbon but comes with a small but not negligible risk of disaster storage problems for radioactive waste and a high cost but there are serious questions about whether the world can make this green transition fast enough to avert catastrophic climate change thatâ s where fusion could be an 11th hour hero â if the world masters it in time when the late physicist stephen hawking was asked by time in 2010 which scientific discovery he would like to see in his lifetime he pointed to exactly this process â i would like nuclear fusion to become a practical power source â he said â it would provide an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming â a new era the experts working on nuclear fusion have overcome enormous challenges already and so many including bigot dedicated their entire careers to it and never saw it come into practical use now commercial businesses are preparing to generate and sell fusion energy so optimistic they are that this energy of the future could come online by mid century but as ever with nuclear fusion as one challenge is overcome another seems to crop up the limited stocks and price of tritium is one so iter is trying to produce its own on that front the outlook isnâ t bad the blanket within the tokamak will be coated with lithium and as escaped plasma neutrons reach it they will react with the lithium to create more tritium fuel time and money are always concerns for big projects but â bigâ doesnâ t even begin to describe the scale of iter which is truly one of the worldâ s largest and most ambitious international energy collaborations in history one day s delay costs about a million euros bigot said the european union is footing 45 of the project s ever mounting construction costs all the other participant countries are contributing a little over 9 each by rough estimations initially the entire construction was estimated at around 6 billion euros 6 4 billion right now the total has more than tripled to around 20 billion euros the 2001 predictions envisioned the first batch of plasma being produced in 2016 another missed goal some observers had considered the project dead in the water but after bigot took the helm the project was streamlined and got back on track bigot had a reputation as a micromanager coblentz said but thatâ s exactly what was needed to get this complicated project in order â when you got here his car was in place at 7 a m and often here until 9 or 10 p m at night â coblentz said â so you always had the impression that no detail was too large or too small for him to take seriously and be involved in â though under his leadership expectations and deadlines were also revised to be more realistic first plasma is now expected in 2025 and the first deuterium

this excellent book belongs to a species that is too seldom met with in american literature the english produce almost innumerable examples and many good ones there is no place in the empire so remote that it has n t its illuminating volume soberly documented and bemapped and with all in it that is worth knowing about the politics sorceries and table manners of the local brown brothers our own agents of the enlightenment seem to be far less literate than their british colleagues most of them i dare say can read and write after a fashion but what they write is buried in government files thus we know less about the indians within our own borders than the average curious englishman knows about the tibetans the marquesas islanders and the swahili the cheap magazines and the movies simply caricature them what one hears about them in the newspapers is only to the effect that they have sold more oil lands and are drinking again mr crane when he became an indian agent brought a novel equipment to his office he was by occupation an attaché of the indian bureau in washington but he was by vocation a literary gentleman and one of very considerable skill his short stories were in all the magazines he was a rising young man it was ill health that took him into the field and when he got there it combined with a burden of harsh and unaccustomed duties to paralyze his pen for a decade he wrote scarcely anything but then restored to health and with an immense stock of fresh and vivid impressions he took to writing again and here are the first fruits of his new activity they take the form of a book that is at once a valuable record and a sort of poem it describes one indian people the hopis at length realistically and without sentimentalizing but it throws about them a glow that reflects the author s delight in them and in the gorgeous desert that is their home no better picture of that desert is to be found in american literature tourists whirl through it on express trains the plain people see it only in the monotone of the movies mr crane for years on years battled for life with its eternal rocks and sands he makes it brilliantly real and he somehow makes it romantic its blinding colors are in his narrative and its immense silences and its baking heats and bitter colds here for the first lime thither arizona begins to exist the book is charmingly written it avoids laborious details it is a panorama of beautiful things and a narrative of hard and useful work done in a lonely place without thanks and against depressing difficulties h l mencken
inflation has gradually become a buzzword in business and economic circles since 2021 in april the year on year growth rates of the consumer price index cpi and producer price index ppi in the united states rose 8 3 percent and 11 0 percent respectively right now the us cpi and ppi are still at four decade high levels europe is even worse in terms of inflation as european union member states face energy shortages and geopolitical tensions triggered by the russia ukraine conflict a combination of factors has contributed to the high inflation rates including policy factors supply issues and geopolitics to name just a few after the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic in late 2019 many countries adopted expansionary monetary and fiscal policies take the us as an example government departments launched a series of stimulus policies including both monetary and fiscal policies in response to covid 19 in march 2020 the year on year growth rate of the broad money supply m2 rose from 6 7 percent to 10 2 percent reaching a peak of 26 9 percent in february 2021 in addition the federal reserve board has also stimulated the economy through reducing interest rates and practicing quantitative easing in terms of fiscal policy the us government also introduced a series of stimulus programs by early 2021 a number of fiscal stimulus policies were in place and paved the way for inflation these programs involved a total amount of some 5 trillion which was almost equal to a quarter of the us gdp in 2020 this is a striking stimulus program when we compare it to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 2008 at that time the obama administration s fiscal stimulus policy stood at around 787 billion which amounted to 5 4 percent of the us gdp in 2008 there is no doubt that us monetary and fiscal policies and the accompanying tremendous liquidity are very important causes of inflation in the us and the world as well other developed countries have also adopted similar stimulus policies the money supply grew at a peak rate of 12 4 percent in the eurozone in january 2021 another factor that must be kept in mind is the russia ukraine conflict as it can lead to potential energy shortages which further exacerbate inflation in the eu as can be seen from statistics the eu s ppi was as high as 31 5 percent and 36 8 percent in march and april 2022 even the cpi which rose relatively slower reached 7 4 percent in april japan also adopted an extremely expansionary monetary policy even in april when the us and other countries began to raise their interest rates the bank of japan still stuck to an expansionary monetary policy to achieve an expansionary effect the boj continues to buy government bonds in order to suppress the interest rates of japanese government bonds thus injecting more liquidity into the market in short the expansionary monetary policies of the world s major developed countries are an important reason for the current global inflation the disruption of supply chains caused by covid 19 is another important reason for global inflation at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic many countries around the world held a wait and see attitude which led to even more serious spread of the contagion the spread of the virus led to the cessation of production in some areas and subsequent serious shortages of supplies that said the labor shortages caused supply shocks when demand recovers quickly but supply recovers more slowly inflation occurs covid 19 has also led to chaos in transportation services with rising freight prices and tight capacity and this phenomenon has also pushed up global inflation the russia ukraine conflict that broke out in february is exacerbating the problem of global inflation the conflict directly leads to global energy jitters nymex crude oil was 95 72 per barrel on feb 28 just as the hostilities began on march 7 the price rose to 130 50 per barrel which is the highest level since august 2008 for us cpi data the sub item energy fuel electricity and gasoline prices rose by as much as 32 0 percent and 30 3 percent year on year in march and april another sub item transportation increased 22 6 percent and 19 9 percent respectively the russia ukraine conflict has had an impact on minerals and agricultural products since the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict prices of aluminum nickel and copper have risen significantly as an important food producing region in the world ukraine s agricultural production and exports have also been greatly affected global supplies of wheat sunflower oil and other agricultural products have been seriously disrupted food prices are also an important part of the cpi and the russia ukraine conflict has undoubtedly contributed to the rise of global food prices in china covid 19 is increasingly coming under better control because of appropriate prevention policies the industrial chain operates regularly and the supply shock is relatively muted compared with other countries in 2020 and 2021 the value of foreign direct investment fdi inflows to china was 163 billion and 173 billion respectively foreign capital flowed into china to take advantage of its potential these fdi statistics reflect the stable business environment in china and how foreign companies vote with their money and strategies as the world s factory chinese plants need to import many raw materials such as oil copper iron ore and so on in fact many chinese manufacturing enterprises also face problems of rising costs this can be seen in ppi and cpi figures in other words because ppi growth always represents upstream activity so when the ppi growth rate is higher than the cpi growth rate the downstream manufacturing enterprises will see weaker profits this phenomenon is occurring in china the chinese government also adopted expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in 2020 however when compared with other countries china s policies were relatively mild actually the growth rate of the m2 hit a peak of 11 1 percent in may and june 2020 and began to decrease gradually after that time in comparison with the us and eu china s cpi and ppi are relatively low in april china s cpi growth was 2 1 percent although the ppi s growth rate was still high at 8 0 percent this can be seen as the result of the growing price of global commodities to a greater extent on the whole the chinese government has been doing well in controlling inflation china does not export inflation in contrast china is playing a positive role in reducing global inflation and stabilizing global prices the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily the writers are zhou xuezhi assistant research fellow of the institute of world economics and politics chinese

macaulay s famous chapter on the state of england in the latter part of the seventeenth century was written with the object of placing before the english of the nineteenth century a true picture of the life of their ancestors but able and entertaining as it is it cannot be accepted as an adequate fulfillment of this purpose no description of manners customs and ideas dissociated from the personalities to which they adhered will constitute a picture of life when thus presented they lack the vitalizing property which gave them their essential significance they strike us as curiosities rather than as characteristics for the underlying identity of human nature is left unrevealed to get a vivid conception of the life of a people remote from us in time or space we must have a full portrayal of some typical lives must see not only the conditions of existence but its inner workings mere antiquarianism does nothing for us here nor can history when it keeps within its proper limits supply the need for it deals with the play of world forces and dominating influences with individuals in their public capacities and with a people in its collective concerns and activities even imaginative literature fails to meet the exact requirements it goes as much too far beyond the scope as history falls short of it it masks the real with a fictitious world it transfigures and embellishes its pictures however true in essentials are composed in accordance with æsthetic principles and have the gratification of the æsthetic sense as their ultimate object it palters with us in a double sense giving to reality the effect of illusion and to illusion the effect of reality in a word it is art an art which does mend nature change it rather and for the purpose in view we prefer with perdita the products of great creating nature in their rude simplicity the one sufficient medium of the revelation we are seeking for is biography or rather the material of biography the correspondence the diaries the authentic record in whatever form in which character betrays itself unconsciously and its concomitants present themselves incidentally neither being exhibited of set purpose or with any ulterior aim this alone corresponds to and supplies the place of personal observation and experience in regard to the complex of activities and relations that constitutes life here there is no cicerone to distract us with his explanations no allegorist to beguile us with his interpretations we are left free to study and gain insight for ourselves and how quickly do we become accustomed to these new surroundings how soon is the sense of difference lost in the recognition of an essential identity strangeness curiosity repugnance are succeeded by familiarity comprehension sympathy and if the interest awakened be less intense less exalted than the drama or the novel is capable of inspiring it has the poignancy peculiar to emotions excited by immediate presence and contact revelations of this kind are unfortunately rare accident alone has generally preserved such material as lack of appreciation consigned to destruction exactly the reverse of what has usually been the case with artistic productions posterity will apparently have little cause to complain of our course in this respect except perhaps as over zealous and indiscriminative in handing in our documents but it was the eighteenth century the age of dormant imagination and lively curiosity which gave the first impetus in this direction it was then that biography was first elaborated and raised to the dignity of a distinct branch of literature and that contemporaneous private letters journals and ana were carefully husbanded and collected for publication it was then also that the archives of earlier periods began to be ransacked with the same object and that long forgotten records leaped to life and gave up secrets unsuspected or unvalued by previous explorers the most important of these contributions to the knowledge of a bygone time were the paston letters giving the self delineation of a family circle and group of neighbors during the wars of the roses made vivid by minute detail and unreserved utterance and rendered more striking by the inclusion of some figures which history and shakespeare had depicted under a semi mythical aspect in singular contrast with the realism of these inartistic disclosures and now we have presented to us a similar collection relating to a later period of civil strife another little ark floating safely on the billows and carrying a not less precious freight if the paston letters have a higher value from the historical point of view this is only because the events of the fifteenth century are more obscure than those of the seventeenth so that all the side lights thrown upon them are doubly welcome the information of this kind given in the verney papers is even more abundant but it is less indispensable copious details of private life and manners are to be found in both collections but the greater urbanity of the later period the general superiority of the verneys to the pastons in the finer traits of character and the deeper interest which attaches to the personal fortunes of several of them lend a charm to the story which is conspicuously lacking in the earlier publication in the present case it is true we have only selections from an enormous mass of material interwoven with an explanatory narrative but they embody apparently all that was necessary to give both the lights and the shades of the picture and they are reproduced in their original garb as far as regards the spelling which being in most instances purely phonetic not only represents a vast variety of discarded forms but affords information as to the prevalent modes of pronunciation lady verney who spent the last invalid years of her life in assorting deciphering and editing this correspondence was fitted for the task by her studious and critical habit of mind and her proved literary ability not less than by her loving interest in the scenes and personages of what may be called a domestic episode in a great historical drama the manor house of claydon buckinghamshire the home of the verneys during several centuries has been so transmogrified by additions and alterations that only the form of the building erected in the reign of henry vii can now be traced but thirty years ago a portion of it still intact furnished a curious example of the ancient disregard or ignorance of what seem to us the simplest and most obvious methods of arrangement in the construction of a dwelling house this central narrow part joining two wider blocks consisted of two rows of rooms back to back with no passage except through each entire suite none of the walls were at right angles the floors rose and fell again in the same room to a difference of three or four inches in the same level it was like walking over a ridge in a ploughed field the ampler wings may be supposed to have been more conveniently planned there would seem at all events to have been no lack of the adjuncts and appurtenances rendered necessary by the conditions of housekeeping in ages when a large establishment was chiefly dependent on itself for all that it consumed and concentrated in its buildings and grounds occupations that are now distributed over a wide population the mill house the slaughter house the blacksmiths carpenters and painters shops the malting and brew house the wood yard full of large and small timber the sawpit the outhouses full of all sorts of odds and ends of stone iron bits of marble carved woodwork and logs cut for burning the riding house the laundry the dairy with a large churn turned by a horse the stalls and styes the apple and root chambers the dovecotes and fish ponds were as necessary complements of the fields the pastures and the woodlands as the barns the cattle and the farming implements the weaving was carried on in the cottages of the village but within the great house itself there were incessant spinning of wool and flax embroidering distilling preserving conserving candying making syrups jellies beautifying washes pomatum essences and other such secrets in addition to the more commonplace labor of the cooks the seamstresses and a host of man servants and maid servants storerooms and closets were filled with the accumulated products of household industry and the gowns and other articles of female apparel the sheets and bed furniture in general were too costly and too durable lightly to be cast aside and usually descended by special bequest from one generation to another one may say indeed in general that most of the earliest appliances of comfort were necessarily of the nature of luxury or ornament fur was worn before corduroy and velvet before cotton and the walls of rooms wore wainscoted or tapestried before the cheaper inventions of plastering and papering were applied to them one feature now entirely obsolete of many old english mansions was discovered at claydon when repairs were making thirty years ago in the central chimney was a hiding place the existence of which being known as usual only to the successive heirs of the property had been in time forgotten it was a dark chamber capable of containing ten men standing upright masked by a blind passage in the middle story and communicating by a secret stairway and concealed door with the muniment room at the top of the house the latter apartment a wainscoted gallery forty feet long was the receptacle of deeds charters rent rolls and similar documents early editions of plays copies of the manuscript newes letters which preceded the printed newspaper and piles of correspondence which some unknown utilitarian investigator had labeled private letters of no value but which a later and more discerning student was to appreciate more truly and render a source of profit and pleasure to the world as well as to herself the genealogy of the verneys goes back to the reign of king john but first comes under distinct notice in the person of sir ralph verney the purchaser of claydon who was a merchant of london and lord mayor in 1465 this connection of the family with civic life and dignity seems however to have been merely temporary and accidental its normal position was that of the country gentry the class which after the wars of the roses and the policy of the tudors had thinned the ranks and crippled the power of the nobility may be said to have constituted the backbone of the nation down to a recent period and which nowhere shows to such advantage as in the history of the long struggle that ended in the overthrow of the stuarts the verneys bore no conspicuous part in that contest but it happens that in their case we have at once an excellent example of the typical qualities of their class and a striking illustration of that conflict of sentiments and principles of opposing claims and duties which in every great crisis of this nature brings into play a cross current more trying to those who are caught in it sometimes exciting a closer personal sympathy in those who watch the eddies it creates than the broad and direct stream of influences and results it is true that for the mass of the nation and of the upper classes especially a long experience of arbitrary encroachments was needed before the intense loyalty developed under the skillful rule and popular prestige of elizabeth and her ministers gave way to a determined spirit of resistance but those who took the lead in this revolt the eliots pyms hampdens and others had no such relations with the court as involved any wrench of personal affections or the solution of any questions of the private conscience before deciding on their course even among the ranks of the nobility there were not many who found themselves in this dilemma and falkland who has been usually regarded as the most striking and pathetic example of the miseries of such a position was the victim of the weakness of his nature rather than of the strength of his principles a more typical and illustrative instance is to be found in the career of sir edmund verney knight marshal and standard bearer of charles i and from early youth one of his constant personal attendants both at home and abroad but also the head of a house which by all its affinities of station kinship and sentiment seemed to be committed to the support of the parliamentary cause in sir edmund s own character there was a mingling of the two strains which viewed in the perspective of history represent for us the totally opposite qualities and tendencies of cavalier and puritan although their incompatibility did not become apparent until the actual rupture took place looking at him under one aspect one might describe him briefly by the simple but emphatic old designation a gallant gentleman conspicuously brave honorable and warm hearted with a natural gayety of temperament a sanguine disposition and an inclination to profuse expenditure not unbefitting his position but tending to encumber bis estate he was popular both as a courtier and as a landlord and beloved by his family his friends and his dependents we find him constantly applied to for favors and good offices while never soliciting any for himself he does not petition the king for places or for emoluments but on the contrary lends him a thousand pounds on very poor security he is overwhelmed with commissions from his country neighbors the letters asking assistance of all kinds from all sorts of men fill whole portfolios in particular friends of every degree appeal to him to find husbands and wives for their sons and daughters he was no doubt ready and active in meeting all such demands but his native goodness of heart is best evinced by his interest in the affairs of his cottagers and farmers and his prompt attention to their needs and requests in response to an application from one of them respecting some ash wood he writes to his steward the poore old man offers to pay for it tell him i cannot weight to him now but that i have sent to you to lett him have that wood or any other wood to keepe him from coulde all these traits were such as the spirit of an older time when presented in its ideals and its best examples had fostered and developed what had gone on in recent years was not a rooting up of the old stock but a sedulous grafting upon it a stricter code of morals a simpler but sterner creed a ritual from which all that was thought to savor of superstition and idolatry was banished and the conviction that not only purity of life and of faith but the independence of england and the liberties of her people were bound up with the maintenance of the protestant religion these formed an accumulated heritage of belief and practice acquired by the valor and resolution of several generations and still needing to be guarded against open or insidious aggressions but courtly manners and festive celebrations gay apparel flowing hair and joyful countenances had not yet been discarded by those who held these principles and the natural tendency of a peaceable development would have been towards a completer blending of what now appear to us irreconcilable characteristics of two different eras there could be no better representative of the type of character formed under these influences before they were forced into opposite directions than the simple hearted knight sir edmund verney who is described in lloyd s memorials as one of the strictness and piety of a puritan of the charity of a papist of the civility of an englishman whose family the king his master would say was the model lie would propose to the gentlemen whose carriage was such that he was called the only courtier that was not complained of so long as peace remained unbroken such a man as this could pursue the even tenor of his way giving his silent votes in the commons in accordance with his honest convictions while performing his functions in the ceremonials of the court without misgivings as to his own consistency or the ultimate healing of the breach between the parliament and the king even a deeper vision might not have apprehended that the innovations or revivals of laud call them whichever we may or think of them however we will had driven a wedge into the social system which could not fail to split and rend it into discordant fractions in this as in all such cases the first clear perception of the situation came with the suddenness of a surprise to those who had been most active in bringing it about even the appeal to arms was made with almost equal confidence on each side that the bulk of the nation would rally to its support and that the struggle would be short and the victory speedy and complete in this temper the parliament proceeded to organize an army by such methods as could be devised for the occasion while charles following the precedents and traditions of feudal chivalry prepared to set up his standard and summoned his knight marshal to bear his appropriate part in the ceremony here then was the great problem of the time pointing itself at poor sir edmund and demanding an immediate solution to disobey was to desert his king and master in the hour of need and peril and to disown the obligations of his office to comply was to abandon the friends to whom he was most attached to separate himself from his eldest and best loved son who had for years been his stay and support the chief manager of his affairs and his colleague in parliament worst of all to draw his sword against a cause which he believed in his soul to be just and right never surely was an honest and guileless soul with no motives of self interest to throw into the scales confronted with a crueler choice of alternatives that he was as described in a letter of this period a most sade man we can well believe but his decision was not long delayed nor was it other than might have been expected with such a nature the point of honor must perforce override all other considerations in a conversation with hyde reported by the latter in his life he said in answer to an exhortation to assume a more cheerful demeanor my condition is much worse than yours and different i believe from any other man s and will well justify the raelancholick that i confess to you possesses me you have satisfaction in your conscience that you are in the right that the king ought not to grant what is required of him and so you do your duty and your business together but for my part i do not like the quarrel and do heartily wish that the king would yield and consent to what they desire so that my conscience is only concerned in honour and gratitude to follow ray master i have eaten his bread and served him near thirty years and will not do so base a thing as to forsake him and choose rather to lose my life which i am sure i shall do to defend and preserve those things which are against my conscience to preserve and defend for i will deal freely with you i have no reverence for the bishops for whom this quarrel subsists there was in truth as he well saw but one escape from the false position in which he had become innocently or inadvertently entangled to do his devoir as became a true knight and seek deliverance in the only way still open to him his not to reason why but only to do and die the opportunity was not long in coming two months later at edgehill he took his station in front of the centre of the royal army and when the line was broken and he was surrounded by assailants refused to yield holding the standard erect to the last and leaving it is reported his lopped off hand clinging tightly to the staff when it was captured with his lifeless body his successor sir ralph known to students of history by his notes of the debates in the long parliament was no unworthy scion of the stock but while generous helpful and affectionate trustworthy in all his dealings and almost painfully scrupulous in adherence to principle he had a different temperament from his father s better balanced perhaps but less engaging an excellent man of business and methodical in all his habits he was naturally somewhat formal and a little given to copious and ornate phraseology on occasions when one would have wished for the simplest and most direct utterance of emotions which were not the less evidently deep and sincere having taken his stand from the first on the side of the parliament with no counter engagements to violate in doing so he might have been expected to go forward in happy freedom from any inward embarrassments or perplexities but this was not to be within a year after his father s death he too found himself caught in the meshes of a case of conscience the house of commons having voted to adopt the scottish covenant all the members were required to sign it under penalty of the sequestration of their estates sir ralph was one of the few who were unwilling to consent to the change in the form of church government which this measure involved a short term of grace was allowed to those who absented themselves at the appointed time and the arguments and persuasions employed in the interval were effectual with most of them nor is it probable that the ruin which threatened them in case of non compliance was the chief motive in inducing their submission a far stronger consideration was the anomalous and as it might well seem unworthy and unjustifiable position in which they would place themselves by separating from their party on grounds that did not allow of their passing over to the opposite camp and thus remaining useless and idle at a time when it behooved every man to be active and earnest even in ordinary political contests we know how the man is looked upon who takes this course open desertion to the enemy being much less unfavorably viewed in a crisis involving the safety of the country the very existence of the common weal such a position is tenfold more invidious the case is well put in a letter to sir ralph from his cousin henry parker in these publicke divisions where religion and liberty are indangered all men ought to adhere to that cause which is dictated to them to be ye better and ye more harmless by ye light of nature and the most forcible indications of reason no man can say that god has left him no part to act nor no station to make good and if some poor mechanick might plead himself to bee wholly unusefull and inconsiderable in these grand cases yet you are apparently berreft of such excuses you have an account to make to god to y country to yr freinds to yrselfe and yr charge of that account wilbee high and valuable and to thinke that you can exonerate all by saying you were dubious and not satisfied in all particulars is most strange tis impossible yt you should bee equilibrious in ye maine or in ye generality of yr controversye and if ether scale have but one od grayne in it to sway you you are as much bounde to obey that sway as he is that has ye strongest propension of judgment but sir ralph though he professed to entertain a very humble estimation of himself and a strong desire to be guided by better judgments was the last man to yield to any reasoning which demanded the sacrifice of a single private scruple and he came to the conclusion to escape from the pressure of solicitations and appeals which he could meet only with a formulated declaration of the claims of conscience i have resolved he wrote to take a jorney and for a while to retire to some such place where i may have leasure enough to informe my judgment in such things wherein i am yet doubtinge he had in fact determined to go into exile accordingly having made such arrangements as were feasible in regard to his affairs and taking with him his wife and two of his children he removed to france settling first at rouen and afterwards at blois and passing many tedious years of inactivity and anxiety before he was permitted to return to his beloved home and familiar occupations some brief mention must be made of sir edmund s other sons the one who was named after his father had inherited his simple and gallant spirit and having already served in the army responded with ardor and unquestioning loyalty to the call of his sovereign when he learned that ralph was taking the other side he was as much shocked and grieved as if he had been wholly ignorant which indeed is not unlikely to have been the case of the causes of the war and the temper of the times i beseech you he wrote consider that majesty is sacred god sayth touch not myne anointed it troubled davyd that he cutt but the lapp of saul s garment but when this letter and others remained unanswered the fear that his brother was offended and that their fraternal relations were in danger of being severed led him to write again in this nobler strain i beseech you let not our unfortunate silence breede the least distrust of each other s affections although i would willingly loose my right hand that you had gone the other way yet i will never consent that this dispute shall make a quarrell between us there be too many to fight with besides ourselves though i am tooth and nayle for the king s cause and shall endure soe to the death whatsoever his fortune be yet sweete brother let not this my opinion for it is guyded by my conscience nor any report which you can heare of me cause a diffidence of my true love to you the fate of this fine young fellow is one of the saddest incidents in tire family history most of his years of warfare were spent in ireland amid distractions and miseries far exceeding those that befell england there almost at the outset of his career he had fought against the rebels who were carrying slaughter and devastation throughout the country and there he lost his life in the dreadful massacre at drogheda ordered by cromwell in reprisal for those barbarities in strange contrast with these two brothers were harry and tom the former did some scanty fighting for the king with apparently equal willingness to do as much and as little for the parliament the only contests in which he took any strong personal interest being those of the race course when ralph was in his throes of conscience about the covenant harry urged him in the sporting phrase of the times to take the pitt one way or other adding the wise assurance which was true in a deeper sense than he conceived that non will be in soe sad a condition as those that stand newters but a more conspicuous instance of the variety of character that distinguished the verneys was tom the scapegrace of the family and as amusing a specimen of the tribe as any that thackeray or trollope has depicted in his own conception he was a gifted and glorious creature high mettled and adventurous yet profoundly sagacious and practical he started in life with full confidence in his ability to win fortune and distinction in some enterprising career if only the necessary equipment were provided many in fact were the outfits successively furnished not with any belief in his vaunted powers of achievement nor yet as might be suspected in the hope of getting rid of him forever but whether as a planter in virginia and barbadoes a soldier of fortune in france and sweden or in any other capacity and field of action he gained nothing but experience which as in all such cases proved an utterly valueless acquisition the outbreak of the civil war might have been expected to give a decisive and corrective impulse to this bold but eccentric spirit it was not however till several months after the summons had gone forth that he made a pompous announcement to ralph of his purpose to take the field my full resolution is to goe down to the king s army about wednesday next and there to proffer my service to his majesty which i hope will not only be accepted of but it may if it shall pleas god to spare mee my life be a fortune for me for ever now i am noways able to goe unless you will be pleased either to lend me a hors or to give me a hors ralph would seem to have supplied the hors without any painful scruples about sending this reinforcement to the enemy s army not expecting it perhaps to have any momentous results if so he judged rightly a few weeks later tom had been brought back to london a prisoner and was writing from the fleet in his most magniloquent vein for what i have hitherto done i will maintaine with my life that it is warrantable with this respect that i did alwayes maintaine that true protestant religion which my father bred and brought me up in next the king s prerogative then the liberty of the subject and last of all the just privileges of parliament with so broad a platform of principles a prowess so redoubtable and an adherence to the first law of nature which was never at fault tom was pretty sure to steer his way victoriously through all the troubles of the time and we are not surprised to hear that despite the varied perils of his vagabond existence including several marriages he outlived all the rest of the large brood dying triumphantly in 1707 at the age of ninety two the women of the family with one exception are it must be confessed its least interesting members good dame margaret sir edmund s wife lived quietly at claydon bearing many children superintending her household with patient care and diligence and happily for herself ending her days in 1641 unclouded by the shadow of fast approaching calamities of her six daughters it is sufficient to say that they were all fairly successful in making maches suitable to their rank and means and that even the youngest two or three who growing up in a double orphanage at claydon while the place was in possession of the soldiery contracted hoidenish manners and somewhat perverse dispositions were thoroughly practical in their sentiments regarding the main object of feminine ambition but the coarser features thus exhibited are far more than redeemed by the characteristics of another figure which is brought out in fuller relief with a charm which the bare outline that can here be given will at the best serve only to suggest mary blacknall left in childhood an orphan and an heiress was privately married when only thirteen to ralph verney then less than sixteen with the view apparently on the part of her guardians of saving her from the pursuit of rival fortune hunters who were already becoming assiduous in their attentions two years later she became an inmate of claydon her youthful husband being then a student at oxford but making frequent visits to his girl bride and winning a love the ardor and depth of which are among the strongest tributes to his own good qualities while still better evidences of the finer and intenser nature from which they sprang the sweetness of her disposition the archness and fun which led to her being dubbed mischiefe by those who most relished her playful vivacity the disregard of self which caused her husband to remark that she never remembered her own claims and the ready and active sympathy on which every one could count from sir edmund and dame margaret to harry and tom endeared her to the whole household with one or another of whom she is sweetest comfort sweetest sister or deare heart whenever she is mentioned in the dark days that ensued her character shone forth as was natural with added force and lustre it does not appear what her own views if she had any may have been in regard to the point on which her husband separated from his party and sacrificed his interests it was sufficient for her that his course was dictated by his conscience and she accepted it and all the consequences it entailed without a word of remonstrance or complaint it was ralph himself as he afterwards confessed who amid the trials and discomforts of exile gave vent to impatience and disgust while such was her goodnesse he writes that when i was most peevish she would be most patient and as if she meant to aire my frowardnesse and frequent follies by the company of her forbearance studied nothing more than a sweet compliance their chief means of support at this period was the income from her own estate which had been settled upon herself and when be proposed to encroach upon this source in order to meet some old claims on his father s property she wrote being then at a distance from him for my awne land i confess i should have been very glad to have kept enoughe of itt to have provided well for my toe yonger boyes and my gerll but if that cannot bee thou mayst as freely dispose of that as of myselfe nor is it only by her sweetness of temper and her disinterested spirit that this remarkable woman wins our admiration the fortitude and self devotion which we are wont to regard as the utmost reach or at least as the distinctive traits of feminine heroism were equaled in her case by a practical ability and active energy which in the very crisis of the family fortunes saved them from threatened ruin the sequestration of estates voted by the house of commons could not take effect without the concurrence of the lords and the question whether the mere absence of a member from his parliamentary duties should be held to constitute a case of delinquency had not been decided by the upper house this question was not brought to an issue till more than three years had passed when it was resolved to take up sir ralph verney s case as one by which it could be effectually tested in anticipation of this step lady verney went over to london in november 1646 to endeavor by enlisting the coöperation of friends by securing legal assistance and by solicitations in every quarter where the exertion of a favorable influence might be gained by address or purchased by gifts to bring the affair to a fortunate conclusion for this result two conditions were necessary first that the commons should be induced to refer the matter to the joint committee of the two houses and then that the committee should decide in sir ralph s favor no legislative log roller ever labored more strenuously than did lady verney in this protracted business but as if its incessant toils and fatigues with alternate encouragements and rebuffs were not sufficient to tax her powers of endurance she was herself besieged by applicants old creditors of the estate whose interest was in default and the brothers and sisters who had claims upon a portion of the revenues in the midst of this multiplicity of duties and annoyances she writes a long letter weekly to ralph and when he ungrateful man chides her for having failed to answer all those severall perticulers in regard to which he had sent her instructions or inquiries adding with the serene self satisfaction of an ever exact and punctilious correspondent had i but one letter to write a weeke i would not misse answering the least perticuler she administers this gentle rebuke truly i am confydent tis by chance if i miss ansering of every perticuler for i allwayes lay thy letters before me when i wright butt however when thou considerest how much i wright and how ill a scribe i am thou oughtest nott to be angry with me for forgetting now and then a little but far heavier trials than these were in reserve while the great object of her journey was still in suspense in an indifferent london lodging remote from all her family with no attendant but a newly hired maid she gave birth to another child her recovery was slow but as soon as she was able to be about she sent the child to claydon to be nursed in order that she might again give all her time to her husband s affairs a few months later both this infant and her little girl in france sickened and died and without any preparation she learned the two events simultaneously the effect of this double bereavement was for the moment overwhelming her physician who was also a kinsman and her ardent admirer wrote that she spake idly for two nights and sometimes did not know her friends her own first mention of the loss is in a brief postscript to a previously written letter to her husband since i writt this i have receaved ye sad nues of toe of our deare children s death which affliction joyned with being absent from thee is without god s great marcy to me a heavier burthen than can be borne by thine owne unhappy m whereupon ralph in a sort of fantastic desperation conceived the idea of taking himself off to turkey or some other remote land leaving his wife to recover and enjoy the estate and trusting that his own speedy death might end all these troubles and afflictions her reply is the last citation which need be made from this correspondence i confess i did believe thou badst hadd other thoughts of me then to think that i could brooke such a proposition noe my harte you must nott whilest i live have any such desighn withoute you resolve to take me along with you and then live in whatt parte of the world you most fancye itt is not the being intrusted with your estate can give me the least satisfaction if itt be nott posseble for me to finish your buseness i will leave itt to god s blessing and the honest dr s care truly this very notion of yours hath gone soe neare me that i have scarce had one nights rest since i receaved your letter i had enough upon me before and i prayse my god that he hath kept my harte from breaking all this while it cannot be for my good to be heare without thee nor for your advantage or our toe dear children s to have our small famylye divided in fower severall places to tell you truth i cannott be any longer from you therefore i am resollved to stand or fall with you and i begg of thee nott to lett this desighn any more enter into your thoughts i am nott able to say one word more but that at this time there is nott a sadder creature in the world then thine owne deare m at last the clouds broke and a gleam of joy visited these tortured hearts contrary to the expectation of all who had interested themselves in the matter a motion to refer the case to the committee brought in suddenly when the house was crowded in preparation for a debate on a more momentous affair passed without opposition and two weeks later in july 1647 the final decision was reached and the sequestration annulled there were still however so many arrangements to make at claydon and elsewhere that it was not till the following april that lady verney was able to rejoin her husband who judged it best to remain abroad until he should have saved enough to liquidate all the debts when he at last returned it was without the companion whose share of the common burden had been heavier than his own while her courage and sweetness had sustained his spirit when it fretted under the load or was ready to succumb neither labors and privations nor anxieties and griefs could subdue her finer but firmer and more elastic nature but her frailer physical powers were less capable of resistance in the year following her return to france she fell into a slow decline and in may 1650 she died at the early age of thirtyfour sir ralph survived her forty six years the greater portion of his long widowhood was spent in the home which her energy and tact had rescued from forfeiture he resumed his place as one of the principal landholders of his native county and sat in the successive parliaments of the later stuarts but it was not till after the glorious revolution that he saw the government established on the basis of those principles to which he had so long and so consistently adhered a policy proclaimed which he was free to support and a court set up at which he could seek favor and influence without tarnishing his good name his descendants continued to reign at claydon until early in the present century when the line ennobled in its later generations became extinct here then not of course in this meagre abstract but in the letters and narrations from which it has been drawn is a true picture of english life in the seventeenth century it embraces many figures besides those that have been mentioned and shows in full detail the peculiar features of the time to which it belongs but it bears also the deeper impress of humanity common to all times the persons are for the most part such as ordinary experience makes us familiar with while some of them may revive our recollection of the forces by which qualities are tested and actions impelled when national convulsions derange the relations and subordinate the motives of the regular course of life were there not in virginia in 1861 men who in an analogous position to that of sir edmund verney chose their part from a similar sentiment and perhaps with as sad a forecast did not many a gallant youth at the same period give his life like the younger edmund to a hopeless cause deeming it unimpeachable and sacred as for the harrys and the toms they in quiet or disturbed times are always with us sir ralph is styled by his biographer the very model of an english country gentleman and no doubt he had the virtues of his class but it is to be feared that many married ladies would be disposed to define him without any abatement for his tender conscience as merely a man and a husband just like the rest of them but the central figure on the canvas cannot be so lightly described or so easily paralleled the type is not profusely scattered and seldom meets us in the pages of biography several women of the seventeenth century have been enshrined as among the brightest ornaments of their sex but neither lucy hutchinson nor rachel russell nor margaret godolphin so far as known to us showed the same combination of charm and strength as mary verney such characters are more likely to avoid than to attract the notice of the world and the reader may be left to supply an instance from his private knowledge if he be so unfortunate as to discover no example there he must for this occasion acknowledge the ascendency of imaginative creation turn to the women of shakespeare real through a transcendent idealism and modern through their immortality and find a similar union of delicate and noble qualities in the playful mischievous generous tender and impassioned yet practical and politic portia john foster kirk

inflation has gradually become a buzzword in business and economic circles since 2021 in april the year on year growth rates of the consumer price index cpi and producer price index ppi in the united states rose 8 3 percent and 11 0 percent respectively right now the us cpi and ppi are still at four decade high levels europe is even worse in terms of inflation as european union member states face energy shortages and geopolitical tensions triggered by the russia ukraine conflict a combination of factors has contributed to the high inflation rates including policy factors supply issues and geopolitics to name just a few after the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic in late 2019 many countries adopted expansionary monetary and fiscal policies take the us as an example government departments launched a series of stimulus policies including both monetary and fiscal policies in response to covid 19 in march 2020 the year on year growth rate of the broad money supply m2 rose from 6 7 percent to 10 2 percent reaching a peak of 26 9 percent in february 2021 in addition the federal reserve board has also stimulated the economy through reducing interest rates and practicing quantitative easing in terms of fiscal policy the us government also introduced a series of stimulus programs by early 2021 a number of fiscal stimulus policies were in place and paved the way for inflation these programs involved a total amount of some 5 trillion which was almost equal to a quarter of the us gdp in 2020 this is a striking stimulus program when we compare it to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 2008 at that time the obama administration s fiscal stimulus policy stood at around 787 billion which amounted to 5 4 percent of the us gdp in 2008 there is no doubt that us monetary and fiscal policies and the accompanying tremendous liquidity are very important causes of inflation in the us and the world as well other developed countries have also adopted similar stimulus policies the money supply grew at a peak rate of 12 4 percent in the eurozone in january 2021 another factor that must be kept in mind is the russia ukraine conflict as it can lead to potential energy shortages which further exacerbate inflation in the eu as can be seen from statistics the eu s ppi was as high as 31 5 percent and 36 8 percent in march and april 2022 even the cpi which rose relatively slower reached 7 4 percent in april japan also adopted an extremely expansionary monetary policy even in april when the us and other countries began to raise their interest rates the bank of japan still stuck to an expansionary monetary policy to achieve an expansionary effect the boj continues to buy government bonds in order to suppress the interest rates of japanese government bonds thus injecting more liquidity into the market in short the expansionary monetary policies of the world s major developed countries are an important reason for the current global inflation the disruption of supply chains caused by covid 19 is another important reason for global inflation at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic many countries around the world held a wait and see attitude which led to even more serious spread of the contagion the spread of the virus led to the cessation of production in some areas and subsequent serious shortages of supplies that said the labor shortages caused supply shocks when demand recovers quickly but supply recovers more slowly inflation occurs covid 19 has also led to chaos in transportation services with rising freight prices and tight capacity and this phenomenon has also pushed up global inflation the russia ukraine conflict that broke out in february is exacerbating the problem of global inflation the conflict directly leads to global energy jitters nymex crude oil was 95 72 per barrel on feb 28 just as the hostilities began on march 7 the price rose to 130 50 per barrel which is the highest level since august 2008 for us cpi data the sub item energy fuel electricity and gasoline prices rose by as much as 32 0 percent and 30 3 percent year on year in march and april another sub item transportation increased 22 6 percent and 19 9 percent respectively the russia ukraine conflict has had an impact on minerals and agricultural products since the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict prices of aluminum nickel and copper have risen significantly as an important food producing region in the world ukraine s agricultural production and exports have also been greatly affected global supplies of wheat sunflower oil and other agricultural products have been seriously disrupted food prices are also an important part of the cpi and the russia ukraine conflict has undoubtedly contributed to the rise of global food prices in china covid 19 is increasingly coming under better control because of appropriate prevention policies the industrial chain operates regularly and the supply shock is relatively muted compared with other countries in 2020 and 2021 the value of foreign direct investment fdi inflows to china was 163 billion and 173 billion respectively foreign capital flowed into china to take advantage of its potential these fdi statistics reflect the stable business environment in china and how foreign companies vote with their money and strategies as the world s factory chinese plants need to import many raw materials such as oil copper iron ore and so on in fact many chinese manufacturing enterprises also face problems of rising costs this can be seen in ppi and cpi figures in other words because ppi growth always represents upstream activity so when the ppi growth rate is higher than the cpi growth rate the downstream manufacturing enterprises will see weaker profits this phenomenon is occurring in china the chinese government also adopted expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in 2020 however when compared with other countries china s policies were relatively mild actually the growth rate of the m2 hit a peak of 11 1 percent in may and june 2020 and began to decrease gradually after that time in comparison with the us and eu china s cpi and ppi are relatively low in april china s cpi growth was 2 1 percent although the ppi s growth rate was still high at 8 0 percent this can be seen as the result of the growing price of global commodities to a greater extent on the whole the chinese government has been doing well in controlling inflation china does not export inflation in contrast china is playing a positive role in reducing global inflation and stabilizing global prices the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily the writers are zhou xuezhi assistant research fellow of the institute of world economics and politics chinese

i if there is one dominant world problem causing the community of nations an unbroken series of headaches it is the increasing urge toward greater selfsufficiency what this has meant to countries operating on wartime economies such as germany italy japan has recently become depressingly evident but apart from the belligerent powers there exist areas which for less lethal reasons are manifesting a decided interest in some phases of economic selfsufficiency nowhere is this truer than in our own hawaiian islands which are endeavoring to day to reassess their relationship to the mainland and in the process are dealing with as complex and fascinating a set of military social and economic currents as are to be found anywhere a little over a quarter of a century ago ray stannard baker undertook to examine the paradise of the pacific and found among other things that to the outside visitor the island life conveys a curious sense of unnatural strain and overstimulation a condition in which many fine and sincere men are struggling with almost impossible difficulties his comment might almost have been made yesterday so applicable is it to contemporary hawaii to reappraise adequately this condition to do justice to the projection into the present of these difficulties to analyze new ones that have arisen is a complicated task beyond the scope of a general magazine article yet by describing hawaii s efforts to assure her food supply at all times by explaining why her campaign in this direction has thus far stalled and by outlining the exciting possibilities in prospect if the islands do become more self sufficient and if they do not we can at least indicate some of the pressing issues that must be settled if the territory is to remain next to the panama canal our most valuable overseas asset no one can live very long in hawaii without the overwhelming realization that island stability is based upon two major crops sugar cane and pineapples both of which require long growing seasons large scale operations and heavy investments in mills and equipment after driving mile upon mile through sugar cane country past plantations each one of which is a small town in itself with stores churches a bank and assembly hall the visitor cannot help appreciating those facts that 60 per cent of the population owe their livelihood to sugar production and that 70 per cent of the territory s annual income is derived from sugar the pineapple industry less extensive is controlled largely by the sugar interests for years the islands have been made to produce in the neighborhood of 1 000 000 tons of raw sugar annually about 14 per cent of the sugar consumed in the united states this has been possible only through the resourcefulness of the leaders of the industry involving the intensive study of soils fertilizers varieties of cane eradication of pests and improved methods of irrigation arid lands have been transformed into green fields by developing water supply transportation facilities have been built up plantation laborers have been provided with many of the prerequisites of daily life including free housing and medical care the success of the industry last year sugar shipments amounted to approximately 63 575 478 which together with pineapple shipments of 59 487 394 accounted for 92 per cent of total exports has depended directly upon the mighty triumvirate of land labor and water supply adequately financed and kept abreast of the latest scientific developments through their own experiment stations the sugar cane and pineapple plantations have developed the corporate type of farming to a degree of efficiency perhaps unsurpassed anywhere in the world the hawaiian economy then depends upon marketing sugar and pineapples on the mainland using the income from sales of these crops to purchase the commodities necessary to island life amounting last year to unloads of some 113 000 000 it should be noted parenthetically that islanders quick to emphasize that hawaii is an integral part of the united states prefer the use of the terms shipments and unloads to the foreign sounding exports and imports to day the islands provide about one third of their food requirements although oahu on which live nearly 60 per cent of the total resident population supplemented by army and navy forces and their households of nearly 35 000 produces only 15 per cent of its own food supply since hawaii is climatically adapted to the production of sugar cane and pineapples it has been insisted by some exponents of the free trade theory that the islands should become even more dependent upon outside commodities capitalizing upon the natural asset of climate to achieve a satisfactory balance of trade it is understandably among these exponents concerned above all with the control of land labor and water supply that one finds the most apparent misgivings about large scale crop diversification yet this school of thought suffered somewhat of a jolt when the maritime strike on the pacific coast which lasted from october 28 1936 to february 8 1937 cut off supplies from the mainland with the result that prices rose immediately and a few items of food were not available at any price housewives found the strike playing havoc with their budgets oranges were selling at 1 35 a dozen a rise of 255 per cent onions rose 215 per cent rice 34 per cent potatoes 23 per cent wheat flour 29 per cent corn meal 47 per cent considerable concern was caused by the rapidly decreasing supply of canned milk which is widely used among plantation workers fresh fruits and vegetables which normally come from the mainland increased in price more than any other class of foods followed by cereals and bakery products except for foreign or government ships a few freighters from the east coast and oil tankers no vessels entered or departed from hawaiian ports during the strike the acting governor of hawaii charles m hite in his report to the secretary of the interior for the fiscal year 1937 pointed out that the strike again emphasized the necessity of a more diversified agricultural system and a more effective and less costly system of distribution between the various islands the pertinency of this suggestion was evidenced as recently as may of this year when a strike by employees of the interisland steam navigation company paralyzed shipping between the islands with the result that within a week after the strike began prices on the honolulu vegetable market mounted 10 to 15 per cent and residents of oahu found their table fare again restricted a system of diversified agriculture is by no means a new idea in the territory the early polynesians in the islands introduced the taro sweet potato breadfruit coconut banana and many other fruits and vegetables from the south seas when immigrants from america and europe arrived they tried out various new crops with which they were familiar in most cases as dr harold l lyon has asserted with very little success of late years however the urge toward greater self sufficiency in foods has taken definite form crystallized by the lessons of the 100 day maritime strike there are four general arguments advanced in favor of diversified agriculture for the islands to produce more of the food consumed to improve the diet to ship out of season crops to the mainland and to provide farming opportunities for those of the younger generation not adapted to work on the sugar cane and pineapple plantations ii the most powerful force in encouraging greater self sufficiency is the hawaiian department of the united states army which considers the problem primarily from the point of view of defense it is customary in military circles to consider the islands as the western outpost of american defense an extension as it were 2000 miles to the westward of the american coast line and there is much talk in the islands of how hawaii in the hands of an enemy would be a spearhead pointing at the west coast of america so serious is this job of guarding the mainland and the naval base at pearl harbor when for any reason the fleet is not within hawaiian waters that army forces on oahu now number over 21 000 the largest american troop concentration anywhere the civilian in hawaii who generally has little to do with the service communities is constantly reminded of the military significance of the islands by the army and navy bombers and pursuit planes which roar overhead day and night radio programmes sponsored by military units inform him of the army s rôle in case of war for instance while i was in the islands hawaii s anti aircraft regiment the sixty fourth coast artillery presented a radio drama entitled moonlight cavalry as a feature of its celebration of organization day the feature was announced in one of the honolulu newspapers in these words this drama written by lieutenant colonel ward e duval c a c vividly depicts the rôle which the sixty fourth coast artillery would play should an enemy attack the island of oahu big guns searchlights and machine guns all do their part sponsors of the programme hope to impress listeners with the fact that their army in hawaii is constantly on the alert and continually training to defend them and their homes against any possible enemy not once during my stay in the islands did i succeed in obtaining official comment upon the offensive value of hawaii in any war which might have to be waged across the pacific persons raising the question are regarded with reserve the emphasis for public purposes is on defense and any suggestion that the building up of the naval base is linked with possible offensive commitments in the far east inevitably receives a noncommittal response in time of war or of great catastrophe it devolves upon the army in hawaii to feed not only itself but the hard working civilian population only the tourists loaf of approximately 400 000 persons under present conditions this is of course impossible at the conclusion of the maritime strike of 1936 1937 major general h a drum then commanding the hawaiian department uttered this warning if hawaii makes no change in her system of production and her shipping is cut off from any cause her food stocks will be depleted in a few days in a few weeks she will know deprivation and in a few months she may face starvation it is the prescribed function of the army in the islands to provide against peacetime crises and calamities that reach or approach catastrophic proportions the 100 day maritime strike was deemed a commercial disturbance not involving the extended use of army facilities it is also the army s task to take the very darkest view of what would happen to the islands in time of war japan being presumably the aggressor should there be a state of siege difficult though it is to conceive of a situation in which all communication with the mainland would be severed the army is taking no chance that the problem of a sufficient food supply the outstanding flaw in a well nigh impregnable defense shall endanger the success of operations in and around the gibraltar of the pacific to remedy this the service command of the hawaiian department has been entrusted with the job of working out a coördinated plan in conjunction with civilian agencies to assure a sufficient food supply to defend the islands particularly oahu i doubt if there is any other american community whose leaders are so aware of their vital responsibility in feeding the people in case of emergency major general charles d herron commanding the hawaiian department told me that under ordinary circumstances the island food supplies are sufficient for approximately fifty days it is known that ninety days are required to grow a staple crop such as potatoes without a sufficient programme of crop diversification before eventualities island defense would be seriously impaired say army leaders it has been pointed out that hawaii is in a position somewhat analogous to england whose dependency upon food from abroad was well illustrated during the world war not long ago the british minister for coördination of defense established a food defense plans department to build up food reserves for a year in addition to encouraging diversified agriculture on every possible occasion army leaders in hawaii are likewise concerned with evolving some means of surplus storage of foods and seeds i was told by one authority that army and navy forces in hawaii are maintaining sufficient supplies to support themselves for six months but what of the civilian population to help meet this problem hawaiian general headquarters strongly advocates the storing up and constant replenishment of numerous varieties of seeds some of which it is claimed will last up to one year i understand that the war department has approved an appropriation that would provide 100 000 for building an air conditioned seed storage centre the upkeep for the first year being estimated at 60 000 and 40 000 annually thereafter iii it is evident then that the matter of basic food supplies in hawaii is inextricably bound up with army defense plans it is no secret that the hawaiian service command s extensive research has progressed to the extent of determining which areas now in sugar cane or pineapples would grow other food crops advantageously in an emergency involving the declaration of martial law such areas presumably would be taken over at once cleared of cane or pines and devoted to sustaining crops the organization and efficiency of the plantations would be indispensable aids at such a time our conception has been worked out in most details what is needed now is some real result producing execution said one officer from the army point of view the most successful effort to date to develop local food products has been the recent utilization of taro products taro is one of the oldest important food crops of the islands the root of this plant was prized by the early hawaiians who cooked and pounded the tubers to a pasty substance which they called poi this substance has been the staple starchy food of the islands used in much the same manner as we use bread or as orientals use rice to determine the palatability and practicality of taro products the army has undertaken several experiments with taro blend bread for a time the entire garrison of some 21 000 men was furnished with taro blend bread and the results according to military officials indicated that it is entirely practicable beneficial to health and an important step in the development of a greater degree of self sufficiency army leaders have fostered several other experiments with local grown foods but it is possible to detect on their part a certain impatience with the relatively slow progress of the diversified crops programme it is self evident that hawaii an import export community with conditions favoring the production of sugar cane and pineapples on a vast scale under a highly developed and scientifically conducted organization is not going to be transformed in a few months into an economy sufficiently diversified to maintain its population in time of war nevertheless the service command of the hawaiian department continues its preparations to fight in advance against malnutrition deficiency diseases and epidemics which may come with any catastrophe war being the worst plantation authorities are working to encourage a more diversified crop system chiefly to afford plantation workers a better balanced diet nutrition experts have pointed out repeatedly that the prevailing rice diet among the laboring classes in the cities and on the plantations is far from beneficial the rice consumption per capita in hawaii is 230 pounds compared with 5½ pounds on the mainland workers are encouraged to grow sufficient green vegetables for family use and an improved diet has been the dominating influence behind garden contests sponsored by the honolulu star bulletin as well as the 4 h club and future farmers club gardens however as the diversified crops committee of the hawaiian sugar planters association has emphasized there is a surprising dearth of reliable information bearing upon the food requirements of plantation workers the situation is inevitably complicated by the fact that the dietary of a population predominantly oriental in origin has been steadily changing developing along the lines of american diet thus necessitating either increased unloads or local production of fruits vegetables and dairy products two years ago the hawaii agricultural experiment station under the joint supervision of the united states department of agriculture and the university of hawaii conducted a detailed survey of all farms cultivating crops other than sugar cane and pineapples and found that truck crops occupied less than 2 per cent of the territory s arable land this small part was composed mainly of second rate and marginal lands tilled by tenant farmers and averaging less than five acres in extent sums have been appropriated from sugar processing taxes and from territorial funds to develop truck farming and to improve local marketing facilities for farm products as yet however there has been no coordinated effort at diversification related to a necessarily new form of distribution dr o c magistad has stressed the fact that since a large part of the truck crops consumed in the territory are shipped in from the mainland many wholesalers to day have standing orders for mainland shipment this factor together with the uncertainty as to quantities of truck crops available locally induces the wholesaler to continue shipments from the mainland rather than to plan on partial and uncertain delivery from local growers it was recently estimated that food costs in honolulu for the average white family of four are 22 7 per cent higher than the average for fifty one mainland cities moreover retail prices of twentytwo farm products capable of being grown in hawaii were found to be about 20 per cent higher this would seem to offer local producers an unusual opportunity for profit provided they could place foods of equal quality on the local market militating against such profit even against the appearance of locally grown produce are these factors irregular supplies from unirrigated lands subject to droughts and floods inability of small truck gardens to compete successfully with large scale mechanized production on the mainland limited capital high cost of fertilizer and packing materials difficulty of persuading truck farmers most of whom are over fifty five years of age to adjust their age old method of oriental hand production to the market requirements of a modern american city mr h h warner director of the agricultural extension service university of hawaii has suggested two practical methods by which the islands could produce more of their own food the use of public funds for the development of cheap water for irrigation which would result in the increased production of food on land without sufficient rainfall a direct cash subsidy justified on the basis of national defense to return present wet land areas to rice or taro there are areas of good agricultural land on oahu itself now suffering from lack of irrigation says mr warner and also many small sources of water at present unused and actually creating drainage problems at certain seasons of the year if it is the genuine desire of the territory and the federal government that we produce more of our food it would be advantageous to draw together these water sources on windward oahu into a gravity system with one or more reservoirs cheaper water for irrigation purposes would thereby be provided on near by fertile land and without interfering with any existing systems for domestic or plantation use it has also been pointed out that rich valley floors once intensively cultivated in rice and taro are now in pasture or else unused at all growers in these areas find it impossible to obtain laborers in sufficient number and to pay the wages prevailing in the production of sugar cane and pineapples consequently the hawaiian rice industry has been crowded out by low cost production in california where high labor costs have been met by large scale mechanization a general sales tax of ten cents per one hundred pounds on all rice 95 per cent of which is now received from the mainland would provide mr warner believes a subsidy of well over one dollar a bag for all the rice and taro now grown in the territory these benefit payments it is argued would stimulate production and gradually return to cultivation some 10 000 acres of the most fertile lands in the territory iv in late years island researchers have become more and more concerned with the possibility of commercial shipment of fresh papaya mangoes avocados tomatoes and string beans to mainland markets the third general argument for greater diversification for the past two winters for example shipments of hawaiian asparagus free of quarantine restrictions have gone forward to the mainland during december january and february last winter a number of lots were reshipped by refrigerated express from oakland to new york city where they were snapped up at 1 00 to 1 25 per pound wholesale hawaiian potatoes landed at ports on the west coast in february have naturally found a ready market new potatoes in midwinter before sizable progress can be made however it will be necessary to modify the stringent regulations of the united states bureau of entomology and plant quarantine so as to permit entry of fruits passengers on liners from honolulu to san francisco or los angeles never fail to be impressed when they learn that ships supplies of fresh fruits obtained in the islands must be thrown overboard before reaching the mainland the reason for this procedure is that the strictest quarantine is maintained against hawaiian melon and fruit flies their inroads upon the california fruit industry may well be imagined a number of experiments have been made to devise harmless fumigants which would kill all insects and larvæ and permit mainland entry of these export possibilities the solo papaya seems to offer the most hopeful prospect some agricultural authorities in the islands are convinced that the papaya may prove to be the third hawaiian crop next in importance after sugar cane and pineapples having become inordinately fond of the fruit during my brief stay in the islands i tried to find out what has to be done to facilitate its appearing on my breakfast table at home the papaya is a melon like fruit already well advertised as a nutritious food and an excellent digestant high in pepsin content and of memorable flavor experiments have proved that the fumigant methyl bromide applied to papayas kills all insects and larvæ although the fruit is admittedly rarely infested solo papayas require eleven months from seed to fruit a single tree is estimated to produce fifty pounds of fruit per year with a maximum production extending over three years and they grow best in sugar cane land the director of the agricultural extension service estimates that growers could produce fifteen tons of fruit per acre per year which retailed on the mainland at fifteen cents apiece or two for a quarter one weighs about a pound and a half would make money for the growers it is claimed moreover that papayas will keep under refrigeration about as well as cantaloupes that the growth of the papaya industry would benefit shipping between honolulu and the mainland is evidenced by the assertion of one shipping official that were he able to utilize fully his refrigerating space on the run from the islands to the mainland it would mean increased revenues to the company of 600 000 annually how this could be worked out in actual practice is a question assuming modification of the plant quarantine availability of sufficient land for the crop and commercial feasibility with the added possibilities of such by products as preserves and canned juice the papaya should provide a welcome addition to our diet v the fourth argument in favor of greater island diversification is social in nature and involves one of the islands most pressing problems the changing aspirations and needs of a population for the most part of oriental ancestry but americanized to a greater extent than is commonly recognized on the mainland to gain some understanding of this problem and it is absorbing one should bear in mind the racial extraction of the major groups making up hawaii s population there are of course the native hawaiians who have tended to become assimilated with immigrant groups the anglo saxon north european element arrived individually and of their own accord other immigration was directly solicited by the hawaiian government and private industries to fill the need for plantation labor the chinese and portuguese came between 1875 and 1898 the japanese between 1885 and 1908 the filipinos between 1908 and 1932 several smaller groups of immigrants include norwegians germans russians koreans puerto ricans and spaniards immigration has now ceased except for a steady accretion of people from the mainland since the filipinos are the only recent comers there are to day more nativeborn citizens than aliens in all but the filipino group american law bars from american citizenship with few exceptions foreign born chinese japanese koreans filipinos while the foreignborn islanders are rapidly dying off their descendants have multiplied enormously for instance those of japanese parentage who form approximately 40 per cent of the total population have increased proportionately more than any other group the army keeps an everwatchful eye on the leaders of the native born japanese numbering some 37 000 and are consequently very much in evidence in all phases of island activity it is apparent that eventually there will be practically no aliens in hawaii nor indeed any of foreign birth at present however hawaii s population is predominantly youthful that the territory has proved the melting pot of races par excellence goes without saying as the younger generation grows up it proceeds through the americanization process of the public schools and shares in community life with those of other racial ancestries classroom work sports the r o t c and so on the environment is fundamentally american and the natural result is the welding together of hawaii s youth as one people with common aspirations and loyalties based on the american pattern paralleling in some respects the experience of the mainland hawaii has found that each immigrant group and its descendants have tended to graduate out of the rôle of field workers for which purpose they were originally imported into skilled and white collar occupations or into independent businesses this phenomenon involving seriously the island labor supply has been a factor in impelling plantation authorities to improve living and working conditions on the plantations in order to attract and hold second generation inhabitants accustomed to higher standards than their immigrant parents accordingly the plantations have installed better housing better hospitals gymnasia athletic fields movies and so on nevertheless the question still arises whether the second and third generation hawaiianborn will accept agricultural work as a vocation the per cent of citizen employees on sugar plantations has been steadily rising yet there is ample evidence that many of the new generations resent field labor and the supervision which is a part of collective life on the plantations also the field for skilled labor is small by the very nature of hawaii s location and dependence upon agriculture thus one hears talk of the social menace inherent in this situation unless outlets are provided for those who spurn the security of a niche however small in the plantation system efforts are being made to encourage these young citizens to turn to small scale independent truck farming which of course serves the general purpose of greater crop diversification such diversification it is held offers prospects of adequate livelihood without too heavy an investment for those who desire to be independent operators truck farms are coming into the hands of second generation hawaiianborn farmers of oriental extraction who have modern ideas of growing and merchandising nevertheless as the agricultural extension service will attest these educated young farmers are in a difficult position so strong is the filial tradition particularly among the japanese that as long as their parents are living many of the young citizen farmers are prevented from carrying out improvements in the grading and packing of farm products and the keeping of accurate records of operation costs which they know are necessary for successful merchandising in the competitive scheme it is a period of difficult adjustment for these hawaiian born citizens who have absorbed american educations and who find themselves in fundamental conflict with their parents traditional system of cultivation vi these then are the major problems involved in any food programme designed to give hawaii greater military protection improved diet new export outlets and to provide a satisfying career for the rising generation being a sort of half sister to the mainland and politically a part of the united states hawaii cannot interfere with interstate commerce regulations she cannot fall back on the familiar practice of fixing duties on imports in order to encourage home production situated geographically as a foreign country she is nevertheless prevented from encouraging home production by the drastic methods now in effect in countries which have inaugurated thoroughgoing programmes for greater economic self sufficiency so far as i was able to observe most people in the islands favor in some degree one or more of the four preceding arguments for greater food production there have been numerous but isolated attempts to experiment with diversified crops and there is evident a willingness to undertake coördination of these efforts but as yet a unified and wholehearted drive with the determined coöperation of existing island agencies to make hawaii more self sustaining has not made itself felt despite the admittedly vital significance of the food problem two alternatives seem to present themselves hawaii can encourage home production by various types of subsidies or she can proceed more slowly along the present course of encouraging the production of those crops which show a long time possibility of maintaining a competitive position with the returns from sugar cane and pineapples in either case the interests of those dependent upon the volume of business received from outside sources would be somewhat affected rather sharply perhaps if the first policy is adopted and more slowly if the present trend continues if hawaii is to undertake seriously a policy of greater self sufficiency admitting her vulnerability because of her isolation some concessions to the free trade theory will probably have to be made unquestionably the future well being and stability of our most important offshore territory are wrapped up in these issues they must be met and soon for the islands are being drawn more and more into the maelstrom of world events

if you were lucky enough to live in houston during the boom years of the late seventies and early eighties and even the rough bust years that followed the name fayez sarofim has a certain resonance conjuring up all kinds of mystical magical stories of wealth and glamour which is odd because although he was a billionaire plus sarofim was not particularly glamorous nor would he be mistaken for say oscar isaac he was a portly man with a receding hairline and narrow eyes surrounded by square thick rimmed glasses he always wore a suit and tie even on hunting trips but houston then was a place where oilman oscar wyatt was another major character in the narrative so you didn t have to look like a movie star to find yourself at the top of the social and economic heap and now that sarofim has left us he died at home in river oaks at the ripe old age of 93 on the morning of may 28 you can pretty much close the book on a story that has just started to gather dust on the shelves of younger generations of houstonians the loss is profoundly theirs it s not financial though he sat atop his eponymous fayez sarofim co which managed something on the order of 31 6 billion as much as it is historical the houston that sarofim was a part of where anyone could come into town marry well make a fortune and act any which way to the astonishment of the hoi polloi well its days are going fast if they aren t gone already even after houston settled into its more grown up years sarofim remained a figure of note you could find him hanging out at the coronado club in the old bank of the southwest building downtown lunching in a back room with cnbc playing on a big screen tv the stock ticker running continuously on the chyron his clients would stop by to pay homage gleaning bits of sarofim wisdom such as nervous energy is a great destroyer of wealth during the enron frenzy when so many of his clients were desperate to buy in sarofim was one of the few to refuse i can t understand their balance sheets he explained which infuriated some at the time but provided great relief to others when later the old fuddy duddy was of course proven right popular videos previous next more hence fayez that was how he was referred to another personage who earned first name only status here even maybe especially among those who did not know him in brief he was the money manager to houston s elite the son of a wealthy egyptian aristocrat who owned large cotton estates in north africa sarofim landed here in the fifties after graduating from the university of california berkeley with a degree in food technology and earning a harvard mba he took a job at anderson clayton an old cotton firm but by 1958 at the age of thirty had opened his own investment firm along with smarts he had enough europoise to wow an upper class that had a thirst for just that sarofim went on to prove his skill at the one thing that mattered even more to that group taking their money and making more of it for them and of course he did the same for himself fayez cared about two things one of my favorite houston observers once said to me money and women in that order there was the storybook marriage to the lovely louisa stude who had been adopted by the very rich herman brown of the megalithic brown root construction company and his wife margarett root after louisa and her brother mike were orphaned the sarofim stude nuptials in 1962 were a reenactment of the kind of turn of the century romance that henry james wrote about a match between an old world prince and an american debutante in the words of my great colleague skip hollandsworth that merger was very good for business by the early 1960s the very well connected sarofim was managing brown root s corporate retirement fund and the rice university endowment worth 63 million at the time the mansion in river oaks followed as did the lavish and obligatory charitable donations the houston ballet memorial sloan kettering houston grand opera the hobby center for the performing arts etc he amassed a private art collection with its coptic carvings and masterpieces by mary cassatt winslow homer henry moore robert motherwell and andy warhol that nearly rivaled that of the museum of fine arts houston his old money clients produced new old and new money clients in the way these things go then to quote hollandsworth again it was as if jackie collins had arrived tapped henry james on the shoulder and said scoot over honey let me finish this that period involved the again obligatory major divorce costing him on the order of 250 million complete with a second family hiding in the shadows the marriage to the matriarch of that family linda hicks a former employee of sarofim co lasted from 1990 to 1996 before a second even tawdrier divorce earle lilly a name that once struck terror and gloom in the hearts of opposing attorneys was linda sarofim s attorney then there was the mysterious much discussed death of linda who had won a settlement of 12 million the river oaks mansion fayez moved into an extra one and 960 000 a year for life tax free she never got to enjoy the proceeds because she died while climbing mount kilimanjaro with her new husband mason in 2000 finally there was a third marriage in 2015 when he was 85 to the decades younger susan krohn a wealthy divorcée who escaped katrina ravaged new orleans for the wilds of river oaks houston billionaire weds son s mother in law at his hawaii retreat with lavish new year luau was the headline for society writer shelby hodge s scoop for culturemap indeed sarofim s son phillip of family number two was then married to krohn s eldest daughter lori for the record hodge stated we have photographed fayez sarofim for years and never once did he smile in the photos not until susan krohn came into his life in every photo that culturemap has taken of him since then the man is smiling rip fayez thanks for the memories editors

years of rapid financialisation has led to colossal debt growth with low interest rates and qe helping to push asset prices ever higher the tide is rapidly reversing at least for now central banks are unable to ignore the inflation in front of them but inflation is a lagging indicator as is employment we are now working through the consequences of the excessive fiscal and monetary stimulus delivered 18 months ago in the pandemic a good example of the scale of that excess is real disposable income rising more than 15 in the us over the 2020 2021 period despite the economy being in recession as a deluge of fiscal transfer payments overwhelmed the actual loss of salaries and wages as well intentioned as fiscal policy was with the benefit of hindsight it clearly exceeded requirements across the world interestingly no one seems to be proposing tighter fiscal policy to reverse some of the largesse administered through the pandemic global debt gdp is at record levels and markets have unquestionably been fuelled by an extended era of ultra easy money unfortunately the probability of this ending well is extremely low as the monetary action being taken right now will manifest itself in significantly weaker growth over the coming twelve months my colleague chris siniakov has produced this chart to highlight how significant the coordinated global monetary tightening under way already is the chart shows that across around 125 central banks we have seen a monetary tightening campaign to take conditions into the most restrictive since the gfc blue line inverted this is before moves this week particularly from the fed which likely moves by 50bps advancing this index by 11 months against the us manufacturing ism pmi shows how this story will end recession and early signs are already confirming that downturn just as inflation is a lagging indicator so changes in monetary policy work with lags which will show up over coming months and quarters the difficulty is central banks must respond to the here and now even as lags prevail last week s first quarter australian cpi cannot be dismissed easily 5 1 annual headline cpi is the fastest in more than 20 years and the measure showed some 88 items in the abs basket recorded price gains its not the end of the world and its certainly not the 1970 s in many respects everything that could have conspired to push prices higher in q1 did but there are some slivers of hope to consider 1 housing has been one of the strongest sources of inflation pressure in the last 12 months we are now experiencing the consequence of over stimulating housing at a time when supply of construction materials and labour was materially constrained construction costs for building a new home was one of the larger components that exceeded forecasts contributing 0 62 of the 2 1 quarterly number alone source australia bureau of statistics there are many reasons to suggest that we are moving past peak housing mania but it will take time to show up higher costs the winding down of homebuilders higher interest rates which have already been moving as banks raise rates on fixed rate products in particular and just the natural normalisation of housing demand will all cool construction the chart below highlights the relationship between residential building approvals which exploded in 2020 21 but is now in the rear view mirror and construction costs in short the worst might be past we pay particular attention to the housing market because as per the saying as goes the housing market so goes the economy even the hint of higher interest rates is clearly starting to add to the list of headwinds for the sector with auction clearance rates already at multi year lows and sydney house prices now down for two consecutive months corelogic data 2 the rba along with other central banks will be mindful of the moves in areas like food and energy and key non discretionary prices increases in these areas act as de facto tightening as households can t choose to not eat or fill up the car that is why core inflation ex these items is the focus for them core inflation of 3 7 is a concern but it s not seismically above the 3 25 in their 2022 forecasts the abs points out that non discretionary cpi grew at more than twice the pace of discretionary in some ways in q1 everything that could go wrong did from the ukraine conflict impacting energy prices to floods in nsw and qld adding to food inflation which doesn t mean the rba won t respond but it highlights that prices of non discretionary items are already doing some of the work for them in curbing demand the risk when price pressures spread is a more broad based cycle leading into a wage price spiral so doing nothing is not an option source australia bureau of statistics within this category energy prices met a perfect storm in q1 prices may stay elevated for some time but a 30 plus move from here is clearly much less likely source australia bureau of statistics 3 for what it s worth markets continue to believe inflation is not likely to be a persistent phenomenon and that central banks are going to be effective in dealing with it the us led the developed world in this inflationary cycle and so we continue to look to this economy for signs that the peak is in which is expected in the near term longer term expectations for inflation remain well anchored it should be fairly striking that despite a 8 5 headline inflation level in the us as at the most recent print the us 5yr5yr forward breakeven rate which is closely watched including by the fed remains a little above recent averages but not that much at 2 54 source franklin templeton bloomberg survey based measures of inflation expectations also remain anchored albeit having risen from low levels the university of michigan consumer sentiment survey of longer term inflation expectations has risen yes but is still at levels around 2012 13 policy makers don t want to see these rise much further but if some sort of peak is close that risk should be limited the risks of course are that the longer headline inflation persists the greater the risk that longer term measures of expectations become unanchored leading to a wage price spiral we are not there yet and neither do markets expect this there is no disagreement that us inflation will slow from its current lofty heights there is disagreement about the pace and extent but the signalling this will convey will be powerful for the world this will be an important and powerful signpost that we are passing a peak in the developed world which will be important for australian dynamics too where an unhelpful assumption has been made that so the us so goes australia 4 monetary policy will still not be anywhere near as aggressive as markets expect below we show what is implied by current market pricing for the rba versus the last 4 rate hike cycles going all the way back to 1990 in short markets continue to project the most aggressive tightening cycle to ensue in more than 30 years both in terms of speed of move and size of rate hikes themselves with household debt levels at record highs and consumer confidence already weak a cash rate as implied by current markets would likely push australia into a housing led recession we continue to argue that what the rba actually delivers and where the cash rate ends up is the most significant driver for bond market returns over the next year our view hasn t changed that the rba will take a measured approach to raise rates and likely end up with a terminal rate in the 1 25 area it could be slightly higher but it is almost certainly not going to be the 3 5 now priced by markets source franklin templeton bloomberg these are perilous times with markets already feeling the chill of the monetary deep freeze underway the nasdaq is down more than 20 ytd emerging market currencies have fallen significantly and real estate markets are showing signs of weakness the probability of central banks gently landing the plane looks to us to be shrinking by the day with the consequence of global financialisation facing its biggest hurdle since the

iterâ s fusion energy experiments will take place inside the vacuum vessel of a donut shaped machine called a tokamak saint paul lez durance france â from a small hill in the southern french region of provence you can see two suns one has been blazing for four and a half billion years and is setting the other is being built by thousands of human minds and hands and is â far more slowly â rising the last of the real sunâ s evening rays cast a magical glow over the other â an enormous construction site that could solve the biggest existential crisis in human history it is here in the tiny commune of saint paul lez durance that 35 countries have come together to try and master nuclear fusion a process that occurs naturally in the sun â and all stars â but is painfully difficult to replicate on earth fusion promises a virtually limitless form of energy that unlike fossil fuels emits zero greenhouse gases and unlike the nuclear fission power used today produces no long life radioactive waste mastering it could literally save humanity from climate change a crisis of our own making if it is mastered fusion energy will undoubtedly power much of the world just 1 gram of fuel as input can create the equivalent of eight tons of oil in fusion power thatâ s an astonishing yield of 8 million to 1 atomic experts rarely like to estimate when fusion energy may be widely available often joking that no matter when you ask itâ s always 30 years away but for the first time in history that may actually be true in february scientists in the english village of culham near oxford announced a major breakthrough they generated and sustained a record 59 megajoules of fusion energy for five seconds in a giant donut shaped machine called a tokamak it was only enough to power one house for a day and more energy went into the process than came out of it yet it was a truly historic moment it proved that nuclear fusion was indeed possible to sustain on earth this was excellent news for the project in france the international thermonuclear experimental reactor better known as iter its main objective is to prove fusion can be utilized commercially if it can the world will have no use for fossil fuels like coal oil and gas the main drivers of the human made climate crisis there has been a huge sense of momentum at iter since the success in the uk but the people working on the project are also undergoing a major change their director general bernard bigot pronounced bi goh in french died from illness on may 14 after leading iter for seven years before his death bigot shared his infectious optimism for fusion energy from his sunny office which overlooked the shell of iterâ s own tokamak a sci fi like structure still under construction â energy is life â bigot said â biologically socially economically â when the earth was populated by less than a billion people there were enough renewable sources to meet demand bigot said â not anymore not since the industrial revolution and the following population explosion so we embraced fossil fuels and did a lot of harm to our environment and here we are now 8 billion strong and in the middle of a drastic climate crisis â he said â there is no alternative but to wean ourselves off our current main power source â he said â and the best option seems to be the one the universe has been utilizing for billions of years â mimicking the sun fusion energy is created by forcing together two particles that by nature repel after a small amount of fuel is injected into the tokamak giant magnets are activated to create a plasma the fourth state of matter which is a bit like a gas or soup that is electrically charged by raising temperatures inside the tokamak to unfathomably high levels the particles from the fuel are forced to fuse into one the process creates helium and neutrons â which are lighter in mass than the parts they were originally made of the missing mass converts to an enormous amount of energy the neutrons which are able to escape the plasma then hit a â blanketâ lining the walls of the tokamak and their kinetic energy transfers as heat that heat can be used to warm water create steam and turn turbines to generate power this all requires the tokamak to contain serious heat the plasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees celsius 10 times hotter than the core of the sun it begs the question how can anything on earth hold such high temperatures itâ s one of many hurdles that generations of fusion energy seekers have managed to overcome scientists and engineers designed giant magnets to create a strong magnetic field to keep the heat bottled up anything else would simply melt what those working on fusion have been trying to do inside their machines is essentially replicate the sun the sun is a perpetual fusion factory made up of a gigantic burning ball of plasma it fuses several hundred tons of hydrogen into helium each second plasma is the stuff 99 9 of the universe is made of including the stars our sun and all interstellar matter down here on earth for instance itâ s used in televisions and neon lights and we can see it in lightning and the aurora as awesome as that all sounds generating fusion energy in itself isnâ t actually the hard part several experts at iter said humanity has been pulling off nuclear fusion reaction ever since the invention of the h bomb after all the main challenge is sustaining it the tokamak in the uk â called the joint european torus or jet â held fusion energy for five seconds but thatâ s simply the longest that machine will go for its magnets were made of copper and were built in the 1970s any more than five seconds under such heat would cause them to melt iter uses newer magnets that can last much longer and the project aims to produce a 10 fold return on energy generating 500 megawatts from an input of 50 megawatts but iterâ s goal isnâ t to actually use the energy for power but to prove that it can sustain fusion energy for much longer than jet was able to success here will mean commercial scale machines can start generating fusion in the future while the sun fuses hydrogen atoms to create helium the jet project used two hydrogen isotopes called deuterium and tritium which iter will also use these isotopes behave almost identically to hydrogen in terms of their chemical makeup and reactions both deuterium and tritium are found in nature deuterium is abundant in both fresh and saltwater â the deuterium from just 500 milliliters of water with a little tritium could power a house for a year tritium is rare but it can be synthetically produced at the moment only 20 kilograms of it exist in the world and demand amounts to no more than 400 grams per year but at a yield of 8 million to 1 only tiny amounts of both elements are required to generate a lot of fusion energy tritium is an exceptionally pricey substance a single gram is currently worth around 30 000 should nuclear fusion take off demand will go through the roof presenting the worldâ s fusion masters with yet another challenge a 10 million part project from afar iter looks like a project ready to go from up close itâ s clear itâ s still a ways off the construction â across 39 building sites â is incredibly complex the main worksite is a markedly sterile environment where tremendous components are being put into place with the help of 750 ton cranes workers have already put together the shell of the tokamak but they are still awaiting some parts including a giant magnet from russia that will sit at the top of the machine the dimensions are mind blowing the tokamak will ultimately weigh 23 000 tons thatâ s the combined weight of three eiffel towers it will comprise a million components further differing into no fewer than 10 million smaller parts this powerful behemoth will be surrounded by some of the largest magnets ever created their staggering size â some of them have diameters of up to 24 meters â means they are are too large to transport and must be assembled on site in a giant hall given the huge number of parts involved thereâ s simply no room for error even the digital design of this enormous machine sits across 3d computer files that take up more than two terabytes of drive space thatâ s the same amount of space you could save more than 160 million one page word documents on wartime nuclear fusion behind hundreds of workers putting the iter project together are around 4 500 companies with 15 000 employees from all over the globe thirty five countries are collaborating on iter which is run by seven main members â china the united states the european union russia india japan and south korea it looks a little like the un security council though the late bigot among others have tried hard to keep geopolitics out of iter entirely but as russia seeks to redraw europeâ s map with its war in ukraine and even challenge the post war world order there are concerns over the countryâ s continued role in iter and just as many over its potential exclusion russia has been cut out of a number of other international scientific projects in the fallout of its war but the european commission has explicitly made an exception for iter in its sanctions part of this is because russia is inextricably linked with not only the project but fusion energy historically countries began seeking fusion energy in the 1930s building all sorts of machines over decades but it was the tokamak created in the soviet union that proved most successful in 1968 soviet researchers made a huge fusion breakthrough â they were able to achieve the high temperatures required and contain the plasma for a sustained period which had never been done before the tokamak became the machine to replicate even the word tokamak â a portmanteau for â toroidal magnetic confinementâ â is from the russian language russia has also provided some of the most critical elements of the iter project and is one of its main funders the magnet for the top of the tokamak for example was made in st petersburg and waits there ready to be sent to france said iterâ s head of communications laban coblentz so far russiaâ s involvement in the project hasnâ t changed in any way he said iter is really a child of the cold war â coblentz said â it s a deliberate collaboration by countries that are ideologically unaligned who simply share a common goal for a better future â he pointed out that the seven main members have been through many tense events since iterâ s conception in 1985 â before anything around the latest russia circumstances that has to date never affected the collaborative spirit i think it is not an exaggeration to say that iter is a project of peace â he said but coblentz conceded that the war in ukraine was â unprecedentedâ and that he couldnâ t predict what it might mean for russia s future in iter â something that will be a delicate issue for the next director general part of bigotâ s job was to coordinate the seven main members and their often differing views on the handling of various political ideological and economic issues when asked before russiaâ s invasion of ukraine whether managing these differences got challenging bigot gave a wry smile â now that is truly no small feat â he said â but our joint commitment remains as strong as ever i can say that from the beginning of my involvement with the project daily politics has had virtually no impact on our endeavors â he said â each of the partners seems quite aware dropping the ball could easily mean the demise of the entire project this of course is a tremendous responsibility â geopolitics has always played a role in iter just finding the right location for it took years and involved more than a decade of technical studies political bargaining and diplomatic fine tuning franceâ s saint paul lez durance was finally made the official site in 2005 at a meeting in moscow and the agreement on construction was signed in paris a year after as the diplomacy and technology fell in step building began in 2010 the foundations were laid and in 2014 the first construction machines were switched on time is running out the scale and ambition of the iter project may seem enormous but it is at the very least a proportional response to the mess humans have made of the planet since 1973 global energy usage has more than doubled by the end of the century it might actually triple seventy percent of all carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere are created through humansâ energy consumption and 80 of all the energy we consume is derived from fossil fuels now the earth is barreling toward levels of warming that translate into more frequent and deadly heat waves famine inducing droughts wildfires floods and rising sea levels the impacts of the climate crisis are getting harder and harder to reverse as entire ecosystems reach tipping points and more human lives are put on the line the world is now scrambling to rapidly decarbonize and speed up its transition from planet baking fossil fuels to renewable energy like solar wind and hydropower some countries are banking on nuclear fission energy which is low carbon but comes with a small but not negligible risk of disaster storage problems for radioactive waste and a high cost but there are serious questions about whether the world can make this green transition fast enough to avert catastrophic climate change thatâ s where fusion could be an 11th hour hero â if the world masters it in time when the late physicist stephen hawking was asked by time in 2010 which scientific discovery he would like to see in his lifetime he pointed to exactly this process â i would like nuclear fusion to become a practical power source â he said â it would provide an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming â a new era the experts working on nuclear fusion have overcome enormous challenges already and so many including bigot dedicated their entire careers to it and never saw it come into practical use now commercial businesses are preparing to generate and sell fusion energy so optimistic they are that this energy of the future could come online by mid century but as ever with nuclear fusion as one challenge is overcome another seems to crop up the limited stocks and price of tritium is one so iter is trying to produce its own on that front the outlook isnâ t bad the blanket within the tokamak will be coated with lithium and as escaped plasma neutrons reach it they will react with the lithium to create more tritium fuel time and money are always concerns for big projects but â bigâ doesnâ t even begin to describe the scale of iter which is truly one of the worldâ s largest and most ambitious international energy collaborations in history one day s delay costs about a million euros bigot said the european union is footing 45 of the project s ever mounting construction costs all the other participant countries are contributing a little over 9 each by rough estimations initially the entire construction was estimated at around 6 billion euros 6 4 billion right now the total has more than tripled to around 20 billion euros the 2001 predictions envisioned the first batch of plasma being produced in 2016 another missed goal some observers had considered the project dead in the water but after bigot took the helm the project was streamlined and got back on track bigot had a reputation as a micromanager coblentz said but thatâ s exactly what was needed to get this complicated project in order â when you got here his car was in place at 7 a m and often here until 9 or 10 p m at night â coblentz said â so you always had the impression that no detail was too large or too small for him to take seriously and be involved in â though under his leadership expectations and deadlines were also revised to be more realistic first plasma is now expected in 2025 and the first deuterium tritium experiments are hoped to take place in 2035 though even those are now under review â delayed in part by the pandemic and persistent supply chain issues yet with one of the worldâ s biggest projects running behind time on his lap bigot remained passionate and optimistic about iterâ s potential until his last breath

by catherine drinker bowen foreword the story of justice oliver wendell holmes is the story of his country the narrative cannot begin with the flat date of his birth 1841 this was a man whose presence carried tradition over his shoulder one catches sight of his ancestors his roots reached deep into american earth it was the strength of these roots that permitted so splendid a flowering to know judge holmes at eighty courtly witty scholarly kind it is well to have acquaintance with his calvinist grandfather abiel holmes with his handsome worldly great grandfather judge wendell with his mother from whom he inherited he said a trace of melancholy above all it is well to know his father professor of anatomy talkative five footthree autocrat of the breakfast table who lived on applause and said so with engaging frankness and who looked down his nose at his son s choice of a profession 21 on the seventeenth of june 1872 in christ church cambridge fanny bowditch dix well married oliver wendell holmes jr phillips brooks was the clergyman fanny herself had picked out the church the biggest one she had said so that we can invite all your old girls wendell by september the two were settled with the senior holmeses at 296 beacon street they had the third floor to themselves there had been no choice of where they would live there was no money for a separate establishment dr holmes was enormously pleased to have a new daughter under his roof a fresh audience was a godsend he said you may find me a trifle egotistical he told fanny beaming on her his eyes bright as buttons the crow s feet deep around his eyes the reason i have to take so much interest in myself my dear is that i have a good deal to do i must put my spirit into it and that makes a person more or less of an egotist fanny had always got on well with dr holmes before she came to live in his house she had been continually amused by his industry and his vanity now amusement gave way to a kind of amazement more or less of an egotist dr holmes had said there was no less about it nor was there any doubt that dr holmes was a genuine celebrity letters came to him from all over the country and from abroad too huge piles of them day after day extraordinarily personal letters enclosing poems to be crit icized asking the autocrat if it was wrong for a woman to leave a brutal husband and whether the doctor advised voting for grant or greeley in november most of the letters were flattering to a degree dr holmes read them aloud laughing delightedly i purr very loud over a good honest letter that says pretty things to me he told fanny a man bears superlatives about his own productions with wonderful fortitude your father is like a child fanny told her husband his vanity is harmless and charming on a november afternoon of 1880 at the lowell institute wendell holmes gave the first of his lectures on the common law the bare gas lighted hall was perhaps three quarters full there was a sprinkling of law students and most of their professors john gray and james barr ames james bradley thayer dean christopher columbus langdell was there his long dark beard flowing over his shirt front his fine eyes level and searching behind his spectacles langdell as holmes well knew was all for logic and hated references to anything outside of it but he was a superb teacher a noble old swell holmes called him president eliot was there sitting straight in his chair his arms folded there were not many practicing lawyers present run of the mill lawyers were still suspicious of historical analyses of the law holmes s law partner george shattuck was there of course and munroe and captain manitzky from the office henry parkman and joseph warner fessenden and brooks adams charles barnes young louis brandeis there was also a contingent from the world of banking and large business affairs higginsons lees wigglesworths friends of the holmes family the rest of the audience was made up of the usual institute followers elderly men and women who pursued culture even in its more formidable aspects that these lectures on the common law would be formidable they had not a doubt but surely a son of dr holmes would leaven the lump with a quip or two some homely local reference dr holmes s feelings this afternoon were mixed long ago he had become convinced that wendell would never make a public speaker wendell s manner was not easy when he was interested in a subject he was uncompromising making no effort to charm his audience when wendell s mother demurred at this the doctor had ended by saying a trifle irritably that wendell s neck was too thin for platforms public speakers should be robust the doctor thought of it now wendell had begun to speak his voice was certainly agreeable it was soft but it had resonance and carried well his neck was indubitably thin even at forty he was thin all over with the figure of a man of twenty five he held bis shoulders like a soldier he had no notes and spoke slowly continuously as though telling a story that he himself found enormously interesting the life of the law has not been logic it has been experience the quiet voice went on gathering depth george shattuck turned his head abruptly and looked at professor langdell what holmes bad just said was in direct opposition to langdell s beliefs shattuck s own outlook on the law was more like langdell s than like holmes s but this had not deterred shattuck from saying openly that holmes should have a harvard professorship and a judgeship later on if it was the business of a lawyer to know law this was shattuck s favorite phrase it was the business of a professor and a judge to know even more law wendell holmes probably knew more law than any other man in massachusetts langdell s expression was unfathomable behind heard and glasses but president eliot had unfolded his arms he leaned forward his face raised toward the speaker holmes had walked round from behind the lectern and was standing at the edge of the platform his voice rang with the slow quiet assurance of a man who speaks from a conviction born of knowledge and who knows that only time is needed to bring other men to his view the very considerations which judges most rarely mention and always with an apology are the secret roots from which the law draws all the juices of life i mean of course considerations of what is expedient for the community concerned in the audience a wigglesworth a lee a higginson bankers all stirred a trifle uneasily expedient for the community concerned what did the lecturer mean by the community the bankers and businessmen who were the rightful leaders or the mass of people if the latter it was a notion no man of business would tolerate for a moment it smacked of legislative interference so far however the lecturer had said nothing actually anarchistic merely a suspicion was born but surely this fellow holmes belonged in the right camp he was a wendell an oliver a holmes a jackson maybe these were just the notions of a theoretically minded man holmes had never made any real money in the law when it was over eliot langdell and ames moved up the aisle toward the platform so did louis brandeis wigglesworths and higginsons after shaking dr holmes by the hand disappeared the bulk of the audience filed out onto dark november streets looked at their watches and thought about supper dr holmes s son was a pretty good lecturer certainly although a trifle learned for everyday consumption but after all was not the law the driest subject on earth the lecturer obviously did not think so the lecturer was plainly in love with the law it was this quality perhaps that brought the audience back monday after monday until the twelve lectures were done the general conviction was that the whole thing had been learned elevating and dry what eliot and langdell thought would become apparent later on what the wigglesworths higginsons and lees thought what indeed the entire non legal audience thought was a matter of indifference to wendell holmes what he did care about enormously was the book that he was making out of the lectures and the response to this book he might expect from the legal world by february 1881 the book was finished and in the printer s hands on the third of march five days before his fortieth birthday wendell and fanny holmes walked down beacon street to the parental mansion under holmes s arm was a new brown covered book the common law he handed it to his father on the flyleaf was written 0 w holmes from his affectionate son o w holmes jr march 3 1881 how many books on wendell holmes s shelves bore a like inscription but reversed the inscriptions went all the way hack to 1848 when wendell was seven each of his father s works as it came out but dr holmes had never abbreviated the names be had written them in full with a flourish oliver wendell holmes jr from his loving father oliver wendell holmes most fathers would have stopped with the word father but not the doctor posterity he knew would want to know who this father was it had never ceased to irritate wendell holmes now at last the inscription was reversed now the son could pay ihe father in his own coin 22 in january 1882 a harvard graduate named william weld confided to president eliot that he had some money to dispose of he would like it to go to the law school four professors were not enough for a school of the scope and standing of this one would ninety thousand dollars endow a fifth professorship ninety thousand dollars for the law school eliot had not countersigned the check before he knew where the new salary was going oliver wendell holmes jr was the man for the place brilliant and with the scientific outlook a man who would produce bocks as well as teach a combination that eliot insisted upon a harvard graduate son and grandson of harvard graduates married to a bowditch his roots in good massachusetts soil a man of solid distinguished background when holmes was notified of his appointment he went straight to his partner shattuck was in no way surprised shattuck knew everything that went on take the job he said instantly it is your kind of job and your kind of life holmes you will never make money in the law your heart is not in the right place to make money i always suspected it but after i sat through those lowell lectures i was sure of it shattuck paused then went on vigorously on the massachusetts supreme court otis lord is sick he can t last much longer you are the man to succeed him and don t tell me you haven t thought of it yourself shattuck grinned through his beard don t let eliot tie you to more than a year s contract he went on have it in writing that if you are offered a judgeship you can resign it s highly unusual eliot won t like it he isn t an easy man to bargain with but i have never observed that the holmes family lacked stubbornness itself holmes laughed but he followed shattuck s advice about the law school contract eliot agreed to the proviso after all a harvard professorship was a thing seldom relinquished holmes looked forward eagerly to his new job the law school he well knew was a very different place from the days when he himself had gone there to read law behind the white painted pillars of dane hall entering with no academic requirements and leaving after three years without examination langdell s case system was well established now but it had taken eleven years of battle to establish it holmes approved the case system law only ends with a theory it begins with a concrete case naturally a student remembers an actual instance more vividly than a general principle the judgeship seemed remote in the academic world time moves slowly shattuck and his resignation clauses most likely it had all been unnecessary he would be at harvard law school thought professor holmes forever on the morning of december 8 1882 professor holmes was called out of his classroom in the foyer stood george shattuck hat in hand his eye alight with news otis lord has sent in his resignation he said governor long wants you for the judgeship he has to submit your name to the council by twelve o clock and he has to have your consent first shattuck took out his watch it s eleven now he said the supreme court so it had come at last in his heart holmes had hoped always but he had never really expected it it left him stunned speechless why are you standing there shattuck asked he was almost as excited as holmes an hour is not long to get ourselves to eliot s office and then across the river to the court house holmes got his hat and coat the two walked down the steps of austin hall turned left on harvard square toward the president s house the sky was a brilliant blue gusts of dry snow blowing along the bricks touched their faces how will eliot take this holmes asked badly shattuck replied his voice cheerful with the prospect of imminent battle one week later on december 15 holmes was formally appointed to the court his resignation was accepted at harvard on january 8 there was some reason for eliot s displeasure ordinarily a resigning professor gave the corporation time to fill his place before he left on the third of january 1883 holmes took his seat in the supreme court the youngest of seven judges he was forty one field was fifty the other five morton devens colburn the two allens were white haired white bearded charles devens harvard 38 had commanded the fifteenth massachusetts infantry and fought through the same battles as holmes devens knew holmes well trusted him as one soldier trusts another badly the supreme court needed men of vision in 1883 these were times of vast social change with extraordinary rapidity a pioneer economic individualism was giving way to the collectivism of corporate trade and the transition was attended by groaning and travail a country that in holmes s youth had been rural in tone now rushed to build new cities jefferson s fears had come to pass men lived piled upon one another struggling for survival under smoking factory chimneys of which jefferson could not have dreamed by 1883 the transition from a rural to an industrial economy was gathering momentum in the nineties the ills attending it would be acute had abiel holmes been alive once more he would have said the country was growing too fast for its heart but this time it was more than a change it was a revolution holmes recognized it he had studied the formation of great states and the causes of their dissolution when the pattern of society changes legislation meets the change or the state perishes in the common law holmes had said repeatedly that the best judge bears in mind public policy the felt necessities of the time when holmes came to the bench the burning issues of the day were labor s grievance against the employer and the people s grievance against the corporations two manifestations of the individual s battle for survival in a collectivist world the battle was just beginning it would rage all during holmes s lifetime and beyond once america had looked to the declaration of independence but the declaration was a trifle vague to a massachusetts businessman almost transcendental by 1880 there was more than a suspicion that in spite of the hopes of the fathers political liberty would never result in economic equality men became less interested in being born free and equal more interested in regulating commerce if the declaration had been a profession of faith the constitution was its working instrument and america looked now to the constitution the trouble was that the courts gave this working instrument no elasticity they regarded it as immutable written in stone on sinai desperately the people needed judges who possessed historical as well as judicial awareness judges whose social prejudices were leveled by the long view of the scholar holmes was such a man 23 at seventy five dr holmes did not seem a day older than at fifty five he had taken to wearing brown suits with a plaid bow tie bright scotch colors scarlet and green thirty five years of a black coat every morning to lecture at the medical school was black enough for one man he said he had lately got out a new volume of poems he was writing a book length memoir of emerson his love of flattery had by no means diminished you know i am a trifle deaf he would say quickly when someone praised his latest work won t you please repeat that a little louder every sunday dr holmes managed to get down to king s chapel for morning service they say i fell asleep this morning in church he told a visitor one sunday afternoon possibly possibly but when i woke up the minister was preaching very well in the summer of 1804 dr holmes failed visibly wendell and fanny holmes watched the frail old figure day by day tried not to help him rise when he struggled from his chair how thick his hair was and how bright his eye but obviously it was very hard for him to see and when he sat down at the desk his hand knotted and he could not write on a table by the fire the pearly nautilus shell sat gleaming with iridescent color build thee more stately mansions o my soul as the swift seasons roll did his father know wendell holmes wondered that the end was near surely his medical knowledge must tell him daily hourly the meaning of this film before his eyes this helplessness when the pen dropped from his fingers on these october afternoons his father sat in his chair gazing into the fire his tiny wrinkled hands crossed on his knee outside autumn winds ruffled the bright waters of the river along the street leaves scurried golden wine red driven early from the trees wendell his father said one day suddenly sitting thus by the fire in the october dusk what is it for me king s chapel fanny holmes sewing by the table looked up wendell what is it i said king s chapel yes father all right then i am satisfied that is all i am going to say about it the days moved swiftly fanny reading to her fatherin law at teatime rose to draw the curtains and saw across the river beyond the spires of cambridge beyond mount auburn and the northern range of hills the sky alight with the colors of the setting sun how dr holmes loved that view i seem to look out on all creation he had said could there be for this man a heaven that did not contain bunker hill and boston common the state house and harvard yard fanny moved back to her place by the lamp wendell came in and the three talked quietly of the day s events the white head sank a little lower father is going to sleep wendell thought and saw his wife get up and move swiftly to the old man s side wendell got up himself leaning over the chair the two waited motionless the frail shoulders moved with an even breathing the white head sank a little lower wendell holmes putting out his hand knew suddenly that the shoulders had ceased to move it was extraordinary that among all the notices the telegrams letters eulogies the kindest came from england boston was so used to the doctor s verses and his jokes and his articles in the atlantic that the city could not seem to realize that he was gone the doctor had been so cheerful boston said so good to meet on the paths across the public garden but it was london punch that struck somehow the notes nearest to the doctor s own chord the nine verses dedicated to the autocrat might have been written by the autocrat himself the last leaf can it be true we have turned it and on you friend of all was there one who ever took from its shelf by chance a book penned by you but was fast your friend for life with one refuge from its strife safe and true 24 in july of 1899 chief justice field died the governor immediately appointed holmes as his successor no one was surprised it was the logical move but what did surprise boston and especially the judges was the ease with which holmes from the very first filled his place the judges had known that this was a brilliant mind a forceful and persuasive character but holmes was independent impatient of slower miuds in the consultation room alone with the other judges how would he behave had he the tact the poise to carry it assign the opinions to be written resolve differences preserve judicial harmony chief justice holmes it seems had all these qualities and he loved the position at fifty nine it was extraordinary how young the chief justice looked his face with its high color was lined and showed all the marks of living but the deep gray eyes were more searching than ever and there was a quickness about him that seemed to stem from far within from a wellspriug unending and joyful young judge loring in particular looked upon his chief with amazement one day worried over an opinion holmes had assigned him to write loring took it to beacon street carrying along all the papers of the case holmes glanced through the material turning the pages then he got up and went to the high old desk in the comer standing he wrote ten lines handed them to loring the younger man was appalled surely the chief justice was not going to let this cursory examination suffice but when loring submitted the report it was accepted by the others as the opinion of the court and incorporated without question in the records in ten minutes holmes had seen to the heart of the matter early in september 1901 president mckinley went to buffalo to greet holiday throngs at the exposition theodore roosevelt aged forty two was up in keene valley climbing mountains enjoying the st renuous life in music hall mckinley put out his hand to greet a citizen who was standing in line the man raised his hand a shot was fired mckinley lived for eight days the country as a whole was ready for roosevelt but the conservative republicans were not his first message to congress was moderate but firm and there was no mistaking the fact that the government was going to assume a new relation to business the square deal for all parties would include labor and the public as well as capital in words less disturbing and far more judicial holmes bad said the same thing when he dissented in the vegelahn case the organization of the world now going on so fast means an ever increasing might and scope of combination combination on the one side is patent and powerful combination on the other is the necessary and desirable counterpoint if the battle is to be carried on in a fair and equal way roosevelt and holmes were poles apart in temperament they differed both in their approach to social problems and in their plans for meeting these problems yet it was natural reading the vegelahn dissent that roosevelt should see here a justice who would be his man who would support the policies he believed in without the court on his side no president could be effectual huge issues could depend as roosevelt said on whether a judge of the supreme court came down heads or tails in june 1902 one of the judges was ill horace gray of boston he was coming home to nahant he said to rest for the summer judge gray was seventy four during eighty two of its one hundred and thirteen years there had been a massachusetts man on the court newspapers speculated and in their prophecies the name of the chief justice of massachusetts loomed large henry cabot lodge to theodore roosevelt nahant mass june 5 1902 dear theodore i hear on my return that judge gray is so much more weak that he has resigned i want of course to talk with you before you decide i have not bothered you because i thought it would not come for some time but i have thought it over a great deal ever yrs h c lodge theodore roosevelt to henry cabot lodge oyster bay n y july 10 1902 dear cabot now as to holmes if it becomes necessary you can show him this letter first of all i wish to go over the reasons why i am in his favor his father s name entitles the son to honor and if the father had been an utterly unknown man the son would nevertheless now have won the highest honor the labor decisions which have been criticized by some of the big railroad men and other members of large corporations constitute to my mind a strong point in judge holmes favor the ablest lawyers and greatest judges are men whose past has naturally brought them into close relationship with the wealthiest and most powerful clients and i am glad when i can find a judge who has been able to preserve his aloofness of mind so as to keep his broad humanity of feeling and his sympathy for the class from which he has not drawn his clients i think it eminently desirable that our supreme court should show in unmistakable fashion their entire sympathy with all proper effort to secure the most favorable possible consideration for the men who most need that consideration now a word as to the other side in the higher sense in the proper sense he is not in my judgment fitted for the position unless he is a party man marshall rendered such invaluable service because he was a statesman of the national type like adams who appointed him like washington whose mantle fell upon him taney was a curse to our national life because he belonged to the wrong party and faithfully carried out the criminal and foolish views of the party which stood for such a construction of the constitution as would have rendered it impossible even to preserve the national life the supreme court of the sixties was good exactly in so far as its members fitly represented the spirit of lincoln this is true at the present day the majority of the present court who have although without satisfactory unanimity upheld the policies of president mckinley and the republican party in congress have rendered a great service to mankind and to this nation the minority have stood for such reactionary folly as would have hampered well nigh hopelessly this people in doing efficient and honorable work for the national welfare now i should like to know that judge holmes was in entire sympathy with our views that is with your views and mine and judge gray s for instance just as we know that ex attorney general knowlton is before i would feel justified in appointing him faithfully yours theodore roosevelt p s how would it do if he seems to be all right to have him come down here and spend a night with me and then i could make the announcement on the day that he left after we have talked together on the eleventh of august holmes s appointment was announced in the papers all new england it seemed was pleased most of the accounts mentioned the vegelahn dissent there was a disposition to pronounce the new judge something of a radical 25 on friday morning december 18 1902 in the chamber of the united states supreme court in washington fanny holmes watched the hands of the round clock above the chief justice s chair move toward noon she had sat here for half an hour the spell of the old room had settled upon her light came benignly from the domed ceiling judges in marble looked down from their pedestals on a raised dais nine tall black leather chairs faced the chamber in that center chair under the red canopy judge taney had sat at eighty seven reviled and mistrusted by a country he had served for half a century daniel webster had argued here and calhoun it was an awesome sight for the wife of any judge this quiet room with the round clock ticking above the eagle there was a stir to the left in a long black line the judges came slowly in chief justice fuller hale and hearty at sixty nine his white hair worn long after the western fashion how tiny he was in front of harlan john marshall harlan of kentucky the giant who had been in the court since 77 last of the tobacco spitting judges holmes called him next to harlan was white of louisiana the sugar planter veteran of the rebel army dark haired with a square stubborn head slowly the nine walked to their places brewer of kansas brown of michigan the judge next to brown was peckham of new york then came somebody fanny could not place and then standing next to wendell was a man with a face like lincoln s whiskers all round under his chin that was mckenna of california oyezl oyezl oyezl the honorable court is now sitting fanny holmes looking up at her husband was swept with sudden deep emotion it was not only that wendell was so handsome standing there straight and tall in his robes but they had done right to come whatever might arrive whatever fate had in store for him and for her in this sprawling city of strangers they had done right to come they had done right to leave home break away cut off the associations of a lifetime fanny holmes had always felt it but now she knew it and rejoiced gazing up at her husband from under her prim dotted veil fanny felt tears surge to her eyes hot and overflowing washington in 1903 was the most exuberant place on the civilized earth and in the center of it in the midst of all this ferment of a new century a new era theodore roosevelt stirred the mixture with his big stick busting the trusts curbing monopoly shaking his fist grinning from newspaper cartoons one eye on the matter in hand one on the presidential convention next year in chicago newspapermen had never had a president who was such copy everything he did was spectacular the sunday afternoon hikes through rock creek park with the french ambassador panting behind in lavender kid gloves pour i honneur de la prance the ambassador had remarked resignedly throwing off his clothes preparatory to swimming the creek after the president the country liked it the plain people especially the west almost forgetting bryan was glad of a leader who was not afraid of wall street but the captains of industry captains of railroads and captains in wall street looked with anger and apprehension upon the dude cowboy who had promised to continue unchanged the policies of his predecessor mckinley when theodore roosevelt did not like a thing he instantly set about legislating it out of existence to him the legal and political points of view were one and the same it did not occur to him that there were men among them a new court appointee from massachusetts who looked upon the thing far differently what the boys like about roosevelt a senator said is that he doesn t care a damn for the law neither did the country what the country desired just now was neither legality nor reason but revenge let t r smash somebody big make an example of him a meat packer the sugar trust anybody or anything so long as there was action the country had not long to wait looking round roosevelt seized upon the biggest newest railroad merger of them all the northern securities company asked his attorney general to investigate its legality under the sherman act knox went ahead and in february 1902 news of a suit against the northern securities company burst upon the captains of industry like a declaration of war the stock market plunged downward doesn t your friend a railroad man asked owen wister in philadelphia ever think in washington henry adams answered the question roosevelt he said from head to foot was pure act and on the other side of lafayette square the new justice from massachusetts watched a trifle sardonically while his president wielded the big stick the sherman antitrust act obviously was going to be roosevelt s favorite weapon and holmes had always disliked the act the sherman act isn t fair he said often it won t let the strong man win the race besides mere bigness didn t make a merger unconstitutional how it behaved what it did made its existence legal or illegal theodore roosevelt greeting holmes in washington was well pleased with his new justice the presidential handshake was hearty what extraordinary charm the man had holmes thought leaving the white house one october afternoon that wide infectious grin there was nothing enigmatic about it certainly energy like that pugnaciousness like that was a basic talent and how it served the man roosevelt got things done and there was evident sincerity about him sincerity the word brought holmes up short it was a vague word and suspect what had that young fellow from harvard said the other night that was so good one must always remember that t r s sincerityis of a contemporary nature walking through the white house grounds in the clear october sunlight holmes quickened his step impatiently how a man even an old fellow like himself got taken in by praise by friendliness from high or low t r was a politician he had to be it was in the nature of his job 26 on december 14 1903 the case of the northern securities company v the united states reached the supreme court the country turned its eyes eastward this obviously was a test case would the court dissolve the huge railroad merger planned by the nation s greatest businessmen or would the merger slip through as so many other corporate plans had slipped through never mind legalities and technicalities the question was whether the government of the united states lay in wall street or washington this was a good time to find out the courtroom was filled that noonday with congressmen diplomats judges lawyers from every state in the union all the justices were present except brown who was kept at home by an affliction of the eyes reporters noted a fair number of ladies mrs roosevelt mrs lodge mrs knox wife of the prosecuting attorney general and mrs holmes crowded behind the bar stood the plain people pushing in until the room would hold no more the northern securities company had a whole battery of lawyers and when john g johnson of philadelphia got up to speak even the reporters from the radical papers conceded the rugged strength and distinction of his appearance beside him the dapper little attorney general seemed a mere david going out to battle reporters noted also justice holmes handsomest man on the bench tall and broad shouldered carefully dressed with the manners of a courtier and the humor of his father but today there was time for neither humor nor courtliness john g johnson stood up in his seat third from the end justice holmes took out notebook and pencil this johnson began was prosecution under a criminal law were the achievements of james j hill the acts of a criminal here was an american who had done extraordinary service to his country born to obscurity almost to poverty asking favor of no one he had become perhaps the greatest railroad man in our nation through untrodden country he had laid his rails from minot to the great falls of the missouri through the rocky mountains down to tidewater at tacoma washington now his steamers carried american produce to china and the far east and through all this wild country where his railroads ran hill had developed the land irrigated the dry spaces bred fine cattle by the thousand hogs and steers and sheep giving them to the western farmers to improve their stock here johnson implied was no smug executive sitting at his desk directing the fate of thousands here was a man who got out and sweated working with his hands like any other good american this of course was not law but oratory justice holmes s pencil poised waiting johnson describing his hero client had by no means reached what holmes was pleased to call the point of contact the formula the place where the boy got his finger pinched in the machinery yet what he said interested holmes who had always admired jim hill of the massive brow the overwhelming energy the pioneer s daring no one not even the bryanites accused hill of dishonesty but they accused him of power and that was enough in holmes s mind the question hovered was power mere bigness illegal under the sherman act the northern securities company johnson s voice went on is enlarging commerce not restraining it holmes s pencil began to write the court would recall johnson said the favorable ruling in the antitrust case of knight v the united states from time to time one of the judges interrupted reporters came instantly awake what a judge said might reveal which way he was going to vote johnson mentioned the thousands involved in the transaction and justice harlan bent his huge bulk forward the figures of the report he said spoke not of thousands but of millions yes your honor johnson said quickly you see i am not given to exaggeration spectators smiled johnson was a wizard but justice harlan it was pretty certain would vote with the government as for the argument of the attorney general people scarcely needed to listen was not this the public s own argument translated into legal terms when a trust got too big bust it never mind if it called itself a merger a trust or a holding company never mind the technicalities the laws of new jersey and minnesota bust the trust before it strangled its competitors prove to the people that wall street was not master the lawyers finished gathered up their papers the judges rose and the people standing waited for them to go then spread noisily to the street it might be months before a decision was announced to hell with all these lawyers and their arguments if the company won the case then t r s big stick was a willow wand and the party had better nominate mark hanna for president in june theodore roosevelt himself counting over his nine judges was well satisfied he would win by a 7 to 2 decision or at worst a 6 to 3 a righteously aroused public opinion would surely react upon what t r might have called the conscience of the court let the judges look to their conscience and settle this case as it should be settled the atmosphere was auspicious for victory concerning his new judicial appointee from massachusetts the president had no doubts holmes s labor decisions in boston notably vegelahn v guntner and the later case of plant v woods showed clearly where his sympathies lay the president could not have been more mistaken to holmes the supreme court existed for the purpose of interpreting the statutes according to the constitution of the united states not as a whipping post for malefactors of great or little wealth if the northern securities company was proved under the sherman act to be in restraint of trade it should be dissolved if not it should stand all this pressure of public opinion served merely to cloud the issue holmes it was true had said again and again that judges must bear in mind the economic changes in society the felt necessities of the time but that was a very different matter from being stampeded by a public opinion which the exigencies of the movement dubbed righteous if the public would come out frankly and say it desired to sock the rich it would be holmes thought far more admirable than this pretense of using the courts to call the rich illegal simply because they were rich as for the conscience of the court a court that ruled according to its conscience would be no court at all law was neither morality nor politics nor expediency nor art theodore roosevelt obviously chose whichever definition suited the moment it was march before the decision was ready in the intervening three months every precaution had been taken against leakage the public was not even supposed to know what day to expect the decision nevertheless on march 14 1904 when the nine justices walked to their seats at noon they found the courtroom jammed with spectators justice harlan began to read the majority opinion the northern securities company was in restraint of trade no scheme came more certainly within the words of the sherman antitrust law this device of morgan and hill would suppress free competition among railroads and it would be impossible for congress to protect the public against further exactions there was a stir in the courtroom the government had won what the newspapers wanted to know was how did the votes lie they soon found out the vote was 5 to 4 in itself a surprise but to those who considered themselves especially knowing the greatest surprise of all was justice holmes s dissent not merely the fact that he had voted against the government against dissolution of the company but his words which were outspoken and very strong great cases like hard cases make bad law for great cases are called great not by reason of their real importance in shaping the law of the future but because of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment these immediate interests exercise a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes what previously was clear seem doubtful and before which even wellsettled principles of law will bend we must read the words before us as if the question were whether two small exporting grocers shall go to jail there is a natural feeling that somehow or other the statute meant to strike at combinations great enough to cause just anxiety on the part of those who love their country more than money while it viewed such little ones as i supposed with just indifferenee this notion it may be said somehow breathes from the pores of the act in the first place size in the case of railroads is an inevitable incident in the ease of railroads it is evident that the size of the combination is reached for other ends than those which could make them monopolies of the majority of the court only four concurred in harlan s opinion justice brewer had written a separate opinion holmes was happy to know therefore he went on that only a minority of his brethren had adopted an interpretation of the law which in his opinion would make eternal the helium omnium contra omnes and disintegrate society so far as it could into individual atoms if that were its intent i should regard calling such a law a regulation of commerce as a mere pretense it would be an attempt to reconst ruct society i am not concerned with the wisdom of such an attempt but i believe that congress was not entrusted by the constitution with the power to make it and i am deeply persuaded that it has not tried i am authorized to say that the chief justice mr justice white and mr justice peckham concur in this dissent theodore roosevelt heard the decision of the court and was jubilant the suit he said was one of the greatest achievements of his administration the knight case had been overruled the northern securities company was dissolved the power of the government against the monopolies was established the government roosevelt called it we had gained the power but it was a crime that the decision had been so close judge holmes s dissent in particular was outrageous what did the man mean turning against him that way obviously holmes had simply lost his nerve i could carve out of a banana shouted t r a judge with more backbone than that holmes himself cared nothing whatever about the presidential reactions he was in fact as angry as the president years later he wrote to pollock about it it broke up our incipient friendship however as he looked on my dissent as a political departure or i suspect more truly couldn t forgive anyone who stood in his way we talked freely later but it was never the same after that and if he had not been restrained by his friends i am told that he would have made a fool of himself and would have excluded me from the white house i never cared a damn whether i went there or not he was very likeable a big figure a rather ordinary intellect with extraordinary gifts a shrewd and i think pretty unscrupulous politician he played all his cards if not more in march 1904 feeling ran high after the northern securities decision not only in washington but all over the country wall street had been dreading the decision now that it came stocks went down most certainly this would be only the prelude t r would not stop with one victory there was to be a presidential election in the fall as usual the roosevelt luck held and his only formidable rival in the party mark hanna died in february in june the republican convention met in chicago and nominated the trust buster by acclamation four months later roosevelt was elected over bryan by the largest popular and electoral majority to date and on march 4 1905 nine supreme court justices sat on a windy platform outside the capitol building while the president was sworn in the older a justice got the more he dreaded this quadrennial exposure it was a matter for pneumonia and the ague oliver wendell holmes shivering watched a trifle sardonically while chief justice fuller his white hair lifted by an icy wind administered the oath the dude cowboy was back in the white house with the people s mandate behind him there would be no stopping the slaughter now in cartoon after cartoon newspapers took up the crusade lhe fat trusts in their traditional costume of checked waistcoat and fancy watch chain the cheese trust the meat trust the sugar trust talked behind their hands watching across the room nine black gowned figures the supreme court they whisper is a nervy bunch those judges should be abolished the anti rebate law went through the employers liability act the door to the white house t r shouted shall swing open just as easily to the poor as to the rich and not one bit easier the hepburn rate law went through in philadelphia holmes s friend owen wister desiring to ride to new york in the engineer s cab went to dewitt cuyler for a pass wister must buy a ticket cuyler said genially the halcyon day of free passes was done 11 we have to be good now we have to be good now but if theodore roosevelt was out to bust the trusts the corporations themselves were out to bust the labor unions and to outwit also where they could the new state laws regulating the hours of workmen ten hour laws eight hour laws why if the employers didn t look sharp the courts would lorget all about freedom of contract the police power of the states would prevail over that sacred and conveniently misty phrase of the fourteenth amendment due process of law to justice holmes combination on the one side was as lawful within limits as on the other in the northern securities dissent he had upheld the side of capital although he would have disliked to hear it called a side now a year later he was to uphold the other the right of a state to regulate the hours of labor holmes s dissent in the lochner case was among his most significant utterances in court it heralded a long and noble list of such dissents opinions which were to prove him old though he was far younger in spirit than his brethren at once prophetic in vision and tough minded in the law the fact that holmes s most famous opinions were dissenting opinions by no means sets him down as a rebel or a no sayer holmes always regretted the necessity of dissenting believing that too many dissents detract from the prestige of the court but the blunt fact remained that in a period of vast and almost revolutionary social change holmes found himself on the bench with a majority so conservative as to be not merely stubborn but blind he had to voice his dissent to remain silent would have been to shirk his duty moreover it was not the number of his dissents that won for holmes the title of the great dissenter some of his brethren dissented more often than he did it was the quality of holmes s dissents that made them famous it was what he said and how he said it when a judge writes a majority opinion he is speaking for the court but when he dissents he has a chance to say what he really thinks and these individual expressions play a very significant part in the function of the supreme court a dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal to the brooding spirit of the law to the intelligence of a future day when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed the lochner dissent was most certainly such an appeal and as certainly it became years later the majority opinion and therefore the law of the land the lochner case concerned moreover a conviction that holmes held very deeply the conviction that under the constitution the states have a right to make their own social experiments when these experiments these state laws conflict with federal authority then let the case be decided not on the basis of whether the supreme court believes the law concerned to be a good law or a bad law let it be decided solely on the basis of whether the constitution forbids it i strongly believe holmes said from the bench that my agreement or disagreement with a certain economic theory has nothing to do with the right of the majority to embody their opinions in law whether these theories these economic experiments resulted in disaster was not holmes thought a judge s business just now in 1905 the experiments tended all towards combination collectivism and whether the combination was of capital as in the northern securities case or of labor wishing to protect itself by state laws as in the lochner case at all events let the experiments be made let those men who fearing experiment desire to preserve the status quo be they judges capitalists or laboring men not hide behind the sherman act or the vague phrases of the due process clause the lochner suit was a perfect case in point new york state had passed a law prohibiting more than ten hours work a day in bakeries a bakery in utica belonging to a man named lochner broke the law twice and was fined for it lochner appealed on the ground that the tenhour law was class legislation favoring the workers it denied said lochner s counsel equal protection of the laws justice holmes listening to the defendant s long harangue summed up the case before mr lochner s lawyer had been at it ten minutes the judges went into conference voted 5 to 4 in favor of lochner justice beckham wrote the majority opinion and on april 17 1905 announced it in court the ten hour law he declared was a meddlesome interference the spread of such laws in the various states was deplorable the men who passed this particular law had called it a health protective measure but surely their real motive had not been the manufacture of healthy bread their motive had been to regulate the hours of labor which then should prevail the police power of a state or freedom of contract in other words should the individual be a slave to the state or should he remain free under the constitution to manage his factory as he pleased what justice peekham defended was not merely the right of one employer to work his bakers more than ten hours a day he was defending a whole social system he did not once use the words laissez faire he did not need to obviously laissez faire was the social system he favored was indeed the only system he recognized revolutions bad been fought to achieve it herbert spencer had endorsed it it had sufficed for a hundred years and more under it our country had grown great and fat why endanger the system then with these interfering laws clean and wholesome bread said justice peckham serenely does not depend on whether a baker works but ten hours per day or only sixty hours a week almost anywhere else rufus peekham could have spoken these words with little harm done but the majority opinion of the supreme court becomes the law of the land it creates a precedent that may sway future courts for decades justice peekham giving voice to the majority opinion in favor of mr lochner who worked his bakers more than ten hours a day was fixing the fate of workingmen for a generation to come oliver wendell holmes was only three years younger than his esteemed colleague from new york it was not youth then which told him that economic systems are far from indestructible he had been brought up like peckham under the most favorable circumstances which the social concept of laissez faire could create yet holmes felt that the system was dead at heart a giant industrial society was busy making its own new pattern when justice peekham had finished holmes rustled his papers leaned forward and began to read his dissent the first line of it gave the gist of what he was going to say this case is decided upon an economic theory which a large part of the country docs not entertain it is settled by various decisions of this court that state constitutions and state laws may regulate life in many ways which we as legislators might think injudicious the liberty of the citizen to do as he likes so long as he does not interfere with the liberty of others to do the same which has been a shibboleth for some well known writers is interfered with by the school laws by the post office by every state or municipal institution which takes his money for purposes thought desirable whether he likes it or not the fourteent h amendment does not enact mr herbert spencer s social statics the other day we sustained the massachusetts vaccination law the decision sustaining an eighthour law for miners is still recent some of these laws embody convictions or prejudices which judges are likely to share some may not but a constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state or of laissez faire it is made for people of fundamentally differing views and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the constitution of the united states there were fighting words and to that portion of the nation which understood them they were words of hope onthecourt there was no other man equipped to say them the people have a right to make their own mistakes a man poles apart from holmes had spoken these words a decade earlier william jennings bryan demagogue and inspired rabble rouser who was far closer to the people than holmes was when he gave the lochner dissent in 1905 yet in different ways and from different spheres the two had said the same thing but the conviction that breathes from the lochner dissent is neither the oratory of the demagogue nor the hot fury of the reformer of a brandeis angry because laboring men are being exploited it is rather the cold clear anger of the intellectual who believes that freedom means above all the right to experiment this was holmes s stand in the past thirteen months he had given voice to two important dissents one on the side of capital one on the side of labor the people did not think of him so far as one of their great judges their great men it would be a long time indeed before the people became really aware of justice oliver wendell holmes but he had taken his stand it was calm it was consistent it stemmed from intellectual conviction and it was a stand the nation could count on him to sustain for twenty six years until at the age of ninety he would leave the court forever with this installment which ends in the year 1905 the atlantic brings to a close the serialization of mrs bowen
