the bulk of committee work on a 3 5 trillion package of social benefits and climate programs a massive undertaking that advances what would be a legacy defining domestic agenda for president biden now the harder part begins while 13 separate committees succeeded in drafting massaging and ultimately approving the portions of the package under their jurisdiction the process featured plenty of infighting between disparate factions over various provisions differences that have created headaches for democratic leaders and will need resolving before the legislation hits the floor those clashes have threatened to sink a major cost slashing drug benefit risking liberal defections and potentially alienating moderates if deficit estimates swell as a result a separate battle over tax benefits risks an erosion of support from a handful of democrats in high income regions enough to bring the legislation to a halt the combination is raising new questions about whether house leaders have the votes to pass the package on the floor with a minuscule majority and that s all before the looming fight in the evenly split senate where democrats can afford zero defections the hill s mike lillis

despite the slogans the polling and even the infamous white ballgown democrats appear to be getting cold feet on taxing the rich the democratic party has repeatedly pledged to make the rich pony up their pledge is partly about fairness massive income and wealth gains have accrued to the tippy top over recent decades while effective tax rates for this same population have fallen it s also partly about fiscal responsibility the party wants to pay for safety net and climate investments so like willie sutton they re going where the money is finally it s about politics polling suggests broad public support for raising taxes on the rich but even if most americans say they support taxing the rich the people whom democrats consider rich these days are a teeny and vanishing group advertisement then president barack obama said households making 250 000 or more were sufficiently well heeled to tolerate a tax hike president biden has raised the threshold to at least 400 000 according to rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y she of the tax the rich gown rich people worthy of higher taxation are instead only those with hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions of dollars not a doctor or a lawyer follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow for context the average u s doctor has annual wages of 221 000 per the bureau of labor statistics that s roughly quadruple the average wage across all occupations physicians are among the professions most likely to fall in the top 1 percent so why has democrats definition of rich narrowed over time americans including those of means have long preferred to think of themselves as middle class plus in recent years the democratic base has changed becoming increasingly college educated and well off it s uncomfortable for democratic politicians to tell these higher income constituents that they are objectively higher income particularly when astronomically richer people such as bill gates exist advertisement all this has caused problems for democrats as they craft their bill on social spending and the climate which they say they want to pay for already biden s 400 000 cutoff which rules out tax hikes on more than 95 percent of americans had limited funding options but democrats have been reluctant to levy some of the tax hikes that biden did ask for for instance biden proposed raising the capital gains rate so that income derived from wealth is treated the same as income from work house democrats bill is considerably weaker instead raising the top capital gains rate only a few percentage points biden also proposed closing one of the most valuable tax breaks for the ultrawealthy a provision called the stepped up basis most of the time people must pay capital gains taxes when they sell an appreciated asset such as microsoft stock but there s a death loophole a person can bequeath that stock to his heirs without either the original owner or the heirs ever having to pay taxes on how much the stock rose during the original owner s life advertisement this is a huge boon to anyone with dynastic level wealth since it means their fortunes can escape capital gains taxes it also distorts investment decisions since it encourages people to hold on to assets until they die biden proposed dealing with the loophole by taxing unrealized capital gains at death with the first 1 million of unrealized gains exempted plus some other exceptions but in the face of aggressive lobbying house democrats scrapped his proposal congressional democrats have agreed to increase funding for the internal revenue service as biden asked but not to require more third party reporting critical for helping the agency catch rich tax cheats as biden also requested democrats are mulling even more tax breaks for the wealthy including repealing the limits on state and local tax salt deductions proponents claim this would help the middle class in reality because of the way this provision interacts with other parts of the tax code households making 1 million or more a year would receive half the benefit according to the tax policy center 70 percent of the benefit would go to households making 500 000 or more of course those high income households are disproportionately in democratic states advertisement sometimes this soaking of the rich could be mistaken for a warm bath meanwhile some socially valuable pay fors such as carbon or gas taxes are off the table because they would affect households making less than 400 000 perplexingly democrats have simultaneously argued tobacco and nicotine taxes wouldn t violate this rule even though such taxes are disproportionately paid by lower income people apparently the only people democrats reliably count as rich these days are billionaires hundred millionaires and smokers yes democrats plan to raise top rates on personal and corporate income taxes that s not nothing but it s not nearly sufficient to pay for the generous welfare state democrats want to build paying for that would ultimately require levying higher taxes on the middle class too as other countries with more expansive safety nets do
a big recommendation and price target upgrade shifted the company into the fast lane what happened shares of vehicle rental incumbent avis budget group car 0 92 zoomed into the speeding lane on thursday accelerating nearly 10 higher that was due to a significant change in a recommendation from a high profile bank so what thursday morning bank of america securities analyst john murphy upped his recommendation on the stock to buy from the previous neutral in doing so he also pushed the gas pedal on his price target which is now 125 per share from 90 at the new level the stock now has nearly 27 potential upside even after today s big gain avis stock has been on a tear of late as demand for rental vehicles has risen notably as an increasingly vaccinated population longs to break their stay at home isolation for some travel elsewhere or at least a decent road trip more locally compounding that disruptions in the supply chain have curtailed the output of new vehicles this cranks prices for rentals murphy feels that this dynamic won t melt away anytime soon many of the macro factors driving over earning by the company in 2021 will likely persist well into 2022 he wrote in his latest research note on avis combined with ongoing execution by avis this should result in upward revisions to 2022 and beyond estimates that do not appear appreciated by the stock murphy added now what murphy s argument is certainly convincing and is compounded by the fact that avis is basically the only viable auto rental company traded on the stock market if anything this new analysis understates the case as supply chain issues have a way of persisting once coronavirus case and fatality figures start to drop meaningfully demand should get commensurately stronger
just a few hours before president joe biden gave his class warfare pitch to level the playing field as he calls it punish success though he denies it and falsely charge that wealthy people and large companies don t pay any taxes all of which is far left progressive woke democratic pap with not an ounce of truth in any of it just a few hours before we had to sit through all of this the commerce department retail sales release was a blowout instead of down big from wall street the number was up big even taking out the glitch for lower car sales the number was even bigger than anyone dreamed of and the core retail sales number that feeds into gdp came up even bigger than all of that in recent days we had a big release for industrial production manufacturing and business equipment spending regional fed manufacturing surveys are strong the ism supply managers are strong biden s 3 5t spending bill would let gov t spy on wealthy s bank accounts the 11 million unfilled jobs demand for workers is strong off the chart and broad inflation measures may be simmering but still running at a too high 4 now with all that president biden with a straight face tells the nation this afternoon we need a 6 trillion federal spending package really do you think anybody in their right mind believes that is there any common sense to this story at all playing the class warfare card is not going to work polls show clearly that the nation favors free enterprise capitalism not big government socialism do you think there s a groundswell of support for picking out small businesses and punishing them with the worst tax increases in the ways and means package do you think that working folks want the u s to have the highest corporate tax among developed countries we would be number 1 except for columbia and portugal china will be substantially lower is that what we want china with a capital gains tax that will be over 40 effectively again much higher than china is that what ordinary folks want or how about this we ve had record profits in recent years and record corporate tax payments on those record profits following the trump tax cuts of 2017 mr biden telling folks today that big companies don t pay taxes is utter nonsense cognitive dissonance people know that s not true the government stats show it s not true now here s a key point on profits biden and the left may hate profits but profits are the mother s milk of stocks and the lifeblood of the economy if businesses large and small aren t making money then they can t expand in fact they ll have to lay off workers and surely cut wages our pal dan clifton estimates that the ways and means bill could cut s p 500 profits by a hundred billion dollars nearly half of the expected profit gain next year that means no wage increases for the blue collar middle class workforce that means no investment in new business equipment and technology to make the workforce more productive and that means going back to the zero stagnation days for family income that was the hallmark of the obama biden period before trump s tax cuts dem plan could push combined rates beyond 60 for taxpayers that s right tax companies and you will go into wage stagnation and you will slow the entire economy down the biden plan will throw a wet blanket over a very healthy pandemic recovery you know if it ain t broke don t fix it smart policy would make the trump tax cuts permanent because they work so well for record low unemployment including women and minorities and record high real wages and record declines in poverty and income inequality mr biden wants to level the playing field that suggests to me he wants to make all of us poorer not more prosperous i don t like leveling i like increasing i like opportunity i like rewarding success these are all reasons why i firmly believe we must save america by killing the bill there s more a lot more to say but i want to get to republican house leader kevin mccarthy get fox business on the go by clicking here just let me note finally that all these good left wing intentions to increase subsidies for childcare dependent care nutrition the child tax credit free community college more obamacare more medicaid more more more none of these mores have a single workfare requirement none this is government welfare dependency on a grand scale this cuts to the very heart of america s social fabric which the dems want to transform into big government socialism and in some sectors like healthcare and energy they literally want to take over the means of production more insanity so i ll conclude save the country kill the bill this article is adapted from larry kudlow s commentary on the sept 16 2021 edition of kudlow
a short seller s stinging twitter diatribe against the company continues to affect investor sentiment what happened for the second day in a row biotech stock berkeley lights bli suffered a big investor sell off falling by almost 12 on thursday even though an analyst tracking the stock issued a bullish new research note on the company it continued to experience the fallout from a sharply worded tweet storm delivered by a short seller so what scorpion capital s six tweet thread was published early on wednesday and it accused berkeley lights of fleecing both its customers and investors of its recent ipo the short seller said that it interviewed 14 of the company s largest clients all of whom conveyed that its lead product cell analysis and processing device beacon is doa and a flop in reaction to this btig analyst mark massaro issued a new research note in which he reiterated both his existing buy rating on the stock of the biotech and his 65 per share price target he also stressed that in a set of june interviews btig conducted with three top company customers the tone and substance of our conversations with the same users were starkly different our customer checks unveiled that bli provides major time savings in months to the world s largest biopharma companies which in our view more than justifies the 2 price tag for the bli beacon system given user testimonials that time is money massaro continued cowen analyst doug schenkel also reiterated his company s equivalent of a buy recommendation writing in a new note that the stock price sell off in the wake of scorpion s accusations might be a bit much now what unfortunately for berkeley lights neither update seems to be convincing the market that the stock is a safe buy what might be affecting the sentiment is the company s lack of official reaction to scorpion s charges this could at least somewhat calm investor nerves

a top senate democrat has been circulating a proposal that would hit the rapidly growing world of exchange traded funds big money managers are bracing for a fight senate finance committee chairman ron wyden s proposal aims to tax etfs use of in kind transactions that currently avoids triggering capital gains taxes with such in kind transactions etfs bundles of securities that trade on exchanges transfer appreciated stock bonds or other assets to wall street intermediaries instead of cash by closing a decades old tax regulation loophole the proposal stands to eliminate one of the etf industry s key selling points tax efficiency this proposed change has spurred a rush to mobilize among the largest asset managers some of whom have built their businesses around the etf industry etfs have become big capital gains deferral machines said jeffrey colon a professor at fordham university school of law who has researched this topic etfs are able to avoid taxes with in kind transactions thanks to a tax exemption intended for mutual funds created long before etfs existed the ability of these funds to do in kind redemptions of appreciated property is being weaponized and used in a way that congress surely couldn t have intended he said the impact of the proposal would largely fall on etfs rather than mutual funds which largely distribute assets to investors in cash over the past decade etfs have boomed in popularity with assets of such u s registered funds quintupling to 5 4 trillion by the end of 2020 according to the investment company institute investors have turned to etfs because of their low fees tax benefits easy trading and broad market exposure cathie wood s ark invest files to offer a bitcoin etf the proposal would result in funds passing on capital gains to millions of investors in the funds asset managers are scrambling to respond if the proposal appears to be going somewhere it s going to be defcon 1 for the etf industry said jeremy senderowicz a partner at law firm vedder price pc which represents several etf firms the proposal has yet to make its way into any formal legislative plan it is part of a slew of suggestions oregon s mr wyden shared with house and senate democrats for discussion as they look to fund an ambitious spending agenda if other tax proposals lose political support on wednesday the house ways and means committee voted 24 19 to advance a plan that would generate more than 2 trillion that would go toward expanding medicare increasing renewable energy tax breaks and creating a national paid leave program among other items rep stephanie murphy d fla joined republicans in opposition the changes targeting in kind transactions by funds are expected to generate just over 200 billion over a decade according to preliminary estimates by the joint committee on taxation that were shared with sen wyden s office industry lobby groups from ici to securities industry and financial markets association are strategizing on how to topple the proposal ici is soliciting feedback from firms among key ici statistics starting to circulate and become echoed by various lobbyists and executives is that nearly 12 million u s households own etfs and the median income of these households is 125 000 that is well below the income level democrats are targeting for tax increases some asset managers are saying that the proposal would unintentionally saddle long term investors with a higher tax bill than short term traders blackrock inc said it was looking into the proposal we would be concerned about policies that would raise costs and reduce returns for long term investors and retirement savers and are carefully reviewing sen wyden s proposal to better understand how it will impact millions of long term investors said a spokesman the in kind trades that this proposal targets are a vital part of the multitrillion dollar industry every day banks buy baskets of instruments to exchange for shares of etfs or vice versa keeping etf prices in line with their underlying investments get fox business on the go by clicking here in some cases fund managers will engineer in kind trades to help manage tax burdens of the fund while also rebalancing the funds so they track indexes a fund manager could instruct a bank to steer big inflows in and out of a fund these flows resemble spikes and troughs in an electrocardiogram and are known in the industry as heartbeat trades in the process the etfs shed shares that might otherwise trigger a taxable gain these trades which can be outsize and visible were among the issues that prompted sen wyden s office to pay closer attention to the tax advantages of etfs in the past two years a spokeswoman for sen wyden said that the proposed rule would affect those that invest in etfs through taxable brokerages while those in tax sheltered accounts such as individual retirement accounts wouldn t be affected invesco ltd a large etf manager in a statement said the firm strongly disagrees with the premise of the proposed legislation portraying etfs as an investment for the wealthy goes against the nature of the vehicle s potential benefits and those who are

as the most consumed material after water concrete is indispensable to the many essential systems from roads to buildings in which it is used but due to its extensive use concrete production also contributes to around 1 percent of emissions in the united states and remains one of several carbon intensive industries globally tackling climate change then will mean reducing the environmental impacts of concrete even as its use continues to increase in a new paper in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences a team of current and former researchers at the mit concrete sustainability hub cshub outlines how this can be achieved they present an extensive life cycle assessment of the building and pavements sectors that estimates how greenhouse gas ghg reduction strategies including those for concrete and cement could minimize the cumulative emissions of each sector and how those reductions would compare to national ghg reduction targets the team found that if reduction strategies were implemented the emissions for pavements and buildings between 2016 and 2050 could fall by up to 65 percent and 57 percent respectively even if concrete use accelerated greatly over that period these are close to u s reduction targets set as part of the paris climate accords the solutions considered would also enable concrete production for both sectors to attain carbon neutrality by 2050 despite continued grid decarbonization and increases in fuel efficiency they found that the vast majority of the ghg emissions from new buildings and pavements during this period would derive from operational energy consumption rather than so called embodied emissions emissions from materials production and construction sources and solutions the consumption of concrete due to its versatility durability constructability and role in economic development has been projected to increase around the world while it is essential to consider the embodied impacts of ongoing concrete production it is equally essential to place these initial impacts in the context of the material s life cycle due to concrete s unique attributes it can influence the long term sustainability performance of the systems in which it is used concrete pavements for instance can reduce vehicle fuel consumption while concrete structures can endure hazards without needing energy and materials intensive repairs concrete s impacts then are as complex as the material itself a carefully proportioned mixture of cement powder water sand and aggregates untangling concrete s contribution to the operational and embodied impacts of buildings and pavements is essential for planning ghg reductions in both sectors set of scenarios in their paper cshub researchers forecast the potential greenhouse gas emissions from the building and pavements sectors as numerous emissions reduction strategies were introduced between 2016 and 2050 since both of these sectors are immense and rapidly evolving modeling them required an intricate framework we don t have details on every building and pavement in the united states explains randolph kirchain a research scientist at the materials research laboratory and co director of cshub as such we began by developing reference designs which are intended to be representative of current and future buildings and pavements these were adapted to be appropriate for 14 different climate zones in the united states and then distributed across the u s based on data from the u s census and the federal highway administration to reflect the complexity of these systems their models had to have the highest resolutions possible in the pavements sector we collected the current stock of the u s network based on high precision 10 mile segments along with the surface conditions traffic thickness lane width and number of lanes for each segment says hessam azarijafari a postdoc at cshub and a co author on the paper to model future paving actions over the analysis period we assumed four climate conditions four road types asphalt concrete and composite pavement structures as well as major minor and reconstruction paving actions specified for each climate condition using this framework they analyzed a projected and an ambitious scenario of reduction strategies and system attributes for buildings and pavements over the 34 year analysis period the scenarios were defined by the timing and intensity of ghg reduction strategies as its name might suggest the projected scenario reflected current trends for the building sector solutions encompassed expected grid decarbonization and improvements to building codes and energy efficiency that are currently being implemented across the country for pavements the sole projected solution was improvements to vehicle fuel economy that s because as vehicle efficiency continues to increase excess vehicle emissions due to poor road quality will also decrease both the projected scenarios for buildings and pavements featured the gradual introduction of low carbon concrete strategies such as recycled content carbon capture in cement production and the use of captured carbon to produce aggregates and cure concrete in the ambitious scenario explains kirchain we went beyond projected trends and explored reasonable changes that exceed current policies and commitments here the building sector strategies were the same but implemented more aggressively the pavements sector also abided by more aggressive targets and incorporated several novel strategies including investing more to yield smoother roads selectively applying concrete overlays to produce stiffer pavements and introducing more reflective pavements which can change the earth s energy balance by sending more energy out of the atmosphere results as the grid becomes greener and new homes and buildings become more efficient many experts have predicted the operational impacts of new construction projects to shrink in comparison to their embodied emissions what our life cycle assessment found says jeremy gregory the executive director of the mit climate consortium and the lead author on the paper is that isn t necessarily the case instead we found that more than 80 percent of the total emissions from new buildings and pavements between 2016 and 2050 would derive from their operation in fact the study found that operations will create the majority of emissions through 2050 unless all energy sources electrical and thermal are carbon neutral by 2040 this suggests that ambitious interventions to the electricity grid and other sources of operational emissions can have the greatest impact their predictions for emissions reductions generated additional insights for the building sector they found that the projected scenario would lead to a reduction of 49 percent compared to 2016 levels and that the ambitious scenario provided a 57 percent reduction as most buildings during the analysis period were existing rather than new energy consumption dominated emissions in both scenarios consequently decarbonizing the electricity grid and improving the efficiency of appliances and lighting led to the greatest improvements for buildings they found in contrast to the building sector the pavements scenarios had a sizeable gulf between outcomes the projected scenario led to only a 14 percent reduction while the ambitious scenario had a 65 percent reduction enough to meet u s paris accord targets for that sector this gulf derives from the lack of ghg reduction strategies being pursued under current projections the gap between the pavement scenarios shows that we need to be more proactive in managing the ghg impacts from pavements explains kirchain there is tremendous potential but seeing those gains requires action now these gains from both ambitious scenarios could occur even as concrete use tripled over the analysis period in comparison to the projected scenarios a reflection of not only concrete s growing demand but its potential role in decarbonizing both sectors though only one of their reduction scenarios the ambitious pavement scenario met the paris accord targets that doesn t preclude the achievement of those targets many other opportunities exist in this study we focused on mainly embodied reductions for concrete explains gregory but other construction materials could receive similar treatment further reductions could also come from retrofitting existing buildings and by designing structures with durability hazard resilience and adaptability in mind in order to minimize the need for reconstruction this study answers a paradox in the field of sustainability for the world to become more equitable more development is necessary and yet that very same development may portend greater emissions the mit team found that isn t necessarily the case even as america continues to use more concrete the benefits of the material itself and the interventions made to it can make climate targets more achievable the mit concrete sustainability hub is a team of researchers from several departments across mit working on concrete and infrastructure science

federal regulators announced charges thursday against the sweetwater union high school district and its former chief financial officer for filing filed false reports about tens of millions of dollars in municipal bonds the 11 page complaint filed by the u s securities and exchange commission accused former official karen michel of promoting inaccurate budget projections and misleading investors in a 28 million bond offering in 2018 advertisement michel approved disclosures saying the district would close out the fiscal year with approximately 19 5 million when in fact it was engaged in significant deficit spending and on track to a negative 7 2 million ending fund balance regulators said much of the spending was due to a 3 75 percent pay raise approved in 2018 that the district failed to properly budget for the sec said the district was the subject of a 9 page order instituting a cease and desist order against committing any future violations and agreeing to implement a host of reforms to prevent misstating public offerings going forward advertisement as the order finds sweetwater and michel presented stale and misleading financial information as current and accurate said leeann gaunt chief of the division of enforcement s public finance abuse unit the sec will continue to address deceptive conduct that prevents municipal bond investors from getting an accurate picture of the financial risks of their investments she said the sweetwater union high school district issued a statement that largely recounted terms of the settlement advertisement this settlement resolves all outstanding sec claims against the district and represents another positive step in the district s ongoing remedial efforts to continuously evaluate and improve its fiscal health the statement said the district looks forward to implementing the improvements and changes outlined in the sec s order it concluded it will continue to take steps to ensure it provides accurate disclosures and information to the public michel who resigned in 2018 did not respond to email or phone messages advertisement both the district and the former chief financial officer settled their cases without admitting or denying the allegations the sec said michel agreed to pay a 28 000 fine and to no longer participate in future securities offerings the agreement remains subject to approval by a federal judge the settlement with the district requires officials to hire an independent consultant to evaluate their policies and procedures related to municipal bond disclosures advertisement within six months the district also must establish appropriate and comprehensive written policies for future bond disclosures it also agreed to hire an independent consultant to prepare a written report examining financial statements that report will not be released to the public the sec said because it is likely to contain confidential financial information but the district is obliged to adopt any recommendations from the independent expert within 90 days except those the board considers unduly burdensome impractical or inappropriate advertisement michel was a district veteran of almost 20 years when she was appointed interim chief financial officer in 2013 her appointment followed the brief tenure of albert alt who had been hired from a northern california district earlier that year according to federal regulators michel ran sweetwater s bond program and was authorized to execute all required documents on the district s behalf michel or others acting at her direction were primarily responsible for providing sweetwater s financial information in support of the bond offering the sec order states from february through april 2018 they repeatedly provided misleading interim budget projections to the credit rating agency and potential bond investors advertisement the sweetwater chief financial officer provided inaccurate information to investors and the public even though she knew it to be incorrect regulators said at no point leading up to or following the bond offering did michel or sweetwater disclose to the credit rating agency that actual expenses were trending significantly higher than the projections contained in the first and second interim reports the sec said the bonds subsequently received an a rating with experts telling investors they expected reserves to hold above the 2 percent minimum fund balance and that the district would actively manage its spending to address potential budget gaps advertisement michel retired around september 2018 and the new chief financial officer soon became aware of budget discrepancies totaling millions of dollars the sec said the 2017 18 salary costs alone were almost 19 million above prior estimates and the general fund balance dropped to approximately negative 2 9 million regulators said the audited financials revealed an even worse year end general fund balance of negative 7 2 million based on total deficit spending of approximately 28 7 million the sec stated advertisement the sweetwater union high school district has an average daily attendance of about 36 000 students at more than two dozen middle and high school campuses throughout the south bay the public agency is governed by a five member elected board of trustees that oversees a current year budget of approximately 505 million and about 3 500 employees the district has a history of financial improprieties advertisement ten years ago investigators from the district attorney s office executed search warrants at the homes of four of the five sitting board members by early 2012 then district attorney bonnie dumanis announced 26 felony charges against a slew of current and former sweetwater officials accused of being involved in a widespread pay to play scandal most of the school board members were voted out of office or resigned the former superintendent was convicted and sentenced to seven plus months in jail advertisement more recently the school board fired then superintendent karen janney in august 2020 two months after state auditors found evidence of potential financial fraud across the district janney had been rehired in 2015 to help the district rebound from its previous missteps the u s securities and exchange commission is a regulatory agency meaning it can issue monetary penalties and revoke licenses in cases of misconduct advertisement its regulatory findings may be forwarded to the fbi or the u s department of justice for criminal investigation the sec acknowledged the assistance of the san diego county district attorney s office in preparing its charges

if congress manages to pass president biden s big budget package this fall with most of its spending and tax changes intact it will represent the biggest shift in federal fiscal policy in 40 years if it happens still a big if it will be because congress can circumvent its usual rules and process tax and spending measures via a process called reconciliation that process is a powerhouse capable of major disruptions and changes in government because it offers protection from filibuster reconciliation bills can pass with a simple majority that is why biden and his allies house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer think they have a shot at raising trillions in tax revenue over the next 10 years to pay for their spending priorities democrats propose to raise the needed revenue through borrowing as well as through more robust revenue collections thanks to a beefed up irs but the bulk of it would come from tougher tax treatment and higher tax rates on corporations investors and others whose annual income exceeds 400 000 if they succeed they will be using reconciliation to reverse the direction of federal tax policy which has brought down the top tax rate and made other changes that benefit corporations and the wealthy over the past four decades and they will be doing it with the same process that was used to set that direction four decades ago when first year president ronald reagan used reconciliation to achieve his revolution in federal fiscal policy in 1981 polls have shown americans support higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy tax increases are rarely popular but polling this summer has generally found the public supportive of higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy at the same time reports surfaced that show that mega corporations and ultra rich individuals pay little or nothing in federal income tax for example in june propublica published a trove of tax data leaked from the irs that showed such prominent billionaires as tesla founder elon musk and berkshire hathaway investment guru warren buffett paid little income tax in relation to their vast income gains in some years paying none at all buffett who has campaigned for some democratic candidates has famously said he should not be paying a lower rate than his secretary propublica said the data showed amazon founder jeff bezos realizes billions each year in asset appreciation such as rising stock prices and yet can keep his taxable income so low that one year he qualified for the child tax credit which he took the data which was not authorized for publication covered 15 years and thousands of wealthy taxpayers and in june the new york times reported that tax laws allowed top managers in the private equity industry to prosper to the tune of billions without paying significant taxes relative to their gains audits the newspaper found were almost nonexistent all this feeds into a widening perception that the major moves in taxation over the last several decades have consistently benefited the higher income groups and particularly those with the greatest accumulated wealth there s a growing realization of what has changed in the tax code the nobel laureate economist joseph e stiglitz wrote in 2016 that snowballing changes to the tax code over the past 35 years have prioritized tax cuts and subsidies focused on those at the top placing a greater tax burden on the rest and causing neglect of critical public investments corporations have accomplished some of this tax avoidance by incorporating overseas or realizing some of their profits offshore one prospect for revenue seeking legislators would be an attempt to curtail these practices and reap a tax bonanza it is also possible the eventual legislation will address the step up in basis policy by which inheritors of property escape taxation on its appreciated value such a move has raised objections from rural interests even though the biden administration has pledged to protect family farms it will be hard to get every democrat in the senate and virtually every one of them in the house of representatives to accept the compromises and disappointments sure to be found in an eventual deal but difficult as this is the president and his party would have no shot whatsoever without the reconciliation process and that process got its start as a major mover of federal fiscal policy in 1981 with reagan s first budget it set a pattern that would dominate for the next 40 years culminating in the most recent tax cuts enacted under former president donald trump bob daugherty ap ap lawmakers watch as reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in october 1986 reagan slashed tax rates and sold the idea of supply side economics as an elixir much of the attention at the time went to the deep cuts reagan proposed to social spending programs as well as his historic increases in spending for the military but just as important as where the money was going was a radical reversal on the revenue side reagan proposed not just lowering the federal income tax but slashing it by 10 in year one and by another 10 in each of the next two years as well at the time the top marginal tax rate on the last dollar earned was still 70 an echo of the world war ii taxes that had risen over 90 on paper and remained there in the peak cold war years of course few people paid anything like that rate and those who were subject to it could find ways to reduce their tax exposure but reagan had become convinced that the high marginal rate as much as the weight of the tax burden overall was the problem in his view it penalized success impeded economic growth dampened the nation s entrepreneurial spirit and weakened its work ethic he spoke of it as much as a moral issue as a material one the 10 cuts were across the board as he liked to say implying they were of equal value to all the dollar value of the cuts was of course far larger for those with larger incomes moreover the tax law changes that accompanied the rate cuts made it easier for individuals and corporations to write off various forms of income and spending to lower their tax bills further the tax rate for capital gains money made from successful investing would come down from 28 to 20 reagan did not get everything he sought in this initial foray against high taxes and progressivity the senate trimmed the third year of the tax cut from 10 to 5 and it would take a second bill the tax reform act of 1986 to pull the marginal top rate all the way down to 28 but reagan s tax cuts in 1981 constituted the strongest move away from progressivity in the income tax since the tax was initiated in the civil war they were the culmination of rising anti tax sentiment in the late 1970s when some states adopted tax limitations by popular referendum that spirit was kept alive in the decades to come by groups such as americans for tax reform led by activist grover norquist starting in 1986 norquist has challenged candidates for office to sign his taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes the great majority of republicans have signed reagan pared back progressivity reagan was able to reverse what had been a decades long commitment to at least the look of progressivity he could do it in part because his 1980 election coattails enabled his party to capture control of the senate for the first time in a quarter century moreover while democrats still had a house majority their ranks included scores of members from southern and midwestern districts that had also voted for reagan when the budget resolution passed in that summer of 1981 63 house democrats joined all 190 republicans in backing it and when the tax package came to its critical votes in july dozens of democrats sided with reagan and the republicans rather than their own leadership in 1982 democrats added to their majority in the house and negotiated some revenue increases with the senate and the white house and in reagan s second term momentum built quickly for a tax overhaul that would combine still lower marginal rates with new business taxes and a paring back of tax preferences and other loopholes the new overhaul s main appeal to democrats was that it exempted far more middle and lower income earners from the income tax altogether mark wilson getty images getty images career anti tax advocate grover norquist here in 2018 called the trump administration s 2017 tax cut reaganite the ultimate compliment from the founder of americans for tax reform the tax reform act of 1986 was hailed as a bipartisan wonderment winning support from bipartisan majorities in a republican senate and a democratic house reagan signed it into law praising the new top rate of 28 and turning a blind eye to the new business levies but effects of the act had scarcely begun to be felt when policymakers began chipping away at them preferences and other specific provisions for industries or other activities were reinserted in the tax code as lobbying and popular demand took their toll the top tax rate started creeping back up in the budget compromises of 1990 and 1993 reaching 39 6 in the presidency of bill clinton nonetheless the clinton years saw a robust economy created in part by the personal computer and the burgeoning internet economy that in turn drove stock prices to historic highs the higher tax rates on income and capital gains brought new highs in federal revenue collections and by 2000 the annual federal budget was remarkably close to being balanced the congressional budget office even projected a surplus in the coming years of the new century large enough to start paying down the national debt which still amounted to less than 6 trillion at that time deficits and debt rose faster after 2000 but the idea of running a surplus and shrinking the debt did not inspire much political excitement instead when newly elected president george w bush took office in 2001 he swiftly moved to cut taxes and a republican congress went along soon the top rate was back down to 35 even as spending raced higher for the wars in afghanistan and iraq the potential surplus never materialized yearly deficits got bigger again and the debt grew apace j scott applewhite ap ap then president barack obama joined by republican and democratic lawmakers signs a bipartisan tax package that extends tax cuts for families at all income levels in december 2010 president barack obama came into office in the midst of an economic free fall from the financial crisis of 2008 his first rescue package included a lot of spending and new borrowing and some relatively marginal cuts to payroll taxes many did not even notice in their paycheck stubs in his second term the top marginal tax rate went back up to 39 6 trump arrived in 2017 and promptly prioritized another general overhaul of the tax code which was again enacted using reconciliation the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was intended to spur growth and seemed to do so in 2018 when the economy briefly grew at a 4 rate early on but slowed thereafter to 2 6 in the fourth quarter and a 2 9 rate for the year trump s overhaul eagerly supported by republicans in both chambers reduced the top tax rate to 37 for individuals and reduced the rate for six lower brackets as well dropped the corporate rate from 35 to 21 and exempted the value of estates worth up to 11 2 million from the estate tax the exempt amount had been about half that while providing numerous other breaks for banks and other industries the trump cuts were projected to add up to 2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years and indeed federal revenues plummeted immediately corporate tax revenue fell 31 in the first year evan vucci ap ap then president donald trump displays the 1 5 trillion tax overhaul package he signed in december 2017 the net effect of trump s cuts on top of the second president bush s has been more than sufficient to counteract the smaller moves toward more revenue under george h w bush clinton and obama tax cuts are generally popular but trump s package delivered disproportionately to corporations and the wealthy the non partisan tax policy center has reported 60 of the savings went to people in the top quintile one fifth of the income ladder perceptions of that skew among wage earners helped democrats recapture the house in 2018 and were often cited by democratic candidates during the presidential primaries in 2020 that leaves biden with the double challenge of reducing future deficits while also addressing inequity in the sharing of the tax burden it s the dual mission of the tax portions of the reconciliation bill now taking shape in the tax writing committees to raise enough revenue to prevent the new spending from adding too much to future deficits but democrats also want to make sure whatever new revenue they raise comes from corporations and high income individuals the categories

the white house james s brady press briefing room 2 47 p m edt ms psaki hi everyone okay a couple of items for all of you at the top yesterday president biden announced a historic trilateral security partnership with the united kingdom and australia two of our closest allies to ensure peace and stability in the indo pacific it demonstrates our commitment to revitalizing our alliances and strengthening them to take on the challenges of the 21st century as we ve said we are committed to strengthening historic bonds and working through new configurations like the quad and aukus a free and open indo pacific region is critical to the security and prosperity of the american people and this partnership will help defend our interests there for generations as the leaders made clear we believe this new initiative is especially important given the changing strategic environment in the region we will continue to work with our allies and partners including in europe to maintain a free and open indo pacific and we are looking forward to our continued cooperation in this critical region i also wanted to highlight that yesterday the business roundtable which represents many of america s leading companies sent a letter urging congress to act swiftly to address the debt ceiling underscoring that congress quote congress has the authority to lift the debt ceiling to safeguard the full faith and credit of the united states and the responsibility to do so they warned of the catastrophic economic consequences of failing to address the debt limit saying it would quote produce an otherwise avoidable crisis and provide and pose unacceptable risk to the nation s economic growth job creation and financial markets of course we agree fin or two more two more items wow it s pouring out there today 15 recipients of the nobel prize in economics released a letter in support of the president s build build back better plan and his economic agenda to support the middle class writing that it will make quote critical investments in human capital the care economy research and development public education and more which will reduce families costs importantly these distinguished economists echo the president s case that the infrastructure deal and build back better package will both lower costs for families and quote ease longer term inflationary pressures by investing in our economic capacity and allowing more americans to participate in the economy finally just a quick update since i know many of you have asked the president did speak with governor newsom yesterday and congratulated him on his win tuesday the two spoke about how the victory was powered by the governor s strong leadership in the response to covid and the need for continuing to talk about a science based approach to fighting the pandemic the president told governor newsom he was honored to have campaigned for him and they both agreed the focus must continue to be on crushing the virus and getting the economy back up and running the need to address the climate crisis through the build back better agenda and showing government can deliver for the american people jonathan go ahead q thank you jen a couple questions on the same topic this agreement announced yesterday the aukus agreement in particular the reaction from two different countries first china who said that who accused this agreement of escalating tensions in the region and said it was reflective of a quote cold war mentality do you have a response to that is president biden looking to escalate a cold war with china ms psaki no this partnership announced yesterday is not about any one country this is about advancing our strategic interests the strategic interest of the united states upholding the international rules based order and promoting peace and stability in the indo pacific and i would note that the united kingdom and australia also have a long history as does the united states of upholding the international rules based order so our hope is that the three countries who have consistently worked with regional supporters to support a secure and stable and peaceful indo pacif pacific can now work together to do exactly that as it relates to china we welcome stiff competition with the prc we do not seek conflict obviously the president spoke with president xi just a few days ago and certainly we re committed to maintaining an open high level dialogue between the leaders q the other country reacting strongly to this is france the french foreign minister deemed it a quote stab in the back compared it to a unilateral decision like the ones made by former president trump just now france has canceled a gala here in washington that was meant to celebrate friendship with the united states what reaction do you have to france s rather outraged response to this agreement ms psaki well i would first say that we value our relationship and our partnership with france on a variety of issues facing the global community whether it s economic growth or whether it s the fight against covid or addressing security throughout the world and that has been a longstanding partnership for many many years i would leave it of course to our australian partners to describe why they sought this new technology and why they pursued this technology from the united states as you know part of their part of their issue is that there was a purchase of technology from that australia had made with the french but we ll let australia speak to that and why they pursue or why they purchased this technology we cooperate closely with france as the president said yesterday we have a range of shared priorities in the indo pacific and that will certainly continue we don t see this from our end as a regional divide we see this as areas in security as security issues that we want to take on together q last one then i ll hand off on the same subject the french have also said that this is undermining relations with u s and its european partners and they said they were blindsided by this deal did president biden or the administration convey ahead of time to france that this was coming do they plan to speak today ms psaki i don t have any preview of calls for you i will say that i m sure we will the president will speak at a high level soon but we are engaged closely and we were engaged in advance of this announcement with leaders in france about about this purchase q they were told it was coming ms psaki they were aware in advance of the announcement yes go ahead q thanks jen i want to ask you about some recent vaccine misinformation that s been out there and ask you to clarify there seems to be a difference of opinion between nicki minaj and the white house about what she was invited to do did the white house extend an invitation to nicki minaj to come here ms psaki well first we don t see this as a point of tension or disagreement i want you all to know that we engage all the time with people who have big public platforms or profiles some of them we talk about some of them are here some of them you don t even know about because they re just looking for questions to be answered we offered a call with nicki minaj and one of our doctors to answer questions she had about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine this is pretty standard and something we do all the time it was a very early stage call at a staff level staff to staff and we weren t even at the point of discussing or we re not even at the point of discussing i should say at this point the mechanisms or the format or anything along those lines it was simply an offer to have a conversation and an early stage call q and do you think that s going to happen ms psaki we ll see i don t have anything to predict for you q what kind of responsibility do you think someone like nicki minaj has someone with a really big platform when it comes to talking about the vaccine ms psaki well our hope is that anyone who has a big platform is going to project accurate information about the effectiveness of the vaccine the safety of the vaccine and the availability of the vaccine at the same time and both can be true we also recognize that people have questions out there they have questions they want to have answered by their doctors we have doctors who can answer questions and this is something again in our outreach to celebrities it follows a pretty standard process we officials who are working on these issues engage in regular conversations offer to answer questions offer to do that privately sometimes sometimes it s done publicly and i would say that if we believed that everybody who had skepticism about the vaccine wasn t someone we should engage with or talk to we wouldn t have made the progress we ve made i mean remember back in december the only 33 percent of the american people were open to getting vaccinated now more than 75 percent have had at least one shot so part of our strategy and our objective from the beginning has been engaging with people who have questions to help answer their questions go ahead q i d like to ask you a little bit more about the some of what s detailed in the upcoming book of woodward and costa specifically in the area of the president taking or not taking the advice of secretaries austin and blinken we ve seen the president defend his decision to exit afghanistan in the way that he did but as the public they see this and read this and say top close officials suggested a slower path out the public watched what happened with some of the chaotic things what should we take from that in terms of how the president processes the information his advisors are giving and does he have any second thoughts about not taking the gated slower approach that s described ms psaki well i think that people should take one let me first say i m not going to confirm or substantiate anonymous unconfirmed reports in a book but i think you re asking an important question which is how does the president take a range of advice from different people and sometimes it s conflicting with each other as well of course first what we ve said from the beginning as it relates to afghanistan is the president asked his team to present to him clear eyed assessment candid advice on the path forward everyone knew coming into the beginning of the administration he knew the vice president knew the national security team knew that we were in a situation facing a may 1st timeline of either getting our troops out or facing conflict with the taliban that s what we walked into and the circumstances we were discussing what we also know now is that given it took 6 000 troops to protect the airport this was not a scenario where it was either maintain the status quo the president never felt that was a real viable option and now we looked at 6 000 troops were needed to protect the airport that wouldn t have been a viable option it was not the status quo or withdraw it was withdraw or increase troops and that s how he saw the decision q one of the things that secretary blinken talked about was the concern about european partners jonathan was asking about questions related to european partners ms psaki yep q being upset now is there a tension point between a president who talked about being a steady hand and normal relationships when the french are mad today they were other nato partners and others were unhappy about the exit is there an issue there where the president is going it without consideration of those partners ms psaki i don t think the president sees it as without consideration there was extensive consultation there was extensive briefings both at the secretary of state s level at the secretary of defense s level in advance of the president s announcement in may about his decision to withdraw our military presence in afghanistan it doesn t mean that all of our allies and partners are going to always agree with everything we do nor do we always agree with everything they do but sustainable and good diplomatic relationships mean you work where you can agree and you sustain strong partnerships to address global issues in the world regardless i think what the president s view is here is that one his decision to withdraw our troop presence in afghanistan was as he has talked about extensively in large part because he felt it was a 20 year war that had gone on for too long that did not have a military outcome that would be successful and that it was in our national interest to do so also our resources as a country as a national security team are not unlimited and he wants to have the capacity and the ability to have partnerships like the one we announced last night that is an important partnership moving forward for security in the indo pacific to address big issues whether it s technology or cyber or even climate and that s what he feels the united states should be focused on q one very different separate many of us were in the east room watching the president we ve seen him on many occasions where he has a repeated cough what is the situation with that cough and is that a concern ms psaki it s not a concern we have a doctor who travels with him obviously who checks in if there is it is ever warranted and certainly that continues to be the case as it has been since the beginning of his presidency q is there an explanation for why he coughed so frequently in situations like that i m sure you saw it ms psaki i did i don t think it s an issue of concern i think there are a range of reasons why we may need to clear our throat or we may have a little light cold and that s certainly something that presidents elected officials reporters spokespeople can confront but it s not an area where we have a medical concern go ahead q right after aukus china said that it wants to join the trans pacific trade deal does the administration have a response to that and secondly does president biden s would he still like to join that if it could be renegotiated ms psaki well on their second question let me take that first the president has been clear that he would not rejoin the tpp as it was initially put forward he s also being clear that we have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us for the deal and make sure environmentalists and labor are at the table so obviously there would be a lot of steps for that to be taken in order for that to be a viable option to the president in terms of china china s interest in joining you know we we and i just let me just add one more thing we re looking at a range of options of course to forge stronger economic partnerships in the indo pacific trade does not is not the only one there s a range of ways that we can forge those relationships and those partnerships obviously as it relates to china s interest in joining we d leave it to those countries to certainly determine we re going to continue to work with other countries in the region on economic partnerships and relationships and if there s an opportunity to renegotiate then that could be a discussion we could be a part of q has president biden promised to leader schumer that he will help lobby for changes to the filibuster on voting rights if needed ms psaki the president has promised leader schumer that he will help get voting rights passed into law and he there s obviously been some important developments over the past couple days that the president sees as a positive step forward additional compromises that could be a path forward so the president wants to stay closely in touch work closely with leader schumer and determine what the next steps are to get this passed and move forward q but has he broached the subject of the filibuster on that ms psaki there are a range of topics that are discussed and raised the president s view hasn t changed there are more steps forward in the president s view to get this passed go ahead q will you give us any readout or update from the president s meetings with senators sinema and manchin earlier this week and can you confirm that he s speaking today with schumer and pelosi and what he plans to discuss with them ms psaki sure he is speaking today or he does plan to have a conversation today with speaker pelosi and leader schumer as you all know speaker pelosi is overseas it s a virtual conversation and certainly moving the build back better agenda forward the infrastructure bill forward and the president s legislative agenda forward will be the central part of the conversation today as it was when he met yesterday with senator manchin and senator sinema we re in the middle of the process so the president knows and is that he s going to need to be he s eager to be very engaged with directly with senators directly with leadership to move this forward i will note though i know there s been a focus on just a couple of members very important members we are engaged with a range of members and the president is as well senators members of congress moderates progressive across the political political band as we work to move this forward q did these two senators indicate any cap that they would support in terms of the reconciliation package ms psaki i will let them speak to what their interests are i know they have both spoken to their interests publicly on many occasions so i will leave that to them q can i ask also anthony fauci has said that he would support the notion of requiring either vaccinations or a negative test for domestic air travel in the u s for passengers not staff if he supports that and he s the president s chief medical advisor why haven t you done that ms psaki well i would say you know right now last week we announced some bold ambitious steps that were supported across the board from our health and medical experts right now our focus is on implementing those part of that was also doubling fines for people who were not wearing masks on planes a step that we feel would help keep people safe on flights and reduce the spread we haven t taken options off the table but i don t have any updates to share with you at this point our focus is on implementation of the big steps we announced last week q and do you have any update on the fed chair ms psaki i do not q phil was going to ask so i figured i d q come on ms psaki i know it s laughter it s a big a big question on phil s mind go ahead it s okay don t hide behind phil laughter go ahead q thanks jen yesterday the president announced a second global climate summit and he s been really doubling down on these ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ms psaki yeah q so i want to ask about the line 3 pipeline enbridge the energy company says it s almost complete it could be operational by this fall we ve talked to opponents and climate scientists who say that from a potential emissions standpoint it s the equivalent of bringing online more than 40 coal fired power plants we know there s ongoing litigation we ve reached out to doj and the army corps of engineers but representative ilhan omar and her colleagues wrote specifically to president biden asking him to look into this pipeline i just want to know if the president has reviewed that letter if he plans to respond does the president plan to consider is the president even considering asking the army corps of engineers to review some of their permits on this one ms psaki well as you said it s in the middle of active litigation so that is where we are going to leave it be we are certainly aware of the concerns of the expression of viewpoints on this particular issue no question about it but we re going to it s in the middle of active litigation so there s not a lot i can say from here on it i do i would say that on climate and the president s climate agenda he has a very ambitious approach that is reflective of the agenda that s moving forward and moving through congress something he s talked about with a range of members you know over the course of the last couple of weeks but there s not much i can say beyond what we ve said to date q yeah but zooming out we ve talked to some climate scientists who say that who just really question whether it would be possible for the president to meet his own goals with reducing emissions if new pipelines like this one if new fossil fuel infrastructure basically get more oil to the market so are you confident the president can meet his own goals here and do any new pipelines like this kind of undermine the president s message that the united states wants to be a global leader on this ms psaki well again there s active litigation so that s where it sits but i would say that in terms of the president s climate agenda it s not just one thing he has taken a range of steps announced steps to steps to drive american leadership forward on clean cars and trucks that s something he can do on his own obviously there are a number of components that are included in his build back better agenda in the infrastructure bill that will take significant steps to moving things forward he s been a leader in getting us back in the on the having a seat at the table in the paris climate agreement so he has taken across the board steps every step he can take within his control to move the climate agenda forward he s identified climate as a crisis facing his presidency and is eager to work with activists to continue to get the job done but if something is in active litigation it s in active litigation go ahead q thank you jen quick question about the security partnership yesterday there was a call when several senior administration officials said that there were conversations that were had over months before this partnership ms psaki yeah q was announced and we re sort of curious to know if france was part of those conversations and the whole process and if they weren t was that sort of has there been a loss of trust because of that ms psaki well you know senior administration officials have been in touch with the french with their french counterparts to discuss aukus i can t i don t have in front of me nor do i think i m going to outline for you a detailed level of our engagement on this this was a this is a partnership with the australians and the united kingdom and of course we keep other partners and key allies abreast but i think what s important to know is that we went going back to the g7 the three leaders met in june as you all know in cornwall on the margins of the g7 and this was one of the main topics that was discussed and that was where they from there they urged their teams to work on it to get us to this point q and a quick follow up on gas prices the president was talking about it just now he said that you know we re looking into this manipulation of the gas market is the white house currently doing an investigation he said prices should be coming down but they re not what is the do you have an update on that ms psaki we ve asked the ftc as you know to look into it they d be the appropriate body they ve conveyed they that they would in a letter so i would point you to them for more specifics go ahead q just one quick follow up and a couple others you said aukus isn t about any one country officials have been pretty clear this is about china what s the difference between what the white house is saying publicly from the podium and what we re hearing from officials behind the scenes ms psaki well in our view it s about security in the indo pacific q is there not a country in the indo pacific that you feel like is a threat laughter to the rules based order and international norms ms psaki i will let others do their analysis but from the united states government our focus is on what steps we can take to increase security in the indo pacific and there are a range of countries that could pose a threat and we ll let an outside analysist give their analysis q all right on debt limit is the president view of bipartisanship which you guys have made very clear from secretary yellen across the administration is important on this is that a red line for him like republicans have to be involved or there s no other path ms psaki you know how i love red lines laughs q line in the sand ms psaki line no i m not here to set new lines red lines lines in the sand but i do think it s important context for everybody to understand as you well know that 80 times has congress raised the debt limit and even if you look to comments in recent days by senator mcconnell if you look to just two years ago he argued that failing to vote to raise the debt limit would quote be a disaster and quote put our full faith in credit at risk we agree with that and now he s against a vote so i think when we re looking at politics here we know where the politics is coming from but our argument is that this is about this is not a political issue shouldn t be a partisan issue it hasn t been throughout history you may have all seen that secretary yellen had a call with senator mcconnell not a political call of course she s not political she s an economist to really convey what the enormous dangers of default would be so that s the argument we re making yes i know you all have good questions about the vehicle and how it will move forward all good questions we re working with congress on but our view is this should be bipartisan as it has been in the past q and then just one more since josh stole my fed question laughter fda i know you don t have a personnel announcement is the idea here that because they ve got so much on their plate and they have a team that s been working on this stuff for a long time you just wait until there s like a quiet moment to appoint somebody or does that have any impact whatsoever on what s going on ms psaki i promise you when we have determined and selected an fda commissioner to nominate we will announce it and not wait for a quiet moment i don t know that there are quiet moments around here you may all agree with that and that s what the president is eager to do of course i don t have any predictions of what the timeline will be and understand certainly the question go ahead q thanks jen q a federal judge just ruled that blocked the biden administration from expelling migrant families under the public health order in a new ruling it takes effect in 14 days i m wondering what the administration s plans are on that front ms psaki right the news just came out as you referenced it s a preliminary injunction that would take effect as you said two weeks from now we of course would refer you to the department of justice on any additional steps or next steps we are still taking steps are focused on taking steps to address the root causes of migration implement orderly asylum processes strengthen collaborative migration management efforts in the region and effectively secure our borders we feel we ve maken we ve made considerable progress on that front but this news of course just came out and i d really defer you to the department of justice for any additional steps q and then one other on booster shots obviously next week is the timeline that the administration laid out there seems you ve addressed there seems to be some considerable disagreement within the public health agencies about how to move forward former scientists from the fda who left signed on to a study about this saying that the boosters are not needed do you still plan to have the boosters rolled out next week and what do you tell the american people about some of this disagreement inside the public health agencies ms psaki well of course we respect a range of viewpoints but we really rely on the people who are leading our health and medical agencies and there is broad agreement among those individuals about where things stand if we go back to august eight of the department of health and human services top doctors released a statement saying they had determined boosters would be needed and that we have a plan to begin a booster program starting the week of september 20th subject to an independent evaluation from fdic fda and acip that continues to be what we have conveyed since then right now where the process is is yesterday there was data provided by the fda that will be analyzed and the next step is next week acip is planning to meet and based on the recommendation we re prepared to operationalize our plan but it s always been based every time we ve talked about this we ve talked about this as based on a thorough review and a thorough process to complete it s our job to be prepared whenever we can operationalize q and does the president have any regrets about speaking publicly about this plan before there was the approval from the public health agencies or he still feels that was the right step to take ms psaki well first of all the first statement was done by our health and medical doctors by hhs those eight doctors q but then he spoke you know ms psaki and then he spoke to it and the president said i want to be clear this plan is pending the fda conducting an independent evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of a third dose of the pfizer and moderna mrna vaccines and the cdc s advisory committee on immunization practices issuing booster dose recommendations based on a thorough review of the evidence that was what he said when this announcement was made if you look at it on the flip side of this right it is at the time they made this announcement in part because there was data that was available that showed that the waning efficacy of vaccines over a period of time right that s why these doctors and medical experts in their statement made this made this recommendation and this announcement so the alternative would have been they not move forward with it and hold back and not share that data i mean that s that s also not being transparent or leading with science and so that s that s the course of history here i should say q can i follow up on that jen ms psaki sure q just a quick follow up so you said a moment ago that so the top public health officials of the administration fda commissioner cdc surgeon general all agree and recommend that the american public should be getting boosters you know starting next week so they re all on that page but the fda advisory committee and the cdc advisory committee let s say are on a different page if they don t think boosters should be ready at this time i guess then who is the administration going to listen to its top doctors or these outside advisory committees ms psaki well before we confuse the public that s not what acip has recommended they re meeting next week we don t know what they re going to say q so if they do ms psaki what our what our health and medical experts have said and they ve been very consistent on this dr walensky based on the fda review and acip and exactly as you said the note that immunocompromised people actually never got really a good immune protection to begin with we noted that as of now we should be offering a third dose of the vaccine janet woodcock so it is true we don t have all the data we have a lot of data from both this country and other countries in the effects of waning but we don t have all the data on the most of all most all the safety data and so forth those studies have been completed and should be available to the fda soon our objective is to be prepared should all of this process move forward it s always been pending the approval of the acip and the fda all of these doctors have said this could be needed they ve said in their statement eight of them said they had determined boosters would be needed now it s going to go through the process that s what s happening over the next week so we re not going to predetermine what that process is going to say q but you follow inaudible q jen i have a follow up on that from the fda q but you guys will follow whatever the agen whatever those advisory committees recommend you guys will follow their recommendation right ms psaki yeah yes of course q okay ms psaki go ahead q but jen on that though a follow up on that ms psaki i ll go to you next emerald go ahead q thank you i have one quick follow up on the booster ms psaki sure q question so say that rollout does get delayed i understand the president said that we ve purchased boosters to be ready for this ms psaki yeah q is there any chance that they would expire and need to be sent off to other countries like we ve done in the past or do we buy like booster credits are they sitting in a fridge somewhere i guess is what i m asking ms psaki well our objective here is to be like boy scouts and girl scouts and always be prepared for every single scenario right and so that s why we wanted to make clear we would be ready to operationalize right our in terms of so we are preparing for all contingencies and all scenarios we ll see what the acip says and then we ll be able to lay out for you where we go and what that means moving forward i will say we have never felt it to be we feel it s a false choice to suggests it s either give to the world or not we are continuing to increase the supply of vaccines we re giving to the world we will continue to have more announcements on that because we want to be the arsenal of vaccines to the world and we are giving more than every other country in the world combined at the same time we re going to maintain a supply for the united states and for american citi and for people living here so that we can get give out the booster should that be go through the approval process q thank you and then i wanted to get to the hearing on the hill with general miller the president told abc back in august that none of his advisors recommended leaving 2 500 troops in afghanistan general miller told the senate armed services committee that that was exactly what he recommended was the president s answer in that interview an honest answer ms psaki first of all i m not going to get into details of private advice that the president gets from his national security team or military advisors what is clear is that the president asked for welcomed candid non sugarcoated advice on afghanistan and what we should do given what we walked into which was a deal struck with the taliban with a may 1st timeline including the release of 5 000 taliban fighters where we would need to get our u s forces out otherwise we would face conflict that s what he was facing in terms of the mechanisms of who provided what advice through what forum i m just not going to get into that level of detail from here q but did they president hear specifically the recommendation from the commander on the ground in afghanistan that he feared that a full withdrawal would be devastating and should not happen ms psaki he was provided a range of advice i m not going to get into more details than that but what s important to note at this point is it s crystal clear that 2 500 troops would not have been sustainable on the ground it would have been either increase troops on the ground or withdraw troops on the ground and the president has been clear many times he was not going to send thousands and thousands more troops to fight a war the afghans did not want to fight themselves q and then i want to get also to the debt limit ms psaki sure q following up on the question earlier the democrats when they had control unified control in 2010 raised the debt limit unilaterally what is different now and why doesn t the president just encourage democratic leaders to do this on their own and defuse that crisis ms psaki why aren t republicans for doing what they ve done dozens of times in the past and many of them did three times during the trump administration including after they passed a 2 trillion unpaid for tax giveaway to corporations and the wealthiest americans they were fine doing it then why aren t they fine doing it now so it could go i think that s the fundamental question i d send back q would the president at any point intervene and try to stave this off if this comes to a head and seems ms psaki the president wants to maintain the full faith and credit of the united states our view continues to be this should be done in a bipartisan way and there should be a bipartisan path forward emerald i promised you we d go to you next q jen thank you a follow up on the fda you say that there was a large consensus of doctors and advisors who feel like boosters are warranted and safe and effective but then during all this you had two top senior officials at the fda resign during the booster conversation that being the director of office of vaccines research and dr philip krause deputy director of the office concerned about the vaccine so what s your reaction to that in light of boosters next week and what does that say to the american people to have those two high level people step down over this conversation ms psaki well emerald what i conveyed before and i ll reiterate is that eight of our top medical experts health and medical experts including the acting head of the fda janet woodcock recommended we would need boosters moving forward the american people would need boosters pending approval through a process including the fda and acip that s the process that s ongoing in terms of differences of opinion within the fda or other components of the federal government that s certainly we understand that may be the case but in terms of the consensus view the view of the leadership of the fda the view of the leadership of our health and medical experts that was their shared recommendation because their objective and their focus is on relying on data to save lives and the data available showed a waning efficacy of vaccines after a certain number of months q so speaking of the waning efficacy of vaccines i do have another question about the president s covid plan he promised on september 9th that he was going to send 50 percent more supply of monoclonal antibodies to states yet the biden administration is cutting supplies in red states by 50 percent so for example you know in florida they were expecting to get 70 000 doses this week which they say they need they re only getting 30 000 doses and this is not just for unvaccinated people in south florida half the people who are seeking this treatment are fully vaccinated so why is the biden administration cutting these supplies ms psaki that s not accurate so let me give you the accurate information first of all we are increasing our distribution this month by 50 percent in early august we were distributing an average of 100 000 doses per week now we re shipping an average of 150 000 doses per week over the last month though and one thing that i think people need to understand for clarity facts i know you like facts is that monoclonal antibodies are lifesaving therapies that are used after infection to prevent more severe outcomes so clearly the way to protect people and save more lives is to get them vaccinated so that they don t get the covid to begin with but over the last month given the rise in cases due to the delta variant and the lower number of vaccination rates in some of these states like florida like texas just seven states are making up 70 percent of the orders our supply is not unlimited and we believe it should be equitable q but there has ms psaki across states across the country do you q but there have been no reports of a lack of supply so why cut them to those states only if there s no reports of a lack of supply ms psaki i think our role as the as the government overseeing the entire country is to be equitable in how we distribute we re not going to give a greater percentage to florida over oklahoma nor do i think are you suggesting that i think we have to move on go ahead yamiche q thank you so much jen one question one follow up question on booster shots i m wondering if you could just say whether or not the president is at all even concerned about whether the administration endorsing booster shots before the fda fully approved them just looks like they re trying to influence the fda and mix science with politics i understand your ms psaki but yamiche it was q point i m just wondering ms psaki the fda acting head who endorsed boosters q the point is though that the fda itself and scientists are still weighing whether or not they want to make the recommendation fully so the question is does this administration even have any concerns that coming out and recommending booster shots before they re fully approved and fully recommended by the fda that that might be seen as unduly influencing ms psaki no again it s the acting fda head and eight of our health and medical experts from agencies not the white house not the president who put out this statement initially making this recommendation because they believe you need to come forward and we fully support with data when it s available and make that available to the american people make sure the american people understand and know that there could be waning efficacy of these vaccines and that that s where they recommend it if you look at the reverse imagine if they had not come out and shared that that was their view and this is where it might be headed now it needs to go through a process they ve said that in every single statement that they have made publicly but we believe the american people are smart and they re paying attention and they would want to know that boosters might be something that go through a process that are recommended and they might be something that you should plan for once you get to a certain set of months past your second vaccination that s that s our view and that s the view of our health and medical experts q can i ask one more question ms psaki oh go ahead yeah q about the french response to aukus ms psaki sure q which of course is a whole mouthful but i m wondering if you could just talk or respond directly what does the president think of the french foreign minister saying that he s acting like former president trump and being unpredictable and the french canceling their gala now in d c at their embassy because they re angry over this agreement what does the president make of being compared to former president trump by an ally such as france ms psaki i would say the president doesn t think about it much the president s focus is on maintaining and continuing our close relationships with leaders in france with the united kingdom with australia and to achieving our global objectives which include security in the indo pacific that s what his focus is and we will continue to work toward a productive constructive partnership with the french go ahead q thank you jen a clarification and then a follow ms psaki yeah q on aukus ms psaki sure q you said the french were informed of the arrangement just even going to the president s remarks ms psaki yeah q yesterday the arrangement was broader than just the nuclear powered submarines ms psaki yeah q it was cyber it was ai were they specifically informed on the that the u s would be sharing technology for nuclear powered submarines ms psaki again it was the australians decision so i d point you to the australians but they were aware in advance q so i mean but if you re the u s you re involved here we saw the uk also involved why couldn t the administration you know not just inform but bring in the french they also have nuclear powered submarines ms psaki you mean in terms of a fourth partner to this to this tri to this i m not sure what your question is q yeah i do i do i mean in terms of a fourth partner and get them engaged as well it s another ally to also share this technology it s clear based off the statements today that they had the intent to or also expressed a desire to ms psaki well this is not the only global engagement or global cooperative partnership the united states has in the world the french are a member of the g7 they re a member of the g20 we work with them on a range of issues and we will continue to and their leadership up and down the ranks will continue to be important partners to the united states and to this administration moving forward so this was a partnership between the united kingdom the united states and australia there are a range of partnerships that include the french and some partnerships that don t and they have partnerships with other countries that don t include us that is part of how global diplomacy works q just to follow on the first question i asked it sounds like what you were saying is when i asked if the why did the u s didn t inform about specifically sharing the technology for submarines is that australia was kind of in the lead of this arrangement ms psaki i m just not going to have more details on it but i will tell you that again the australians partners they can describe why they sought this new technology it was their effort to do that so i would point you to them for more details q and then just quickly on greg abbott has issued a statement he has directed his department of public safety and the national guard to shut down six points of entry along the southwest border he issued that statement today just wondering if the administra they also say that the customs and border protection requested this i m wondering if the administration did request this if they re aware of it and if there is any response ms psaki i m happy to check into it zolan i haven t seen governor abbott s statement or cbp s commentary so let me let me check into it and we can get you something after the briefing go ahead q thanks jen i think you said yesterday you might have some more details today about the president s visit to the u n next week ms psaki i was hoping i would i promise i will tomorrow q okay and coughs excuse me on another matter there are also reports that the british prime minister will be at the white house next week can you confirm that and offer any details about that ms psaki i promise you tomorrow i will have more final details about next week about the u n general assembly and the president s trip there and other components that are planned for next week q and one more thing ms psaki sure q will the do the president and the first lady plan to get the booster shot ms psaki yes go ahead karen q following up with on what kelly had asked ms psaki once it s through the process of course go ahead q following up on one of the questions from kelly do you have an update on when the president will get a physical ms psaki i know this is an understandable question i don t have an update he will get one soon and when he does we will make sure you all are aware of it and get the information q and to follow up on nancy s questions the nicki minaj questions ms psaki sure q sorry laughter you said that we engage all the time with people who have big platforms or profiles how do you determine who to engage with and in what way on something like this on vaccine hesitancy ms psaki sure q and nicki minaj has 22 million twitter followers why not invite her to the white house have a conversation and make it a big public thing ms psaki well i appreciate your recommendations on our communications advice karen you are quite experienced laughter look i will say we recognize and we ve talked about this a bunch before that we are not always the right platform or the right voice right sometimes that s because people may not like the president and they may not have voted for him and that s okay and we work with a range of partners to communicate the efficacy and the safety of the vaccine it s also true that when we re reaching a range of audiences young people where we ve seen lower rates of vaccination is a good example we know there might be more effective voices we don t always know how effective working in partnership with celebrities may or may not be but sometimes it is a tool that we can use or we ve employed as you ve seen us do in on cases before we do this behind the scenes quite a bit sometimes to speak to particular audiences so all i was conveying is it s commonplace we have calls every week multiple times a week from our engagement team with a range of officials with followings to see how they might want questions answered maybe they want to play a role in communicating information out publicly as a part of our effort to to get the pandemic under control q and do you have any sense like let s just say olivia rodrigo do you have any sense of a difference that made are you guys able to track that in any way ms psaki it s a good question it s kind of a hard thing to track we can see how many views we can see anecdotally if people say i got the vaccine because i saw this video and certainly sometimes that happens i m not sure i ll have to check go ahead q just to follow up on china and the tpp you mentioned that the u s is looking at a range of options to forge stronger economic partnerships can you just elaborate a little bit on what those options are ms psaki i think what i was trying to convey is it s not just trade right and there are a range of ways we can work with countries in the region and forge a range of partnerships and so certainly the president would need labor environmental environmentalists to be at the table to potentially engage on tpp we re obviously not there at this point so i was just conveying we don t see trade as the only path forward go ahead q thanks a couple questions on housekeeping is the president intending to meet with emmanuel macron on the sidelines of the u n general assembly ms psaki i don t have anything yet on next week i should have some more on it tomorrow and then i can outline for you what is what is going to happen next week q and then in terms of just the overall kind of fallout that we ve seen from france ms psaki mm hmm q was the white house at all surprised by the response from france how would you characterize ms psaki i don t think i m going to characterize from here q okay and then another question in terms of housekeeping has the president met with any of the afghan refugees who have come to the united states and if not will he be meeting with any of them ms psaki not yet but he he is certainly eager to and looks forward to as you know i know it s feels like it s been a long several weeks or maybe just to me but you know it they ve only many of them have only just settled in the united states some of them have never been here before some of them have of course so it s not quite scheduled yet but it s something he s certainly eager to do q can i ask a follow up on that question ms psaki go ahead q we re starting to get some numbers about where some of the afghan ms psaki yeah q evacuees will be resettled can you walk through the administration s process i know it has to do with the office of refugee resettlement but a number of governors have raised their hands we re learning more about the first wave how is the administration going about determining where to place evacuees and refuges ms psaki sure it s a very good question i think our department of homeland security is going to have the best level of detail for you on how that process works or i can also ask former governor markell to come out here and talk with all of you one day soon which i m sure you d be interested in so let me venture to do that and see if dhs has more of a rundown for you q and one follow up on the ask by the administration to congress for more than 6 billion in funding to help with resettlement efforts what happens if you don t obtain that money and also some of the immigration policy fixes that have been requested ms psaki well i mean we re hopeful that given there has been stronger support for helping and welcoming our afghan partners who fought aside right alongside i should say the united states for the last 20 years from democrats and republicans that we can move forward and get the funding we need obviously we didn t anticipate no one did right that there would be this number of afghan refugees that we would need to fund support for six months eight months ago hence the request as we announced at the time but i think we re certainly hopeful given support for that that we will get that funding q one last is there a timeline when you need to get an answer by congress that for the funding ms psaki i m not sure there s a timeline i m happy to check with our legislative team in the and the refugee resettlement team to see if they have one they re focused on q jen just one or two more ms psaki yeah go ahead one more q thank you jen the deputy director of the fbi said that there s no sign so far from russia of any cracking down on the you know cyber activity does the president have anything new to tell the country about that because you know it was a big deal and it s gone kind of quiet so what s happening ms psaki i think as the president said at the time we didn t expect this to be a light switch that would happen overnight there s ongoing discussions ongoing conversations at a diplomatic level and that s something our national security team is engaged with but beyond that i don t have another update from here on the progress okay thanks everyone q thanks jen 3 35 p m edt

medicines for the treatment of cancer metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases announced that the results of the phase 2 study in chinese patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma were released today at the european society for medical oncology esmo congress 2021 e poster 50p this study which is a bridging study of the fight 202 is a phase 2 open label multi center single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemigatinib a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor fgfr inhibitor in chinese patients with unresectable advanced recurrent or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma cca with fgfr2 fusion rearrangement that failed to prior systemic therapy as of jan 29 2021 the data cutoff date 3 subjects were enrolled and treated at 9mg pemigatinib in stage 1 to evaluate pharmacokinetic pk in chinese population the other 31 subjects with documented fgfr2 fusion or arrangement were enrolled in stage 2 and received 13 5mg pemigatinib subjects in both stages were orally given pemigatinib qd on a 2 weeks on 1 week off schedule until disease progression unacceptable toxicity withdrawal of consent or physician decision the primary endpoint was objective response rate

observed in 6 patients the disease control rate dcr was 100 95 ci 88 4 100 all 34 subjects in both stages were included for safety analysis as of data cutoff date each subject experienced at least 1 treatment related adverse event trae the most common trae were hyperphosphatemia 73 5 xerostomia 55 9 and alopecia 50 0 and 14 7 had grade 3 or higher traes three participants had saes which were rectal polyps abnormal liver function and bile duct infection there was no treatment discontinuation and deaths due to trae the principal investigator prof jian zhou from fudan university zhongshan hospital stated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common type of cancer originated from liver for advanced disease the first line recommended therapy is gemcitabine plus cisplatin with an orr of 26 and median overall survival mos of 11 7 month whose limited efficacy needs to be improved for patients who failed the first line therapy asc mfolfox will be administrated with an mos of 5 6 months there is an urgent need in drugs that can vastly change the landscape of treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma fgfr2 fusion rearrangement is the most common fgfr alteration in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma which is usually accompanied with more rapidly growth status pemigatinib is a selective fgfr1 2 3 inhibitor and has been proved with an positive efficacy and tolerable safety profile in studies conducted outside of china this bridging study was aiming at evaluating the efficacy and safety in chinese intrahepatic cholangiocarcinima patients with this result of meeting a primary end point i hope pemigatinib will provide a new and better therapy option for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocaricinoma once approved dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated innovent has multiple clinical trials of pemigatinib for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and other types of tumors currently our new drug application nda of pemigatinib to national medical products administration nmpa in china has been accepted and pemigatinb was approved in taiwan market in june earlier this year the data presented at the esmo annual meeting indicated that pemigatinib was highly effective and tolerable in chinese patients with recurrent or metastatic cca with fgfr2 fusion rearrangement in the future we will conduct in depth clinical development of pemigatnib to explore potential treatments in other indications we are looking forward to providing novel therapies for more cancer patients in the future about advanced cholangiocarcinoma and fgfr2 rearrangement cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originated from biliary epithelium cells and it is categorized as intrahepatic or extrahepatic based on anatomical location of origin the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma has been increasing progressively over the past decade surgery is the first priority for patients with resectable disease however most cholangiocarcinomas patients have been in advanced and or metastatic status at diagnosis and lost the chance for surgical resection the treatment options for patient who relapse after surgery or have advanced or metastatic disease are limited and the recommended therapy method is systemic chemotherapy with gemicitabine plus cisplatin which has a medium overall survival of less than a year aberrant signaling through fgfr resulting from gene amplification or mutation chromosomal translocation and ligand dependent activation of the receptors has been demonstrated in multiple types of human cancers fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling contributes to the development of malignancies by promoting tumor cell proliferation survival migration and angiogenesis results from early clinical studies of selective fgfr inhibitors including pemazyre have shown a tolerable safety profile for the class and preliminary signs of clinical benefit in participants with fgf fgfr alterations about pemazyre pemigatinib in april 2020 the u s food and drug administration fda approved incyte s pemazyre pemigatinib a selective oral inhibitor of fgfr isoforms 1 2 and 3 for the treatment of adults with previously treated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 fgfr2 fusion or rearrangement as detected by an fda approved test continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial s in japan pemazyre is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable biliary tract

the grids used were perpendicular to the vein structures with variable spacing between 100 and 200 meters and with measuring points every 20 meters in aparecida due to the mapping having indicated veins with different strikes a grid was used instead of lines perpendicular to the main structure previous exploration work reported in the company s national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure

quintanillo target shows a projected vein system of almost 4 km in length along strike the grids used were perpendicular to the vein structures with variable spacing between 100 and 200 meters and with measuring points every 20 meters the geological mapping and sampling on the quintanillo target identified occurrences beyond those known from the artisanal production works in the quintanillo

if congress manages to pass president biden s big budget package this fall with most of its spending and tax changes intact it will represent the biggest shift in federal fiscal policy in 40 years if it happens still a big if it will be because congress can circumvent its usual rules and process tax and spending measures via a process called reconciliation that process is a powerhouse capable of major disruptions and changes in government because it offers protection from filibuster reconciliation bills can pass with a simple majority that is why biden and his allies house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer think they have a shot at raising trillions in tax revenue over the next 10 years to pay for their spending priorities democrats propose to raise the needed revenue through borrowing as well as through more robust revenue collections thanks to a beefed up irs but the bulk of it would come from tougher tax treatment and higher tax rates on corporations investors and others whose annual income exceeds 400 000 if they succeed they will be using reconciliation to reverse the direction of federal tax policy which has brought down the top tax rate and made other changes that benefit corporations and the wealthy over the past four decades and they will be doing it with the same process that was used to set that direction four decades ago when first year president ronald reagan used reconciliation to achieve his revolution in federal fiscal policy in 1981 polls have shown americans support higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy tax increases are rarely popular but polling this summer has generally found the public supportive of higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy at the same time reports surfaced that show that mega corporations and ultra rich individuals pay little or nothing in federal income tax for example in june propublica published a trove of tax data leaked from the irs that showed such prominent billionaires as tesla founder elon musk and berkshire hathaway investment guru warren buffett paid little income tax in relation to their vast income gains in some years paying none at all buffett who has campaigned for some democratic candidates has famously said he should not be paying a lower rate than his secretary propublica said the data showed amazon founder jeff bezos realizes billions each year in asset appreciation such as rising stock prices and yet can keep his taxable income so low that one year he qualified for the child tax credit which he took the data which was not authorized for publication covered 15 years and thousands of wealthy taxpayers and in june the new york times reported that tax laws allowed top managers in the private equity industry to prosper to the tune of billions without paying significant taxes relative to their gains audits the newspaper found were almost nonexistent all this feeds into a widening perception that the major moves in taxation over the last several decades have consistently benefited the higher income groups and particularly those with the greatest accumulated wealth there s a growing realization of what has changed in the tax code the nobel laureate economist joseph e stiglitz wrote in 2016 that snowballing changes to the tax code over the past 35 years have prioritized tax cuts and subsidies focused on those at the top placing a greater tax burden on the rest and causing neglect of critical public investments corporations have accomplished some of this tax avoidance by incorporating overseas or realizing some of their profits offshore one prospect for revenue seeking legislators would be an attempt to curtail these practices and reap a tax bonanza it is also possible the eventual legislation will address the step up in basis policy by which inheritors of property escape taxation on its appreciated value such a move has raised objections from rural interests even though the biden administration has pledged to protect family farms it will be hard to get every democrat in the senate and virtually every one of them in the house of representatives to accept the compromises and disappointments sure to be found in an eventual deal but difficult as this is the president and his party would have no shot whatsoever without the reconciliation process and that process got its start as a major mover of federal fiscal policy in 1981 with reagan s first budget it set a pattern that would dominate for the next 40 years culminating in the most recent tax cuts enacted under former president donald trump bob daugherty ap ap lawmakers watch as reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in october 1986 reagan slashed tax rates and sold the idea of supply side economics as an elixir much of the attention at the time went to the deep cuts reagan proposed to social spending programs as well as his historic increases in spending for the military but just as important as where the money was going was a radical reversal on the revenue side reagan proposed not just lowering the federal income tax but slashing it by 10 in year one and by another 10 in each of the next two years as well at the time the top marginal tax rate on the last dollar earned was still 70 an echo of the world war ii taxes that had risen over 90 on paper and remained there in the peak cold war years of course few people paid anything like that rate and those who were subject to it could find ways to reduce their tax exposure but reagan had become convinced that the high marginal rate as much as the weight of the tax burden overall was the problem in his view it penalized success impeded economic growth dampened the nation s entrepreneurial spirit and weakened its work ethic he spoke of it as much as a moral issue as a material one the 10 cuts were across the board as he liked to say implying they were of equal value to all the dollar value of the cuts was of course far larger for those with larger incomes moreover the tax law changes that accompanied the rate cuts made it easier for individuals and corporations to write off various forms of income and spending to lower their tax bills further the tax rate for capital gains money made from successful investing would come down from 28 to 20 reagan did not get everything he sought in this initial foray against high taxes and progressivity the senate trimmed the third year of the tax cut from 10 to 5 and it would take a second bill the tax reform act of 1986 to pull the marginal top rate all the way down to 28 but reagan s tax cuts in 1981 constituted the strongest move away from progressivity in the income tax since the tax was initiated in the civil war they were the culmination of rising anti tax sentiment in the late 1970s when some states adopted tax limitations by popular referendum that spirit was kept alive in the decades to come by groups such as americans for tax reform led by activist grover norquist starting in 1986 norquist has challenged candidates for office to sign his taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes the great majority of republicans have signed reagan pared back progressivity reagan was able to reverse what had been a decades long commitment to at least the look of progressivity he could do it in part because his 1980 election coattails enabled his party to capture control of the senate for the first time in a quarter century moreover while democrats still had a house majority their ranks included scores of members from southern and midwestern districts that had also voted for reagan when the budget resolution passed in that summer of 1981 63 house democrats joined all 190 republicans in backing it and when the tax package came to its critical votes in july dozens of democrats sided with reagan and the republicans rather than their own leadership in 1982 democrats added to their majority in the house and negotiated some revenue increases with the senate and the white house and in reagan s second term momentum built quickly for a tax overhaul that would combine still lower marginal rates with new business taxes and a paring back of tax preferences and other loopholes the new overhaul s main appeal to democrats was that it exempted far more middle and lower income earners from the income tax altogether mark wilson getty images getty images career anti tax advocate grover norquist here in 2018 called the trump administration s 2017 tax cut reaganite the ultimate compliment from the founder of americans for tax reform the tax reform act of 1986 was hailed as a bipartisan wonderment winning support from bipartisan majorities in a republican senate and a democratic house reagan signed it into law praising the new top rate of 28 and turning a blind eye to the new business levies but effects of the act had scarcely begun to be felt when policymakers began chipping away at them preferences and other specific provisions for industries or other activities were reinserted in the tax code as lobbying and popular demand took their toll the top tax rate started creeping back up in the budget compromises of 1990 and 1993 reaching 39 6 in the presidency of bill clinton nonetheless the clinton years saw a robust economy created in part by the personal computer and the burgeoning internet economy that in turn drove stock prices to historic highs the higher tax rates on income and capital gains brought new highs in federal revenue collections and by 2000 the annual federal budget was remarkably close to being balanced the congressional budget office even projected a surplus in the coming years of the new century large enough to start paying down the national debt which still amounted to less than 6 trillion at that time deficits and debt rose faster after 2000 but the idea of running a surplus and shrinking the debt did not inspire much political excitement instead when newly elected president george w bush took office in 2001 he swiftly moved to cut taxes and a republican congress went along soon the top rate was back down to 35 even as spending raced higher for the wars in afghanistan and iraq the potential surplus never materialized yearly deficits got bigger again and the debt grew apace j scott applewhite ap ap then president barack obama joined by republican and democratic lawmakers signs a bipartisan tax package that extends tax cuts for families at all income levels in december 2010 president barack obama came into office in the midst of an economic free fall from the financial crisis of 2008 his first rescue package included a lot of spending and new borrowing and some relatively marginal cuts to payroll taxes many did not even notice in their paycheck stubs in his second term the top marginal tax rate went back up to 39 6 trump arrived in 2017 and promptly prioritized another general overhaul of the tax code which was again enacted using reconciliation the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was intended to spur growth and seemed to do so in 2018 when the economy briefly grew at a 4 rate early on but slowed thereafter to 2 6 in the fourth quarter and a 2 9 rate for the year trump s overhaul eagerly supported by republicans in both chambers reduced the top tax rate to 37 for individuals and reduced the rate for six lower brackets as well dropped the corporate rate from 35 to 21 and exempted the value of estates worth up to 11 2 million from the estate tax the exempt amount had been about half that while providing numerous other breaks for banks and other industries the trump cuts were projected to add up to 2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years and indeed federal revenues plummeted immediately corporate tax revenue fell 31 in the first year evan vucci ap ap then president donald trump displays the 1 5 trillion tax overhaul package he signed in december 2017 the net effect of trump s cuts on top of the second president bush s has been more than sufficient to counteract the smaller moves toward more revenue under george h w bush clinton and obama tax cuts are generally popular but trump s package delivered disproportionately to corporations and the wealthy the non partisan tax policy center has reported 60 of the savings went to people in the top quintile one fifth of the income ladder perceptions of that skew among wage earners helped democrats recapture the house in 2018 and were often cited by democratic candidates during the presidential primaries in 2020 that leaves biden with the double challenge of reducing future deficits while also addressing inequity in the sharing of the tax burden it s the dual mission of the tax portions of the reconciliation bill now taking shape in the tax writing committees to raise enough revenue to prevent the new spending from adding too much to future deficits but democrats also want to make sure whatever new revenue they raise comes from corporations and high income individuals the categories that have benefited most from the tax trends that began with reagan s 1981 reconciliation breakthrough copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

major disruptions and changes in government because it offers protection from filibuster reconciliation bills can pass with a simple majority that is why biden and his allies house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer think they have a shot at raising trillions in tax revenue over the next 10 years to pay for their spending priorities democrats propose to raise the needed revenue through borrowing as well as through more robust revenue collections thanks to a beefed up irs but the bulk of it would come from tougher tax treatment and higher tax rates on corporations investors and others whose annual income exceeds 400 000 if they succeed they will be using reconciliation to reverse the direction of federal tax policy which has brought down the top tax rate and made other changes that benefit corporations and the wealthy over the past four decades and they will be doing it with the same process that was used to set that direction four decades ago when first year president ronald reagan used reconciliation to achieve his revolution in federal fiscal policy in 1981 polls have shown americans support higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy tax increases are rarely popular but polling this summer has generally found the public supportive of higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy at the same time reports surfaced that show that mega corporations and ultra rich individuals pay little or nothing in federal income tax for example in june propublica published a trove of tax data leaked from the irs that showed such prominent billionaires as tesla founder elon musk and berkshire hathaway investment guru warren buffett paid little income tax in relation to their vast income gains in some years paying none at all buffett who has campaigned for some democratic candidates has famously said he should not be paying a lower rate than his secretary propublica said the data showed amazon founder jeff bezos realizes billions each year in asset appreciation such as rising stock prices and yet can keep his taxable income so low that one year he qualified for the child tax credit which he took the data which was not authorized for publication covered 15 years and thousands of wealthy taxpayers and in june the new york times reported that tax laws allowed top managers in the private equity industry to prosper to the tune of billions without paying significant taxes relative to their gains audits the newspaper found were almost nonexistent all this feeds into a widening perception that the major moves in taxation over the last several decades have consistently benefited the higher income groups and particularly those with the greatest accumulated wealth there s a growing realization of what has changed in the tax code the nobel laureate economist joseph e stiglitz wrote in 2016 that snowballing changes to the tax code over the past 35 years have prioritized tax cuts and subsidies focused on those at the top placing a greater tax burden on the rest and causing neglect of critical public investments corporations have accomplished some of this tax avoidance by incorporating overseas or realizing some of their profits offshore one prospect for revenue seeking legislators would be an attempt to curtail these practices and reap a tax bonanza it is also possible the eventual legislation will address the step up in basis policy by which inheritors of property escape taxation on its appreciated value such a move has raised objections from rural interests even though the biden administration has pledged to protect family farms it will be hard to get every democrat in the senate and virtually every one of them in the house of representatives to accept the compromises and disappointments sure to be found in an eventual deal but difficult as this is the president and his party would have no shot whatsoever without the reconciliation process and that process got its start as a major mover of federal fiscal policy in 1981 with reagan s first budget it set a pattern that would dominate for the next 40 years culminating in the most recent tax cuts enacted under former president donald trump bob daugherty ap ap lawmakers watch as reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in october 1986 reagan slashed tax rates and sold the idea of supply side economics as an elixir much of the attention at the time went to the deep cuts reagan proposed to social spending programs as well as his historic increases in spending for the military but just as important as where the money was going was a radical reversal on the revenue side reagan proposed not just lowering the federal income tax but slashing it by 10 in year one and by another 10 in each of the next two years as well at the time the top marginal tax rate on the last dollar earned was still 70 an echo of the world war ii taxes that had risen over 90 on paper and remained there in the peak cold war years of course few people paid anything like that rate and those who were subject to it could find ways to reduce their tax exposure but reagan had become convinced that the high marginal rate as much as the weight of the tax burden overall was the problem in his view it penalized success impeded economic growth dampened the nation s entrepreneurial spirit and weakened its work ethic he spoke of it as much as a moral issue as a material one the 10 cuts were across the board as he liked to say implying they were of equal value to all the dollar value of the cuts was of course far larger for those with larger incomes moreover the tax law changes that accompanied the rate cuts made it easier for individuals and corporations to write off various forms of income and spending to lower their tax bills further the tax rate for capital gains money made from successful investing would come down from 28 to 20 reagan did not get everything he sought in this initial foray against high taxes and progressivity the senate trimmed the third year of the tax cut from 10 to 5 and it would take a second bill the tax reform act of 1986 to pull the marginal top rate all the way down to 28 but reagan s tax cuts in 1981 constituted the strongest move away from progressivity in the income tax since the tax was initiated in the civil war they were the culmination of rising anti tax sentiment in the late 1970s when some states adopted tax limitations by popular referendum that spirit was kept alive in the decades to come by groups such as americans for tax reform led by activist grover norquist starting in 1986 norquist has challenged candidates for office to sign his taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes the great majority of republicans have signed reagan pared back progressivity reagan was able to reverse what had been a decades long commitment to at least the look of progressivity he could do it in part because his 1980 election coattails enabled his party to capture control of the senate for the first time in a quarter century moreover while democrats still had a house majority their ranks included scores of members from southern and midwestern districts that had also voted for reagan when the budget resolution passed in that summer of 1981 63 house democrats joined all 190 republicans in backing it and when the tax package came to its critical votes in july dozens of democrats sided with reagan and the republicans rather than their own leadership in 1982 democrats added to their majority in the house and negotiated some revenue increases with the senate and the white house and in reagan s second term momentum built quickly for a tax overhaul that would combine still lower marginal rates with new business taxes and a paring back of tax preferences and other loopholes the new overhaul s main appeal to democrats was that it exempted far more middle and lower income earners from the income tax altogether mark wilson getty images getty images career anti tax advocate grover norquist here in 2018 called the trump administration s 2017 tax cut reaganite the ultimate compliment from the founder of americans for tax reform the tax reform act of 1986 was hailed as a bipartisan wonderment winning support from bipartisan majorities in a republican senate and a democratic house reagan signed it into law praising the new top rate of 28 and turning a blind eye to the new business levies but effects of the act had scarcely begun to be felt when policymakers began chipping away at them preferences and other specific provisions for industries or other activities were reinserted in the tax code as lobbying and popular demand took their toll the top tax rate started creeping back up in the budget compromises of 1990 and 1993 reaching 39 6 in the presidency of bill clinton nonetheless the clinton years saw a robust economy created in part by the personal computer and the burgeoning internet economy that in turn drove stock prices to historic highs the higher tax rates on income and capital gains brought new highs in federal revenue collections and by 2000 the annual federal budget was remarkably close to being balanced the congressional budget office even projected a surplus in the coming years of the new century large enough to start paying down the national debt which still amounted to less than 6 trillion at that time deficits and debt rose faster after 2000 but the idea of running a surplus and shrinking the debt did not inspire much political excitement instead when newly elected president george w bush took office in 2001 he swiftly moved to cut taxes and a republican congress went along soon the top rate was back down to 35 even as spending raced higher for the wars in afghanistan and iraq the potential surplus never materialized yearly deficits got bigger again and the debt grew apace j scott applewhite ap ap then president barack obama joined by republican and democratic lawmakers signs a bipartisan tax package that extends tax cuts for families at all income levels in december 2010 president barack obama came into office in the midst of an economic free fall from the financial crisis of 2008 his first rescue package included a lot of spending and new borrowing and some relatively marginal cuts to payroll taxes many did not even notice in their paycheck stubs in his second term the top marginal tax rate went back up to 39 6 trump arrived in 2017 and promptly prioritized another general overhaul of the tax code which was again enacted using reconciliation the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was intended to spur growth and seemed to do so in 2018 when the economy briefly grew at a 4 rate early on but slowed thereafter to 2 6 in the fourth quarter and a 2 9 rate for the year trump s overhaul eagerly supported by republicans in both chambers reduced the top tax rate to 37 for individuals and reduced the rate for six lower brackets as well dropped the corporate rate from 35 to 21 and exempted the value of estates worth up to 11 2 million from the estate tax the exempt amount had been about half that while providing numerous other breaks for banks and other industries the trump cuts were projected to add up to 2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years and indeed federal revenues plummeted immediately corporate tax revenue fell 31 in the first year evan vucci ap ap then president donald trump displays the 1 5 trillion tax overhaul package he signed in december 2017 the net effect of trump s cuts on top of the second president bush s has been more than sufficient to counteract the smaller moves toward more revenue under george h w bush clinton and obama tax cuts are generally popular but trump s package delivered disproportionately to corporations and the wealthy the non partisan tax policy center has reported 60 of the savings went to people in the top quintile one fifth of the income ladder perceptions of that skew among wage earners helped democrats recapture the house in 2018 and were often cited by democratic candidates during the presidential primaries in 2020 that leaves biden with the double challenge of reducing future deficits while also addressing inequity in the sharing of the tax burden it s the dual mission of the tax portions of the reconciliation bill now taking shape in the tax writing committees to raise enough revenue to prevent the new spending from adding too much to future deficits but democrats also want to make sure whatever new revenue they raise comes from corporations and high income individuals the categories that have benefited most from the tax trends that began with reagan s 1981 reconciliation breakthrough copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
michael sussmann prominent cybersecurity lawyer is accused of making a false statement to the fbi washington the prosecutor tasked with examining the u s government s investigation into russian election interference charged a prominent cybersecurity lawyer on thursday with making a false statement to the fbi the case against the attorney michael sussmann of the perkins coie law firm is just the second prosecution brought by special counsel john durham in two and a half years of work yet neither case brought by durham undoes the core finding of an earlier investigation by robert mueller that russia had interfered in sweeping fashion on behalf of donald trump s 2016 presidential campaign and that the trump campaign welcomed that aid it lays bare the wide ranging and evolving nature of durham s investigation in addition to having scrutinized the activities of fbi and cia officials during the early days of the russia probe it has also looked at the behavior of private individuals like sussman who provided the u s government with information as it scrambled to determine whether trump associates were coordinating with russia to tip the election s outcome the indictment accuses sussmann of hiding that he was working with hillary clinton s presidential campaign during a september 2016 conversation he had with the fbi s general counsel when he relayed concerns from cybersecurity researchers about potentially suspicious contacts between russia based alfa bank and a trump organization server the fbi looked into the matter but found no connections sussmann is a former federal prosecutor who specializes in cybersecurity sussmann s lawyers sean berkowitz and michael bosworth said their client is a highly respected national security lawyer who had previously worked in the justice department under both republican and democratic administrations and said they were confident he would prevail at trial and vindicate his good name mr sussmann has committed no crime they said in a statement any prosecution here would be baseless unprecedented and an unwarranted deviation from the apolitical and principled way in which the department of justice is supposed to do its work the alfa bank matter was not a pivotal element of the russia probe and was not even mentioned in mueller s 448 page report in 2019 still the indictment may give fodder to russia investigation critics who regard it as politically tainted and engineered by democrats sussmann s firm perkins coie has deep democratic connections a then partner at the firm marc elias brokered a deal with the fusion gps research firm to study trump s business ties to russia that work by former british spy christopher steele produced a dossier of research that helped form the basis of flawed surveillance applications targeting a former trump campaign official carter page perkins coie said sussmann resigned from the firm thursday after the indictment was handed down to focus on his legal defense the durham investigation has already spanned months longer than the earlier special counsel probe into russian election interference conducted by mueller the former fbi director and his team the investigation was slowed by the coronavirus pandemic and experienced leadership tumult following the abrupt departure last fall of a top deputy on durham s team though trump had eagerly anticipated durham s findings in hopes that they d be a boon to his reelection campaign any political impact the conclusion may have once had has been dimmed by the fact that trump is no longer in office the durham appointment by then attorney general william barr in 2019 was designed to examine potential errors or misconduct in the u s government s investigation into whether trump s 2016 presidential campaign was conspiring with russia to sway the outcome of the election a two year investigation by mueller established that the trump campaign was eager to receive and benefit from kremlin aid and documented multiple interactions between russians and trump associates investigators said they did not find enough evidence to charge any campaign official with having conspired with russia though a half dozen trump aides were charged with various offenses including false statements

by shrutee sarkar and indradip ghosh bengaluru reuters the u s economic rebound has been dented in q3 partly on the spread of the delta coronavirus variant with economists in a reuters poll also pushing their expectations back to november for when the federal reserve announces an impending policy shift like in most countries the u s economy is facing global supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic which have also pushed up inflation but economic disruption in many parts of the country has been sharp as the delta variant spreads especially among people who are hesitant to take vaccines the shift in expectations over the past month for when the fed will announce a taper to its 120 billion in monthly bond purchases has been almost as sudden as the unexpected dent to the recovery in the current quarter for now most economists say the growth slowdown will be temporary and so far have not made any major changes to a strong outlook for next year despite president joe biden s mandates to spur americans who are not vaccinated to get a shot children heading back to school and some firms continuing with return to office plans could still aggravate the risk of a further spread there has been rising concern a growth scare is underway in the u s and at first blush the sharp markdown to our third quarter growth estimates would seemingly support that view said ellen zentner chief u s economist at morgan stanley nyse who said delta had left an ugly mark in august the bottom line is the expansion continues to progress albeit at a slower pace she said the median q3 growth forecast in the sept 13 16 reuters poll was slashed to a 4 4 seasonally adjusted annualized rate from 7 0 just a month ago and well below the second quarter s 6 6 growth with the range showing lower lows and lower highs the q4 median was chopped to 5 1 from 5 9 nearly 85 of 51 economists who responded to an extra question in the poll said the spread of the delta variant had a material impact on their quarterly gdp growth forecasts over the last month reuters poll graphic on the u s economic outlook but the growth outlook for next year is a still robust 4 2 unchanged from the august poll and 2 3 in 2023 only a notch lower than the 2 4 predicted last month in the meantime the expected timing of the fed s taper announcement has shifted decisively over the past month partly because inflation also remains elevated nearly three quarters of respondents 36 of 49 said the taper announcement will come in november and not this month as previously thought the main problem is that they have reached a plateau in terms of vaccination which will be very difficult to raise further because of a certain segment of the population who just don t want to be vaccinated said philip marey senior u s strategist at rabobank if there is going to be much more damage from the delta variant to the economy then we could see a delay of the formal announcement from november to december or even january while six respondents still expect an announcement at the conclusion of the fed s sept 21 22 meeting economic uncertainty due to rising covid 19 cases and a weak jobs report last month have led most economists to shift their expectations reuters poll graphic on the federal reserve taper outlook asked about the greater risk to the job market forecasts a slight majority of respondents said it was to the downside the unemployment rate was expected to remain above its pre pandemic level of 3 5 at least until 2023 over 60 of respondents expected the taper to begin in december with monthly reductions of 10 billion in purchases of treasuries and 5 billion in mortgage backed securities a majority of economists expected it to end in q3 2022 while the consensus showed the federal funds rate would remain unchanged at 0 00 0 25 until 2023 over one quarter of respondents 16 of 56 said the fed would raise rates next year for the first time in this cycle the core personal consumption expenditures price index which recorded its biggest surge since 1991 in june was expected to remain above 3 5 per quarter on average for the rest of 2021 core pce inflation was expected to cool slightly but remain above the central bank s 2 0 target at least until 2023
forget the reshuffle the more significant announcement made by boris johnson over the last few days is the security and cooperation agreement he has signed with the united states and australia or aukus as it s to be known in a scene that wouldn t have looked out of place in a bond movie the leaders of the three powers linked up live by video on wednesday night to unveil what has the makings of one of the most historic defence partnerships for decades while none of the leaders us president joe biden australia s scott morrison or johnson mentioned china directly their message was crystal clear xi jinping watch out prime minister boris johnson linked up with with us president joe biden and australian prime minister scott morrison for a virtual press conference to announce the aukus agreement for the first time the new aukus pact will let australia build nuclear powered submarines using technology and expertise from the us and the uk to create a new western bulwark in the asia pacific region while biden got himself into another muddle addressing morrison as that fella down under johnson used his spot in the limelight to spell out how aukus will be a big boost for new jobs and investment to the uk and of course he couldn t resist adding will help with levelling up across the country so it might shares in rolls royce and bae jumped on the overnight news as both companies are involved in building submarines and associated technologies at the barrow shipyards in cumbria bae systems designs and makes nuclear submarines for the royal navy the latest being the astute model for its part rolls royce is a specialist in nuclear propulsion for submarines having provided the power for all of the royal navy s nuclear submarines at its derby factory for the last 60 years it s too early to know the details of the agreement and who gets what and where but at first glance the pact is good for bae which generates just over two thirds of its income from the three countries while rolls royce earns about half of its revenue from the three the timing is good too as both companies have been hit badly by the pandemic because of their big exposure to civil aerospace a sector which will take years to recover because of the slowdown in long haul air travel laura hoy at hargreaves lansdown says there will be other benefits for bae and rolls royce as they also have interests in ai cyber security and other surveillance technologies another part of the new agreement and so will some of the world s biggest tech companies it s hard not to have some sympathy for the french also a nuclear power which has been left out in the cold for now anyway it looks as though the french deal with canberra to supply diesel submarines has been dropped if the trio are sensible they will find a role for the french one of nato s biggest military spenders alongside the uk and not a country to snub whether you approve or not of higher defence spending the new pact signals that higher spending is here to stay and that biden is no less keen on turning off the defence spending tap than trump was holding defence stocks has suddenly become far more defensive marlboro man it s time for some of the city s big investors to hold up a mirror to look again at their mission statements and compare them to what they do in practice the latest example of the contrast between the two is how so many of the uk s big institutions have rolled over to accept the bid by marlboro owner philip morris for vectura the inhaler business most of those same investors however are all too eager to spout off about their concern for esg matters and how deeply they care about the environment diversity and other sensitive issues but there is a case for accepting big tobacco s money in return for vectura s shares which is that they believe the philip morris boss when he says he wants to quit the habit and that backing him to make that move is a positive one if that s the case they should say so otherwise why should shareholders believe them on any other issue market driven walking through my local waitrose car park earlier this week i overheard two young chaps chatting about the lorry driver shortage one said to the other have you heard they are shortening the hgv test and supermarkets are paying bonuses for new drivers i m thinking of leaving my job and going for it as i can double my pay the other replied i ve already quit mine start training next week maybe the market is working
fed chairman jerome powell has decided the fed ought to review its ethics policies after it was revealed that high ranking personnel at the fed were actively trading stocks even as the fed was busy pulling the levers on monetary policy cnbc reported today federal reserve chairman jerome powell directed staff to review the central bank s ethics rules for appropriate financial activities after disclosures that several senior central bank officials made multiple multimillion dollar stock trades in 2020 while others held significant investments last week financial disclosures filed by the fed s 12 regional presidents revealed some had actively traded in 2020 while others held million dollar financial positions without making changes to their portfolios specifically dallas fed president robert kaplan made numerous trades worth 1 million or more last year meanwhile boston fed president eric rosengren last year was making large trades in real estate investment trusts possibly in the six figure range the problem here is obvious to any normal person who watches the fed the fed is not just an instrument of monetary policy but a regulator of financial institutions the fed regulates bank holding companies foreign banks working in the us hundreds of state member banks and other institutions as well this gives fed policymakers an enormous amount of control over the fortunes of many financial institutions moreover fed policy can be and these days usually is instrumental in pushing up stock prices and real estate prices through monetary inflation since the great recession and arguably since the late 1980s with the greenspan put the fed has been instrumental in subsidizing stock prices through an implied promise that the fed will rush to the rescue if financial markets face any real risk of falling prices since the great recession especially the fed s unconventional monetary policy has meant the fed has sucked up trillions of dollars in bonds and mortgage debt this means both a direct subsidy of real estate investments and also as fed asset purchases push down interest rates a flight to yield in the stock market not surprisingly we can see a clear correlation between the fed s easy money policy and a supercharged stock market the information available to these regulators and policymakers also provides an enormous amount of insider information not available to outsiders so perhaps fed officials should divest themselves of their stock and real estate portfolios at the very least for rosengren and kaplan however this is crazy talk since both men insisted their actions were consistent with their respective bank s code of conduct policies this may very well be true although this only illustrates how the federal reserve system is soft on potential corruption within the ranks of its leadership after all rosengren and kaplan only offered to sell their holdings after a public scandal broke out non fed personnel were less sanguine on the issue as the wall street journal reported mr kaplan s trading should be a scandal said professor peter conti brown of the university of pennsylvania an expert on the structure of the federal reserve if he s making directional bets on interest rates we will not be able to tell if he s advocating for policies for the public good or talking his book it s a fundamental conflict of interest mr conti brown also said that the perception that mr kaplan could personally profit from his fed role feeds into longstanding skepticism of the fed held in some corners kathryn judge a law professor at columbia university said fed officials are privy to all kinds of information that has the potential to move markets while mr kaplan may have followed the letter of the code she said it is unclear if he followed the spirit the position of kaplan and rosengren is typical for government officials which is what fed officials essentially are this is also common in congress what matters is finding loopholes allowing the official to maximize his personal wealth capitalizing on his ability to affect regulations and conditions that affect the prices of his investments all that matters is that the lawyers say it s okay it s not surprising of course that congress is chock full of millionaires the fed s boards aren t exactly populated by regular folk and this may be significant in helping us understand how fed policy has been so lopsided in favoring the ultrawealthy while imposing price inflation and a higher cost of living on people of more ordinary means fed policy has been extremely successful from the point of view of billionaires and hedge fund managers holding huge stock portfolios and real estate holdings the prices just keep going up and at rates that outpace official price inflation rates but for first time home buyers and the many millions of american workers who own few stocks they just face higher prices for housing education healthcare and now even food investing is out of the question because ultralow interest rate policy makes traditional conservative low risk investments like savings accounts basically worthless wholesale food prices are up 12 7 percent but eric rosengren has more than a million dollars to throw around he s doing fine

if congress manages to pass president biden s big budget package this fall with most of its spending and tax changes intact it will represent the biggest shift in federal fiscal policy in 40 years if it happens still a big if it will be because congress can circumvent its usual rules and process tax and spending measures via a process called reconciliation that process is a powerhouse capable of major disruptions and changes in government because it offers protection from filibuster reconciliation bills can pass with a simple majority that is why biden and his allies house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer think they have a shot at raising trillions in tax revenue over the next 10 years to pay for their spending priorities democrats propose to raise the needed revenue through borrowing as well as through more robust revenue collections thanks to a beefed up irs but the bulk of it would come from tougher tax treatment and higher tax rates on corporations investors and others whose annual income exceeds 400 000 if they succeed they will be using reconciliation to reverse the direction of federal tax policy which has brought down the top tax rate and made other changes that benefit corporations and the wealthy over the past four decades and they will be doing it with the same process that was used to set that direction four decades ago when first year president ronald reagan used reconciliation to achieve his revolution in federal fiscal policy in 1981 polls have shown americans support higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy tax increases are rarely popular but polling this summer has generally found the public supportive of higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy at the same time reports surfaced that show that mega corporations and ultra rich individuals pay little or nothing in federal income tax for example in june propublica published a trove of tax data leaked from the irs that showed such prominent billionaires as tesla founder elon musk and berkshire hathaway investment guru warren buffett paid little income tax in relation to their vast income gains in some years paying none at all buffett who has campaigned for some democratic candidates has famously said he should not be paying a lower rate than his secretary propublica said the data showed amazon founder jeff bezos realizes billions each year in asset appreciation such as rising stock prices and yet can keep his taxable income so low that one year he qualified for the child tax credit which he took the data which was not authorized for publication covered 15 years and thousands of wealthy taxpayers and in june the new york times reported that tax laws allowed top managers in the private equity industry to prosper to the tune of billions without paying significant taxes relative to their gains audits the newspaper found were almost nonexistent all this feeds into a widening perception that the major moves in taxation over the last several decades have consistently benefited the higher income groups and particularly those with the greatest accumulated wealth there s a growing realization of what has changed in the tax code the nobel laureate economist joseph e stiglitz wrote in 2016 that snowballing changes to the tax code over the past 35 years have prioritized tax cuts and subsidies focused on those at the top placing a greater tax burden on the rest and causing neglect of critical public investments corporations have accomplished some of this tax avoidance by incorporating overseas or realizing some of their profits offshore one prospect for revenue seeking legislators would be an attempt to curtail these practices and reap a tax bonanza it is also possible the eventual legislation will address the step up in basis policy by which inheritors of property escape taxation on its appreciated value such a move has raised objections from rural interests even though the biden administration has pledged to protect family farms it will be hard to get every democrat in the senate and virtually every one of them in the house of representatives to accept the compromises and disappointments sure to be found in an eventual deal but difficult as this is the president and his party would have no shot whatsoever without the reconciliation process and that process got its start as a major mover of federal fiscal policy in 1981 with reagan s first budget it set a pattern that would dominate for the next 40 years culminating in the most recent tax cuts enacted under former president donald trump bob daugherty ap ap lawmakers watch as reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in october 1986 reagan slashed tax rates and sold the idea of supply side economics as an elixir much of the attention at the time went to the deep cuts reagan proposed to social spending programs as well as his historic increases in spending for the military but just as important as where the money was going was a radical reversal on the revenue side reagan proposed not just lowering the federal income tax but slashing it by 10 in year one and by another 10 in each of the next two years as well at the time the top marginal tax rate on the last dollar earned was still 70 an echo of the world war ii taxes that had risen over 90 on paper and remained there in the peak cold war years of course few people paid anything like that rate and those who were subject to it could find ways to reduce their tax exposure but reagan had become convinced that the high marginal rate as much as the weight of the tax burden overall was the problem in his view it penalized success impeded economic growth dampened the nation s entrepreneurial spirit and weakened its work ethic he spoke of it as much as a moral issue as a material one the 10 cuts were across the board as he liked to say implying they were of equal value to all the dollar value of the cuts was of course far larger for those with larger incomes moreover the tax law changes that accompanied the rate cuts made it easier for individuals and corporations to write off various forms of income and spending to lower their tax bills further the tax rate for capital gains money made from successful investing would come down from 28 to 20 reagan did not get everything he sought in this initial foray against high taxes and progressivity the senate trimmed the third year of the tax cut from 10 to 5 and it would take a second bill the tax reform act of 1986 to pull the marginal top rate all the way down to 28 but reagan s tax cuts in 1981 constituted the strongest move away from progressivity in the income tax since the tax was initiated in the civil war they were the culmination of rising anti tax sentiment in the late 1970s when some states adopted tax limitations by popular referendum that spirit was kept alive in the decades to come by groups such as americans for tax reform led by activist grover norquist starting in 1986 norquist has challenged candidates for office to sign his taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes the great majority of republicans have signed reagan pared back progressivity reagan was able to reverse what had been a decades long commitment to at least the look of progressivity he could do it in part because his 1980 election coattails enabled his party to capture control of the senate for the first time in a quarter century moreover while democrats still had a house majority their ranks included scores of members from southern and midwestern districts that had also voted for reagan when the budget resolution passed in that summer of 1981 63 house democrats joined all 190 republicans in backing it and when the tax package came to its critical votes in july dozens of democrats sided with reagan and the republicans rather than their own leadership in 1982 democrats added to their majority in the house and negotiated some revenue increases with the senate and the white house and in reagan s second term momentum built quickly for a tax overhaul that would combine still lower marginal rates with new business taxes and a paring back of tax preferences and other loopholes the new overhaul s main appeal to democrats was that it exempted far more middle and lower income earners from the income tax altogether mark wilson getty images getty images career anti tax advocate grover norquist here in 2018 called the trump administration s 2017 tax cut reaganite the ultimate compliment from the founder of americans for tax reform the tax reform act of 1986 was hailed as a bipartisan wonderment winning support from bipartisan majorities in a republican senate and a democratic house reagan signed it into law praising the new top rate of 28 and turning a blind eye to the new business levies but effects of the act had scarcely begun to be felt when policymakers began chipping away at them preferences and other specific provisions for industries or other activities were reinserted in the tax code as lobbying and popular demand took their toll the top tax rate started creeping back up in the budget compromises of 1990 and 1993 reaching 39 6 in the presidency of bill clinton nonetheless the clinton years saw a robust economy created in part by the personal computer and the burgeoning internet economy that in turn drove stock prices to historic highs the higher tax rates on income and capital gains brought new highs in federal revenue collections and by 2000 the annual federal budget was remarkably close to being balanced the congressional budget office even projected a surplus in the coming years of the new century large enough to start paying down the national debt which still amounted to less than 6 trillion at that time deficits and debt rose faster after 2000 but the idea of running a surplus and shrinking the debt did not inspire much political excitement instead when newly elected president george w bush took office in 2001 he swiftly moved to cut taxes and a republican congress went along soon the top rate was back down to 35 even as spending raced higher for the wars in afghanistan and iraq the potential surplus never materialized yearly deficits got bigger again and the debt grew apace j scott applewhite ap ap then president barack obama joined by republican and democratic lawmakers signs a bipartisan tax package that extends tax cuts for families at all income levels in december 2010 president barack obama came into office in the midst of an economic free fall from the financial crisis of 2008 his first rescue package included a lot of spending and new borrowing and some relatively marginal cuts to payroll taxes many did not even notice in their paycheck stubs in his second term the top marginal tax rate went back up to 39 6 trump arrived in 2017 and promptly prioritized another general overhaul of the tax code which was again enacted using reconciliation the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was intended to spur growth and seemed to do so in 2018 when the economy briefly grew at a 4 rate early on but slowed thereafter to 2 6 in the fourth quarter and a 2 9 rate for the year trump s overhaul eagerly supported by republicans in both chambers reduced the top tax rate to 37 for individuals and reduced the rate for six lower brackets as well dropped the corporate rate from 35 to 21 and exempted the value of estates worth up to 11 2 million from the estate tax the exempt amount had been about half that while providing numerous other breaks for banks and other industries the trump cuts were projected to add up to 2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years and indeed federal revenues plummeted immediately corporate tax revenue fell 31 in the first year evan vucci ap ap then president donald trump displays the 1 5 trillion tax overhaul package he signed in december 2017 the net effect of trump s cuts on top of the second president bush s has been more than sufficient to counteract the smaller moves toward more revenue under george h w bush clinton and obama tax cuts are generally popular but trump s package delivered disproportionately to corporations and the wealthy the non partisan tax policy center has reported 60 of the savings went to people in the top quintile one fifth of the income ladder perceptions of that skew among wage earners helped democrats recapture the house in 2018 and were often cited by democratic candidates during the presidential primaries in 2020 that leaves biden with the double challenge of reducing future deficits while also addressing inequity in the sharing of the tax burden it s the dual mission of the tax portions of the reconciliation bill now taking shape in the tax writing committees to raise enough revenue to prevent the new spending from adding too much to future deficits but democrats also want to make sure whatever new revenue they raise comes from corporations and high income individuals the categories that have benefited most from the tax trends that began with reagan s 1981 reconciliation breakthrough copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
cold and flu season has officially started in the u s so it s time to get your annual flu vaccine getting a shot in the arm isn t exactly fun but there is another option the nasal flu vaccine known as flumist quadrivalent or the live attenuated influenza vaccine this flu vaccine lets you bypass the whole needle in arm scenario making it a good option for children and people who are nervous about shots but the nasal flu vaccine isn t for everyone including adults over 50 here s what you need to know before bypassing the shot what is the nasal flu vaccine exactly the nasal flu vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine meaning it contains weakened flu viruses so they won t make you sick the centers for disease control and prevention cdc explains those weakened viruses are specially designed to only multiply at the cooler temperatures found in your nose and not in your lungs or other areas in your body that are warmer just like the regular flu vaccine the nasal flu vaccine targets certain strains of influenza that researchers predict will circulate the most during that given year this year s nasal flu vaccine is a quadrivalent vaccine meaning it targets four strains of the flu the cdc says the 2021 2022 nasal flu vaccine will target the following strains according to the food and drug administration fda and cdc an a victoria 2570 2019 h1n1 pdm09 like virus an a cambodia e0826360 2020 h3n2 like virus a b washington 02 2019 like virus b victoria lineage a b phuket 3073 2013 like virus b yamagata lineage how does the nasal flu vaccine work the process of getting the nasal flu vaccine is pretty simple says infectious disease expert amesh a adalja m d a senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security there is a syringe type of device that contains the vaccine it s inserted into your nose and it mists the vaccine into your nostrils he says the person usually sniffs it this method he explains exposes the lining of your nose aka your nasal mucosa to the vaccine how effective is the nasal flu vaccine the effectiveness of any flu vaccine varies from year to year but the nasal flu vaccine is considered comparable to the flu shot dr adalja says there have been questions of the efficacy of the nasal flu vaccine for certain influenza types such as h1n1 in the past but that s been addressed says thomas russo m d professor and chief of infectious disease at the university at buffalo in new york the cdc s advisory committee on immunization practices does not show a preference for any type of flu vaccine over another this year provided you meet the right qualifications what are potential side effects of the nasal flu vaccine potential side effects can vary depending on whether the vaccine is given to a child or an adult the cdc says side effects for kids can include runny nose wheezing headache vomiting muscle aches low grade fever sore throat for adults they might include runny nose headache cough who is the nasal flu vaccine good for the nasal flu vaccine is approved for use in healthy people who aren t pregnant and are between the ages of two and 49 per the cdc but there is a laundry list of health conditions that can keep you from being eligible for this flu vaccine more on that in a moment it s sort of a niche vaccine given that there are so many contraindications dr russo says but it can be helpful for people who have a needle phobia while adults can get the nasal flu vaccine most tend to opt for the shot generally the nasal flu vaccine is more often given to kids says richard watkins m d an infectious disease physician and professor of internal medicine at the northeast ohio medical university who shouldn t get the nasal flu vaccine the cdc has a big list of people who should skip the nasal flu vaccine that includes children younger than 2 adults 50 years and older people with a history of severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any flu vaccine children 2 through 17 years old who are receiving aspirin or salicylate containing medications children 2 through 4 years old who have asthma or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months people with weakened immune systems immunosuppression from any cause people who care for severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment or otherwise avoid contact with those persons for seven days after getting the nasal spray vaccine people without a spleen or with a non functioning spleen pregnant people people with an active leak between the cerebrospinal fluid and the mouth nose ear or other place within the skull people with cochlear implants people who have taken flu antiviral drugs within a certain amount of time 48 hours for oseltamivir and zanamivir 5 days for peramivir and 17 days for baloxavir the cdc also cautions against using the nasal flu vaccine for people with the following health conditions asthma in people 5 years and older other underlying medical conditions that can put people at higher risk of serious flu complications including lung disease heart disease kidney disease like diabetes kidney or liver disorders neurologic neuromuscular or metabolic disorders moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever developing guillain barré syndrome within six weeks following a previous dose of flu vaccine where can you get the nasal flu vaccine it s usually available where other flu vaccines are offered but given that it s not as popular as the flu shot not every doctor s office or drugstore will have it in stock dr adalja s

t he sceptics have plenty of fodder the earliest adopters of bitcoin the original cryptocurrency used it to buy drugs while cyber hackers now demand their ransom in it hundreds of millions of dollars of ether another digital money were stolen this year after hackers found a bug in some code many believers are in reality trying to get rich quick from the global mania that has seen the value of cryptoassets reach 2 2trn others are freakishly devoted the entrepreneur who announced in june that el salvador was adopting bitcoin as an official currency sobbed on stage claiming it would save the nation listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the crooks fools and proselytisers are off putting nevertheless the rise of an ecosystem of financial services known as decentralised finance or defi deserves sober consideration it has the potential to rewire how the financial system works with all the promise and perils that entails the proliferation of innovation in defi is akin to the frenzy of invention in the early phase of the web at a time when people live ever more of their lives online the crypto revolution could even remake the architecture of the digital economy defi is one of three tech trends disrupting finance tech platform firms are muscling in on payments and banks governments are launching digital currencies or govcoins defi offers an alternative path which aims to spread power not concentrate it to understand how start with blockchains vast networks of computers that keep an open incorruptible common record and update it without the need for a central authority bitcoin the first big blockchain created in 2009 is now a distraction instead ethereum a blockchain network created in 2015 upon which most defi applications are built is reaching critical mass its developers view finance as a juicy target conventional banking requires a huge infrastructure to maintain trust between strangers from clearing houses and compliance to capital rules and courts it is expensive and often captured by insiders think of credit card fees and bankers yachts by contrast transactions on a blockchain are trustworthy cheap transparent and quick at least in theory although the terminology is intimidating fees are gas the main currency is ether and title deeds over digital assets are known as nft s the basic activities taking place on defi are familiar these include trading on exchanges and issuing loans and taking deposits through self executing agreements called smart contracts one yardstick of activity is the value of digital instruments being used as collateral from almost nothing in early 2018 it has reached 90bn another is the value of transactions that ethereum is verifying in the second quarter this reached 2 5trn around the same sum as visa processes and equivalent to a sixth of the activity on nasdaq a stock exchange the dream of a low friction financial system is just the beginning defi is spreading to more ambitious terrain metamask a defi wallet with more than 10m users acts as a digital identity to enter a decentralised metaverse a looking glass world with shops run by its users you link your wallet to a cartoonish avatar who roams around these digital worlds will become the subject of intensifying competition as more spending shifts online big tech firms could impose huge taxes on these mini economies imagine apple s app store charging fees or facebook selling your avatar s intimate secrets a better alternative might be decentralised networks that host applications and are run mutually by users defi could provide payments and property rights crypto enthusiasts see a utopia but there is a long way to go before defi is as reliable as say jpmorgan chase or paypal some problems are prosaic a common criticism is that blockchain platforms do not scale easily and that the computers they harness consume wasteful amounts of electricity but ethereum is a self improvement machine when it is in high demand the fees it charges for verification can climb encouraging developers to work on minimising the intensity with which they use it there will be new versions of ethereum other better blockchains could one day replace it yet defi also raises questions about how a virtual economy with its own norms interacts with the real world one worry is the lack of an external anchor of value cryptocurrencies are no different from the dollar in that they rely on people having a shared expectation of their utility however conventional money is also backed by states with a monopoly on force and central banks that are lenders of last resort without these defi will be vulnerable to panics contract enforcement outside the virtual world is also a concern a blockchain contract may say you own a house but only the police can enforce an eviction governance and accountability in defi land are rudimentary a sequence of large irrevocable transactions that humans cannot override could be dangerous especially as coding errors are inevitable money laundering has thrived in the ungoverned grey zone of services lying between ethereum and the banking system despite the claims of decentralisation some programmers and app owners hold disproportionate sway over the defi system and a malign actor could even gain control over a majority of the computers that run a blockchain alice s adventures in defi land digital libertarians would prefer that defi remain autonomous imperfect but pure yet to succeed it must integrate with the conventional financial and legal systems as gary gensler a crypto expert who is america s financial watchdog has outlined many defi applications are run by decentralised organisations which vote on some issues these bodies

if congress manages to pass president biden s big budget package this fall with most of its spending and tax changes intact it will represent the biggest shift in federal fiscal policy in 40 years if it happens still a big if it will be because congress can circumvent its usual rules and process tax and spending measures via a process called reconciliation that process is a powerhouse capable of major disruptions and changes in government because it offers protection from filibuster reconciliation bills can pass with a simple majority that is why biden and his allies house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer think they have a shot at raising trillions in tax revenue over the next 10 years to pay for their spending priorities democrats propose to raise the needed revenue through borrowing as well as through more robust revenue collections thanks to a beefed up irs but the bulk of it would come from tougher tax treatment and higher tax rates on corporations investors and others whose annual income exceeds 400 000 if they succeed they will be using reconciliation to reverse the direction of federal tax policy which has brought down the top tax rate and made other changes that benefit corporations and the wealthy over the past four decades and they will be doing it with the same process that was used to set that direction four decades ago when first year president ronald reagan used reconciliation to achieve his revolution in federal fiscal policy in 1981 polls have shown americans support higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy tax increases are rarely popular but polling this summer has generally found the public supportive of higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy at the same time reports surfaced that show that mega corporations and ultra rich individuals pay little or nothing in federal income tax for example in june propublica published a trove of tax data leaked from the irs that showed such prominent billionaires as tesla founder elon musk and berkshire hathaway investment guru warren buffett paid little income tax in relation to their vast income gains in some years paying none at all buffett who has campaigned for some democratic candidates has famously said he should not be paying a lower rate than his secretary propublica said the data showed amazon founder jeff bezos realizes billions each year in asset appreciation such as rising stock prices and yet can keep his taxable income so low that one year he qualified for the child tax credit which he took the data which was not authorized for publication covered 15 years and thousands of wealthy taxpayers and in june the new york times reported that tax laws allowed top managers in the private equity industry to prosper to the tune of billions without paying significant taxes relative to their gains audits the newspaper found were almost nonexistent all this feeds into a widening perception that the major moves in taxation over the last several decades have consistently benefited the higher income groups and particularly those with the greatest accumulated wealth there s a growing realization of what has changed in the tax code the nobel laureate economist joseph e stiglitz wrote in 2016 that snowballing changes to the tax code over the past 35 years have prioritized tax cuts and subsidies focused on those at the top placing a greater tax burden on the rest and causing neglect of critical public investments corporations have accomplished some of this tax avoidance by incorporating overseas or realizing some of their profits offshore one prospect for revenue seeking legislators would be an attempt to curtail these practices and reap a tax bonanza it is also possible the eventual legislation will address the step up in basis policy by which inheritors of property escape taxation on its appreciated value such a move has raised objections from rural interests even though the biden administration has pledged to protect family farms it will be hard to get every democrat in the senate and virtually every one of them in the house of representatives to accept the compromises and disappointments sure to be found in an eventual deal but difficult as this is the president and his party would have no shot whatsoever without the reconciliation process and that process got its start as a major mover of federal fiscal policy in 1981 with reagan s first budget it set a pattern that would dominate for the next 40 years culminating in the most recent tax cuts enacted under former president donald trump bob daugherty ap ap lawmakers watch as reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in october 1986 reagan slashed tax rates and sold the idea of supply side economics as an elixir much of the attention at the time went to the deep cuts reagan proposed to social spending programs as well as his historic increases in spending for the military but just as important as where the money was going was a radical reversal on the revenue side reagan proposed not just lowering the federal income tax but slashing it by 10 in year one and by another 10 in each of the next two years as well at the time the top marginal tax rate on the last dollar earned was still 70 an echo of the world war ii taxes that had risen over 90 on paper and remained there in the peak cold war years of course few people paid anything like that rate and those who were subject to it could find ways to reduce their tax exposure but reagan had become convinced that the high marginal rate as much as the weight of the tax burden overall was the problem in his view it penalized success impeded economic growth dampened the nation s entrepreneurial spirit and weakened its work ethic he spoke of it as much as a moral issue as a material one the 10 cuts were across the board as he liked to say implying they were of equal value to all the dollar value of the cuts was of course far larger for those with larger incomes moreover the tax law changes that accompanied the rate cuts made it easier for individuals and corporations to write off various forms of income and spending to lower their tax bills further the tax rate for capital gains money made from successful investing would come down from 28 to 20 reagan did not get everything he sought in this initial foray against high taxes and progressivity the senate trimmed the third year of the tax cut from 10 to 5 and it would take a second bill the tax reform act of 1986 to pull the marginal top rate all the way down to 28 but reagan s tax cuts in 1981 constituted the strongest move away from progressivity in the income tax since the tax was initiated in the civil war they were the culmination of rising anti tax sentiment in the late 1970s when some states adopted tax limitations by popular referendum that spirit was kept alive in the decades to come by groups such as americans for tax reform led by activist grover norquist starting in 1986 norquist has challenged candidates for office to sign his taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes the great majority of republicans have signed reagan pared back progressivity reagan was able to reverse what had been a decades long commitment to at least the look of progressivity he could do it in part because his 1980 election coattails enabled his party to capture control of the senate for the first time in a quarter century moreover while democrats still had a house majority their ranks included scores of members from southern and midwestern districts that had also voted for reagan when the budget resolution passed in that summer of 1981 63 house democrats joined all 190 republicans in backing it and when the tax package came to its critical votes in july dozens of democrats sided with reagan and the republicans rather than their own leadership in 1982 democrats added to their majority in the house and negotiated some revenue increases with the senate and the white house and in reagan s second term momentum built quickly for a tax overhaul that would combine still lower marginal rates with new business taxes and a paring back of tax preferences and other loopholes the new overhaul s main appeal to democrats was that it exempted far more middle and lower income earners from the income tax altogether mark wilson getty images getty images career anti tax advocate grover norquist here in 2018 called the trump administration s 2017 tax cut reaganite the ultimate compliment from the founder of americans for tax reform the tax reform act of 1986 was hailed as a bipartisan wonderment winning support from bipartisan majorities in a republican senate and a democratic house reagan signed it into law praising the new top rate of 28 and turning a blind eye to the new business levies but effects of the act had scarcely begun to be felt when policymakers began chipping away at them preferences and other specific provisions for industries or other activities were reinserted in the tax code as lobbying and popular demand took their toll the top tax rate started creeping back up in the budget compromises of 1990 and 1993 reaching 39 6 in the presidency of bill clinton nonetheless the clinton years saw a robust economy created in part by the personal computer and the burgeoning internet economy that in turn drove stock prices to historic highs the higher tax rates on income and capital gains brought new highs in federal revenue collections and by 2000 the annual federal budget was remarkably close to being balanced the congressional budget office even projected a surplus in the coming years of the new century large enough to start paying down the national debt which still amounted to less than 6 trillion at that time deficits and debt rose faster after 2000 but the idea of running a surplus and shrinking the debt did not inspire much political excitement instead when newly elected president george w bush took office in 2001 he swiftly moved to cut taxes and a republican congress went along soon the top rate was back down to 35 even as spending raced higher for the wars in afghanistan and iraq the potential surplus never materialized yearly deficits got bigger again and the debt grew apace j scott applewhite ap ap then president barack obama joined by republican and democratic lawmakers signs a bipartisan tax package that extends tax cuts for families at all income levels in december 2010 president barack obama came into office in the midst of an economic free fall from the financial crisis of 2008 his first rescue package included a lot of spending and new borrowing and some relatively marginal cuts to payroll taxes many did not even notice in their paycheck stubs in his second term the top marginal tax rate went back up to 39 6 trump arrived in 2017 and promptly prioritized another general overhaul of the tax code which was again enacted using reconciliation the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was intended to spur growth and seemed to do so in 2018 when the economy briefly grew at a 4 rate early on but slowed thereafter to 2 6 in the fourth quarter and a 2 9 rate for the year trump s overhaul eagerly supported by republicans in both chambers reduced the top tax rate to 37 for individuals and reduced the rate for six lower brackets as well dropped the corporate rate from 35 to 21 and exempted the value of estates worth up to 11 2 million from the estate tax the exempt amount had been about half that while providing numerous other breaks for banks and other industries the trump cuts were projected to add up to 2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years and indeed federal revenues plummeted immediately corporate tax revenue fell 31 in the first year evan vucci ap ap then president donald trump displays the 1 5 trillion tax overhaul package he signed in december 2017 the net effect of trump s cuts on top of the second president bush s has been more than sufficient to counteract the smaller moves toward more revenue under george h w bush clinton and obama tax cuts are generally popular but trump s package delivered disproportionately to corporations and the wealthy the non partisan tax policy center has reported 60 of the savings went to people in the top quintile one fifth of the income ladder perceptions of that skew among wage earners helped democrats recapture the house in 2018 and were often cited by democratic candidates during the presidential primaries in 2020 that leaves biden with the double challenge of reducing future deficits while also addressing inequity in the sharing of the tax burden it s the dual mission of the tax portions of the reconciliation bill now taking shape in the tax writing committees to raise enough revenue to prevent the new spending from adding too much to future deficits but democrats also want to make sure whatever new revenue they raise comes from corporations and high income individuals the categories that have benefited most from the tax trends that began with reagan s 1981 reconciliation breakthrough copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

contagion risk was on full display on thursday chinese junk bond yields jumped to an 18 month high and shares of real estate companies plunged after evergrande had its credit rating downgraded and requested a trading halt in its onshore bonds some banks in china appear to be hoarding yuan at the highest cost in almost four years a sign they may be preparing for what a mizuho financial group strategist called a liquidity squeeze in crisis mode where xi will ultimately draw the line remains a mystery while china s top financial regulator has urged billionaire evergrande founder hui ka yan to solve his company s debt problems authorities have yet to spell out whether the government would allow a major debt restructuring or bankruptcy property is the biggest bubble that everyone has been talking about in china so if anything happens this could clearly cause systematic risk to the whole china economy yu yong chief risk officer at china agriculture reinsurance fund even senior officials at state owned banks say privately that they re still waiting for guidance on a long term solution from top leaders in beijing evergrande s main banks were told by china s housing ministry this week that the developer won t be able to make interest payments due september 20 according to people familiar with the matter china s government isn t averse to taking over companies from the private sector if needed it seized baoshang bank in 2019 and assumed control of hna group the once sprawling conglomerate in early 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic decimated the company s main travel business court led restructurings have also become more common in recent years with more than 700 being completed in 2020 the evergrande endgame may depend largely on how xi decides to balance his goals of maintaining social and financial stability against his multi year campaign to reduce moral hazard the timing is particularly tricky as china juggles an economic slowdown a sweeping crackdown on the private sector and rising tensions with washington all in the runup to a once in five year leadership reshuffle in 2022 at which xi is set to extend his indefinite rule construction of unfinished properties with enough floor space to cover three fourths of manhattan is at risk credit bloomberg the government has to be very very careful in balancing support for evergrande said yu yong a former china banking and insurance regulatory commission regulator and now chief risk officer at china agriculture reinsurance fund property is the biggest bubble that everyone has been talking about in china yu told everbright sun hung kai analyst jonas short in a recent podcast so if anything happens this could clearly cause systematic risk to the whole china economy here are some of the factors that may sway chinese leaders social unrest maintaining social order has always been paramount for the communist party which has little tolerance for protests of any kind in guangzhou homebuyers surrounded a local housing bureau last week to demand evergrande restart stalled construction disgruntled retail investors have gathered at the company s shenzhen headquarters for at least three straight days this week and unconfirmed videos of protests against the developer in other parts of china have been shared widely online evergrande had 1 3 trillion yuan 276 billion in presale liabilities at the end of june equivalent to about 1 4 million individual properties that it has committed to complete according to a capital economics report last week if evergrande had to dump its inventory onto the market it would drag down property prices substantially said hao hong chief strategist at bocom international without a social safety net and with limited places to put their money chinese savers have for years been encouraged to buy homes whose prices were only ever supposed to go up today real estate accounts for 40 per cent of household assets and buying a house or two is a cultural touchstone while housing affordability has become a hot topic in the west many chinese are more likely to protest falling home prices than spiking ones given that the bulk of people s wealth is already in property even a 10 per cent correction would be a serious knock to many people said fraser howie an independent analyst and co author of books on chinese finance who has been following the country s corporate sector for decades it would certainly knock their hopes and dreams and expectations about what property is another potential flashpoint is whether evergrande can repay high yield wealth management products that it sold to thousands of retail investors including many of its own employees about 40 billion yuan of the wmps are due to be repaid according to caixin a chinese financial news service evergrande is trying to free up cash by selling assets including stakes in its electric car and property management businesses but has so far made little progress capital markets evergrande is the largest high yield dollar bond issuer in china accounting for 16 per cent of outstanding notes according to bank of america analysts should the company collapse that alone would push the default rate on the country s junk dollar bond market to 14 per cent from 3 per cent they wrote in a note this month while beijing has become more comfortable with allowing weaker businesses to fail an uncontrolled spike in offshore funding costs would risk derailing a key source of financing it could also undermine global confidence in the country s issuers at a time when beijing is pushing for larger foreign investor ownership yields on china s junk dollar bonds are nearing 14 per cent up from about 7 4 per cent in february according to a bloomberg index the stakes are higher on the mainland where the credit market is about 15 times the size at us12 trillion while evergrande is less of a whale onshore a collapse could force banks to cut their holdings of corporate notes and even freeze money markets the very plumbing of china s financial system in such a credit crunch the government or central bank would likely be forced to act banks involved in property lending may come under pressure leading to an increase in soured loans smaller banks exposed to evergrande or other weaker developers may face significant increases in non performing loans in the event of a default according to fitch ratings economic impact concern over evergrande comes at a time when china s economy is already slowing aggressive controls to curb outbreaks of covid 19 are hurting retail spending and travel while measures to cool property prices are taking a toll loading data this week showed home sales by value slumped 20 per cent in august from a year earlier the biggest drop since the onset of the coronavirus early last year responding to a question on evergrande s potential impact on the economy national bureau of statistics spokesman fu linghui said some large property enterprises are running into difficulties and the fallout remains to be seen china s current priorities of promoting common prosperity and deterring excessive risk taking mean there s unlikely to be any easing of property curbs this year according to macquarie group the sector will be a main growth headwind for next year although policy makers may loosen restrictions to defend growth goals macquarie analysts wrote in a note on wednesday

if congress manages to pass president biden s big budget package this fall with most of its spending and tax changes intact it will represent the biggest shift in federal fiscal policy in 40 years if it happens still a big if it will be because congress can circumvent its usual rules and process tax and spending measures via a process called reconciliation that process is a powerhouse capable of major disruptions and changes in government because it offers protection from filibuster reconciliation bills can pass with a simple majority that is why biden and his allies house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer think they have a shot at raising trillions in tax revenue over the next 10 years to pay for their spending priorities democrats propose to raise the needed revenue through borrowing as well as through more robust revenue collections thanks to a beefed up irs but the bulk of it would come from tougher tax treatment and higher tax rates on corporations investors and others whose annual income exceeds 400 000 if they succeed they will be using reconciliation to reverse the direction of federal tax policy which has brought down the top tax rate and made other changes that benefit corporations and the wealthy over the past four decades and they will be doing it with the same process that was used to set that direction four decades ago when first year president ronald reagan used reconciliation to achieve his revolution in federal fiscal policy in 1981 polls have shown americans support higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy tax increases are rarely popular but polling this summer has generally found the public supportive of higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy at the same time reports surfaced that show that mega corporations and ultra rich individuals pay little or nothing in federal income tax for example in june propublica published a trove of tax data leaked from the irs that showed such prominent billionaires as tesla founder elon musk and berkshire hathaway investment guru warren buffett paid little income tax in relation to their vast income gains in some years paying none at all buffett who has campaigned for some democratic candidates has famously said he should not be paying a lower rate than his secretary propublica said the data showed amazon founder jeff bezos realizes billions each year in asset appreciation such as rising stock prices and yet can keep his taxable income so low that one year he qualified for the child tax credit which he took the data which was not authorized for publication covered 15 years and thousands of wealthy taxpayers and in june the new york times reported that tax laws allowed top managers in the private equity industry to prosper to the tune of billions without paying significant taxes relative to their gains audits the newspaper found were almost nonexistent all this feeds into a widening perception that the major moves in taxation over the last several decades have consistently benefited the higher income groups and particularly those with the greatest accumulated wealth there s a growing realization of what has changed in the tax code the nobel laureate economist joseph e stiglitz wrote in 2016 that snowballing changes to the tax code over the past 35 years have prioritized tax cuts and subsidies focused on those at the top placing a greater tax burden on the rest and causing neglect of critical public investments corporations have accomplished some of this tax avoidance by incorporating overseas or realizing some of their profits offshore one prospect for revenue seeking legislators would be an attempt to curtail these practices and reap a tax bonanza it is also possible the eventual legislation will address the step up in basis policy by which inheritors of property escape taxation on its appreciated value such a move has raised objections from rural interests even though the biden administration has pledged to protect family farms it will be hard to get every democrat in the senate and virtually every one of them in the house of representatives to accept the compromises and disappointments sure to be found in an eventual deal but difficult as this is the president and his party would have no shot whatsoever without the reconciliation process and that process got its start as a major mover of federal fiscal policy in 1981 with reagan s first budget it set a pattern that would dominate for the next 40 years culminating in the most recent tax cuts enacted under former president donald trump bob daugherty ap ap lawmakers watch as reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul in october 1986 reagan slashed tax rates and sold the idea of supply side economics as an elixir much of the attention at the time went to the deep cuts reagan proposed to social spending programs as well as his historic increases in spending for the military but just as important as where the money was going was a radical reversal on the revenue side reagan proposed not just lowering the federal income tax but slashing it by 10 in year one and by another 10 in each of the next two years as well at the time the top marginal tax rate on the last dollar earned was still 70 an echo of the world war ii taxes that had risen over 90 on paper and remained there in the peak cold war years of course few people paid anything like that rate and those who were subject to it could find ways to reduce their tax exposure but reagan had become convinced that the high marginal rate as much as the weight of the tax burden overall was the problem in his view it penalized success impeded economic growth dampened the nation s entrepreneurial spirit and weakened its work ethic he spoke of it as much as a moral issue as a material one the 10 cuts were across the board as he liked to say implying they were of equal value to all the dollar value of the cuts was of course far larger for those with larger incomes moreover the tax law changes that accompanied the rate cuts made it easier for individuals and corporations to write off various forms of income and spending to lower their tax bills further the tax rate for capital gains money made from successful investing would come down from 28 to 20 reagan did not get everything he sought in this initial foray against high taxes and progressivity the senate trimmed the third year of the tax cut from 10 to 5 and it would take a second bill the tax reform act of 1986 to pull the marginal top rate all the way down to 28 but reagan s tax cuts in 1981 constituted the strongest move away from progressivity in the income tax since the tax was initiated in the civil war they were the culmination of rising anti tax sentiment in the late 1970s when some states adopted tax limitations by popular referendum that spirit was kept alive in the decades to come by groups such as americans for tax reform led by activist grover norquist starting in 1986 norquist has challenged candidates for office to sign his taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes the great majority of republicans have signed reagan pared back progressivity reagan was able to reverse what had been a decades long commitment to at least the look of progressivity he could do it in part because his 1980 election coattails enabled his party to capture control of the senate for the first time in a quarter century moreover while democrats still had a house majority their ranks included scores of members from southern and midwestern districts that had also voted for reagan when the budget resolution passed in that summer of 1981 63 house democrats joined all 190 republicans in backing it and when the tax package came to its critical votes in july dozens of democrats sided with reagan and the republicans rather than their own leadership in 1982 democrats added to their majority in the house and negotiated some revenue increases with the senate and the white house and in reagan s second term momentum built quickly for a tax overhaul that would combine still lower marginal rates with new business taxes and a paring back of tax preferences and other loopholes the new overhaul s main appeal to democrats was that it exempted far more middle and lower income earners from the income tax altogether mark wilson getty images getty images career anti tax advocate grover norquist here in 2018 called the trump administration s 2017 tax cut reaganite the ultimate compliment from the founder of americans for tax reform the tax reform act of 1986 was hailed as a bipartisan wonderment winning support from bipartisan majorities in a republican senate and a democratic house reagan signed it into law praising the new top rate of 28 and turning a blind eye to the new business levies but effects of the act had scarcely begun to be felt when policymakers began chipping away at them preferences and other specific provisions for industries or other activities were reinserted in the tax code as lobbying and popular demand took their toll the top tax rate started creeping back up in the budget compromises of 1990 and 1993 reaching 39 6 in the presidency of bill clinton nonetheless the clinton years saw a robust economy created in part by the personal computer and the burgeoning internet economy that in turn drove stock prices to historic highs the higher tax rates on income and capital gains brought new highs in federal revenue collections and by 2000 the annual federal budget was remarkably close to being balanced the congressional budget office even projected a surplus in the coming years of the new century large enough to start paying down the national debt which still amounted to less than 6 trillion at that time deficits and debt rose faster after 2000 but the idea of running a surplus and shrinking the debt did not inspire much political excitement instead when newly elected president george w bush took office in 2001 he swiftly moved to cut taxes and a republican congress went along soon the top rate was back down to 35 even as spending raced higher for the wars in afghanistan and iraq the potential surplus never materialized yearly deficits got bigger again and the debt grew apace j scott applewhite ap ap then president barack obama joined by republican and democratic lawmakers signs a bipartisan tax package that extends tax cuts for families at all income levels in december 2010 president barack obama came into office in the midst of an economic free fall from the financial crisis of 2008 his first rescue package included a lot of spending and new borrowing and some relatively marginal cuts to payroll taxes many did not even notice in their paycheck stubs in his second term the top marginal tax rate went back up to 39 6 trump arrived in 2017 and promptly prioritized another general overhaul of the tax code which was again enacted using reconciliation the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was intended to spur growth and seemed to do so in 2018 when the economy briefly grew at a 4 rate early on but slowed thereafter to 2 6 in the fourth quarter and a 2 9 rate for the year trump s overhaul eagerly supported by republicans in both chambers reduced the top tax rate to 37 for individuals and reduced the rate for six lower brackets as well dropped the corporate rate from 35 to 21 and exempted the value of estates worth up to 11 2 million from the estate tax the exempt amount had been about half that while providing numerous other breaks for banks and other industries the trump cuts were projected to add up to 2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years and indeed federal revenues plummeted immediately corporate tax revenue fell 31 in the first year evan vucci ap ap then president donald trump displays the 1 5 trillion tax overhaul package he signed in december 2017 the net effect of trump s cuts on top of the second president bush s has been more than sufficient to counteract the smaller moves toward more revenue under george h w bush clinton and obama tax cuts are generally popular but trump s package delivered disproportionately to corporations and the wealthy the non partisan tax policy center has reported 60 of the savings went to people in the top quintile one fifth of the income ladder perceptions of that skew among wage earners helped democrats recapture the house in 2018 and were often cited by democratic candidates during the presidential primaries in 2020 that leaves biden with the double challenge of reducing future deficits while also addressing inequity in the sharing of the tax burden it s the dual mission of the tax portions of the reconciliation bill now taking shape in the tax writing committees to raise enough revenue to prevent the new spending from adding too much to future deficits but democrats also want to make sure whatever new revenue they raise comes from corporations and high income individuals the categories that have benefited most from the tax trends that began with reagan s 1981 reconciliation breakthrough copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

bombardier s chief executive has a relaxed engaging style he s optimistic he leans forward in his chair when he speaks he smiles as he discusses bombardier s recent transformation which he insists will leave the company leaner more focused and financially secure ceo eric martel took bombardier s top job in march 2020 succeeding former chief alain bellemare and arriving as the pandemic cloud descended during the last 18 months he has overseen the final stages of a years long restructuring that has left the montreal company focused exclusively on selling and servicing business jets the transformation will be close to complete early next year when bombardier ends production of learjets and though martel declines to specify where bombardier might next deploy its impressive engineering heft he says the company is evaluating several potential new jets we re at least looking at four or five possibilities he tells flightglobal speaking in a bombardier conference room adjacent to montreal trudeau international airport on 13 september eventually we re going to say it s this one and we re going to put the entire company behind it bombardier s transition away from everything not business jets began before martel took the reins after struggling for years under financial strain brought about by the cseries development programme bombardier handed majority control of that project now called the a220 to airbus in 2018 it sold the dash 8 turboprop programme to longview aviation capital in 2019 all about medium large cabin martel was at the helm in 2020 when bombardier divested its crj programme to mitsubishi heavy industries and its aerostructures manufacturing business to spirit aerosystems bombardier completed its divestitures with the january sale of its rail business to french company alstom the moves left bombardier a pure play business jet company but martel was not done in february with the pandemic raging bombardier announced a new restructuring it would end learjet production concentrate aircraft completions work in montreal cut some 1 600 jobs mostly office workers and reduce its montreal footprint changes aimed at saving hundreds of millions of dollars annually efficiency improvements and the end of crj production left bombardier with too much space in montreal martel says the company is divesting land and buildings at its plant 1 aerospace manufacturing site in the montreal suburb of saint laurent where it produces global and challenger components that divestiture could leave bombardier with just 40 of its current saint laurent footprint it says we are going to be completing that transaction any time soon martel says the company intends to use proceeds from the sales to help finance its new global production facility now under construction at toronto pearson international airport the decision to wind down learjet production is to end in the first quarter of 2022 stemmed from the simple fact that bombardier s medium cabin jets its challengers and large cabin jets its globals generate 90 of its business jet revenue martel says learjet was a smaller piece in a more competitive more crowded market he adds when i have 1 to invest where do i put that dollar today it s pretty clear it s either on the global either on the challenger or in the service business but bombardier insists it will make good use of its learjet facilities and staff in wichita wichita has a lot of talented people says martel we are keeping the workforce busy in wichita and with potential growth aftermarket pivot bombardier plans to pivot the wichita site into a learjet centre of excellence an aftermarket hub for the roughly 2 000 learjets still flying says bombardier vice president of oem parts and services chris debergh the company is transitioning learjet production hangars into service bays and expanding wichita s aftermarket capabilities changes that will give the company capacity in wichita to also serve challengers and globals he says additionally wichita will remain home to bombardier s flight test programme and its special mission aircraft work the wichita shuffle aligns with bombardier s broader goal of expanding its aftermarket business the company aims for aftermarket services to generate 27 of company revenue by 2025 or an estimated 2 billion up from 1 2 billion in 2019 to hit that goal bombardier must capture about half of all learjet challenger and global aftermarket work it s about bringing jets back home to the oem which mean these jets were somewhere else before says jean christophe gallagher executive vice president of services support and strategy that a direct consequence of us having the necessary space necessary manpower and obviously the necessary expertise bombardier intends to increase its aftermarket hangar space from about 186 000sq m 2 million sq ft today to 279 000sq m it has been expanding its aftermarket presence in places like opa locka near miami berlin london dubai singapore and melbourne australia the company expects to boost its aftermarket workforce from about 2 500 people today to near 3 000 by 2022 we are into a massive recruitment campaign around the world for technicians gallagher says the business jet industry like the broader aerospace sector sagged as the pandemic took hold last year but demand has since returned leaving martel optimistic we ve clearly seen a major trend more people flying business jets he tells flightglobal and we believe it s going to stay in august martel described bombardier s second quarter results as exceptional on all fronts citing improved revenue profitability and sales in response the company upped its 2021 revenue expectation by 200 million to more than 5 8 billion bombardier s competitors dassault and gulfstream also this year reported encouraging market conditions martel says business jet fleet operators have seen demand surge amid the pandemic at least partly a result of the troubled state of the commercial airline sector as airlines slashed schedules some travellers made the leap to business jets he says demand has likewise buoyed the used aircraft market to where only 3 4 of the global used aircraft fleet is up for sale says martel previously he had not seen that figure be less than 7 the other day i was trying to find a challenger 350 for a customer there three for sale in the entire world martel says and they re selling at a very high price that anecdote suggests bombardier may have perfectly timed the july launch of its certified pre owned aircraft programme the airframer has long brokered used jets but the certified programme marks bombardier s official entry into the business of buying fixing up and selling pre owned jets the fixing up part goes well beyond a bit of maintenance and a shine says chris milligan vice president of bombardier s pre owned aircraft services rather bombardier makes the jets look and feel new that means new paint refurbished cabins and updated avionics and connectivity systems plus a one year bombardier backed warranty think of it like buying a certified used car from a local dealer except bombardier s customers are buying multi million dollar jets by the end of september the company expects to have delivered five certified pre owned aircraft including four challengers and one global says gallagher clean sheet options in recent years well before announcing the decision to shutter learjet bombardier s business aircraft division had been pumping much of its resources into its larger jets it brought the clean sheet 7 700nm 14 260km range global 7500 a 75 million machine to market in 2018 then in 2019 achieved certifications for its 5 900nm range global 5500 and 6 600nm range global 6500 which replaced the 5000 and 6000 then on 13 september bombardier revealed it is updating its challenger 350 to have a modern cabin a reduced cabin pressure altitude and new features including an auto throttle bombardier aims for the challenger 3500 to enter service in the second half of 2022 the company also manufactures the challenger 650 and update of the challenger 600 that entered service in 2015 ultimately however bombardier will turn attention back to engineering a clean sheet jet there ll be a time we re going to say okay the market is ready we need a new product martel says i m studying all kinds of options many factors will play a role the company must of course understand where the market is going martel says meaning his team must identify the features range number of cabin zones for instance that customers most value the challenge with our industry you don t design this for the next five years martel says you design this for the next 30 to 35 so you need to anticipate he sees potential for bombardier s next aircraft to fill possible gaps in the existing market perhaps an aircraft with capabilities differing from today s products martel does not discount bombardier moving forward with development of the global 8000 the intended sister ship to the 7500 the company launched the 8000 which was to have 7 900nm of range alongside the 7 000nm range 7000 in 2010 but the 7000 became the 7500 in 2018 when bombardier upped its range to 7 700nm development of the 8000 has since stalled we re looking into this that s an option martel says there s a remaining option on the challenger also which path bombardier takes will depend also on the state of engine technology and other factors such as pressure to cut carbon output martel thinks bombardier could within ten years develop a jet that burns 40 less fuel savings achievable through greater use of sustainable aviation fuel aerodynamic improvements and advances in engine technology we believe it s possible he says of a 40 emission reduction the majority of our r d spending is focused on how we get an airplane flying with much less emissions exactly when bombardier might make news with a clean sheet product launch remains unclear but such a move may not be imminent we re not there yet martel says i promised the financial market to be very disciplined in the next five years story corrected on 23 august 2022 to note that regulators certificated the global 5500 and 6500 in 2019 not 2018

irish veterans of the american civil war launched attacks on canada in an effort to win independence for ireland it was 4 a m but the men of the 17th regiment were wide awake they d encountered no opposition crossing the water and they expected little trouble trouncing the enemy when they came face to face they d been waiting for this moment for a long long time jubilant cheers rang out as an irish flag was unfurled on british soil it was a june morning in 1866 and the members of the fenian brotherhood determined to free ireland had set off from buffalo n y crossed the niagara river and landed near the village of fort erie west canada the plan to invade canada was developed after the fenians concluded that canada transformed into new ireland could be used as a military base particularly for privateers who would harry british shipping eventually forcing great britain to negotiate with the fenian leaders they had in mind a simple swap canada in return for home rule for ireland the consensus was that there would never be a better time for action the civil war had ended and both sides had released myriad potential fenian soldiers they had trained indeed the union army had allowed fenian recruiters to sign up its troops while the war was under way what s more the american government was selling off surplus munitions at fire sale prices there was also reason to believe the u s government would look the other way until the takeover became a fait accompli the original plan put forth by gen thomas w sweeny the fenians secretary of war and former commander of the 16th united states infantry was highly complex it called for 30 000 men to stage initial attacks taking a number of major canadian cities within a two week period sweeny believed a successful operation would attract 50 000 more irish americans and irish canadians and a navy could be established on the great lakes the ground forces would then move on other targets there were problems from the start although the fenians had purchased 10 000 rifles and pistols and 2 5 million ball cartridges artillery was not available and the number of men who joined the effort numbered a few thousand at best sweeny s decision to move ahead seems to have been a political one the fenian brotherhood had undergone a split in the fall of 1865 when william r roberts ousted former head john o mahony o mahony still claimed many followers however and his faction launched an attack on campobello island between maine and new brunswick on april 14 1866 the raid was a fiasco but it generated a number of ripples including a fear in the roberts faction that the fenian brotherhood would fall apart without meaningful action so the invasion was launched in early may sweeny ordered fenian troops in the south to head toward designated northern jumping off points when queried most told curious fellow travelers that they were heading west to look for work but when lt col john o neill and his 13th tennessee regiment and lt col owen starr and his 17th kentucky regiment arrived in cleveland to report to gen w f lynch he was nowhere to be found lynch it turned out was laid low with a fever stemming from wounds he sustained during the civil war no one knew anything about the boats lynch was supposed to have obtained for the assault apprised of the situation sweeny ordered the men to head for buffalo lynch s adjutant a col sherwin was placed in command but sherwin couldn t get to buffalo by may 31 when the assault was to begin so capt william f hynes the fenian assistant adjutant in buffalo put the ranking officer in charge and o neill became gen o neill he received only what he later called a few general instructions from hynes he didn t even have a map of the country the niagara border was an ideal spot for a fenian attack buffalo was a vibrant bustling city the tenth largest in the united states and it had a large irish population an ideal place for a few thousand careful men staying in irish run boarding houses to blend in the city also was a transportation hub where railroads came together with the erie canal and great lakes shipping moreover on the other side of the border there were no canadian militiamen or regular troops within 50 miles of fort erie but although a number of groundless alarms and the comic opera campobello affair had led canadians to shrug off invasion concerns warnings of a planned crossing led to some precautions being taken the railroad ferry was deliberately docked overnight on the canadian side of the river meanwhile buffalo s anti fenian mayor had the port closed and the warship u s s michigan ordered in so the fenians headed a few miles north of buffalo to pratt s ironworks where arms and ammunition awaited them along with two steam tugs and four canal boats the advance troops under starr boarded the canal boats which were towed across the niagara river the regiment first stepped on british soil at freebury s wharf two miles north of fort erie the immediate plans were to take over trains in the area and cut telegraph lines but though they quickly cut the wire the rolling stock had already been moved inland local fishermen had sighted the crossing party and warned the railroad the fenians tore up railroad tracks and partially burned a bridge over six mile creek to the west preventing any trains from moving into the area the international railway ferry was seized as were six men of the royal canadian rifles found hiding in the ruins of the old fortress that gave the town its name starr posted sentries and ordered the village reeve or chief magistrate to provide breakfast for the fenian soldiers a proclamarion by sweeny was read stating that the fenians had no issue with the people of these provinces and that our blows shall be directed only against the power of england it also called on irishmen throughout the provinces to join the fenians by dawn o neill and the bulk of the troops had arrived just how many men made the crossing is uncertain but o neill stated in 1870 that it was no more than 600 fenian headquarters was set up at newbigging s farm about three miles north of the village and along the south bank of frenchman s creek the creek made a good barrier against any troops heading south from the village of chippawa and the fenians transformed split rail fences into formidable barricades by noon o neill received additional arms and supplies from buffalo they would be the last to get through as the warship michigan moved to pratt s ironworks the large force under sherwin would never appear by early evening fenian intelligence told o neill that british troops were moving south along the welland river from niagara falls to chippawa north of fort erie he countered by advancing his entire force to black creek still south of the welland river during the night he got more news the column at chippawa included at least some professional infantry and field artillery and a force of canadian infantry was moving on him from port colborne to the west o neill correctly figured the port colborne column would travel by train to ridgeway a bit south of his position and then move north to meet with the other unit he decided to intercept the weaker force at ridgeway he mustered his men at 3 a m and they headed southwest for admirable ground a limestone ridge running north from lake erie altogether there were about 900 officers and men in the port colborne column its commander lt col alfred booker decided to take them off the train at ridgeway as o neill had predicted then move north along ridge road on the limestone ridge before turning north northwest to reach the larger canadian force o neill gained the ridge and deployed his men about three miles north of ridgeway where bertie road intersects with ridge road he ordered his reserve to a wooded height to the north and the fenian troops threw up breastworks along the south side of bertie road a skirmish line was set up about a half mile away where ridge road meets garrison road the plan was for these men to fall back and lure the canadians forward into a trap the canadians advanced reached the skirmishers and took the bait but some fenians began firing too soon and two companies of the canadians were sent in to clear the area the fenians right flank began to buckle and the irish began to fall back to their reserve position but at that point the canadians noticed some horsemen and unaware the fenians had no mounted troops shouted to watch out for the cavalry booker ordered some of his men to form a square which was the traditional way to repel horsemen but created an excellent target for infantrymen and the fenians took advantage of it when booker realized there was no cavalry he ordered his men back into line but confusion quickly set in thanks in part to hard to follow orders given by bugle calls some of the canadian troops fell back in good order but most simply broke and ran the fenians had won the day but they were in a precarious position the reinforcements they expected from buffalo had not arrived and there was a stronger more professional british force heading toward them o neill decided to head for the ruins of fort erie where he would have the option of rendezvousing with any reinforcements or withdrawing across the river when the fenians advance guard arrived at the village it ran into a canadian force of a little more than 100 men and officers the canadians initially drove back the fenians but when o neill s main force sent out a line of skirmishers that turned the british right flank the canadian officers ordered their men to save themselves as best they could this second victory did nothing to change the fenians situation o neill soon learned reinforcements could not get across the river and no other fenian operations were under way and decided to withdraw that night all started well but the two barges towed by tugs carrying the troops back to the united states were stopped by an armed u s revenue cutter tug the u s s harrison the fenians were arrested for violating the neutrality act on june 6 o neill and his officers were fined the enlisted men were released having spent several days in the open barges that same day president andrew johnson issued a proclamation of enforcement of the neutrality act and leading u s fenians including roberts and sweeny were arrested by mid june brigadier gen michael bums was named commander of the fenian army still in buffalo some 5 000 officers and men but he was to oversee a dispersal rather than an assault in return for a promise to give up the invasion the government agreed to provide the fenians with free transportation home and so the army disbanded the canadians arrested a number of stragglers and deserters more than two dozen were sentenced to death but none were executed and all but one who died of natural causes were quietly released by early in the 1870s the fenians launched a few other attempts to invade canada but they were sad shadows of the niagara campaign the fenian brotherhood slowly faded away and irish freedom was won in ireland not in north america

september 2021 by kenneth d ward for much of its early history the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw was a little known international organization quietly verifying the destruction of cold war era stockpiles as required by the chemical weapons convention cwc today the opcw is the epicenter of a global chemical weapons crisis and a front line in a broader confrontation between the west and russia when the cwc entered into force in 1997 it seemed that all that remained to achieve a world free of chemical weapons was to verifiably destroy declared stockpiles and universalize membership instead the international norm against chemical weapons use is under siege most prominently by syria and russia two states parties to that very treaty the world is now precariously perched on the knife s edge of a new era of chemical weapons use once the chemical weapons crisis erupted in syria the opcw was forced to make a historic transformation moving from being solely a standard arms control monitoring body to becoming an indispensable instrument of international peace and security as recognized when the organization was awarded the 2013 nobel peace prize this new role must be strengthened to address the chemical weapons threat that has metastasized globally as a result of recent chemical weapons use in the united kingdom russia iraq and malaysia ghouta the ieper of the 21st century the hope that chemical weapons use had been consigned to the 20th century was shattered on august 21 2013 when the syrian military launched a barrage of rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin against the opposition controlled town of ghouta a suburb of damascus soon afterward a un investigation team confirmed the worst 1 400 people were killed from exposure to sarin the images of the ghouta victims were seared into the collective conscience of humanity alongside ieper the site of the first major use of chemical weapons in world war i and halabja where iraqi president saddam hussein in 1988 perpetrated a devastating nerve agent attack against the kurds as the world reeled in horror from the ghouta attack western powers considered military intervention to deter further carnage but when u s secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov met in geneva to discuss the crisis on september 14 they achieved a diplomatic breakthrough known as the joint framework for the elimination of syrian chemical weapons the united states and russia found common ground on only one point namely that the syrian chemical weapons stockpile needed to be removed and destroyed to this end russia tacitly assumed responsibility as the guarantor ensuring that its syrian ally would not use chemical weapons and would fully declare its chemical weapons stockpile so it could be destroyed under international oversight syria initiated the process to formally join the cwc just 24 days after the ghouta attack during that brief period the assad regime certainly had not undergone a moral conversion but rather bowed to pressure from the western powers and russia by the end of september 2013 the international community had legally anchored the u s russian joint framework in a decision of the opcw executive council and in a un security council resolution which included measures to address any syrian failure to comply with the resolution s provisions or with the prohibitions of the cwc false declaration and chemical weapons attacks in the spring of 2014 while syria s declared chemical weapons stocks were being removed from its territory for destruction the first signs appeared that damascus did not intend to comply fully with its commitments under the cwc and the un resolution the unraveling of the historic joint framework had begun widespread reports emerged of chemical weapons attacks involving chlorine gas barrel bombs dropped by helicopters on opposition controlled towns resulting in injuries and fatalities the claims prompted the opcw director general to establish a fact finding mission which later determined that chlorine had been used as a weapon in syria repeatedly and systematically from april to august 2014 during that same period there were indications that syria had not fully disclosed its chemical weapons program in its october 2013 declaration to the opcw the opcw technical secretariat after a detailed examination of the declaration and site visits in syria identified troubling discrepancies prompting the organization s director general to establish a dedicated group the declaration assessment team to continue engagement with syrian authorities until the declaration could be fully verified as accurate and complete to date that group has conducted more than 20 rounds of consultations with syria yet 19 issues still remain unresolved renewed concern over chemical weapons use in syria prompted the adoption of another un resolution in which the security council unanimously established the opcw un joint investigative mechanism jim since the fact finding mission mandate was limited to determining only whether chemical weapons use occurred in syria the jim was established as a panel of experts charged with identifying those individuals groups or governments involved in their use in the fall of 2016 the jim reported its findings concluding that the syrian military had been involved in the use of toxic chemicals chlorine gas as weapons in three attacks in 2014 and 2015 although moscow refused to accept the jim findings that its syrian ally was using chemical weapons in violation of the cwc and the security council resolution it begrudgingly agreed in november 2016 to renew the jim s mandate for another year and endorsed a new panel of experts to lead the effort within months the jim would become seized with the most devastating chemical weapons attack since ghouta on april 4 2017 the assad regime launched a sarin nerve agent attack against the opposition controlled town of khan shaykhun damascus and moscow quickly flooded the media with disinformation and outright fabrications claiming the opposition itself had launched the attack to falsely accuse the assad regime to deter further chemical weapons use the united states launched cruise missiles against the syrian airfield where the attacking aircraft originated despite russian and syrian efforts to bury the truth of what happened in khan shaykhun the jim determined that the syrian military had used sarin in the attack it was evident at the united nations and the opcw however that russia would seek to block any international action against its syrian ally no matter how damning the evidence indeed it was in direct reaction to the jim s competence that russia vetoed three renewal resolutions at the un and the jim ended in november 2017 deepening chemical weapons crisis two chemical weapons attacks in the spring of 2018 escalated the threat to the international norm against the use of chemical weapons in march former russian spy sergei skripal now a uk citizen living in salisbury and his daughter were poisoned by a novichok nerve agent known to have been developed by the soviet union the uk blamed russia for the assassination attempt underscoring the terrible risk the use of a such a nerve agent had posed to the local community indeed a resident of the adjacent town of amesbury later died the uk requested a technical assistance visit by opcw experts who confirmed that a nerve agent was used in the attack on april 18 2018 the opcw executive council met to address the experts findings in the wake of the expulsion of russian diplomats by the uk the united states and others the meeting immediately escalated into high politics with russia unleashing absurd counteraccusations and protesting that it was the victim of a western smear campaign before the day was over it was clear that a front line in a broader international confrontation had opened up and that in addition to the syrian crisis there was now an even more ominous russian problem russia was no longer just an enabler of syria s use of chemical weapons protecting it at the opcw and the un security council it was itself a perpetrator signaling to the world that it still illicitly possessed its own dangerous chemical weapons agent moreover moscow now viewed the opcw technical secretariat as an adversary just a week earlier as reported by the dutch government agents from the russian military intelligence branch the gru were deported from the netherlands for attempting to conduct a cyberoperation against opcw headquarters in the hague from an adjacent hotel as the chemical weapons threat widened to the european continent the crisis in syria deepened on april 7 multiple chlorine filled barrel bombs were dropped on the damascus suburb of douma killing dozens of civilians again a highly charged special meeting of the opcw executive council was convened on april 16 just two days after joint military strikes against syrian government facilities by france the uk and united states russia and syria falsely claimed that the uk and the united states staged the douma chlorine attacks with the help of the white helmets an organization of volunteer first responders in syria that russia has tried to label as terrorists within weeks opcw fact finders went to douma to further its investigation which ultimately concluded that chlorine was used the opcw also faced a grim new reality extending beyond syrian and russian transgressions the islamic state group had used chemical weapons in syria and iraq moreover north korea although not a party to the cwc was advertising its chemical weapons capabilities by assassinating the stepbrother of leader kim jong un with vx nerve agent in a malaysian airport opcw response to widening chemical weapons use with increasing use of chemical weapons undermining the cwc seriously eroding the international norm and putting the world at risk of a new era of chemical weapons threats the opcw had to act or succumb to irrelevance deeply aggrieved by russia s use of chemical weapons on its territory and concerned with a worsening chemical weapons crisis the uk initiated a special session of cwc states parties to forge an international response after russia and syria tried unsuccessfully to block adoption of the agenda the fourth special session of the conference of cwc states parties on june 27 2018 with broad international support took unprecedented steps to address the crisis by adopting the historic decision titled addressing the threat from chemical weapons use most importantly the decision dealt with syria s continued possession and use of chemical weapons to remedy the termination of the jim the conference directed the opcw technical secretariat to put in place arrangements to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in syria director general fernando arias implemented that directive by establishing the investigation and identification team which in april 2020 found reasonable grounds to conclude that syria conducted three chemical weapons attacks against opposition controlled areas in march 2017 in response to these findings the conference of states parties in april 2021 suspended syria s voting rights at the opcw the decision further clarified the mandate of the opcw technical secretariat in the context of the cwc the director general if requested by a state party investigating a possible use of chemical weapons on its territory was expressly authorized to provide technical expertise to help identify the perpetrators of any chemical weapons attack the decision also authorized the release of opcw information to any entities established under the auspices of the un investigating chemical weapons use in syria this provision would aid the ongoing investigation efforts of two such entities 1 the international impartial and independent mechanism iiim established to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for committing war crimes in syria and 2 the independent international commission of inquiry on the syrian arab republic the fight for a future free of chemical weapons threats to the cwc and the international norm against the use of chemical weapons remain ominous and unabated as evidenced by russia s attempted assassination of opposition leader alexei navalny with a novichok nerve agent in august 2020 russia s contempt for and repeated violation of the convention are appallingly evident moscow has enabled and protected its syrian ally by relentlessly wielding its veto at the un security council opposing action by the opcw and engaging in a calculated global campaign of disinformation and distortion in two assassination attempts against opponents russia has advertised to the world that it illicitly maintains a chemical weapons program possesses novichok nerve agents and has no compunction about using such outlawed weapons against its adversaries there should be no expectation that russia s contempt for the convention will ebb in the foreseeable future indeed moscow s continued embrace of chemical weapons is not an isolated affront but rather part of a much larger challenge to the west the assad regime also remains a long term threat to the convention and the international norm against chemical weapons use it views chemical weapons as a vital tool of survival and as a strategic counterweight to israel there should be no expectation that syria will finally comply with its cwc obligations once the conflict there is over rather it should be expected that syria will seek to produce and deploy chemical weapons as long as the assad regime remains in power the fourth special session of the conference of cwc states parties in june 2018 began an effort to push back against these threats and avoid a return of the chemical weapons horrors of the 20th century this must continue and intensify as it will be a long term struggle the united states must accord high priority to defending the cwc and lead an international effort to hold perpetrators accountable in all relevant forums what would this entail chemical weapons use by north korea and the islamic state group are surely of concern but they are not parties to the treaty and thus not a primary factor in the current crisis which is largely a russian problem it is important to recognize that deterring moscow from possessing or using chemical weapons or enabling their use by others is a challenging task increased pressure through sanctions and initiatives at the opcw and un general assembly will continue to play a role just as importantly the united states and its allies must mount a diplomatic and public messaging campaign to counter russian disinformation and deprive moscow of any credibility or support this would include further isolating russia from the international community by encouraging key states in africa and asia that have been sitting on the sidelines to join efforts to condemn chemical weapons use by syria and russia to be clear the near term prospects for deterring further russian chemical weapons affronts are not favorable the russian chemical weapons problem is fundamentally rooted in moscow s broader confrontation with the west and it should be expected that any progress would ultimately be dependent on the broader political landscape in 2013 russia worked constructively with the united states to diplomatically address the syrian chemical weapons crisis in the years that followed however russia chose to abet rather than dissuade its syrian ally from chemical weapons use and then went beyond that by targeting the kremlin s own opponents for assassination with chemical agents prohibited by its treaty obligations all these premeditated decisions helped to precipitate the wider strained situation and are symptomatic of moscow s intractability justice and deterrence require that a diplomatic strategy to defend the convention also ensure personal accountability for those individuals who ordered enabled or carried out chemical weapons attacks much of the groundwork for such an effort has been laid but its promise may not be realized for years internationally two un established entities the iiim and the independent international commission of inquiry on the syrian arab republic are mandated to investigate violations of international law and have reported on incidents involving chemical weapons use france has spearheaded a multilateral initiative launching in january 2018 called the international partnership against impunity for the use of chemical weapons with the mission of gathering and sharing information to facilitate national and international prosecution of chemical weapons perpetrators currently 40 states and the european union are members the united states and its allies should intensify efforts to substantially expand support for the partnership although prosecutions could take years these cooperative efforts signal the international community s determination to ensure that those who use chemical weapons will someday face a reckoning and their victims will see justice done to successfully weather the assault on the convention and the norm diplomacy must be paired with concerted international investment in the opcw the technical secretariat must remain the calm eye of the political storm the convention does not endow the opcw with enforcement authority but it does provide the secretariat with the ability to assess the accuracy of state party declarations to investigate chemical weapons use and to provide technical assistance to states parties indeed in the syrian case the secretariat s reports underscored that objective analysis from an independent organization is the best antidote to false claims from the perpetrator of a chemical weapons attack it is essential that the technical secretariat remain fit for its mission in an increasingly challenging environment that will require annually increasing the budget to adjust for inflation for almost a decade the opcw budget has remained virtually unchanged at about 85 million meanwhile the international community has asked the organization to do more when inflation has left it with 25 percent less purchasing power than in 2009 states parties have responsibly provided the secretariat with many millions in voluntary contributions to fund syria related operations the 2016 removal of chemical weapons precursors from libya and other important initiatives yet such donations are not a reliable or sustainable way to maintain the organization s core activities and staffing the opcw is the best bargain in the international system and should be treated the same as the international atomic energy agency which in effect has been held to roughly zero real growth with an annual increase reflecting inflation keeping the technical secretariat highly capable and operationally agile will also require establishing a long term training program and a dedicated training directorate to ensure that the next generation of inspectors investigators laboratory technicians chemical weapons experts and analysts are fully trained and prepared to face future challenges given that the opcw is regularly detecting increasingly sophisticated hacking attempts another priority must be securing the organization s computer network the technical secretariat has initiated remedial measures to enhance security but a broader revamp of the computer network along with additional cybersecurity resources are needed these should be funded through the regular budget and voluntary contributions by states parties the final requirement is to ensure the opcw continues to be well led the director general should always be a highly skilled experienced diplomat with expertise in chemistry being optional since the beginning of the syrian chemical weapons crisis in 2013 the opcw has been ably led by successive directors general who have exemplified these attributes faithfully implementing the convention while deftly navigating the diplomatic landscape to paraphrase edmund burke all that is needed for the evil of chemical weapons to triumph is for responsible nations to acquiesce the cwc is a remarkable achievement in the progress of humanity and the international community must continue to fight for it or risk losing it the opcw is an indispensable partner in this fight with the broad support of its membership the organization has taken unprecedented action to expose all perpetrators countries groups and individuals who use chemical weapons more broadly the world must redouble its efforts to ensure chemical weapons remain reviled and those who use them are held accountable what was started with the signing of the convention must be finished finally turning the page on an ugly chapter in history

in this file photo the us capitol building is seen in washington dc on may 11 2021 in the early 21st century if any power sought world domination coercing others and flouting rules it was the united states said an opinion piece by the new york times in october 2020 since the declaration of independence in 1776 the united states has been bent on expanding its territory and influence since the end of world war ii the united states has spared no effort to chase and maintain global hegemony capitalizing on its absolute superiority in the sectors of military economy science and technology and culture the united states frequently interfered in other countries internal affairs and bullied plundered and controlled other countries under the banner of freedom democracy and human rights in the post war era successive us administrations have pursued hegemonistic strategies from the truman doctrine also known as the policy of containment to foreign policies of recent us administrations including barack obama s smart power strategy donald trump s america first policy and joe biden s build back better plan the ultimate purpose is always to secure us hegemony the united states has hyped tensions all around the world by launching wars provoking confrontations and overthrowing foreign governments with armed forces bringing warfare and turmoil to many countries and regions by upholding so called american exceptionalism the country has wantonly employed double standards with no regard to international laws and rules as it has severely obstructed international cooperation by making use of international organizations accords and agreements to fit in with its needs but abandoning those going against its interests by rigging the international finance system the united states has grabbed enormous wealth while turning a blind eye to greed and speculation giving rise to the global financial crisis blatantly imposing long arm jurisdiction the country has initiated trade disputes with many others and stopped at nothing to crack down those it sees as opponents and it has also tried manipulating the international public opinions while exporting its values and launching cultural invasions in other countries it is the biggest saboteur of international rules and order and the source of growing uncertainty and instability in the world america s hegemonism and power politics have undermined world order threatened human peace and caused serious consequences for the world thus becoming the biggest challenge for the progress of human society and civilization as well as peaceful development a belligerent nation the united states has always been a belligerent nation after announcing its independence on july 4 1776 in its history of more than 240 years the country has not been at war for less than 20 years dakota wood senior research fellow for defense programs in the heritage foundation s center for national defense noted in october 2018 that in every 15 years or so the united states would get involved in a conflict to maintain its hegemony the united states has blatantly violated the principles of the united nations un charter and the norms of international law many times relying on its military strength the united states has interfered in other countries domestic affairs and created conflicts by waging wars implementing containment strategies and plotting so called peaceful evolutions and color revolutions severely threatening world peace since world war ii the united states has waged or participated in wars in the korean peninsula vietnam kosovo afghanistan iraq and other places which not only killed many soldiers but also caused extremely serious civilian casualties and property losses resulting in terrible humanitarian disasters in 2003 despite widespread opposition from the international community the united states launched the iraq war on unwarranted charges which has killed 180 000 to 200 000 iraqi civilians according to the watson institute for international and public affairs the coalition forces also used depleted uranium and white phosphorus munitions in iraq which seriously endangered the local environment and people s health according to a report released in march 2021 by code pink a us anti war group the united states and its allies have consistently bombed other countries over the past 20 years dropping an average of more than 40 bombs a day in late february 2021 just over a month after the biden administration took office the us military launched air strikes against eastern syria drawing strong condemnation from many sides behind the us military s indiscriminate bombings overseas is the country s continuously high military spending in 2020 us military expenditure reached an estimated 778 billion us dollars representing an increase of 4 4 percent over 2019 said the stockholm international peace research institute in a report published in april as the world s largest military spender the united states accounted for 39 percent of total military expenditure in 2020 this was the third consecutive year of growth in us military spending it said stephen walt harvard university professor of international relations wrote on the website of foreign policy magazine endless campaigns abroad unleash a host of political forces militarism secrecy enhanced executive authority xenophobia faux patriotism demagoguery etc all of them contrary to the civic virtues on which a healthy democracy depends according to an article published by the center for american progress a us public policy research and advocacy organization earlier this year america s defense budget today is higher when adjusted for inflation than what it spent at the peak of the cold war and is currently more than the defense budgets of the next 10 largest countries in the world combined while consuming more than half of the total discretionary budget of the entire federal government however no matter how much the united states spends on defense it cannot buy perfect security the article argued war on terror this year marks the 20th anniversary of the us invasion of afghanistan under the banner of anti terrorism biden announced on april 14 that the us troops would be completely withdrawn from afghanistan before sept 11 and on july 8 advanced the deadline to aug 31 the united states claimed to have fought extremism and brought stability to the war torn country but failed on both fronts said former afghan president hamid karzai after the 9 11 attacks in 2001 anti terrorism has become the focus of america s national security and foreign policy since then with double standards and the cold war mentality the united states has carried out the war on terror across the world in the name of national security and defending freedom divided countries into different camps and even overthrown the governments of other countries under the guise of fighting terrorism us led anti terrorism operations have become a tool to maintain its hegemony and promote the so called american democracy and values overseas hurting many civilians worsening the refugee issue throwing affected regions into chaos and making security threats spill over apart from the so called anti terrorism operations the united states has also grossly trampled on the human rights and freedom of other countries as evidenced by the shocking scandals of prisoner abuses by the us military in afghanistan and iraq since 2001 contrary to what most americans believe the war on terror is not winding down it has spread to more than 40 percent of the world s countries the us smithsonian magazine wrote in an article published in early 2019 according to a report released in november 2019 by the costs of war project based at us brown university between 770 000 and 801 000 people have died in post 9 11 wars the eastern turkistan islamic movement etim has long engaged in anti china separatist radical and violent activities inside and outside china causing huge casualties and property losses to the chinese people and was added to the sanctions list under the un security council resolution 1267 of which the united states was a co sponsor in recent years the etim has been on the move in afghanistan syria and other places plotting and carrying out a series of violent terrorist activities including the car bomb attack against the chinese embassy in kyrgyzstan in 2016 however the united states unilaterally removed the etim from its list of terrorist organizations in late 2020 claiming that for more than a decade there had been no reliable evidence that the etim continued to exist such a move has clearly revealed the united states s sinister intention to contain china with terrorism the united states has also cultivated many anti government forces around the world many of which later became terrorist organizations and perpetrators of terrorist activities worldwide for example after the cuban revolution the united states sheltered several armed groups opposing the cuban government and even allowed them to set up training camps in southern florida in october 1976 a cuban passenger airliner exploded over barbados killing all 73 people on board luis posada carriles originally from cuba and in exile in the united states was suspected of causing the crash and was wanted by cuba but the us government always refused to extradite him to cuba in the 1980s the united states strongly supported nicaraguan anti government guerrillas stansfield turner former director of the us central intelligence agency once testified before congress i think many of the guerrilla actions are terrorist in nature and are terrorist acts supported by the united states which is irrefutable more ironically the united states invaded afghanistan in 2001 in the name of anti terrorism but has in fact nurtured terrorism during the cold war the united states used afghanistan as a pawn against the soviet union providing large amounts of weapons and money for extremist groups including osama bin laden s forces to encourage them to fight the soviet union after the soviet union withdrew from afghanistan the united states immediately abandoned those useless friends making afghanistan a haven for global terrorism and extremism code pink s co founder medea benjamin and the group s researcher nicholas davis wrote in an article that if the biden administration continues to accumulate more lies and atrocities on the basis of previous administrations it will not be able to regain the world s respect for american leadership nor will it win the american public s support for its foreign policy addiction to interventionism to maintain and consolidate its hegemony the united states has resorted to all means from hatching peaceful evolutions instigating color revolutions to even directly subverting the governments of other countries this july anti government demonstrations broke out in parts of cuba evidence released by the cuban government shows that since mid june some anti cuba forces in the united states funded by the us government have deliberately spread the lie through social networks that the cuban medical system attacked by covid 19 has collapsed and used it as a pretext for instigating military intervention in cuba to subvert the cuban government us sanctions ensued against some cuban military officials and entities on the grounds of the so called governmental suppression of the demonstrators this year local media in cuba revealed that in the last two decades agencies like the us agency for international development usaid and the national endowment for democracy ned have allotted nearly 250 million us dollars to a series of subversive programs targeting cuba at a high level meeting on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the un cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez said the irresponsible behavior of the united states is the biggest threat to global peace and security the united states has an addiction to interfering in the internal affairs of other countries us author william blum said in his book america s deadliest export democracy that since the end of world war ii the united states has endeavored to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments most of which were democratically elected grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries and attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders during the cold war the united states launched activities of infiltration instigating rebellion disruption and destruction against the soviet union and eastern european countries after the end of the cold war the united states even more brazenly promoted interventionism and frequently exported color revolutions at the end of 2003 it forced the resignation of then president of georgia eduard shevardnadze for the so called fraud in vote counting in the parliamentary elections the incident is known as rose revolution in october 2004 it concocted the scandal of fraud in the ukrainian elections incited young people in the country to march in the streets and supported viktor yushchenko s rise to power this is the so called orange revolution in march 2005 it incited kyrgyzstan s opposition to protest against the results of the parliamentary elections which eventually led to riots then president of kyrgyzstan askar akayev was forced to flee and announce his resignation in this so called tulip revolution in the past decade the united states has repeatedly intervened or manipulated color revolutions in some countries in central and eastern europe central asia and west asia and north africa behind the series of color revolutions orchestrated by the united states a self proclaimed unofficial and non profit organization has come under the spotlight the ned known as the largest sponsor for global color revolutions founded in 1983 it has close ties with the us department of state the usaid the central intelligence agency and the like each year it offers more than 1 600 grants to support the projects of non governmental groups in more than 90 countries the foundation is also a funding source behind some separatist forces against china supporting dozens of china related schemes every year it has so far provided about 100 million dollars for more than 100 anti china groups including the groups clearly identified as terrorist organizations by china such as the so called tibetan youth congress and world uyghur congress a lot of funds for hong kong independence activities have also come from the foundation dollar hegemony after world war ii the united states has been taking advantage of the hegemony of the us dollar to wring gains from the creation and flow of the world s wealth it has used the dollar hegemony to increase the financial risk of developing countries plunder their wealth including resources and real estates and obtain the monopoly rights of such public service industries in these countries as water electricity and transportation in those latin american countries that adopted the washington consensus the economic growth rate in the 1990s decreased by 50 percent on average from that in the 1980s american economic killers covered with the legal cloak of economists bankers and international financial advisors manipulate other countries by economic means trick developing countries into falling into preset economic traps control the economic lifeline and natural resources of these countries let funds flow into the united states continuously and consolidate and expand the economic political and military hegemony of the united states in the world said american economist john perkins in his book confessions of an economic hit man published in 2004 this has long been the case in international trade the united states prints dollars and other countries of the world turn resources and goods for dollars in global trade and then buy us treasury bonds and corporate securities as their foreign exchange reserves thus enabling us dollars to flow back to the united states and prop up its economy niall ferguson an american historian once called the phenomenon the biggest free lunch in modern economic history despite ballooning fiscal deficits and government debt us debts can still enjoy low interest rates due to the hegemony of the us dollar allowing the united states to gather funds from around the world at extremely low costs relying on the hegemony of the dollar the united states has been enjoying the privilege of printing money with virtually no restrictions after the financial crisis in 2008 the federal reserve launched three rounds of quantitative easing policies from the end of 2008 to october 2014 transferring the crisis to the whole world through excessive issuance of dollars since the outbreak of covid 19 in order to stimulate the us economy and its stock market the federal reserve has once again resorted to the super easing mode featuring zero interest rate and unlimited quantitative easing after the biden administration came to power it quickly rolled out a 1 9 trillion dollar economic stimulus plan what is more noteworthy is that every time the federal reserve salvages the us market the beneficiaries are not ordinary americans but the top 1 percent american elites who receive almost all of the profits the united states extracted from around the world most of the top 1 percent elites are the most powerful and well funded interest groups including internet giants wall street the health insurance industry drug companies the fossil fuel industry and the military industrial complex the us financial and high tech industries have expanded rapidly during the pandemic and big us companies have received huge subsidies through various economic stimulus packages at the same time most of the excess dollars flowed into the us stock market which further inflated the wealth of the wealthy according to data from us forbes website in january this year although tens of millions of americans lost their jobs during the covid 19 pandemic over the past year the total wealth of the more than 650 us billionaires has increased 1 3 trillion dollars up 38 6 percent while the five richest americans wealth increased from 358 billion dollars to 661 billion dollars in total up 85 percent frenzied money printing created the illusion of temporary prosperity in the united states but great dangers lie behind it the federal reserve s balance sheet now exceeds 8 trillion dollars and the us national debt stands at 28 5 trillion dollars fitch an international rating agency lowered its outlook on the us sovereign credit rating to negative in july 2020 saying that soaring debts and deficits were eroding the us sovereign credit the us practice of printing money to make other countries pay for its deficits will eventually endanger the dominance of the dollar in recent years in order to get rid of the hegemony of the dollar russia the european union china and other countries have accelerated their efforts to de dollarize george soros once said in 2018 that the dollar would lose its status as the world s main reserve currency and medium of exchange in the next few years long arm jurisdiction in his book titled the american trap published in 2019 frederic pierucci former executive of alstom gave a first hand account of washington s cracking down on alstom in the name of fighting corruption he noted in the book that for more than a decade the united states has managed to dismantle many large european multinationals under the guise of fighting corruption washington has over the years exploited such means as long arm jurisdiction and economic sanctions to contain its enemies and rival countries thwarting their development to maintain its own hegemony for example the united states enacted the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act to expand its sanctions against russia the democratic people s republic of korea dprk and iran it activated title iii of the helms burton act to step up its embargo against cuba and unilaterally slap heavy economic sanctions on foreign businesses which have economic ties with cuba the united states has continued to expand the extraterritorial application of its domestic laws and has forcibly placed foreign individuals and entities under its jurisdiction regardless of the rules of jurisdiction in international law under its domestic laws the united states has access to user data and transfer information from many european banks through the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication system in recent years european enterprises have been constantly attacked by the us department of justice and relevant financial regulators and some enterprises accused of corruption or violating the us ban in trade with cuba libya the dprk iran and other countries have been fined hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars said ali laidi a researcher at the french institute for international and strategic affairs these moves have inflicted upon some countries dreadful hardship and even humanitarian crises which have been no less destructive than wars since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic venezuela syria and iran long subjected to us sanctions have seen deteriorating economic and medical situations as well as a severe epidemic situation at home nevertheless washington has gone further on its sanctions making the situations even worse in these countries with their illegal and inhuman sanctions and terrorist actions the americans have inflicted 150 billion dollars of damage on the people of iran said then iranian president hassan rouhani in september 2020 the united states rigged economic rules using them when they are compatible with its interests under the trump administration to undermine china s security and stability and curb china s development the united states formally rejected china s market economy status in documents submitted to the wto provoked trade disputes with china and imposed a series of unilateral sanctions on chinese high tech enterprises after taking office the biden administration continued to abuse the power of the state introducing a series of bills and executive orders to suppress and restrict huawei and other chinese companies by all means the united states has even cracked down on its allies after world war ii the rapid economic rise of japan drew ruthless repression from the united states as evidenced by the plaza accord during the construction of the nord stream 2 pipeline between russia and germany the united states assumed that the project was detrimental to its interests in the region and imposed multiple rounds of sanctions to obstruct the progress of the project provoking strong dissatisfaction of its european allies including germany disruption to international order with its great power the united states has been using american exceptionalism as the theoretical basis to wantonly trample on international relations while requiring other countries to abide by the rules based international order it has long put its own interests above the international system with the un at its core and above the international order underpinned by international law although the united states led the establishment of international systems and rules for global political and economic governance after world war ii the country has habitually broken rules and withdrawn from international organizations as long as they do not satisfy us requirements since the 1980s the united states has refused to ratify or unilaterally withdrawn from many international treaties and organizations such as the un convention on the law of the sea the world conference against racism and the kyoto protocol the trump administration was particularly willful under which the united states withdrew from more than 10 international organizations and agreements in four years such as the un human rights council the joint comprehensive plan of action and the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty the united states has been the only country to oppose the negotiation on a verification protocol to the biological weapons convention hindering the efforts of the international community to verify biological activities in various countries and becoming a stumbling block to biological arms control the united states has not only frequently withdrawn from international groups but also punished any group that dared to challenge it in 2020 the trump administration announced that it would impose economic sanctions and travel restrictions on the officials of the international criminal court icc involved in the investigation into us actions in the afghan war a move even worse than its earlier refusal to recognize and enforce the icc s rulings or to cooperate with the icc s investigation this once again showed that the united states would rather destroy public weapons if they cannot be used for its private purposes the biden administration has rejoined some international organizations and agreements only to serve its national strategies and has stayed out of the agreements that it believes would hurt its interests such as the open skies treaty as the biden administration promoted the selective multilateralism it has been commented by some european media as america first 2 0 in fact the united states has never shown kindness to other countries opponents or allies if they do not serve the us interests in recent years the united states has been asking nato as well as its asian allies to increase their military spending and pay the united states more protection fees for dispatching troops just before biden s europe trip in june it was revealed that the united states had spied on politicians of its european allies which came as yet another us surveillance scandal after the prism project in 2013 it once again showed the united states has been conducting large scale cyber surveillance and attacks globally for a long time and that it a real empire of hackers has become the biggest threat to global cybersecurity the covid 19 pandemic is like a magical mirror that has exposed the ugliness of the america first policy the united states has been engaged in unilateralism since the onset of the pandemic it seized anti pandemic supplies destined for other countries issued embargoes on its medical supplies and bought up production capacity of the drugs that may be used to treat the disease its selfish acts shocked the world and severely damaged global anti pandemic cooperation while vaccines have offered hope for the global fight against covid 19 the united states has upheld vaccine nationalism rushing to order and procure vaccines even those still undergoing clinical trials and putting some underdeveloped countries and regions in a desperate situation with no access to vaccines in the meantime the united states has been attaching political strings to its vaccine assistance the spanish el mundo website said in an editorial that washington lent vaccines to mexico in exchange for a heightened control of the illegal immigrants on the border of guatemala us bimonthly magazine foreign policy commented on its website that the biden administration is still pursuing american interests at the expense of the interests of other countries in the world the united states has secretly established biological laboratories in many places around the world to carry out biological militarization activities the mystery of the link between fort detrick and the spread of covid 19 has not yet been cleared up hume field a science and policy advisor for china and southeast asia of ecohealth alliance in new york said politicizing origins tracing just generates doubt and mistrust and fundamentally undermines the united global efforts needed to prevail against this virus and this pandemic ideological manipulation in august the white house announced that in december biden will convene leaders from the world s democracies at a virtual summit for democracy to be followed in roughly a year s time by a second in person summit ironically a recent poll commissioned by the alliance of democracies foundation among 50 000 respondents in more than 50 countries has found that nearly half of the respondents see the united states as a threat to democracy for a long time the united states has been identifying itself as a city upon a hill and advocating american values such as democracy freedom and human rights as so called universal values and it believes that the united states has the responsibility to promote its values across the globe however such universal values in essence are an ideological tool for the united states to maintain global hegemony on the one hand the united states takes advantage of its strong position in the fields of culture and media to forcibly promote american democracy and values in the world particularly in developing countries on the other hand under the guise of the so called universal values the united states attempts to take the moral high ground to manipulate international public opinion wantonly attack countries and entities that it regards as threats and rivals and deliberately create divisions and confrontations in 2010 marked by the submission of the national framework for strategic communication by then us president barack obama to us congress the national propaganda system led by the us government entered a stage where it became more capable of conducting interagency operations in 2014 a report by the guardian revealed a secret program run by the us agency for international development to infiltrate cuba s hip hop scene and launch a movement against the cuban government according to the british media outlet the agency recruited scores of cuban musicians for projects disguised as cultural initiatives but in actual fact aimed at boosting their visibility and stoking a movement of fans to challenge the government the united states has also linked its economic aid to the political system pressuring african countries into following western political models through us led international financial institutions since the 1980s us presidents have made the promotion of democratization in recipient countries a top goal of us foreign aid but such moves often brought disasters to the recipient countries rapid political democratization and economic privatization in many african countries led to large scale political crises and even bloody conflicts with some countries still in political turmoil today the biden administration has been promoting its idea of embracing multilateralism again ever since assuming office but in practice it still lingers on the small clique politics obsessed with ideological differences and wantonly suppressing other countries to serve its own interests in the name of safeguarding the rules based international order us hegemonic control lies behind the quad the five eyes intelligence alliance the group of seven and all other similar cliques which could in no way represent the international community for example the biden administration has pulled together britain canada and other allies to repeatedly hype up at the united nations human rights council unhrc their false accusations against china s human rights progress including the allegation of the so called forced labor in xinjiang meanwhile those countries deplorable history of genocide and cultural extinction as well as the tragedies of racial discrimination happening nowadays in their own backyards have been continuously exposed to the general public at the 47th session of the unhrc more than 90 countries made the appeal for justice voicing their support for china and saying no to anti china cliques us magazine foreign affairs said in an article published on july 9 that from the covid 19 pandemic to global trade rules from climate change to economic development the united states is actively frustrating the priorities of most of the world s democracies in the process us foreign policy is in the name of democracy compounding the global crisis of democracy and delegitimizing us power the world s liberal democracies have lost their monopoly to define what democracy is bulgarian political scientist ivan krastev said in an opinion piece published on the new york times in may citing a survey conducted by the pew research center a few months earlier krastev said a vast majority of americans are deeply disappointed with their own political system and that some are unconvinced they even still live in a democracy this is also true for many european countries the study showed graham allison a professor at harvard university and american political scientist who popularized the term thucydides trap has previously said in an article on foreign policy that unipolarity is over and with it the illusion that other nations would simply take their assigned place in a us led international order xinhua

washington sept 17 federal reserve chair jerome powell has ordered a review of the institution s ethics rules regarding financial transactions after two regional bank presidents reported large stock trades a spokesperson said thursday because the trust of the american people is essential for the federal reserve to effectively carry out our important mission chair powell late last week directed board staff to take a fresh and comprehensive look at the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activities by senior fed officials the official told afp this review will assist in identifying ways to further tighten those rules and standards the announcement came days after the presidents of the dallas fed bank robert kaplan and boston fed bank eric rosengren came under scrutiny for their trading activity advertisement the two officials engaged in large stock trades in 2020 at a time when the federal reserve was aggressively acting to support the us economy amid the impact of the covid 19 pandemic according to financial disclosures first reported by the wall street journal while the presidents said their activities were in line with fed rules they both announced last week that to address even the appearance of any conflict of interest they would sell their individual stocks by the end of the month and put the proceeds into diversified index funds or cash the fed spokesperson said the institution has the same rules as other us government agencies but central bankers also are subject to a set of supplemental rules that are stricter than those that apply to congress and other agencies advertisement the official did not specify a timeframe for implementing any rule changes chair of the senate banking committee elizabeth warren earlier thursday sent a letter to the 12 regional fed banks calling for them to institute tighter rules this controversy over asset trading by high level fed personnel highlights why it is necessary to ban ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials who are supposed to serve the public interest said warren who has also championed stricter regulations on government ethics rules and banking afp
close your eyes and think of the earth what do you see a blue marble suspended in space perhaps look closer and you might see entire continents and oceans just like the maps we are so used to seeing in books but look even closer and you might notice that something seems a little off despite decades of publication the maps that we pored over in school and the ones that exist in our memories are not actually reliable according to a 2018 report by national geographic there are many misconceptions and errors many of them quite large that exist in maps for one entire continents have been misplaced south america for instance should have been called southeast america because virtually the entire continent lies to the east of florida us and not directly below it as is often depicted and two thirds of africa lies above the equator but our mental map of it probably shows the continent existing predominantly in the southern hemisphere directly across from south america another misplacement involves europe which appears directly across the us in fact it is much further north and actually lines up better with canada surprised there s more when you consider the maps that often line classroom walls in schools they probably use the mercator projection a way of representing the earth s curved surface on a flat map but flattening a 3d globe onto a two dimensional surface can create distortion the unfortunate result is that the relative sizes of several countries are represented incorrectly for instance the mercator projection inflates the size of land near the poles so greenland is often shown to be the same size as south america when the latter is eight times bigger brazil on the other hand is often unimpressive on many maps but in reality it is bigger than the entire us and almost as large as canada another misconception has to do with the us state of alaska which seems quite large on maps but is actually just a little smaller than libya

on thursday president joe biden made a demagogic speech from the white house presenting his build back better budget plan as a historic reversal of the decades long enrichment of the corporate elite at the expense of working people speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif meets with reporters to discuss president joe biden s domestic agenda at the capitol in washington wednesday sept 8 2021 ap photo j scott applewhite he cited a number of indices of the wholesale looting of society by the corporations and the super rich including us billionaires have seen their wealth increase by 1 8 trillion since the beginning of the pandemic fifty of the largest corporations in the us paid zero taxes in 2020 while collectively taking in over 40 billion in profits the top 1 percent in the us evade an estimated 160 billion in taxes they owe every year this is the moment to deal working people back into the economy this is the moment to prove to the american people that the government works for them biden declared but having made the case for the seizure of the wealth of what he referred to as the pandemic profiteers he hastened to add i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great god bless you all i m asking is you pay your fair share biden made his remarks one day after house democrats assembled the various parts of the overall budget plan that had been drafted and approved by numerous house committees the 26 000 page package purports to allocate 3 5 trillion over 10 years for social welfare measures paid for in part by 2 1 trillion in tax hikes for large corporations and wealthy individuals the senate is in the process of assembling its own version of the budget what ultimately emerges from the process of internal horse trading between various factions of the democratic party manipulated by a massive corporate lobbying campaign to block any serious incursions into the profits and the personal fortunes of the ruling oligarchy will be far more modest than even the timid measures contained in the current house proposal the democrats narrowly control both chambers and the republican party is 100 percent opposed to the administration s budget plan and pledged to vote against it in order to circumvent a filibuster in the evenly divided senate the democrats are seeking to pass their budget under the budget reconciliation procedure which requires only a majority vote in the upper chamber 50 democrats and the tie breaking vote of vice president kamala harris and cannot be filibustered that means biden and the democratic leadership cannot afford to lose a single democratic vote in the house they cannot lose more than three democratic votes as a result corporate interests are asserting their demands most directly via their bribed mouthpieces within the democratic congressional caucuses in a concession to right wing members of the house democratic caucus house speaker nancy pelosi last month agreed to bring the 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by the senate up for a vote in the house by september 27 dropping her previous insistence that no action be taken in the house on that bill until the senate had passed the broader human infrastructure budget bill the entire process a combination of back room deal making and political posturing is dominated by the demands of the democratic party right wing west virginia senator joe manchin a multimillionaire coal company owner and arizona senator kyrsten sinema whose idol is the late republican reactionary and war hawk john mccain have publicly declared their opposition to the 3 5 trillion price tag of the administration s budget bill manchin has let it be known he is prepared to accept a bill costing around half that amount he has proposed imposing means testing and work requirements for extended child tax credits child care and pre kindergarten subsidies tuition free community college and other social measures included in the bill he is dead set against provisions that promote clean energy and infringe on the fossil fuel industry from which he has received 400 000 in campaign cash since 2017 making him the industry s top recipient last week manchin appeared on several of the sunday morning television interview programs to push for the house passage of the corporate backed physical infrastructure bill and argue there was no urgency for the social relief and anti climate change measures in the biden budget plan this was under conditions of the delta variant driven fourth wave of the pandemic overwhelming hospitals and infecting record numbers of children in reopened schools the termination of federal unemployment benefits and the moratorium on evictions threatening millions with homelessness and destitution and climate change driven hurricanes and wildfires that have devastated millions from california to the gulf coast to new york city in the house three right wing democrats on the energy and commerce committee reps scott peters calif kathleen rice n y and kurt schrader ore on tuesday voted against the leadership s proposal to allow medicare to negotiate hundreds of prescription drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies using international prices generally half of those in the us as the standard the biden administration and pelosi estimate this would save the government 700 billion which they propose to use to extend medicare coverage to include dental vision and hearing the three democratic no votes prevented the committee from including the provision in its portion of the overall bill according to the center for responsive politics the top industry contributor to peters campaign war chest in 2021 2022 is pharmaceuticals health products which has donated 88 550 his top contributors are pfizer 10 800 eli lilly 10 500 amgen 7 900 and gilead sciences 7 750 schrader s top industry contributor is oil gas 34 000 followed by pharmaceuticals health products 24 000 the second highest industry contributor to rice s campaign is insurance biden and the democratic congressional leadership have bent over backwards to accommodate and placate these forces on wednesday biden met separately with manchin and sinema white house chief of staff ron klain said the 3 5 trillion package could be scaled back by cutting back the size of some of the programs or reducing their duration the house budget package as it currently stands raises the top individual income tax rate from 37 percent to 39 6 percent where it was prior to trump s 2017 tax windfall for the rich it increases the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 26 5 percent which is lower than biden s proposed 28 percent and far lower than the 35 percent rate prior to the 2017 republican tax bill it raises the capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 25 percent still a far lower rate than for the equivalent wage income and lower than biden s initial proposal more significant than the minor tax increases on the wealthy that are contained in the house bill is what is omitted the bill addresses only income not the wealth hoarded by america s oligarchs income comprises only a negligible portion of the fortunes of the billionaires jeff bezos the richest man in the world in 2020 received a salary from amazon of only 81 840 their money comes from stocks bonds real estate and other assets that are largely untaxed the house bill drops a proposal in biden s original plan that would close a loophole allowing the wealthy to pass accumulated assets down to their heirs without ever paying taxes on the rise in the value of those assets from the time of their initial purchase it also leaves in place so called carried interest the loophole that treats the money taken in by hedge fund managers as a capital gain rather than normal income which is taxed at a far higher rate the wall street journal gloated over the democrats failure to challenge this notorious gift to hedge fund billionaires publishing an editorial headlined democrats blink on carried interest none of this prevented biden from giving his full endorsement to the house bill the washington post cited steve wamhoff director of federal tax policy at the institute on taxation and economic policy as saying if the ways and means plan was enacted as is jeff bezos and elon musk would still pay an effective rate of 0 on most of their income if they pass their assets onto their heirs
