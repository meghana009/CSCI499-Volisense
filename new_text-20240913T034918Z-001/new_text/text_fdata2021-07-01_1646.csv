the odey special situations fund returned 0 5 for may compared to its benchmark the msci world usd index which was up 1 6 for the first five months of the year the fund is up 7 9 in his may letter to investors odey portfolio manager adrian courtenay said they had been gradually repositioning the portfolio to better align with inflation and sensitivities to government bond yields hedge fund manager crispin odey leaving westminster magistrates court london with his wife nichola pease where he was accused of assaulting a young investment banker in the late 1990s photo by aaron chown pa images via getty images pa images via getty images inflation may last longer than the fed expects the federal reserve has been saying that it expects inflation to run a bit higher than its 2 target for some time and believes the inflation will be transitory however courtenay said in his letter that there are more and more signs that rising inflation won t be transitory as a result he has been repositioning the odey fund gradually in recent months he said that the fund has gradually boosted exposure to opportunity types that benefit from rising inflation like beverage and railroad companies meanwhile the odey fund has been reducing its exposure to opportunity types with a longer duration forecast like software or other advanced technology companies courtenay explained that historically periods of higher inflation had been correlated with higher government bond yields additionally he said government bonds provide the input for the risk free discount rate for which longer duration securities are susceptible thus rising yields on government bonds in an inflationary environment can result in moderately higher impairment in long duration securities food prices not sensitive to lockdowns the fed insists that recent inflation has been primarily to the reopening of the economy after the pandemic therefore it will be transitory still courtenay pointed to three reasons he believes that isn t the case he noted that inflation hadn t been restricted to goods categories that are sensitive to ending the lockdowns or demand patterns characterized by the economic reopening for example food prices are not sensitive to the reopening and courtenay said the increases have been among the highest observed of any raw material in the 12 months ending at the end of may pork prices have increased 106 while corn is up 105 soybeans have risen 83 coffee is up 67 sugar has climbed 61 and wheat is up by 31 all these increases resulted in the united nations food costs gauge climbing for the 12th consecutive month in may and extending its gain to the highest in a decade a sign of sustained inflation courtenay also pointed out that the fed s position that inflation would be temporary rules out the possibility that an otherwise temporary surge in inflation can also act as a sufficient precipitate for inflation to subsequently become sustained over a much longer time period he noted that one sign that inflation will be sustained is when raw material production is labor intensive and raw material price inflation stimulates wage price inflation courtenay pointed to evidence that this process of inflation reinforcing itself has already begun a u s bureau of labor statistics survey found that prospective employees giving the lowest wage they would accept for a new job had some interesting data the h1 survey year gave an average wage of 30 higher than the answer to the same survey in the first half of last year and 40 higher than the first half of 2019 courtenay added that many large employers already see wage increases for example mcdonald s and chipotle mexican grill announced wage increases in may as did bank of america and under armour long running government budget deficits the odey portfolio manager also pointed out that sustained inflation results from a central bank s continued issuance of new money which devalues its currency thus for inflation to be temporary the deficit in the government budget must also be temporary but that isn t the case for the u s the u s congressional budget office said the budget deficit would be as high as 5 to 6 of gdp annually from 2021 to 2030 even if there is no recession during that period gross federal debt still won t fall below 130 of gdp additionally the cbo estimates that 47 of all new treasury debt issued over the next three years will be purchased by the fed s issuing new money inflation as a golden period for odey s special situations fund courtenay also said that investors in the odey special situations fund shouldn t be concerned about sustained inflation because it could result in a golden period for the type of opportunities targeted by the fund he explained that inflation triggers a merger arbitrage situation subject to bidding wars a type of opportunity that has already resulted in some of the fund s biggest winners since its inception courtenay said the two most significant competitive bidding contributors were gold miners cardinal resources and guyana goldfields they came after 2020 when the gold price had been inflated by more than 30

by tami luhby cnn while states feared the coronavirus pandemic would wreak havoc on their budgets and force them to slash services it turns out that many are doing far better than they predicted so instead of cutting spending in the wake of the pandemic many states are cutting taxes nine states have passed legislation to reduce individual or corporate income tax rates that is awaiting governors signatures or has been enacted according to katherine loughead senior policy analyst at the right leaning tax foundation in some the reductions are retroactive to january 1 but in others the cuts don t take effect until next year most of the states that are doing rate reductions have a big surplus and that s what they are using loughead said a lot are pursuing policies they had in mind for a while now but just didn t have the revenue to do many states are finding themselves flush income taxes held up as many companies and higher income employees shifted to working remotely and federal funds helped keep struggling americans and businesses afloat the booming stock market brought in hefty capital gains taxes and sales tax collections continued as people shopped online and bought essentials in the stores many of the measures cut taxes across the board but provide bigger benefits for the wealthy in ohio republican gov mike dewine was set to sign a two year budget bill on wednesday that reduces income tax rates and boosts the bottom bracket so more low income earners will be exempted but it also eliminates the top bracket for those earning more than 221 300 this means that the state s wealthiest 5 of taxpayers will receive nearly 60 of the benefits while the bottom 80 will get only 23 according to an analysis for policy matters ohio by the left leaning institute on taxation and economic policy without veto action by dewine the legislature will send a windfall to the wealthiest ohioans while draining revenue the state needs to get back on track after the pandemic said zach schiller policy matters research director altogether the tax cuts and breaks will cost more than 2 billion over the next two years that could be put to much better use oklahoma gov kevin stitt a republican last month signed legislation cutting individual income tax rates by 0 25 percentage point that reduces the top rate from 5 to 4 75 the sixth lowest among states that levy income taxes according to the tax foundation also the state s corporate income tax rate will fall from 6 to 4 tying it with missouri s for the second lowest in the nation behind north carolina among states with corporate income taxes meanwhile idaho s republican gov brad little touted in may that state officials had enacted the largest tax cut legislation in state history providing more than 435 million in relief over two measures a tax bill signed in may provides 220 million in one time income tax rebates to residents providing a minimum payment of 50 per taxpayer and dependent or about 9 of the tax amount reported on residents 2019 state income tax forms whichever is higher the legislation also includes 163 million in ongoing tax reductions it trims the number of income tax brackets to five from seven and lowers the top individual and corporate tax rates to 6 5 from 6 925 the primary source of funding for the measure comes from the implementation of a provision several years ago that levies sales taxes on out of state purchases made online according to the idaho freedom foundation helping lower income workers several states also made changes to their earned income tax credits which benefit lower income workers particularly many essential employees who braved the pandemic a lot of the eitc expansion is a lot of states saying hey we know this one group of workers has been particularly hard hit because the defining characteristic of this last year is that if you were a lower income worker you probably lost your job and got hammered said richard auxier senior policy associate at the nonpartisan tax policy center in addition to its rate cuts oklahoma made its state level earned income tax credit refundable again so that lower wage workers can receive the full amount even if it exceeds the taxes they owe it was made nonrefundable in 2016 to address a budget shortfall according to the left leaning oklahoma policy institute washington gov jay inslee a democrat signed a bill creating a state level earned income tax credit in may after more than a dozen years of advocacy by consumer groups the credit which will begin in 2023 will provide between 300 and 1 200 to 420 000 households according to the left leaning washington state budget policy center concerns about federal relief funds the bevy of tax cuts come even as a coalition of republican states are suing the biden administration over a provision in the 350 billion state relief fund contained in the democrats 1 9 trillion rescue bill from march it says that states cannot use the funds to either directly or indirectly offset a decrease in net tax revenue resulting from changes such as rate reductions rebates deductions and credits however treasury department guidance later clarified that states can cut taxes as long as they are paid for through economic growth measured by increases in tax revenue from fiscal 2019 auxier said many state officials particularly republicans argue that cutting taxes is a way to bolster their economic recovery from the pandemic setting up a clash with left leaning advocates who say budget surpluses should be spent on struggling residents in arizona the state budget that gop gov doug ducey is expected to sign collapses the state s tax brackets into two a 2 55 and a 2 98 rate a flat rate of 2 5 could take effect in the future depending on the amount of general fund revenue that is raised also lawmakers put in a 4 5 rate cap blunting a 3 5 surcharge on higher earners that voters approved last year to pay for education we re giving a bulk of the surplus dollars back to the people who earned them to you ducey said in a video message highlighting that the budget contains the largest tax cut in state history this budget puts a giant open for business sign on the state of arizona we will remain competitive and continue to attract good paying jobs the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

editor s note this article provides information for educational purposes nerdwallet does not offer advisory or brokerage services nor does it recommend specific investments including stocks securities or cryptocurrencies if you have a high deductible health insurance plan a health savings account can help you pay your medical bills but hsas have hidden superpowers that make them a great way for some people to create a tax free pot of money for retirement or other long term goals in the right circumstances you can even use an hsa to help your young adult children start saving for their futures not everyone is a good candidate for a high deductible health insurance policy however the minimum deductible that qualifies you to use an hsa is 1 400 for individual coverage or 2 800 for family coverage many plans ask you to contribute even more before coverage kicks in if meeting the high deductible would be a hardship or cause you to scrimp on health care you re probably better off choosing a lower deductible policy and skipping an hsa if a high deductible policy is a good fit you ll need even more cash to take full advantage of an hsa enough to pay the deductible and other health care expenses out of your own pocket without tapping the account that s a pretty tall order but you can still benefit from an hsa even if you have to spend some of the money along the way here are the four biggest advantages to an hsa superpower 1 you can get triple tax benefits heath savings accounts offer a rare triple tax break your contributions are deductible the money grows tax deferred and withdrawals aren t taxed if you have qualified medical expenses by contrast withdrawals from other tax advantaged accounts such as 401 k s are typically taxed as income if withdrawals are tax free as they can be from roth iras you didn t get a tax break when you put the money in superpower 2 you don t have to spend the money any unspent balances in your hsa can be rolled over from year to year that s in contrast to flexible spending accounts another tax advantaged way to pay for medical expenses fsas require users to spend the money within a certain period or those contributions are forfeited fsas allow you to contribute 2 750 in 2021 individuals can contribute up to 3 600 to an hsa this year while families can put in up to 7 200 plus there s a 1 000 catch up contribution for people 55 and older hsa contributions can be invested and that means your money can really grow even if you have to spend some of the money along the way the tax free growth can add up superpower 3 any withdrawal could potentially be tax free as mentioned withdrawals are tax free if used for qualified medical expenses including health insurance deductibles and copayments the irs maintains a list of eligible expenses ranging from acupuncture to x rays you can t double dip only eligible expenses that haven t been reimbursed by another source such as insurance or a flexible spending account can justify a tax free withdrawal the key thing to know however is that the irs doesn t require you to incur the expense in the same year you make the withdrawal as long as the expense occurred after you opened and funded the hsa your withdrawal can be tax free even if it s years or decades later says financial planner kelley long a cpa personal financial specialist and consumer financial education advocate for the american institute of cpas you just need to keep the receipts for the qualifying expenses in case you re audited by the irs i call this the shoebox strategy long says you re storing up your receipts because there is no statute of limitations on when you reimburse yourself for eligible expenses you ll want to guard against fading ink so you can actually read the receipts years later so long recommends making digital copies she takes a picture of her eligible receipts and stores them in folders labeled by the year superpower 4 you can jump start your kids retirement typically you can t claim your children as dependents for tax purposes after they re 19 or 24 if they re college students but many kids stay on their parents health insurance policies until they re 26 which gives parents a unique planning opportunity says mark luscombe a principal analyst for wolters kluwer tax accounting a child who s not a dependent for tax purposes but still on a parent s high deductible health insurance can set up their own individual hsa the parents can help out by giving the child some or all of the money to fund the account the child can t set up their own hsa if they re still claimed as a dependent on the parent s tax return and once the child is no longer a dependent the child s expenses can t be used for tax free withdrawals from the parent s hsa but this approach gives the child a tax deduction for the contribution and potentially decades of tax advantaged growth making it a super strategy for those who can swing it

away from the once maddening crowds of st mark s square tiny certosa island could be a template for building a sustainable future in venice as it tries to relaunch its tourism industry without boomeranging back to prepandemic day tripping hordes private investment has converted the forgotten public island just a 15 minute waterbus ride from st mark s square into a multi faceted urban park where venetians and venice conoscenti can mix free from the tensions inherent to the lagoon city s perennial plague of mass tourism this is the b side of the venetian lp said alberto sonino who heads the development project that includes a hotel marina restaurant and woodland everyone knows the first song of the a side of our long play almost nobody not even the most expert or locals know the lagoon as an interesting natural and cultural environment it may be now or never for venice whose fragile city and lagoon environment alike are protected as a unesco world heritage site citing overtourism unesco took the rare step this week of recommending venice be placed on its list of world heritage in danger sites a decision is expected next month after a 15 month pause in mass international travel venetians are contemplating how to welcome visitors back to its picture postcard canals and byzantine backdrops without suffering the past indignities of crowds clogging narrow alleyways day trippers picnicking on stoops and selfie takers crowding the rialto bridge the recommendation by unesco s world heritage center took into account mass tourism in particular the passage of cruise ships through the historic center a steady decline in permanent residents as well as governance and management problems this is not something we propose lightly mechtild roessler director of the world heritage center told the associated press it is to alert the international community to do more to address these matters together veneto regional officials have submitted a plan for relaunching the tourism dependent city to rome that calls for controlling arrivals of day trippers boosting permanent residents encouraging startups limiting the stock of private apartment rentals and gaining control over commercial zoning to protect venetian artisans the proposal submitted in march aims to make venice a world sustainability capital and hopes to tap some of the 222 million euros us 265 million in eu recovery funds to help hard hit italy relaunch from the pandemic venice is in danger of disappearing if we don t stop and reverse this venice in 10 years will be a desert where you turn the lights on in the morning and turn them off in the evening said nicola pianon a venice native and managing director of the boston consulting group whose strategic plan for venice informed the region s proposal the proposal responds to venetians urgency to reclaim their city from the mass tourism that peaked at some 25 million individual visitors in 2019 and stanch the exodus of 1 000 venetians each year it envisions investments of up to 4 billion euros to attract 12 000 new residents and create 20 000 new jobs as much as venetians groan at the huge tourist flows the pandemic also revealed the extent to which the relationship is symbiotic along with lost tourist revenue venetians suffered a drastic reduction in public transport heavily subsidized by tourist traffic even city museums could not afford to reopen to residents when lockdowns eased venice without tourists became a city that could not serve its own citizens said anna moretti an expert in destination management at venice s ca foscari university the pandemic paused the city s plans to introduce a day tripper tax last year on visitors who sleep elsewhere 80 percent of the total tourist footfall some 19 million day trippers visited in 2019 spending just 5 us 6 to 20 each according to boston consulting on the other side of that equation the 20 percent of tourists who spend at least one night in venice contribute more than two thirds of all tourist revenue a reservation system with an access fee is expected to launch sometime in 2022 to manage day visitors with an eye on monitoring daily tourist arrivals the city set up a state of the art smart control room near the main railroad bridge last year that identifies how many visitors are in venice at any moment using cell phone data that also reveals their country of origin and location in the city the technology means that future reservations can be monitored with qr codes downloaded on phones without the need to set up checkpoints pianon said the plan is feasible in a city like venice which has a limited number of access points and is just five square kilometers two square miles in area as italy reopens the streets in venice are filling up once again as seen here on june 17 2021 photo by ap photo luca bruno relaunching more sustainable tourism in venice would require diverting tourists to new destinations encouraging more overnight stays discouraging day trips and enabling the repopulation of the city with new residents much could go wrong tourist operators are desperate for business to return and there is a pent up global desire to travel in addition many changes being sought by regional and city officials must be decided in rome including any limits on commercial zoning or airbnb rental properties i think the level of dystopia that we had reached was of such a scale that there has to be a reaction said carlo bagnoli head of an innovation lab venisia at ca foscari university there are many projects emerging from many places certosa island after more than a decade is still a work in progress but its success is in the numbers 3 000 visitors each weekend sonino sees another 10 public sites in the lagoon with redevelopment potential including former hospitals abandoned islands and military bases he blames venetians themselves for the city s predicament being long on talk short on action but he feels the pandemic coupled with the world s abiding interest in venice s future might just be the push the city needs to change i prefer to hope that we catch the opportunity carpe diem is not only a slogan but an opportunity sonino said we need a lot of ideas and a lot of passion to take venice from the past to the future next are we loving venice to death

we saw a decade of economic political social and financial action crammed into just 12 months so what should stock fans make of it all you re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fool s premium investing services become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more a madcap 2021 financial year is now done and dusted at first the asx saw a rapid recovery out of the covid 19 crash all while australia endured its first recession in 29 years then in november came the news that the first vaccines were nearing approval and americans voted in the us elections remember how donald trump used to be president that feels like another century ago the southern summer saw a rotation away from growth shares into value stocks afterpay ltd asx apt touched 160 in february before plunging below 85 in may this autumn was spent worrying about inflation it s great news that the economy is recovering and people are back in jobs but subsequent inflation could bring an end to those sweet near zero interest rates there is just no satisfying investors so after a 12 months that saw a decade s worth of economic and financial upheaval what have we learned from it all the motley fool asked 5 experts what lessons we should take into 2022 return to first principles hyperion asset management lead portfolio manager jason orthman told the motley fool that the past financial year demonstrated just how complicated and uncertain the world and markets can be the biggest learning is the need to continually return to first principles when evaluating uncertainty both in terms of the economic framework and company fundamentals earnings not heroic stories guide a company s share price in the long run it s easy to get distracted with headlines style rotations short term macro indicators company short position levels and news flow said orthman it s more useful to focus on which businesses have modern attractive value propositions and how they are relevant to the next generation of users most conditions can be navigated longer term if you return to first principles no single investment style is the sole winner the turbulence of the 2021 financial year showed no one investment style was a consistent winner claimed redpoint investment management chief executive max cappetta quality stocks those that exhibit cashflow strength and a solid balance sheet were the place to be as covid lockdowns commenced in q1 2020 he told the motley fool growth stocks then took over as the market rebounded and dominated through to the end of 2020 with value reasserting itself as the pre eminent strategy towards latter 2020 and into 2021 on the back of the global vaccine roll out confidence due to vaccine rollouts across the globe cappetta warned investors they live in a multifactor world different disciplines are rewarded differently through time he said having a diversity of insights in a portfolio at all times is a better path to long term success than trying to time entry to and exit from different approaches the s p asx 200 index asx xjo has now ascended higher than its pre pandemic highs but forward earnings haven t moved ahead in proportion according to cappetta the upcoming reporting season will provide important insight into which companies and sectors are back on track and those which are still struggling he said the lesson here for investors is that while earnings expectations are typically sound drivers of share price performance we now need to focus on earnings delivery to justify some of the more lofty valuations focus on the long term all the turbulence of the past 12 months will end up being just noise in the longer term bennelong funds management research relationships director stuart fechner told the motley fool it s important to maintain a long term perspective it may not feel like it at the time but that short term pain in fact often provides good long term opportunities if a sense of patience and perspective is maintained he said you can never tell how long it will take for a market fall to be recovered but we all know it will be if you can keep your head in such turbulent times there are opportunities to be taken that will provide benefits over time fechner agreed with orthman that fundamentals like a company s financial strength and quality were critical in times like this such simple qualities can lose their level of importance for some investors when the market is booming along but it is these very qualities that ensure they can survive the tough times and be a good ongoing investment proposition australians have too much cash fidelity cross asset investment specialist anthony doyle said that the typical australian is holding excessive cash which is just shrinking in their hands for example the australian 10 year government bond yield is around 1 5 today if inflation s 2 well you re going backwards he told the yahoo finance summit so a lot of aussies whether they re self managed or retail investors have far too much cash too much and they have to use that cash and enable that capital to work harder for them in the future doyle however did warn that the 40 year tailwind of falling interest rates is now finished the consequence was that investors now needed to search for structural winners in the new financial year and that might mean looking beyond our shores one area that has consensus across fidelity is emerging markets and asia he said a lot of these long term structural themes have been accelerated by the pandemic whether it d be growing incomes superior demographics technology adoption or the very large consumer markets of the next 1 billion people to enter the global middle class 850 million will reside in asia doyle told the motley fool that timing changes in the market is extremely difficult no one rang a bell at the end of march to indicate the change of direction for bond yields or the rotation into value from growth stocks it just happened he said often it is only clear well after the event what has triggered a change by which time of course it is too late going back to investment basics was the best way to protect oneself from uncertainty added doyle by being well diversified by avoiding the temptation to try and time the market by investing regularly through the cycle and by keeping enough cash hand so that we can take the market s ups and downs in our stride think of big picture themes marcus today director marcus padley encouraged investors to take a step back from daily news and financial reports instead try to think of a few simple events fads and trends that would truly move the needle on stock prices i ve always said there is no money in pes or yields there is money in sitting by a swimming pool and working out what nobody expects he said in a memo to clients every year there are a handful of things that you needed to know that would have swept away all the bollocks all the financial theory all the research all the compilations and all the endless blah blah blah we were bombarded with padley suggested 4 themes that are already full steam ahead as a good place to start the new financial year assume the bull market will continue real estate prices are hot making housing shares low risk interest rates won t rise significantly meaning real estate investment trusts infrastructure and utility stocks will rise electric vehicles are taking over so miners producing copper and lithium will trend up continuation of the current trend is the most likely outcome in the stock market he said it s probably best you respect the current themes and not bet against them until proved otherwise

a decade or longer timeframe is the right way to look at these stocks the renewable energy industry is slowly upending a multi trillion dollar electricity market worldwide and a decade or two from now it could make most fossil fuels obsolete wind and solar energy are now beating coal nuclear and natural gas on a cost basis and electric vehicles could dominate the transportation market before the middle of the century that s a long runway for disruptive renewable energy stocks to grow into we asked three of our energy contributors for their top long term renewable energy picks bloom energy be 3 87 nextera energy nee 2 10 and seimens energy smeg f bubbled to the top and are certainly built to thrive for the next decade or more the hydrogen energy giant travis hoium bloom energy hydrogen is one segment of the renewable energy industry that s just getting off the ground hydrogen can be used as a fuel replacing fossil fuels for a variety of applications from transportation to power plants to local backup power and through a process called electrolysis hydrogen can be created with water and electricity as inputs if wind solar or other clean energy is used we can now create green hydrogen and enable a clean energy ecosystem bloom energy is a leader in the hydrogen space and has been making fuel cells for businesses and utilities for more than a decade the company s solid state fuel cell technology should cost less than competing proton exchange membrane technology in the long term and allows a fuel cell to be run backward creating hydrogen at times and consuming it to produce electricity when needed bloom energy has also been improving financially at a rapid rate you can see below that revenue is up slowly but steadily since the start of 2019 and margins and losses are improving as well like other renewable energy technology revenue growth is often underwhelming at times when costs are rapidly falling because installation growth needs to overcome price reductions for example in the first quarter of 2021 the company installed 40 2 more kilowatts of fuel cells than a year earlier but revenue was up just 23 8 that s a challenge for the top line now but the falling cost trajectory should be great for the adoption of fuel cells and hydrogen over time which will ultimately lead to revenue growth there s a lot of optionality in hydrogen and fuel cells it can be a source of energy storage for the grid and businesses fuel for the shipping industry and could even be used for carbon capture as an industry leader with improving finances bloom energy is set to thrive for a long time into the future long term security in a growth sector howard smith nextera energy nextera energy gives investors the benefit of diversity within one stock holding it is

pandemic crisis renewables were the only energy source for which global demand increased in 2020 according to the international energy agency nextera energy resources is a leader in wind and solar power and it has a backlog of renewable energy projects that s even greater than its current portfolio that expanding portfolio should have plenty more runway for growth the u s solar market now has more than 100 gigawatts gw of generating capacity according to a new report released by the solar energy industries association and research group wood mackenzie that represents twice the solar generating capacity versus just three and a half years ago investors must also consider risks with any growth industry making it difficult to know whether a company can thrive well into the future but nextera energy s utility business provides a hedge it offers shareholders a reliable dividend since it has a secure cash stream and as that dividend has grown over the past three years so has the stock price and the company s valuation nextera told investors in its recent fourth quarter earnings release that it plans to continue to increase the annual dividend by about 10 through next year with the support of the growing renewables business it also predicts between 6 and 8 annual earnings growth through 2023 nextera energy has a balanced business and looks to be set to succeed well into the future it s not a typical utility however and income investors can t expect as high a dividend yield as most regulated utilities offer but for investors with the right expectations nextera energy

newly independent siemens energy which has a 67 stake in siemens gamesa renewable energy siemens energy is tailor made for renewables investors combining a strong industry leading gas turbine and power transmission portfolio with renewable investments although about 80 of the value of siemens energy is due to its stake in siemens gamesa the company s gas and power business supplied roughly two thirds of siemens energy s second quarter 2021 revenue the disparity is mainly because the vast majority of siemens gamesa s projects are still in the works in fact siemens gamesa s order backlog is now 33 7 billion euros as orders rose 150 in q2 compared to the same quarter in 2020 for the full fiscal year siemens energy is guiding for a 2 to 6 nominal revenue growth rate in its gas and power business and adjusted ebitda margin to be between 3 5 and 5 5 for siemens gamesa it expects nominal revenue growth of 8 to 11 and an adjusted ebitda margin of 3 to 5 in all honesty these numbers are not that impressive in fact revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance for both segments are lower than what siemens energy previously provided what the company lacks in short term performance it makes up for with the sheer size and scope of its renewable investments these projects will take time to develop and scale but five to 10 years from now siemens energy could be a thriving industrial and wind energy company many ways to play renewable energy growth these three stocks offer very different ways to play the growing renewable energy industry but they re leading in their respective segments and over the next 10 or 20 years they re all built to pay off well for investors

by frank holmes ceo u s global investors legendary global investor john templeton once said that the best time to buy was when there was maximum pessimism and the best time to sell was when there was maximum optimism this type of contrarian investing takes great conviction and nerves of steel but its practitioners templeton included can be rewarded handsomely the trick is to find the opportunities right now i see gold as the ultimate contrarian investment the yellow metal is largely unloved at the moment it s set to notch its worst monthly slump since november 2016 and the 50 day moving average is threatening to fall below the 200 day moving average bloomberg reports that the s p 500 to gold ratio is nearing its highest level in over 15 years as of this week it takes close to two and a half ounces of gold to buy one share of the s p 500 that s up significantly from september 2011 when two thirds of an ounce of gold was enough to get you entry click to enlarge all of this points to the fact that gold is extremely undervalued right now and no one seems to be paying much attention i don t know if this means we re at maximum pessimism what i do know is that all of the traditional drivers of the gold price are firmly in place making the yellow metal very attractive i believe i ll highlight two of those drivers below record money printing favors gold over the past 18 months central banks have taken unprecedented measures to prop up their economies that includes printing money at a record pace which has the direct effect of diluting the purchasing power of the local currency recently i shared with you that nearly a quarter of all u s dollars in circulation has been created since january 2020 what that means essentially is that the greenback has lost a quarter of its value thanks to the actions of powell company such money printing has rightfully triggered massive interest in bitcoin which unlike the dollar is completely decentralized and has no third party risk the rate of new bitcoin issuance is cut in half roughly every four years no central banker then can push a button and create millions more bitcoin out of thin air the same can be said of physical gold gold s supply growth is naturally restricted by a lack of new large discoveries and companies reluctance to spend more to develop harder to mine deposits we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us one advantage that gold has over bitcoin is that there s decades worth of data illustrating the near perfect positive correlation between the amount of money circulating in the u s economy and the price of gold as the value of the u s dollar has decreased due to greater rates of money printing gold has surged to new record highs the implication of course is that gold may continue to benefit from the fed s easy money policies click to enlarge inflation to remain elevated the second factor is something i ve been writing a lot about lately inflation may s consumer price index cpi rose 5 over the same month last year that s the highest rate we ve seen since august 2008 the real inflation though could be much higher the price of used cars and trucks are up more than 36 from last year according to vehicle auction company manheim with some pre owned vehicles selling for more than their original sticker price or consider home prices they climbed at their fastest rate on record in april increasing 14 5 year over year surpassing the previous record rate set in september 2005 click to enlarge despite the fed s insistence that this current spate of inflation is transitory analysts at bank of america believe prices could remain elevated for two to four years short of a major financial crisis central banks are unlikely to raise rates in the next six months to tame inflation according to the bank the cme group s fedwatch tool shows there s a 100 chance of rates staying near zero until at least the end of 2021 everyone s heard at one point or another that gold is an excellent inflation hedge that hasn t been true in every cycle and it s not true now the cpi is up 5 while gold is effectively flat compared to a year ago but that may be because we re at maximum pessimism as templeton called it gold is presently out of favor as stocks chart new all time highs if templeton were alive today he might say now is the time to buy plus with bond yields trading below zero on a real basis right now investors may have little alternative than to consider gold and gold mining stocks in an effort to combat inflation s impact on their portfolios

by jessefelder one thing i try to do with this podcast is to find people who are taking a truly unique approach to analyzing the markets those taking the financial road less traveled as i like to call it well michael oliver is surely one of those there is traditional technical analysis the study of charts which has been around for as long as markets and then there is michael s momentum structural analysis which is an entirely original way of studying price patterns and trends it was almost exactly two years ago i first got the chance to interview michael about his methods in this conversation recorded in fort collins colorado michael goes into even more depth about his analytical techniques and what they are saying about the markets today we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us msa s 36 month momentum chart of the nasdaq 100 it s rare to get such a massive and clear momentum structure developed in this case the red horizontal on the bottom chart it traces back to 2012 a violation of that in your face structure which will not be evident on price would open the door wide for a drop to the next key level around zero line 36 mo avg a disaster in itself just getting to there and we wouldn t bet on that overused zero line area holding if approached again

beer spirits squatters pub 147 w broadway 801 363 2739 squatters com inspired by the song exploder podcast which digs into the history and making of a single song we follow suit with a dissection of iconic local beer squatters craft beers hop rising hop rising is a 9 abv double ipa which utah brewers cooperative operations director adam curfew has been around for since its beginning when he was squatters head cellarman amid its balance as bold but drinkable curfew gives us a taste of why hop rising is a local legacy craft brew slug at the time of hop rising s inception where was the world of craft beer and what were utah s and squatters place in that squatters craft beer was growing rapidly however there were not that many packaging breweries in utah i don t know the number for sure but i don t remember there being more than 10 we were one of the largest breweries in the state and i think we were around 50th largest craft brewer in the country slug per your memory what informed craft beer lovers appetite for hops hops and more hops in their beer in 2009 squatters at that time people were really into pale ales and ipas we were making quite a bit of squatters ipa and full suspension pale ale we used to call full suspension full compensation because we drank so much of it that it was basically part of our paycheck we had started hearing about double ipas coming out of california such as pliny the elder it almost seemed like a novelty at first like wait how much alcohol and how many hops that s just crazy until you tried it and they tasted great slug when how and why did you and squatters decide to brew distribute and continually produce hop rising squatters we decided to make hop rising after a few people around the brewery had been out of state and started to taste some of the great examples of the style pliny the elder from russian river myrcenary from odell and hop slam from bells i remember being a big advocate for us brewing one for utah begging to brew one is more like it the key was when squatters co founder peter cole had a few and loved the style once he was on board it was a go there were four people who worked on that recipe dan burick who was brewmaster at the time jon lee who was head brewer dave mckean who is the head of quality control and myself slug hop rising being a bona fide hop bomb what hops went into it and why what were you trying to bring out with its taste per its double ipa style squatters bravo was and is one of the main hops we used ctz and cascade we really loved the grape flavor we got and still get from bravo we like the piney flavor from ctz and the citrus from cascade we wanted a big hop presence but for it to feel rounded and smooth slug what challenges might there have been in pioneering this beer and how did you overcome them squatters the main challenge we had was actually brewing a 9 beer as alcohol goes up it makes for a rough environment for yeast to live and work in we were also getting some off flavors from stressing the yeast caused by the alcohol level we actually ended up having to find a whole new yeast strain that could handle making such a strong beer it took a lot of experimentation and a lot of beer was thrown away in the process of getting it right slug when you got hop rising where you wanted it what about it aroma taste etc did you like most squatters we liked how smooth and easy drinking it was most 9 beers don t drink as easily having the right amount of bitterness and the right amount of malt backbone really makes the beer go down smooth slug how much of yourself as a brewer and a person do you feel hop rising reflected when you made it how about now squatters quite a lot i have always been interested in trying new styles and hopefully making a great example of that style i also love to make balanced beers to me the best beers are the ones that when you finish one you immediately want another one this has been my goal since i started homebrewing in 1994 as far as how the beer represents me as a person i feel like hop rising has nothing to prove it s not trying to have some huge ibu number and prove that it s the hoppiest beer on planet earth it just wants to be a delicious beer with the right balance i try to live like that as well happy with who i am and with nothing to prove i strive to live a balanced life slug the likeness of jason stock is an iconic element of the hop rising label why was he chosen to model for it squatters because he s so damn sexy our fantastic former marketing director amy coady came up with the jason with a pitchfork idea jason is a great brewer and human in general he has taste in metal and heavy music but is one of the nicest people you will meet i think hop rising is very similar it is a big beer with a ton of flavor but it isn t beating you over the head with it slug people in the local beer and music communities seem to make a tacit connection between hop rising s imperial boozy 9 abv and stock s tastes in metal and heavy music how might you feel like those two elements interlink and complement each other squatters jason is a great brewer and human in general he has taste in metal and heavy music but is one of the nicest people you will meet i think hop rising is very similar it is a big beer with a ton of flavor but it isn t beating you over the head with it it s the chunky power chord of beer we as a brewery have always had a lot of local musicians as employees at one point about half of our employees were in bands slug hop rising has grown as a brand in and of itself with squatters tropical hop rising iteration why was making a mango and citrus driven version of this beer an exciting element of this double ipa s growth and what was the context in the craft beer movement squatters tropical hop rising was born out of us wanting to take a beer we love and see what we could do with a very similar formula but different hops this beer actually contains no fruit all of the fruit flavors are derived from the hops we started messing with test recipes in late 2017 and by the spring of 2018 had arrived on a recipe we were happy with it s really in the hops you choose and the way in which you use them the type of yeast you use can really help coax the tropical flavors out of the hops as well slug how and why might tropical hop rising be a gateway beer for people to become hop heads squatters i would say hop rising and tropical hop rising can both qualify as gateway hop head beers because of the drinkability of them i ve talked with many people who have told me i don t usually like hoppy beers but i love this once you taste them it opens people up to the beauty of hops slug squatters has been able to produce a texas exclusive version of hop rising the texas twist how did it get to texas squatters texas was one of the first states outside of utah to sell hop rising they have been very kind to us since we are part of the canarchy craft brewery collective we have a sister brewery oskar blues who has a brewery in austin texas so we got a wild hair to try and thank texas for buying so much of our beer we figured we would make texas twist hop rising brewed in austin based on a recipe we designed but with the oskar blues house yeast strain the beer turned out great i wish we could get more of it up here but they sell out too quickly slug an element of hop rising that speaks to its longevity is its special editions that have benefitted the fight against cancer the pink hop rising can 2017 and brewing funds the cure hop rising 2020 why is this beer the masthead for these kinds of benefits squatters we decided to involve hop rising because it is such a popular beer and we ship it to 13 different states so it allowed us to spread the word in the most effective way many of us at the brewery have had our lives affected negatively by cancer so we felt very strongly about contributing to awareness and helping monetarily as well by doing this with hop rising we are able to produce 194 000 cans of pink hop rising cans every october for breast cancer awareness month slug why has hop rising been a staple beer both locally and in its growth into new markets squatters consistency has been key we try to make sure you get the best freshest hop rising you can i have mentioned its drinkability as well that is a big one for me slug past its beginnings in a 12 ounce bottle whether it s in bottles or cans what s the full breadth of forms and sizes hop rising is available in squatters we decided that bottles had too much of an environmental impact so we discontinued bottles in 2020 so now you can get it in a 12 ounce can in six packs or 12 packs and you can get a fresh filled 32 ounce crowler if you come down to the west side tavern which is the pub at our production brewery at 1763 s 300 west slug what do you like most about the beer now squatters it is my favorite beer to have after a hard day at work i love that it is flavorful yet crisp and thirst quenching i also like that so many people like it and it makes them happy that allows me to have a job to come home from so thanks to all the hop rising drinkers out there cheers

it s been a roller coaster ride for pakistan since it was put on the financial action task force fatf grey list in 2018 the first time the country found itself there was back in 2008 and then again in 2012 pakistan has fought tooth and nail to fulfil all 27 parameters required by the organisation it was able to comply with all but one the global financial watchdog also slapped islamabad with 6 pointer supplementary guidelines pakistan the fatf judged still needs to do more to curb financing of those groups that the un security council designates terror outfits as well prosecuting and convicting banned persons and combating drugs and precious stone smuggling until the most recent evaluation islamabad has however taken action such as prosecuting lashkar e taiba let head hafiz saeed and his accomplices the discriminatory approach of international organisations is a way to build political and economic pressure on pakistan unfortunately in today s globalised world such institutions and their rulings are directly linked to the international standing of a state fatf s ruling also falls into this category since it raises the country s risk profile making it more difficult for the government and business sector to interact with international financial markets being on the grey list requires domestic and multinational institutions to devote additional resources to building a more transparent system adding more strain to existing economic conditions the asia pacific group apg which is partnered with fatf needs to be renamed the pakistan pacific group since it has demonstrated partisan approach towards this country india pakistan s arch foe has long urged the fatf to impose more stringent restrictions on the country since 2018 the watchdog has acknowledged the islamabad s efforts towards achieving a comprehensive approach to countering terror financing and money laundering yet pakistan is still made to stay on the danger list where it is strictly monitored indeed the asia pacific group apg which is partnered with fatf needs to be renamed the pakistan pacific group since it has demonstrated partisan approach towards this country for the apg appears to turn a blind eye to the atrocities in indian held kashmir as well as new delhi s recent mishandling of the question of uranium trafficking the fatf judgement comes at a time when the us is attempting to depart from afghanistan by this september it would like to have access pakistan s airbases as well as airspace to track and strike terrorist groups in afghanistan such as al qaeda prime minister imran khan on the other hand has flatly refused absolutely no a response that washington is not used to hearing global powers rely on the fatf as a political instrument to exert pressure on nations like pakistan other jurisdictions have been delisted from the global watchdog s enhanced monitoring programme while doing considerably less than islamabad to improve control over dubious capital flows the response of fatf s president marcus pleyer on the question of whether pakistan will be delisted after it has fully complied with all 27 pointers underscored prevailing bias he said however in this situation we have a second action plan containing all of the action items from the first pakistan must next essentially complete all of the items on this action plan after which a separate on site evaluation will be conducted to determine the action plan so before the fatf members vote on withdrawal both action plans must be fulfilled and both onsite appraisals must be approved and completed successfully demonstrating that the changes are durable therefore pakistan will not even be considered for delisting unless the interests of big power are served first sadly the recent blast in lahore is just another tactic to demoralise the country globally according to the authorities those responsible belong to a powerful anti pakistan group the timing of the attack was scheduled to pre emptively endorse fatf s while keeping pakistan on guard in case it fails to surrender to the great powers according to the research paper bearing the cost of global politics the impact of grey listing on pakistan s economy by dr naafey sardar the fatf s decision to keep pakistan on the grey list has incurred a staggering economic loss of 38 billion from 2008 2019 thus pakistan s law enforcement agents must join hands with the international community to track down suspend and seize assets of the specified people and companies more political will is required to implement these two action plans as the government is incurring significant expenses due to failure to do so to avoid the catastrophic repercussions of delay and inactivity islamabad must move quickly to meet the remaining criteria it s time for pakistan to firmly defend the national interest and refuse to submit to pressure by organisations and big powers that are only interested in their own regional ambitions however fatf s turning a a deaf ear to what is going on in held kashmir and india s facilitating of terrorism in afghanistan has disappointed the masses and they have lost trust in the watchdog the writer works for youth development and women empowerment she tweets amreenmir1

by rod smyth chairman of the board of directors summary low interest rates and rising life expectancy are two major challenges for financial advisors and their clients in the distribute phase portfolios will likely need greater exposure to risk assets such as stocks and higher yielding bonds to meet return objectives in our view managing those risks is very important when finding the right balance between current income and growth of principal clients in retirement needing income in a world where most people do not enjoy the benefit of a guaranteed pension retirement becomes a personal responsibility the goal for many investors is to maintain their standard of living in retirement with the peace of mind that their money will not run out furthermore we believe retirees do not want to spend their golden years worrying about the monthly fluctuations in the stock market content continues below advertisement the challenge of providing a stream of income for retirement has changed dramatically for many reasons life expectancy is increasing in the us life expectancy has increased steadily from 68 in 1950 to 79 today according to the united nations and they forecast it will rise to 84 by 2055 therefore the asset pool at retirement must be larger than has historically been the case few guaranteed pensions most employers no longer provide a guaranteed pension in the good ole days when many companies had guaranteed pensions retirement income was your employers problem now with defined contribution plans such as 401k plans that problem has been shifted to employees who must build up savings and invest it themselves investors with insufficient savings are tempted to have excessive exposure to risky assets trying to achieve unrealistic spending goals low interest rates on cash and bonds due to very low interest rates we think a safe portfolio of bonds is unlikely to come close to providing enough after tax after inflation income for most of the investors we serve for example the yield on the standard benchmark bond index is around 1 5 as of june 25 2021 based on the bloomberg barclays u s aggregate index which includes government corporate and mortgage bonds high yield is often high risk yields are usually high for a reason lower quality bonds especially those rated below investment grade offer higher yields to compensate investors for higher volatility and greater risk of default owning high dividend paying stocks can also be riskier than you might think companies with high dividends can be highly indebted and can be concentrated in certain sectors often those that have lower earnings potential lack of investing experience many retirees have little experience with investing managing risk and managing emotions dealing with the price swings of risky assets involves the following risks in our opinion emotional risk in our experience investors plan in 5 and 10 year time horizons but sometimes succumb to fear and greed by reacting to current headlines this can cause them to abandon well thought out plans made in a calm environment we believe a critical part of the retirement planning process is to assess and periodically review risk appetite to build a plan that allows the retiree to weather market volatility this also involves a realistic understanding of the potential longer term tradeoff between returns and safety in our experience investors plan in 5 and 10 year time horizons but sometimes succumb to fear and greed by reacting to current headlines this can cause them to abandon well thought out plans made in a calm environment we believe a critical part of the retirement planning process is to assess and periodically review risk appetite to build a plan that allows the retiree to weather market volatility this also involves a realistic understanding of the potential longer term tradeoff between returns and safety drawdown risk when risk assets fall significantly in price monthly withdrawals can cause forced selling at unattractive levels risking the viability of the plan generating a 3 6 after inflation return in retirement in the current low interest rate world we believe a retiree seeking a 3 6 return after inflation with consistent monthly income will need to invest a greater portion of their assets in more volatile investments to get the higher returns they seek let s call these risk assets which can include stocks investment grade bonds higher yield junk bonds real estate and other investments to give you a sense of the journey of a stock investor the chart below shows annual price returns for the s p 500 index of large us stocks from the beginning of 1964 to the end of 2020 while the price gains have been considerable roughly 40 fold since 1964 each red bar represents a declining year the ovals show prolonged periods 10 15 years where the index essentially went sideways was very volatile and had multiple down years some of the drawdowns in these timeframes were considerable with the index losing roughly half its value 3 times 1973 1974 2001 2003 and 2008 while it might be tempting to look at the overall returns to decide an appropriate allocation we think it is just as important to consider the journey given enough time stocks have historically been a rewarding investment but those in the distribution phase have differing time horizons thus the amount allocated to stocks throughout the retirement journey is a very important part of the distribution equation and one we think about when designing our portfolios the building blocks of a 21st century retirement plan risk assets when constructing a retirement plan we believe investors should use enough risk assets to provide the required returns riskier assets require more careful selection and closer scrutiny for example when incorporating high yield bonds we think it is important to understand the specific risks of each bond which may not be obvious upon cursory review we believe these types of bonds can play an important role in boosting cash flow but we also believe this is a decision that should be actively managed and monitored a balanced structure we believe investors should ensure the portfolio has not only a stream of fixed income payments but also a mixture of stocks that produce a combination of growing dividends and earnings we tend to prefer companies with the greatest potential to grow dividends rather than those with the highest starting yield as we believe growth of income is important in the distribution phase also companies in faster growing sectors often reinvest their excess cash flow to expand and do not pay dividends we do not want to exclude these stocks as we think they can play an important role in growing the retiree s asset base cash reserve we believe investors should hold a cash reserve that ensures retirement income can be drawn down during market corrections thereby minimizing stock sales during bear markets manage the cash reserve by selling some potentially overvalued appreciated assets in good times to fund the cash pool in bad times portfolio income could also be supplemented by selling low risk less volatile assets how riverfront can help while retirement is the end of the accumulate or sustain journey it is the beginning of a potentially long distribute phase as life expectancy continues to increase at riverfront we believe investors will need to maintain a larger allocation to stocks in the distribution phase as long as the cash flow from bonds and money markets remains so low and our portfolio solutions reflect this belief this will likely involve bigger swings in quarterly portfolio values with the help of a financial advisor a professionally crafted retirement plan can be tailored to the investors needs and risk tolerance we think our focus on portfolio construction risk management transparency and consistent communication are critical elements in giving financial advisors and their clients the

july 1 2021 9 55 for the most part the australian economy has weathered the pandemic relatively well thanks to unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy stimulus and resilient consumer confidence the australian sharemarket went up 24 the past 12 months however not all businesses have bounced back from the turmoil simultaneously it s been a mixed bag different parts of the media advertising pie have been doing different things says martin currie investment analyst patrick potts when you look at out of home and radio we are not seeing the return of advertising dollars just yet out of home in particular airports are still struggling potts is one of many analysts who will be keenly watching the upcoming reporting season for corporates on the asx when they announce the fy2021 full financial year results martin currie is one of nine s biggest institutional shareholders advertisement radio has not bounced back yet particularly am talkback radio so that is something to keep an eye on if you look at the individual categories of advertisers there are some that have returned but there are some yet to banks for instance their ad spend is still down travel and leisure is obviously still limited potts says that the multi million dollar deals signed by various media outlets in australia and tech platforms facebook and google have not yet been fully appreciated by equity markets and investors the deals that those media companies have done with the global tech platforms are key in terms of earnings growth he says and potentially opens up other areas to further collaborate with those tech platforms going forward the further advancement of broadcasters such as nine and seven into broadcast video on demand bvod and subscription video on demand svod are also key factor looking ahead for those companies says potts bvod and svod is changing the nature of the tv business which had been structurally challenged for a long time the shift in audiences to digital could reinvigorate the tv business and what drives that is data the ability to package up and sell that data to advertisers is a new feature traditional media companies have historically never had that capability before looking ahead potts says there is optimism in the market with macro indicators consumer confidence business sentiment and gdp all getting back to pre covid levels i hope we get a more positive outlook for the advertising and media companies come the august results season he adds one of the main concerns for analysts such as him is the volume of debt some of the companies are carrying and if earnings have been cut then that puts a lot of strain on balance sheets and the availability to service debt levels if there is no clear pathway to recovery then it prolongs that pressure equity markets in that circumstance will pencil in an equity raising at some point to reduce debt levels company s share price often get marked down as a result of that however not all debt is bad according to potts who is also expecting more corporate activity in the sector balance sheet pressure drives more corporate activity and that is something we will be looking out for financial year 2021 in

commentary the chinese communist party ccp is celebrating its 100th anniversary with fireworks and parades on july 1 those who won t be celebrating are the executed the war dead and the would be grandchildren of the millions who died childless or who were never born because of tens of millions who starved to death during the 1950s famine and hundreds of millions more families who suffered through the country s one child policy not celebrating are the tens of millions who died during the cultural revolution of 1966 to 1976 or the thousands who died at tiananmen square in 1989 mown over by machine guns or run over by tanks not celebrating are the millions today languishing in prison and detention camps because of their human rights activism or their practice of banned religions including house christians uyghur muslims and those who operate this paper not celebrating will be anyone who really cares about all these voiceless chinese people some of whom are part of the voiceless 1 4 billion chinese people who are now suffering under the ccp yoke also not celebrating will be anyone with initiative and drive those would be entrepreneurs in china subject to a glass ceiling for business china s billionaires who must bow and scrape to access a side box from which to view the ccp s big anniversary hoo hah will be made and unmade at the viewing stands where international investors pay attention to exactly who is snapping selfies from the prime for capitalists spots in the peanut gallery those who claw up to the pride of place are favored by the regime and those who do not are at risk their assets and even lives can be taken by the ccp at the drop of a green mao hat in january the former head of china huarong asset management company lai xiaomin was executed huarong currently has a market capitalization of 5 billion and 21 billion in dollar debt the execution was supposedly for corruption and bigamy but was more likely political and approved at the very top the ccp got the blood of one more person on its hands for its 100th year of spreading red ideology around the world i doubt lai xiaomin s three children will be celebrating on july 1 are china s billionaires then really billionaires or are they terrified ccp flunkies i think the latter the rest of the world s billionaires should take note nobody is safe as the ccp continues its concentration of power those favored at the ccp anniversary will see a jump in their company s stock values and a decrease in their cost of borrowing capital those not favored will experience a hastened fall from grace this dynamic of capitalists bowing to high government officials is not only found in beijing but is increasingly duplicated by western companies seeking business in the world s largest by purchasing power parity and fastest growing major economy what beijing billionaires are doing today western billionaires will all be doing tomorrow unless something is done to stop the ccp the july 1 anniversary provides a taste of what is to come paranoid investors will be parsing which moguls show up at the 100th anniversary to figure out who s in and who s out among china s many billionaires writes shuli ren in an insightful article for bloomberg on june 29 investors financial bloggers and speculators have specific sightings in mind the chinese billionaires who desperately want to be seen at the right flag waving ceremonies who s there and who s not could spark market pyrotechnics ms ren notes that an invitation to the party s big party is a tremendous privilege and a sign of official favor bloomberg is here starting to sound the jester discussing court politics from the middle ages or today s society pages in new york or london baidu inc s robin li has been invited three times to china s independence day celebrations ms ren writes also prominent among the chief executives and tycoons at the parades is dong mingzhu of gree electric appliances inc of zhuhai a prominent female entrepreneur at the 2019 celebration the founder of china evergrande group hui ka yan scored an invitation to the tiananmen square gate tower the primary viewing stand for the elite of the elite according to ms ren she wrote of his photo hui looked so young for a 60 year old as well as rich powerful and handsome indeed the prestige and apparent clout attested by hui s prominent placement in tiananmen may have helped evergrande s troubled dollar bonds recover in late 2019 gone is the discussion of a company s underlying value based on earnings and growth prospects now what matters is who is seen and how close they are to the great helmsman of the party xi jinping this is communism socialists and democrats should take note communism today has nothing to do with equality quite the opposite there s no mention in the bloomberg article of the 100 years of misery that the ccp has brought to china the ccp might as well be celebrating the death of democracy in their country which for one moment in the summer of 1989 saw a flowering mown over by china s tanks those are the craven depths ignored by beijing billionaires and others who have fallen as they seek greater access to china s market access given by a ccp gatekeeper mark zuckerberg who took a smiling smog jog through tiananmen square in 2016 was a relatively recent western celebrant of the ccp he failed but in the attempt provided good publicity for the chinese regime on the backs of china s dead democracy protesters a chinese man now known as tank man stands alone to block a line of tanks heading east on beijing s avenue of eternal peace on june 5 1989 during the tiananmen square massacre jeff widener ap photo the party claims to have raised hundreds of millions out of poverty but in fact compared to china s peers japan south korea and taiwan the ccp s disastrous economic policies and war fighting have held the country back the ccp founded in 1921 were not very successful in organizing the working class in china s cities so they turned to the countryside where they got so much support against government corruption and excesses imposed by landlords on the peasants that they were able to militarily grab the southern part of jiangxi province in 1931 including a population of 10 million it became the jiangxi soviet backed by joseph stalin and his comintern the chinese nationalists chased the ccp from jiangxi in 1934 but the latter escaped towards yan an a retreat they called the great march the ccp largely hid out in yan an during the anti colonial war against japan letting the nationalists do most of the fighting after the war the communists defeated the weakened nationalists in 1949 and falsely claimed credit for defeating the japanese as soon as the ccp armies marched into beijing western capitalists including british and americans started falling over themselves to befriend the communists and thereby protect their investments in shanghai hong kong and the rest of china which amounted to tens of millions of dollars even then they haven t stopped kowtowing to the communists who took the investments anyway eventually doing business with capitalists in only short term transactions that benefited both parties but harmed democracy and the westerners home country advantages communist economic and military policy imposed on all of china since the 1950s and increasingly on the globe since the country s economic rise starting in the 1970s has been a disaster that is causing wars and a global nuclear arms race rather than peace and development china s consistently high gdp growth rate since 1977 according to beijing self reporting is due to the ccp finally letting the market take its course and the world s increased trade with the country in order to take advantage of politically powerless chinese factory workers and perhaps in the hopes of bringing the ccp around to some sense of human rights and democracy through economic engagement those hopes are now almost universally dashed none of these inconvenient historical facts appear to matter to the billionaires of today whether of chinese or western extraction they will be clapping and cheering the tank parade and fireworks of july 1 they are too busy climbing the bloodied and slippery political ladders in beijing for special business favors to pay any attention to those on the bottom in china they will be celebrating on july 1 in what is really a desecration of china s dead and an insult to china s 100 years of misery and 1 4 billion voiceless citizens anders

tickers emx source maurice jackson for streetwise reports 6 30 21 david cole the ceo of emx royalty talks to maurice jackson of proven and probable about recent developments at several properties where the firm owns royalties maurice jackson joining us for a conversation is david cole the ceo of emx royalty corp emx tsx v emx nyse american the royalty generator it s always a pleasure to speak with you sir to get the latest exciting developments from emx royalty before we begin mr cole please introduce us to emx royalty and the opportunity the company presents to shareholders david cole emx royalty we re the most prolific royalty generator on the planet we acquire prospective mineral rights around the world utilizing our alpha which is economic geologic talent we add value by building geologic models illustrating prospectiveness and sell those assets to an industry hungry for discovery opportunity for a combination of cash shares annual payments work commitments and always a royalty on the back end we ve been doing this business model successfully now for nearly 18 years accumulating a large portfolio of mineral real estate assets around the world to augment the portfolio we grow organically through that bread and butter process we also buy royalties which is a difficult business which speaks to the value of royalties they re phenomenal financial instruments but we do occasionally find royalties to buy to add to our portfolio and the third thing that we ve done very successfully is make strategic investments those are share placements into public and or private companies where we commonly follow that investment with intellectual talent as well that adds value and then liquidate it over time and our strategic investing track record throughout the history of the company is fantastic and that s why we re in a very strong cash position today so we re sitting here today with nearly 300 mineral property assets worldwide close to us 40 million in cash close to 20 million or perhaps a tad more in tradable securities and long term investments within the portfolio giving us nearly as much cash and investments and tradable securities as we have raised in the entire history of the company in addition to our mineral property assets that span the globe and of course we have no debt maurice jackson for all of the virtues that you ve just conveyed here today i m on record i ve said it in previous interviews i plan to match my bullion purchases with the shares in emx royalty david cole we appreciate that maurice jackson i believe that the stock has the potential to melt up and that s not just my opinion i have a rolodex of names some of those are the most respected names in the industry and we are all aligned with the value proposition of emx royalty in that regard sir emx royalty has some important updates for shareholders let s begin in serbia mr cole take us along the bor mining district and the timok property which is owned by zijin mining which is quickly becoming one of the world s biggest ongoing copper gold discoveries in the past decade last week zijin provided some exciting news on the upper zone what are the latest developments that you can share with us david cole so this is an excellent example of how our business model has worked over the long term for emx it was one of our first business units in the company when we were a private company operating in serbia originally called southern european exploration we were focused on this business model and acquiring assets in serbia we ended up adding value to those and selling them off part and parcel to our business model for cash shares and royalties and that company which we sold to reservoir minerals made a huge discovery with our joint venture partner freeport and as luck would have it it was just off the boundary of our royalty but we had our ear to the railroad track we knew what was going on there and so we were able to quickly go out and buy the royalty that did exist that was held by another company over that discovery for a price of 200 000 canadian early on in the discovery history before it was fully understood what the minimal potential was there keep in mind that the bor district is europe s largest historical copper and gold producing region and has some incredible geology it s a magmatic complex with copper and gold deposits spread along the strike length of that complex reservoir minerals ended up making a very large discovery there that discovery was ultimately sold to zijing mining which is advancing the timok project very quickly part and parcel to a half a billion dollar investment into the ground there and a letter of understanding with the serbian government and my understanding is that mine will be commissioned within the coming days we ve been told they re throwing a party there for the commissioning we re very excited about that we do hold ½ of 1 royalty over that deposit the combined reserve and resource there is approaching 2 billion tonnes at close to 1 copper equivalent that s contained within a higher grade upper zone and then a bigger porphyry zone at depth and the high grade upper zone is what s going into production first which will facilitate the development of underground infrastructure for the development of the lower zone ultimately maurice jackson you ve stated in the past that royalties are powerful financial instruments allowing for embedded optionality put that into some kind of context for us on how powerful emx s 0 5 nsr will be on the timok property david cole well it s a good example of the optionality of royalties and one of the reasons why royalties trade at what sometimes seem like absurd premiums and this concept of optionality is worth touching upon a great example is the royalty that franco nevada bought on the goldstrike mine for a little over a million dollars decades ago and that royalty has now paid close to a billion dollars but when they first bought it on a very modest deposit hosted in poor host rocks hosted on the carlin trend and as luck would have it they ended up finding a huge deposit at depths new metallurgical techniques were invented to be able to extract the gold from the more metallurgically complex ores greater infrastructure continued to be built on the carlin trend making things more and more economic with time so we re sitting here today with nearly 300 mineral property assets worldwide close to 40 million us dollars in cash close to 20 million or perhaps a tad more in tradable securities and long term investments within the portfolio giving us nearly as much cash and investments and tradable securities as we have raised in the entire history of the company in addition to our mineral property assets that span the globe and of course we have no debt and all of these aspects of optionality metallurgical advancements engineering advancements discovery most importantly and of course commodity price optionality because the price of gold has moved substantially since they bought that royalty is multiplicative and so it creates a situation where a royalty that they paid a little over 1 million has paid close to 1 billion now over the life of the royalty and it s still paying and so of course not every royalty is going to turn out that nicely but it does speak to this concept of optionality and we believe that our royalty on timok has that kind of potential certainly since we ve purchased that royalty it s turned into a discovery that is measured in billions of copper tonnes and the price of copper and gold have done very well so these aspects of optionality can play in and be very powerful and that s why you want to own royalties and that s why i often say that royalties are phenomenal financial instruments maurice jackson speaking of royalties let s go to turkey to the balya lead zinc silver mine where emx royalty retains a 4 nsr are there any updates you can provide shareholders david cole that s rapidly advancing towards full scale commercial production it s already been in small scale commercial production we have received production royalty payments in a fairly modest amount as they ve done test mining to work on the metallurgy etc metallurgy works out excellently there is a commingling agreement which we ve signed because the district is divided in half where we have a 4 royalty to the north and the 5 000 ton per day mill is one kilometer from the headframe they re advancing a spiral decline into the deposit as well my understanding is that they re at greater than 200 meters depth in that spiral decline and they re getting close to reaching the first big ore pod to be able to mine with rubber tired vehicles previously they were mining with a railroad track and now they re going to mine in a more advanced way which will facilitate greater tonnage using rubber tired vehicles lhd load haul dumps from underground and running through the 5 000 tonne per day mill we re very excited about the ramp up of production here another great example of optionality on a royalty property keep in mind we bought this project originally for us 17 000 from the turkish government put together the geology illustrating the potential and sold it for 100 000 and a 4 royalty and that 4 royalty will pay us back in spades readers need to understand that it takes a long time for these things to mature we created that royalty organically more than a decade ago but it takes a long time for these things to bubble up work their way up the pyramid and become cash flowing but the opportunity for this to happen multiple times within our pyramid is very high maurice jackson speaks volumes for the business acumen and the geologic acumen that the emx team has here let s move north to finland where emx holds a 2 nsr on palladium one s copper nickel gold platinum group project where they continue to drill more and more well mineralized intercepts how do you think this will play out for emx shareholders david cole well i think it s going to be another really good one we love those commodities we think that copper and nickel and platinum group elements and gold are a great place to be those are some of our favorite commodities if not our absolute favorite commodities once again we bought this royalty early on in the discovery cycle we bought it for ca 250 000 it s 2 royalty where 1 can get bought back at any time prior to production for 1 million euros leaving us with 1 uncapped on buyable forever on the property and it s turning into a large discovery there in finland we believe that it s very likely that that will eventually go into production and it continues to get bigger within that ultramafic complex it s a particular type of geological environment that hosts that style of mineralization and we re very pleased and it s a good example of us buying royalty to augment a portfolio that we were growing organically we have other royalties in the district that we ve grown organically through the acquisition of exploration licenses and then selling on to other companies and keeping the royalty so we have a big royalty footprint within that district but we re most excited about the one at kaukua by palladium one and i will give palladium one a plug i think they re a very well run technically astute company maurice jackson we discussed the good let s address the not so good emx acquired a 19 9 interest in the rawhide mine in western nevada so far the mine has not performed up to expectations what is the plan going forward david cole well this is a great example and i m excited about this investment but i know that that we initially expected a strong cash flow from it right out of the gate that cash flow has not materialized as there have been problems with the crusher circuit etc but emx is doing here what we oftentimes do and that follows our investment with intellectual talent so we have brought in a top notch engineering team of ex newmont people that are dialing things in here the mine is back operating very nicely this last week i believe we were averaging 85 ounces a day pouring gold ounces per day doré on site so the mine s operating quite nicely now we do have a large debt on that project it s about a 15 million debt and that debt is being amortized is being paid down so we do expect to see more cash flow once that debt is paid off but more importantly concerning value creation is now that we ve spent more time on this property and put our geologists out there looking at the potential beyond the known deposits we ve gotten very excited about the exploration potential within this large property that s been tightly held for decades and thus not seeing much exploration outside the immediate mine area we ve been so excited about this that we ve increased our percentage ownership and we re moving towards 40 ownership in that now and i know it didn t produce the cash flow that we expected right out of the gate but long term i m confident this is going to be a good winner for emx maurice jackson well certainly if you re going to double your position in it from 19 9 to 40 david cole we feel risk adjusted we re making a good bet maurice jackson last question what would you like to say to shareholders david cole well i m a big believer in this business model i believe that it creates wealth sometimes slowly but it accretes wealth over time and the key to our stock a lot of junior natural resource stocks you want to buy pre discovery and sell on discovery and catch those waves with emx it s a different model with emx you want to buy the dips and hold the stock long term that is conducive to how our business will and has added value over time maurice jackson mr cole for someone

on june 21 2021 the united states supreme court issued a decision in goldman sachs group inc v arkansas teacher retirement system 1 vacating a decision of the second circuit that affirmed certification of a securities fraud class action against the goldman sachs group inc the court directed the second circuit to consider the generic nature of goldman s alleged misrepresentations in assessing whether goldman had successfully rebutted the fraud on the market presumption of reliance for purposes of plaintiff s claim under section 10 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 and therefore whether class certification is appropriate in an opinion by justice amy coney barrett the court held that courts at class certification must consider all evidence relevant to price impact which is a prerequisite to invoking the fraud on the market presumption afforded to plaintiffs in an efficient market regardless whether that evidence overlaps with materiality or any other merits issue because the second circuit s opinion left sufficient doubt as to whether it had properly considered the generic nature of the alleged misrepresentations the court vacated and remanded the case to the lower court a 6 3 majority of the court also held that a defendant seeking to rebut the fraud on the market presumption of reliance also known as the basic presumption bears the burden of persuasion to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a misrepresentation did not in fact lead to a distortion of the price of a security the decision not only gives goldman sachs a renewed opportunity to defeat class certification in this long running class action suit it also is likely to create a new front in the class certification battleground most notably goldman clarifies that the materiality of alleged misrepresentations is relevant to a showing of price impact and a defendant is entitled to introduce materiality evidence to rebut the basic presumption at the class certification stage a conclusion that many courts rejected following the supreme court s prior decisions in halliburton and amgen the decision s emphasis on the generic nature of the alleged misrepresentations in this case and direction that the second circuit consider it in reviewing the district court s class certification decision may lead to reversal of the district court s decision certifying the class action finally although preserving the basic presumption goldman confirms that plaintiffs and defendants are on nearly equal footing in establishing whether the presumption applies through evidence of price impact or lack thereof subject to a preponderance of the evidence standard accordingly the battle over basic already one of the main events in securities class action litigation is likely to grow even more heated in goldman s wake background to obtain class certification plaintiffs must satisfy the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure 23 including for any action seeking damages a showing that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members 3 ordinarily plaintiffs bringing a section 10 b claim would face a significant challenge in meeting this predominance requirement each putative class member may have purchased the security for different reasons precluding a finding of predominance due to individualized issues of reliance one of the elements of a section 10 b claim 4 in basic v levinson 5 however the supreme court recognized the fraud on the market theory of reliance that makes section 10 b class actions possible when a stock trades in an efficient market courts may presume that all investors rely on the integrity of the market price as reflecting all material public information including any fraudulent statements where established the basic presumption alleviates plaintiffs need to show reliance on a case by case basis allowing adjudication as a class action to invoke the basic presumption a plaintiff must prove that 1 the alleged misrepresentation was publicly known 2 it was material i e significant to a reasonable investor 3 the stock traded in an efficient market and 4 the plaintiff traded the stock between the time the misrepresentation was made and when the truth was revealed 6 these preliminary showings serve at the class certification stage as an indirect proxy for establishing that alleged misrepresentations affected stock price i e price impact 7 once plaintiffs have made this threshold showing a defendant can rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the misrepresentation in fact did not lead to a distortion of price which may be accomplished by any showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price paid by plaintiffs or their decision to trade at that price 8 for example a defendant could rebut the presumption by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not for whatever reason actually affect the market price in other words an absence of price impact 9 as the supreme court has explained there is no reason for a court to limit its review to indirect evidence of price impact adduced by the plaintiff seeking to invoke the basic presumption defendants may seek to rebut the presumption through direct as well as indirect price impact evidence 10 case history this dispute dates back to 2010 when shareholders brought a putative class action against goldman and certain of its executives in the southern district of new york asserting claims for violations of sections 10 b and 20 a of the exchange act and rule 10b 5 thereunder the plaintiffs alleged that between 2006 and 2010 goldman made misrepresentations concerning its procedures for managing conflicts of interest including e have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to address conflicts of interest and ntegrity and honesty are at the heart of our business 11 according to plaintiffs the statements were fraudulent because goldman had conflicts of interest with respect to collateralized debt obligations it sold in 2006 and 2007 plaintiffs relied on the inflation maintenance theory alleging that goldman s prior statements regarding its controls artificially maintained an inflated stock price and that announcements of an sec enforcement action and investigations constituted corrective disclosures the plaintiffs moved to certify a class of investors who purchased goldman stock between 2007 and 2010 invoking the basic presumption the district court initially certified the class 12 on interlocutory appeal the second circuit vacated the district court s order holding that the lower court failed to apply the proper preponderance of the evidence standard in determining whether goldman had rebutted the basic presumption and failed to consider some of goldman s evidence regarding the absence of price impact 13 on remand the district court weighed both parties expert testimony and fact evidence and concluded that goldman had failed to rebut the basic presumption by a preponderance of the evidence 14 once again on appeal to the second circuit a divided panel affirmed 15 the majority rejected goldman s argument that the alleged misstatements were too general to maintain price inflation in an issuer s stock characterizing goldman s arguments as really a means for smuggling materiality into rule 23 and concluding that hile goldman s test might weed out potentially unmeritorious claims rule 23 is not a weed whacker for merits problems 16 in dissent judge sullivan criticized the majority for failing to consider the generic nature of the alleged misstatements in assessing whether the statements affected the market price candidly i don t see how a reviewing court can ignore the alleged misrepresentations when assessing price impact 17 on december 11 2020 the supreme court granted certiorari the supreme court s decision before the supreme court goldman challenged the second circuit s decision on two grounds first that the second circuit incorrectly held that the generic nature of goldman s alleged misstatements was irrelevant to whether defendants successfully rebutted the basic presumption by showing a lack of price impact and second that the court improperly assigned defendants the burden of persuasion of proving lack of price impact the generic nature of the alleged misstatements regarding the first issue the court recognized that the parties dispute had largely evaporated with both sides conceding that district courts may consider the generic nature of alleged misstatements as relevant to the assessment of price impact at class certification 18 the court agreed stating that courts should be open to all probative evidence even if that evidence is also relevant to a merits question like materiality 19 the court explained that while materiality and price impact are overlapping concepts and that the evidence relevant to one will almost always be relevant to the other district courts may not use the overlap to refuse to consider the evidence at class certification 20 furthermore the court recognized that the generic nature of a misrepresentation often will be important evidence of a lack of price impact especially in cases where plaintiffs rely on the inflation maintenance theory where an earlier misrepresentation is generic but the later corrective disclosure is specific it is less likely that the specific disclosure actually corrected the generic misrepresentation which means that there is less reason to infer front end price inflation that is price impact from the back end price drop 21 the court held that the second circuit s opinion had left sufficient doubt about whether it had properly considered the generic nature of the goldman s alleged misrepresentations 22 the court remanded in order for the second circuit to take into account all record evidence relevant to price impact regardless whether that evidence overlaps with materiality or any other merits issues 23 the burden of persuasion on the second issue goldman argued that under federal rule of evidence 301 plaintiffs should have borne the burden of persuasion on price impact because once defendants produced some evidence of lack of price impact the rule does not shift the burden of persuasion which remains on the party who had it originally 24 the court rejected the argument as contrary to basic and halliburton ii which were a clear departure from general rule that presumptions shift only the burden of production 25 the court explained that in those cases it made clear that defendants may rebut the presumption if they show that the misrepresentation in fact did not lead to a distortion of price by making ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and the price received or paid by the plaintiff 26 the court interpreted this precedent as having exercised the court s authority under rule 301 to change the customary burdens of persuasion to reassign the burden of persuasion to the defendant to prove a lack of price impact upon a prima facie showing by the plaintiff 27 dissenting on this issue justice gorsuch joined by justices thomas and alito argued that the basic presumption should operate like most other presumptions while the burden of production may shift the burden of persuasion remains on the party who had it originally i e plaintiffs 28 justice gorsuch disputed the majority s interpretation of basic and halliburton ii arguing that nothing in our prior decisions has ever placed a burden of persuasion on the defendant with respect to any aspect of the plaintiff s case 29 the majority disagreed with justice gorsuch s interpretation of the court s precedent explaining that the language in those cases imposed more than a mere production burden on defendants moreover to hold otherwise would effectively negate halliburton ii s holding that plaintiffs need not directly prove price impact in order to invoke the basic presumption if a defendant could defeat basic s presumption by introducing any competent evidence of a lack of price impact including for example the generic nature of the alleged misrepresentations then the plaintiff would end up with the burden of directly proving price impact in almost every case 30 finally the court downplayed the significance of its holding on the burden of persuasion the court observed that in any event the allocation of the burden is unlikely to make much difference on the ground because the district court s task is simply to assess all the evidence of price impact 31 where both parties submit expert evidence on price impact the court explained the burden of persuasion will have bite only when the district court finds the parties evidence to be in equipoise a situation that should rarely arise 32 implications on the surface the court s holdings appear muted affirming the second circuit s decision on one issue and vacating and remanding for further consideration on the other in fact goldman addresses several issues of considerable significance to securities litigants including opening up a revitalized materiality based defense for defendants seeking to rebut the basic presumption at the class certification stage materiality is back at class certification a frequent point of contention in securities fraud cases is whether a misstatement or omission is material that is whether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available 33 materiality furthermore is one of the threshold requirements for the basic presumption a misrepresentation that is immaterial by definition would have no price impact 34 nevertheless following the trilogy of supreme court decisions in halliburton i 2011 amgen 2013 and halliburton ii 2014 courts typically did not permit defendants to argue materiality at class certification including prohibiting the introduction of evidence relevant to materiality even if also directed at rebutting the basic presumption at the class certification stage the amgen court held that materiality need not be proved prior to rule 23 b 3 class certification because a failure of proof on the issue of materiality does not give rise to any prospect of individual questions overwhelming common ones 35 a view the court reaffirmed in halliburton ii 36 numerous courts including the second circuit took these decisions at their word holding flatly that materiality is not an appropriate consideration at the class certification stage 37 and the basic presumption may not be indirectly rebutted by showing that the misrepresentation was immaterial 38 goldman clarifies that halliburton ii and amgen should not be construed as absolute prohibitions on the introduction of price impact evidence at class certification even if the evidence is also relevant to a merits question like materiality 39 rather courts should be open to all probative evidence indeed the court recognized that materiality and price impact are overlapping concepts evidence relevant to one will almost always be relevant to the other and a district court may not use the overlap to refuse to consider the evidence 40 in other words it remains true after goldman that a defendant cannot directly argue that a statement was immaterial in seeking to defeat class certification the court s holding in amgen to that effect remains good law however given its relevance to the price impact inquiry a defendant may introduce the same evidence and argument for the purpose of severing the link between the alleged misrepresentation and the stock price the court s holding is a significant win for section 10 b defendants for almost a decade defendants have been barred from arguing materiality in attempting to rebut the basic presumption having to rest their case on statistical evidence such as event studies that purport to show lack of price impact now however materiality is sure to be a prime battleground following goldman we expect that defendants will argue routinely at the class certification stage that in addition to statistical evidence the nature of alleged misrepresentations defeats any inference of price impact how courts handle these goldman based arguments and whether this turns out to be a boon for securities defendants remains to be seen is goldman a stealth reversal technically the court only vacated the second circuit s decision so that it may consider all record evidence relevant to price impact including the generic nature of the alleged misrepresentations it did not express a view on how the second circuit should resolve the matter 41 nevertheless it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the majority was skeptical of the lower court s decision to certify the class the majority quoted for example judge sullivan s dissent where he concluded that the generic quality of goldman s alleged misstatements coupled with goldman s expert testimony compelled the conclusion that goldman proved a lack of price impact 42 further the court repeatedly characterized the alleged misstatements pled by the plaintiffs as generic in nature 43 and the court opined that the generic nature of a misrepresentation often will be important evidence of a lack of price impact particularly in cases such as this one based on inflation maintenance theory 44 that is because a necessary predicate is that the price drop equals the amount of inflation created by an earlier misrepresentation an inference that starts to break down when the earlier misrepresentation is generic and the later corrective disclosure is specific 45 courts may assess the significance of general or aspirational statements using all evidence including both expert testimony and their own intuition in their briefing before the supreme court plaintiffs emphasized that while materiality turns on whether an alleged misstatement would have been considered significant by a reasonable investor price impact is an empirical context dependent question and thus must be determined by a court s weighing of expert testimony not the court s own intuition 46 in contrast goldman argued that courts should not be required to set aside common sense in addressing the basic presumption and turn a blind eye to the simple wisdom that the more generic a challenged statement the less likely it is to have affected the price of a stock 47 the goldman opinion now makes clear that courts may consider expert testimony and use their common sense in assessing whether a generic misrepresentation had a price impact and indeed should be open to all probative evidence on that question qualitative as well as quantitative aided by a good dose of common sense 48 not a ringing endorsement of the inflation maintenance theory although accepting plaintiffs inflation maintenance theory for the purpose of the decision the court made a point that it has expressed no view on its validity or its contours and e need not and do not do so in this case 49 unlike a traditional fraud case where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant s misstatements introduced inflation into a company s stock price an inflation maintenance theory hinges on statements that merely maintain inflation already extant in a company s stock price but do not add to that inflation 50 price impact in turn is shown when a corrective disclosure causes the artificial inflation to dissipate and the stock price to fall 51 class action plaintiffs have increasingly relied on the inflation maintenance theory one estimate found that plaintiffs invoked inflation maintenance in 71 of recent district court cases involving the basic presumption and have successfully established price impact in all of those cases 52 while lower courts have widely approved of the theory including endorsements by the second seventh and eleventh circuits 53 some district courts have expressed skepticism of the theory as unduly speculative 54 the supreme court s refusal to take a definitive stand in goldman means that debate over the propriety of inflation maintenance theory and its specific contours will continue to percolate in the lower courts unlike a traditional fraud case where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant s misstatements introduced inflation into a company s stock price an inflation maintenance theory hinges on statements that merely maintain inflation already extant in a company s stock price but do not add to that inflation price impact in turn is shown when a corrective disclosure causes the artificial

definitive stand in goldman means that debate over the propriety of inflation maintenance theory and its specific contours will continue to percolate in the lower courts the court preserves the basic presumption at least for now goldman holds that to rebut the basic presumption the defendant bears the burden of persuasion to prove a lack of price impact and must carry that burden by a preponderance of the evidence 55 in what justice gorsuch describes in dissent as a curious disavowal the majority attempts to downplay the significance of this holding explaining that in most cases the parties will submit competing evidence on price impact and the court will assess the evidence and determine whether it is more likely than not that the misrepresentations had a price impact 56 the burden of persuasion will only bite when the court finds the evidence in equipoise a situation that should rarely arise 57 but in adopting this rule the court makes clear that the basic presumption is no ordinary presumption as justice gorsuch explains presumptions typically evaporate upon the opposing party s production of evidence that if taken as true would permit the conclusion that the presumption in plaintiff s favor is mistaken 58 applied here that means all a defendant would have to do to rebut the basic presumption would be to produce any competent evidence of a lack of price impact 59 at which point the presumption would drop from the case and the trier of fact would proceed to decide the ultimate question 60 in rejecting such an approach under the rule adopted by the majority the basic presumption acts more like an evidentiary standard on price impact tilted ever so slightly in favor of plaintiffs rather than a presumption in any traditional sense the basic presumption has been subject to significant criticism since it was first articulated in 1988 indeed justices thomas and alito who joined justice gorsuch s dissent in goldman have previously called for abrogation of the rule explaining that the view of market efficiency embodied in basic has since lost its luster 61 rather even well developed markets like the new york stock exchange do not uniformly incorporate information into market prices with high speed 62 to date the court has refused to overrule basic nevertheless and perhaps in tacit recognition of these critiques the court now gives plaintiffs and defendants almost equal footing in proving or disproving the validity of the presumption in a given case in the wake of goldman the battle over basic is certain to remain a critical and fiercely contested event in putative securities class actions 1 goldman sachs grp inc v ark teachers ret sys no 20 222 594 u s ___ 2021 2 for a full discussion of the relevant background see our

on may 20 2021 president biden signed an executive order on climate related financial risk which outlines various initiatives to promote policies related to physical and transition risks associated with climate change and to prioritize federal investments in support of those policies in this alert we focus on key aspects of the order that could have implications for private equity funds and areas of consideration for asset managers as a whole the executive order addresses five broad priorities develop a government wide strategy for mitigating climate related financial risk encourage financial regulators to assess climate related financial risk encourage consideration of climate related financial risks related to life savings and pensions modernize federal lending underwriting and procurement practices by incorporating climate related financial risks and reduce the risk of climate change to the federal budget various federal entities are directed to develop strategies and prepare reports in furtherance of these goals while the executive order has no immediate impact on the rules governing financial markets it signals a shift in federal priorities that could create opportunities for private equity in the future implications of the executive order for private equity climate related financial risk strategy the executive order calls for development of a government wide climate risk strategy the strategy must address the measurement assessment mitigation and disclosure of climate related financial risk to federal government programs assets and liabilities the strategy also must identify financing needs associated with achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions for the u s economy by 2050 and opportunities for public and private investments to meet those financing needs the director of the national economic council and the national climate advisor must coordinate with the secretary of the treasury and the director of the office of management and budget to develop the strategy by september 17 2021 120 days after the date of the executive order such a broad based climate risk strategy could present opportunities for private equity to target companies that can contribute to the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 according to 2019 figures released by the environmental protection agency the totality of united states greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to five sectors transportation electricity generation industry commercial residential and agriculture these five sectors are responsible for 29 25 23 13 and 10 of national greenhouse gas emissions respectively in the industrial sector alone the cement and steel industries each contribute approximately 8 to global greenhouse gas emissions climate related innovation in all five of these sectors is increasing rapidly aided by substantial growth in private equity investment in technology companies that have developed or are in the process of developing carbon neutral or less carbon intensive alternatives to activities that are traditionally carbon intensive for example numerous funds seek to invest specifically in environmental and cleantech companies with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through innovative technologies in addition blackrock and vanguard recently became signatories of the net zero asset managers initiative which unites asset managers around the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner these investment strategies and commitments are aligned with the goals of a federal climate related financial strategy and private equity funds with similar approaches should be well positioned to take advantage of any new opportunities that arise from the executive order potential impact on pension funds the executive order directs the secretary of labor to take several actions that could facilitate more retirement plan investments in private investment funds and other investment vehicles with strategies that promote or focus on environmental social and governance esg related goals the executive order includes a general directive to identify agency actions that could be taken under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the federal employees retirement system act of 1986 to protect retirement savings and pensions from the threats of climate related financial risk additionally the executive order directs the secretary of labor to consider proposing a rule by september 2021 to suspend revise or rescind two esg related rules adopted by the department of labor dol under the trump administration the 2020 rules the 2020 rules generally require erisa plan fiduciaries to make plan investment and proxy voting decisions based solely on consideration of pecuniary factors and prohibit them from making such decisions based on non pecuniary considerations e g esg type factors except in very limited circumstances in part because the 2020 rules and confusion about the 2020 rules had a chilling effect on the appropriate integration of esg factors in erisa plan investment decisions the dol announced in march that it would not enforce the 2020 rules until further guidance is issued notwithstanding the dol s non enforcement statement the 2020 rules have not actually been rescinded and additional rulemaking could provide some welcome clarity on these issues rescinding or substantially revising the 2020 rules could mitigate confusion and fears surrounding investing based on esg factors and goals and encourage more erisa plan fiduciaries to incorporate esg investments into their portfolios however the nature and impact of any future dol action is unknown at this time the executive order also directs the dol to submit a report to the president on its actions in response to the executive order within 180 days so we may have additional insight into the dol s direction by november of this year assessment of climate related financial risk by financial regulators the executive order directs the financial stability oversight council fsoc to consider taking a number of actions including issuing a report on any efforts by fsoc member agencies to integrate consideration of climate related financial risk into their policies and programs this report would discuss among other things the necessity of any actions to enhance climate related disclosures by regulated entities to reduce climate related financial risk to the financial system and any other recommendations for mitigating such risk through new or revised regulatory standards although the order only directs the fsoc to consider issuing the report we expect to see a report that addresses most if not all of the topics identified in the executive order by november 16 2021 the deadline imposed in the order the emphasis on climate related disclosures is consistent with efforts already underway at the sec to develop proposals for mandatory climate change disclosure requirements that would apply to public companies federal lending underwriting and procurement the executive order includes several directives related to government contracting and lending by federal agencies it seeks recommendations for the integration of climate related financial risk information into federal financial management and financial reporting especially as that risk relates to federal lending programs the order also calls for consideration of changes to federal procurement rules that would i require major federal suppliers to publicly disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate related financial risk and ii give preference to suppliers with a lower social cost of greenhouse gas emissions additionally federal agencies must integrate climate related financial risk into their own procurement processes with the increase in infrastructure focused private equity funds and the expansion of investment mandates of existing private equity funds asset managers will need to follow these potential regulatory changes in connection with the development of their investment thesis and the assessment of specific investments in the infrastructure vertical distribution and procurement verticals and other ancillary verticals that interact with the federal government on a commercial basis looking ahead the executive order does not create any immediately enforceable rules but it does chart a course for greater emphasis on climate related risk considerations in federal financial policy reports that are required or suggested by the order will shed additional light on the potential longer term impact of this policy shift on the financial markets and regulated entities while many of the priorities covered by the order will not affect the asset management industry we believe that development of a more climate focused federal financial strategy and potential related changes to the erisa rules could create opportunities for private equity firms that are prepared to take advantage of these shifts in policy proskauer will continue to track significant regulatory changes with a focus on the implications and opportunities for private equity funds and we encourage asset managers to monitor developments in this area
