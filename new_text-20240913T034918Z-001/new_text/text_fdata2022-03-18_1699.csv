commentary with consumer prices soaring to levels not seen since the early 1980s many pundits are predicting the economy will enter a period of stagflation that could persist for years stagflation is any period marked by both rising inflation and rising unemployment something our economy has not experienced since 1980 despite the infrequency of periods of stagflation investors have started taking precautionary measures investors professionals and speculators have bought into the stagflation narrative in a big way under the belief that higher consumer prices will ultimately lead to higher interest rates investors are fleeing from the government bond market at a rate unlike any time in modern history in what seems like a sure bet on lower bond prices investors and money managers continue to unload their positions without any regard to price while speculators are shorting the bond market by borrowing bonds and selling them on the open market to keep pace with rising inflation through a period of stagflation investors and money managers are overweighting into stocks as they believe stocks are a superior hedge against inflation investors looking back to the 1970s for cues on how to invest may find themselves on the wrong side of the trade without any instance of stagflation in the past 40 years investors are making a big bet that we are about to enter a period of stagflation investors are hoping for stocks and interest rates to continue to rise when the opposite is more likely to happen before the 1980s there was a relationship between initial unemployment claims and the consumer price index the consumer price index led initial claims higher three times between the 1970s and early 1980s each of these three periods marked periods of stagflation which is consistent with rising consumer prices and unemployment since then the opposite has mostly happened where consumer prices fell during periods of rising unemployment during the 1981 1982 recession consumer prices fell as initial claims rose consumer prices briefly rose as the economy entered a recession in the mid 1990s before consumer prices nosedived against rising unemployment claims when the dot com bubble burst and sent the economy into a recession in 2001 consumer prices crashed while initial unemployment claims rose going into the great financial crisis in 2007 consumer prices rose for about a year before crashing into a deflationary spiral at the same time consumer prices were crashing initial unemployment claims continued higher yet this time investors seem completely convinced inflation is persistent and will only head higher with initial unemployment claims near historically low levels it seems all too obvious initial claims will follow consumer prices higher this belief is especially true when excluding the prior three recessions but if recent history is a guide rising unemployment is more likely to be met by slowing consumer price inflation rather than fixate on the three periods of stagflation during the 1970s into the early 1980s investors would be better served in trying to figure out what changed with the 1981 1982 recession where periods of stagflation have been brief since the early 1980s something about the global monetary system or financial system has changed to the point where unemployment claims no longer follow consumer prices higher as the economy reopened from the pandemic consumer prices shot higher while initial unemployment claims fell to one of their lowest levels in history using the post 1981 1982 recession as a guide initial employment claims are soon to rise as consumer price inflation peaks the first and most important change was global trade after decades of the u s dollar being the global reserve currency the world finally figured out how to use it to create global prosperity when consumer prices rise in the u s low cost foreign producers are financially incentivized to export to the united states unlike the periods of stagflation in the 1970s where foreign produced goods and services were inferior to domestically produced goods and services foreign produced goods and services are on par with or are superior to domestically produced goods and services during periods of high inflation low cost foreign produced goods surge into the u s which helps temper rising consumer prices as far as demand goes the reason unemployment claims rise during periods of rising inflation is that wage growth lags behind the rapid rise in consumer price growth with less discretionary money consumers have no choice but to cut back on their expenditures as spending recedes employers no longer need as many employees as they look to cut expenses as inventory levels continue to rise while investors are betting big on a long period of stagflation and rising interest rates they are about to find themselves mispositioned once again long term treasury yields are a function of growth and inflation expectations and during periods of rising unemployment claims and slowing consumer price growth both growth and inflation expectations decline along with treasury yields this is why each of the three recessions since the early 1980s has seen a decline in treasury yields while there may be a brief period of stagflation it will soon be followed by a period of deflation primarily due to an increase in imports and a decrease in consumer demand views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

it should begin to pick up from a seasonal perspective which can be bearish for the sector matthew gastall executive director and head of wealth management municipal research and strategy at morgan stanley said while the supply demand dynamic and rate movements impact overall market technicals he said investors should work on duration and credit strategies this is one of those periods where you should be monitoring credit structure call dates call options final maturities and above market coupon structure gastall said adding these elements will impact performance in investors portfolios going forward gastall advocates taking credit risk over rate risk so far this year he suggests investors buy essential service paper that is investment grade rated such as a rated or slightly lower water sewer public power or state general obligation paper over taking on extra interest rate risk the essential service paper is still stable high quality paper but in the rare event it encounters fiscal pressure it will receive support from their respective municipalities and will continue to operate uninterrupted gastall said we re definitely not recommending high yield paper right now he said if continued rate weakness occurs gastall warned that the market could potentially see evidence of a negative convexity trade where lower coupon bonds between 2 5 and 3 could reset from their call options to their final maturities sparking increased volatility it s not something that could happen tomorrow but over the course of a few months and years so investors have to be careful of that he said defensive investors are currently keeping an eye on coupon calls and final maturities he noted while offensively others are offsetting that strategy by buying higher coupon bonds with short calls if the market sees more rate weakness with the fed and the glut of seasonal supply investors should be cautious overall until the market sees more stability according to gastall even if rates stabilize for quite some time munis may slowly and gradually respond over time he said mutual funds see outflows in the week ended march 16 weekly reporting tax exempt mutual funds saw investors pull

fomc redux now that the federal open market committee has set a plan rate hikes throughout the year and balance sheet reduction announced as early as its may meeting analysts opined tighter policy yes but not tight enough to derail the economy or curtail inflation in our view said the payden rygel economics team they suggest a 50 basis point increase could occur if core personal consumption expenditures fail to slow assuming the economy continues to grow with a terminal fed funds rate close to 3 they ask will ongoing rate hikes do anything to curtail inflation using the punchbowl analogy the fed is emptying the punchbowl one spoonful at a time payden rygel says such deliberate removal of accommodation is unlikely to derail growth nor curtail inflation in the near term sure interest rates will steadily increase but not quickly enough to end the party neither in the real economy nor the financial markets berenberg capital markets chief economist for the u s americas and asia mickey levy a member of the shadow open market committee said the fed s delays in beginning to raise rates has placed it between a rock and a hard place that will make a soft landing challenging while powell in his press conference claimed the fed does not see evidence of a wage price spiral it is clear current labor market conditions and inflationary expectations are influencing wage and price setting behavior particularly in the services sector levy said everything seems to have surprised the fed the russia invasion of ukraine has muddied the fed s calculus he said a commodity price shock the risk of slumping economic activity in europe and declining real purchasing power tilts economic risks to the downside and raises the probability of a stagflationary outcome while such conditions in the past led to tentative and cautious moves levy said the fed may not be afforded that luxury under present circumstances of elevated underlying inflation powell throughout his press conference stressed the fed s commitment to price stability and the need to take action to ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched yet even with rate increases rising inflation and inflationary expectations are likely to keep real rates deeply negative but policymakers erred on the hawkish side in the dot plot said andrzej skiba head of u s fixed income at rbc global asset management their projections he said suggest inflation is not likely to fall below the 2 level until after yearend 2024 while the projections initially caught markets off guard tom garretson senior portfolio strategist at rbc wealth management said powell appeared to quell some fears around a more hawkish than expected fed during his press conference while the fed is likely to move at a measured pace garretson remains wary of the possibility that the fed risks raising rates until something breaks in the economy which has been reflected in sharply flatter treasury yield curves and inversions within certain segments following the fed meeting ron temple head of u s equities at lazard asset management agreed the markets were surprised by the pace and quantity of expected hikes while tough talk is important he said the fed needs to ensure its doesn t overshoot and turn a robust recovery into a recession the fed s moves are fully expected based on the evolving view of inflation growth and the fact that the jobs market has been more positive over the last three months than expected said steve skancke chief economic advisor at keel point but policymakers offered a fair amount of dispersion about how much rates should rise in the coming quarters said wells fargo securities chief economist jay bryson some of this dispersion in views may represent the uncertainty that the russia ukraine conflict crisis which the fomc explicitly noted imparts to the economic outlook the war in the short term is likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity the fomc statement said this combination creates a dilemma for the fomc bryson said higher inflation implies that the committee would want to tighten aggressively but slower growth would argue for fewer rate hikes what are monetary policymakers to do if the economy doesn t come completely off the rails in the near term he said fed rate hikes at the next few meetings seem more or less like sure bets thereafter the committee may become much more data dependent the fed is determined to fight inflation without sinking the economy said marvin loh senior macro strategist at state street global markets policymakers may need to continue tightening even in the face of waning growth he said as a result the treasury curve has flattened an indication that the risk of a policy mistake has risen addressing the lack of details on balance sheet reduction loh said it may signal that the fed is concerned with tightening financial conditions as a result of its aggressive hiking schedule and the potential fallout of geopolitical developments we will pencil in a start of within the next six weeks while and market volatility may push its start out by a few meetings our read is that the fed pivoted as hawkishly as it could signaling that it will continue to raise rates until inflation expectations stabilize he said this can only be accomplished by sapping demand with the chair pointing out that an overheating jobs market was an unhealthy outcome this raises the risk of a recession but provides some comfort that the fed thinks it can control inflation in the relatively near future with post pandemic issues driving inflation loh said it is unclear how quickly rate hikes will take to influence prices making each data point important with every meeting fed meeting a live event but if the fed tightens as the sep suggests scott anderson chief economist at bank of the west said the fed runs a considerable risk of driving u s economic growth lower than the fomc s current projections in 2022 and 2023 and indeed we cannot completely discount the rising risk of the central bank pushing the u s economy back into recession by next year after the meeting he noted there was an inversion in the 5 year 10 year treasury spread suggesting the fixed income market is increasing its bets that the fed will need to shift gears soon after this tightening and begin cutting its policy rate in response to slower growth and while the fed was hawkish andy sparks head of portfolio management research at msci pointed out the fed s 4 3 pce inflation expectation for this year is noticeably more optimistic than the market implied inflation forecast of 4 95 if the market s forecast is accurate he said the fed may need to tighten monetary policy more than previously thought but stagflation which concerns investors wasn t mentioned he said the anchor played by bonds in multi asset portfolios has resulted in the growth of many investment strategies including the popular 60 40 portfolio sparks said but in a stagflation scenario the combination of slower growth and high inflation would reduce the value of this anchor and is one of the scenarios that many market participants want to avoid powell also failed to address how the u s economy may be harmed by other developed markets being impacted by the russia ukraine war he said also with eyes on russia david page head of macroeconomic research at axa investment managers said we are wary that the fed is underestimating the impact of the invasion on the u s outlook with little change beyond near term adjustments should the economy slow from the war he said financial conditions would tighten further and growth slow more than current projections and this would see the fed needing to tighten policy by less probably by the end of this year and more certainly across next year still some analysts have doubts we believe that the seven 25 bps rate increases the futures market is pricing in for this year very much represent an upper limit of potential hikes and that this scenario is unlikely to materialize said jason england global bonds portfolio manager at janus henderson investors also the meeting had fewer participants than normal as president biden s nominees have yet to be confirmed importantly we believe that eventual new members will lean toward the dovish camp reinforcing our view that the market s expectations have gotten ahead of reality he said it s worth recalling that throughout chairman jerome powell s tenure when given the choice between two paths and having not been mugged by multi decade highs in inflation he s opted for greater accommodation also england noted supply issue fueled the price hikes and unfortunately for the fed the blunt instrument of rate hikes tends to be less effective in combating inflation driven by supply factors than it is in quelling periods of accelerating prices driven by full throttle demand the addition of geopolitical events to the mix he said amplifies our concerns about the potential for monetary policy error policymakers must perform a perilous balancing act should the fed overtighten the u s economy could slip into recession if it falls behind the curve and higher inflation expectations become embedded bond valuations could come under pressure as higher discounts are commanded to compensate for the diminished value of future cash flows

australian politicians who have expressed support for wikileaks founder and publisher julian assange need to act fast to prevent him from being extradited from the uk to the us following the supreme court s rejection of an appeal to hear his case this week politicians like andrew wilkie george christensen and senator rex patrick have taken up his cause it is true while national party leader barnaby joyce has also spoken out about the australian hacker who has been jailed in a maximum security prison in the uk since april 2019 opposition leader anthony albanese has also backed assange but these occasional statements will do nothing to help prevent the us from pushing on aggressively with its campaign to extradite assange and put him on trial he faces up to 175 years in jail if convicted which means he will die in prison for doing what most journalists do as a matter of routine receive data from a known or unknown source and publish articles based on that assange faces criminal charges in the us for publishing classified information that was leaked to wikileaks by an american soldier then known as bradley manning but now after gender reassignment surgery known as chelsea manning the extradition decision is now in the hands of british home secretary priti patel and there is little doubt that she will not go up against the americans to oppose assange s extradition every time the assange issue has been raised with australian prime minister scott morrison his stock response has been that whatever process is in train in the uk has to be gone through and he cannot interfere with it true but what prevents him from having a word with prime minister boris johnson if he really thinks a robust media sector is necessary for a functioning democracy how about showing a little christian charity as has been reported former us president barack obama s administration considered whether it could bring criminal charges against assange and wikileaks for publishing classified information as american journalist glenn greenwald wrote it ultimately decided it would not do so and could not do so consistent with the press freedom guarantee of the first amendment after all the obama doj concluded such a prosecution would pose a severe threat to press freedom because there would be no way to prosecute assange for publishing classified documents without also prosecuting the new york times the washington post the guardian and others for doing exactly the same thing but despite current us president joe biden being obama s vice president and very much a part of that decision he has done nothing to prevent the extradition being pursued it will take an effort outside the normal process to save assange one cannot hope that appeals to this or that authority will succeed the entire saga must be taking a terrible toll on a man who has done no wrong to merit it when he will break is only a matter of time
but the she biden virtual summit this friday comes off the back of the meeting between national security advisor jake sullivan and his nearest chinese equivalent young jae in rome only a few days ago that was a difficult seven hour meeting it s quite plain looking at those readouts that chinese given their increasing degree of international isolation on ukraine seeking to normalize to some extent their relationship and engagement with washington at this stage that i think provides an opportunity for the united states to press home the core political diplomatic and military factors which are alive in the zelensky request to the collective west to secure ukraine s long term viability there is an open question in terms of the nature of the military requests which have been made of beijing from the russians therefore this intervention at the presidential level with xi jinping is important at this time the financial sanctions question as it pertains to chinese financial institutions is top of mind in terms of china s core concerns with the united states given that china still trades within a us dollar denominated international trading system financial system and currency reserve system china as of now is vulnerable and the chinese economic leadership are aware of that china s actions to date in terms of its financial compliance with us and western sanctions against moscow has been based on my information at least reasonably correct that is they are not in the mood to suffer secondary sanctions themselves what happens in terms of this much vexed debate on military supplies and military requests is a separate matter and we will see how that unfolds that is still very much opaque for many of us in terms of what is actually happening on the ground advertisement how china is quietly distancing itself from russia share copy link copy china is quietly distancing itself from russia s sanction hit economy the two states proclaimed last month that their friendship had no limits that was before russia launched its war in ukraine now with russia s economy being slammed with sanctions from all over the world there is growing evidence that china s willingness and ability to aid its northern neighbor may be limited beijing has refused to condemn russia s attack on ukraine but wants to avoid being impacted by the sanctions it has repeatedly denounced as an ineffective way of resolving the crisis china is not a party to the crisis and doesn t want the sanctions to affect china foreign minister wang yi said tuesday during a phone call with his spanish counterpart beijing also gave its full backing wednesday to comments made earlier this week by china s ambassador to ukraine china will never attack ukraine we will help especially economically fan xianrong was quoted as saying in a press release from the lviv regional government fears that chinese companies could face u s sanctions over ties with russia had contributed to an epic sell off in chinese stocks in recent days that slump was reversed wednesday when beijing promised it would pursue policies to boost its sputtering economy and keep financial markets stable u s officials told cnn on monday that they have information suggesting china has expressed some openness to providing russia with requested military and financial assistance china dismissed that as disinformation analysts say that china is attempting to strike a delicate balance between supporting russia rhetorically but without further antagonizing the united states beijing and moscow share a strategic interest in challenging the west however chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to u s dollars and many chinese industries cannot afford to be deprived of u s technology while china is russia s no 1 trading partner beijing has other priorities trade between the two countries made up just 2 of china s total trade volume the european union and the united states have much larger shares according to chinese customs statistics from last year here are some measures beijing has taken in the last few weeks to distance itself from the isolated and crumbling russian economy letting the ruble drop china s currency the yuan doesn t trade completely freely moving instead within bands set by officials at the people s bank of china pboc last week they doubled the size of the ruble trading range allowing the russian currency to fall faster the ruble has already lost more than 20 of its value against both the dollar and euro since the start of the war in ukraine by allowing the russian currency to fall against the yuan beijing isn t doing moscow any favors russians will have to pay more in rubles for chinese imports such as smartphones and cars chinese phone brands like xiaomi and huawei are hugely popular in russia and were vying with apple and samsung for market leadership before the war chinese car makers such as great wall motor and geely auto occupy 7 of russia s market selling more than 115 000 vehicles last year great wall motor has stopped supplying new cars to dealers in russia because of the exchange rate fluctuations expanding the trading band would allow the yuan to keep up with the ruble s wild swings so that chinese companies can better grasp the magnitude or trend of future exchange rate fluctuations and reduce exchange risks by using hedging methods such as derivatives state owned china business network reported last week currently about 25 billion of china russia trade is conducted in yuan chinese state media reported sitting on reservesthe most significant help china could offer russia is through the 90 billion worth of reserves moscow holds in yuan wrote alicia garcía herrero chief economist for asia pacific at natixis in a research report on tuesday sanctions have frozen about 315 billion worth of russia s reserves or roughly half the total as western countries have banned dealing with the russian central bank video above u s sternly warns china on aiding in russia s lethal onslaughtrussia s finance minister anton siluanov said this week that the country wanted to use yuan reserves after moscow was blocked from accessing u s dollars and euros according to russia s state media the pboc has so far not made any comment about its position regarding these reserves if china allowed moscow to convert its yuan reserves into u s dollars or euros that would clearly help russia s current impasse garcía herrero noted however the reputational risk of potentially breaching western sanctions would be a huge step for the pboc to take and therefore makes it highly unlikely she said the long term gains of moving closer to russia might not match the impact of western investors suddenly losing interest in china she added withholding aircraft partssanctions imposed by the united states and the european union mean that the world s two major aircraft makers boeing and airbus are no longer able to supply spare parts or provide maintenance support for russian airlines the same is true of jet engine makers that means russian airlines could run out of parts within a matter of weeks or fly planes without having equipment replaced as frequently as recommended to operate safely earlier this month a top russian official said that china has refused to send aircraft parts to russia as moscow looks for alternative supplies valery kudinov head of aircraft airworthiness at russia s air transport agency was quoted by russian state news agency tass as saying that russia would look for opportunities to source parts from countries including turkey and india after a failed attempt to obtain them from china as far as i know china refused kudinov was quoted as saying in response to cnn s request for comment china s foreign ministry reiterated beijing s opposition to sanctions adding that china and russia will maintain normal economic and trade cooperation china and russia set up a civil aviation joint venture in 2017 to build a new long haul widebody passenger plane seeking to rival the duopoly of boeing and airbus production of the cr929 has begun but disagreements over suppliers have caused delays the plane was initially expected to be offered to customers in 2024 but russia postponed the timeline to 2028 to 2029 freezing infrastructure investmentthe world bank has halted all its programs in russia and belarus following the invasion of ukraine it hadn t approved any new loans or investments to russia since 2014 and none to belarus since 2020 more surprisingly perhaps is the decision by the beijing based asian infrastructure investment bank to do the same in a statement earlier this month it said it was suspending all its activities related to russia and belarus as the war in ukraine unfolds the move was in the best interests of the bank it added frustrated by a relative lack of influence at the world bank based in washington d c and the asian development bank where japan is a major force china launched the aiib in 2016 in addition to hosting the headquarters china provides the president of the bank and has 26 5 of the votes india and russia have 7 6 and 6 respectively the aiib s decision to suspend activities in russia means 1 1 billion of approved or proposed lending aimed at improving the country s road and rail networks is now on hold cnn s beijing bureau and hannah ritchie in sydney

the prospect of double digit inflation this autumn as surging energy and wheat prices force up the cost of living means that the latest quarter point hike in the bank of england s interest rate to 0 75 per cent will not be the last so with putin s war against ukraine taking an enormous bite out of britain and the world s growth prospects we now face the alarming prospect of stagnating prosperity escalating consumer prices and interest rate rises all at the same time and despite the third increase in the official bank rate in four months savers who have made great sacrifices since the financial crisis of 2007 08 cannot expect to see better returns on their hard earned cash any time soon last autumn bank of england governor andrew bailey was insisting that the rise in the cost of living was transitory and would pass as the pandemic receded and world economies opened up again in a rare moment of frankness for a senior banker howard davies the chairman of natwest cautioned savers that the high street banks would not see the need to pass on better returns to savers the market is very competitive at the moment so i don t think it will be one for one he said which is scant comfort for those households who have been prudent through the pandemic banks are sitting on an extra 200billion or more of cash in current and deposit accounts accumulated by households since march 2020 much of this money earns negligible returns of 0 1 per cent and its ultimate value will be eroded by soaring inflation what is without doubt is that mortgage lenders will lose no time in passing on the higher interest rate to borrowers by doing so they widen the gap between the cost of borrowing and savings returns known as the interest rate margin which is adding greatly to the profits of the banks and bonuses for the bankers such grasping behaviour at a time when the public faces huge hardships and when high street banks are savaging the number of branches is nothing short of deplorable some seven out of ten mortgage borrowers are protected from higher interest rates for the time being because they have negotiated fixed rates but the rate rise will punish those seeking new loans to get on or move up the housing ladder as well as mortgage holders on standard or tracker rates which move with the market the economic background to the bank of england s interest rate decision and a similar move by the american central bank the federal reserve on wednesday is complex higher interest rates are intended over time to curb inflation they do so by sending out a cautionary message to consumers and businesses which in turn slows demand and cuts the output of the nation but the timing is terrible the bank of england has upped the base rate for the third time in three months as it attempts to keep a lid on soaring inflation only yesterday the oecd which represents the west s biggest economies warned that world growth this year will be one per cent lower than the previously estimated 4 5 per cent as a result of the ongoing conflict in ukraine while inflation will be a calamitous 2 5 per cent higher than previously projected former treasury mandarin jon cunliffe a member of the bank s interest rate setting monetary policy committee was the only dissenter yesterday voting to keep uk rates on hold at 0 5 per cent until such time as forecasters get a better fix on how war in europe will affect britain s prospects as one of the most open economies in the world as recently as last autumn bank of england governor andrew bailey was insisting that the rise in the cost of living was transitory and would pass as the pandemic receded and world economies opened up again he obviously could not have predicted russia s invasion of ukraine and its impact on already rocketing energy prices nevertheless the screeching change of direction on interest rates leaves the bank and bailey looking embarrassingly out of step with events the bank of england raised interest rates again today amid fears the rate of inflation will increase to around 8 per cent in the coming months or even hit double digits the bank s forecasting has been way off the mark and it should have acted much earlier to combat inflation that would have militated against the need to raise rates at such a turbulent juncture for national security the global economy and financial markets chancellor rishi sunak will have an opportunity to reverse some of the pain of the cost of living crisis in next week s budget by postponing or cancelling the 1 25 percentage point rise in national insurance contributions but so far at least there are no signs that sunak is ready to do a reverse ferret and spike the hike

the company received a pair of bullish ratings from wall street what happened shares of paypal pypl 1 67 had risen more than 16 this week as of market close thursday after the company received bullish ratings from two analysts earlier in the week additionally the federal reserve began raising its benchmark overnight lending rate the federal funds rate for the first time since 2018 at its march meeting held earlier this week so what deutsche bank analyst bryan keane reiterated his buy rating for paypal citing future tailwinds from the company s eventual expansion into china and further offerings on the platform ranging from card based solutions and the integration of zettle its point of sale offering that it purchased in 2018 keane has a price target of 200 implying substantial upside from paypal s current stock price of roughly 112 moffettnathanson analyst lisa ellis also gave paypal a buy rating and a 190 price target saying that she sees potential from further recovery in china new offerings on the platform and growth from ebay in the u s not everyone is so bullish on paypal however just last week bank of america analyst jason kupferberg downgraded the stock and chopped his price target from 175 to 107 in a research note kupferberg said he thinks management overestimated the sustainability of tailwinds induced by the pandemic and related stimulus kupferberg slashed his estimates for total payment volume tpv forecasts in 2022 and 2023 which will take revenue with it as paypal makes most of its money on transaction fees the fed also raised the federal funds rate this week by 25 basis points 0 25 and said it expects similar sized hikes at its next six meetings in 2022 and then potentially five more rate hikes in 2023 now what rising rates can hurt paypal s business because they will likely slow consumer demand and therefore tpv on the platform but as paypal s cfo john rainey said at a recent conference the company has only been penciling in two rate hikes this year because paypal earns interest income on customer balances more rate hikes will also increase this segment of revenue overall trading at 24 times forward earnings paypal trades at a lower earnings multiple than it has historically while things may not be firing on all cylinders right now considering the company s scale and continued investment i think this is a good time to get in on the stock

lefferts garden neighborhood of brooklyn borough in new york city the labor department reported that consumer inflation rose 7 9 over the past year the largest rise si expand while consumers are aware of the price of goods they may be less aware of a small change in the size or volume of the product rather than raise the price directly some manufacturers choose to make the product a little smaller and charge the same price it is a sneaky way to pass on a back door price increase that most shoppers will not notice said edgar dworsky a consumer expert with consumerworld org shrinkflation affects size volume of products this means companies are downsizing products in order to meet the demands of inflation without directly affecting your wallet it s a kind of downsizing that bucks the decades old trend of supersizing and you can see its effects in almost every aisle of the grocery store merriam webster noted dworsky said downsizing has been around since the days when candy bars cost a nickel while the trend comes in waves he said it s more prevalent during times of high inflation putting fewer sheets on your toilet paper or paper towel roll making orange juice containers hold less putting fewer cookies or potato chips in the package taking an ounce out of each box of cereal these are ways that manufacturers are costing you more dworksy continued this means you have to buy the product more often because it will run out faster putting a strain on the consumer s wallet without possibly even realizing it shrinkflation might sneak by shoppers but the tactic has become increasingly noticeable to consumers in a new subreddit on shrinkflation people have been chiming in and documenting their shrinking groceries credit consumerworld org mouseprint org one user on reddit wrote this pack of chicken strips lost 0 31kg since the last time i bought them another user shared a photo of their celery bag writing these celery stalks used to fill the bag and this one is literally half the bag in march alone dworsky documented the changes in size and volume in multiple products including cottonelle 284 2 ply sheets to just 268 sun maid raisins chobani yogurt dove body wash and safeguard soap credit consumerworld org mouseprint org over the past 60 years dworsky revealed charmin toilet paper reportedly went from 650 single ply sheets on a roll to the equivalent of 90 less assuming you could even find single rolls any longer his latest change showed ultra soft mega rolls going from 264 double ply sheets per roll to 244 and super mega rolls went from 396 sheets to 366 fox reached out to charmin for comment are doritos linked to shrinkflation doritos have been making headlines recently for being associated with shrinkflation last year dworsky noted the downsizing of the popular chip brand s volume eight years ago we brought you news that doritos had downsized its 11 3 4 ounce bags to just 11 ounces well we must have missed some additional changes to its net weight in the interim because they recently dropped to 9 1 4 ounces from 9 3 4 he wrote adding the company makes it very hard to detect changes in content because the net weight statement is on the very bottom of the bag often folded under when stocked on store shelves gasoline and diesel fuel prices above six dollars a gallon are displayed on a pump at a chevron gas station at north alameda and west cesar chavez ave near union station in downtown los angeles california on february 17 2022 photo by patrick t expand then last week quartz the global news and insights company claimed that frito lay confirmed that they dropped the weight of doritos bags from 9 75 ounces to 9 25 ounces or five fewer chips but frito lay the parent company of doritos denies these claims in 2022 we have not nor do we plan to cut the number of doritos or any of our chips in any size bag the company wrote in a comment to fox television stations group will shrinkflation end soon as long as the current wave of inflation lasts and manufacturers bottom lines are under pressure experts say producers will continue to look for ways to directly or indirectly raise their prices related federal reserve hikes interest rate to fight inflation more to come consumers are already price conscious but they need to become net weight conscious dworksy concluded that is the only way they can recognize if a manufacturer is pulling a fast one on them by inconspicuously reducing package contents if you don t know that some types of charmin that you buy today have 20 to 30 fewer sheets on a roll than they did last year you won t realize you ve been snookered on wednesday the federal reserve launched a high risk effort to tame the worst inflation since the early 1980s raising its benchmark short

pittsburgh business wire united states steel corporation nyse x today provided first quarter 2022 guidance first quarter 2022 adjusted ebitda is expected to be approximately 1 3 billion a new all time record for the first quarter first quarter 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 2 96 to 3 00 we expect to deliver another strong quarter of safety adjusted ebitda free cash flow and operational performance in the first quarter commented u s steel president and chief executive officer david b burritt at the beginning of the year we communicated expected market softness for the first quarter along with the normal seasonal impacts related to our mining operations we are exiting the first quarter with spot business accelerating steel prices rising and the longest backlog at our big river steel operations since october additionally as a result of continued execution of our differentiated commercial strategy we are realizing significant upside on our fixed price contracts we expect improving market conditions to continue into the second quarter as seasonal demand picks up and buyers begin to shift their attention to a more reliable regional steel supply given the geopolitical risks and cost volatility which has increased in recent weeks burritt continued the conflict in ukraine is a human tragedy safety remains our number one priority our employees in slovakia remain safe and we are demonstrating our culture of caring by assisting our ukrainian neighbors through various charitable activities the workforce in slovakia has been quick to address refugee needs by supplying over 7 840 meals for refugees in slovakia working with ukrainian suppliers to send 17 tons of food to ukraine and providing 800 beds for refugees arriving in kosice over 220 000 refugees have crossed into slovakia from ukraine in addition we are demonstrating our s t e e l principles and culture of caring by announcing donation match programs through unicef and the red cross burritt concluded we are actively monitoring the conflict in ukraine for impacts and risks to our people and business today s market dynamics reinforce what makes u s steel s business model unique our low cost captive iron ore assets in minnesota are a sustainable competitive advantage that cannot be replicated by the competition we are increasingly translating this competitive advantage to our growing fleet of electric arc furnaces we are building a pig iron machine at gary works to supply big river steel with up to 50 of its ore based metallics needs by the first half of 2023 and will continue to identify additional opportunities to broaden our metallics strategy these actions build upon the regionally sourced low cost iron ore advantage our u s blast furnaces have and the strategy in place with big river steel to supplement a portion of their prime scrap needs with home scrap from our integrated operations we remain bullish for 2022 and another strong year of financial performance stockholder returns update quarter to date the company has repurchased approximately 100 million of common stock as of march 17 2022 there is approximately 550 million remaining under the company s cumulative 800 million stock buyback authorization first quarter adjusted ebitda commentary the flat rolled segment s adjusted ebitda is expected to be impacted by approximately 150 million related to the seasonal mining headwinds that occur each year in the first quarter as well as increased raw material costs and a larger than expected headwind from cautious spot market activity these headwinds are expected to be partially offset by increased revenue from our fixed price contracts the mini mill segment is expected to continue delivering adjusted ebitda margins similar to 2021 levels reflecting the high quality earnings of the mini mill segment cautious spot market activity throughout much of the quarter is expected to be partially offset by lower cost metallics consumed in the quarter the recent geopolitical events are increasing spot steel demand particularly at our big river steel operations resulting in a growing backlog of orders considering the conflict in ukraine and its impact on the global metallics supply our raw material inventories remain well positioned to continue meeting customer demand and contingency plans are in place to ensure raw materials are available from alternate sources the european segment is expected to deliver adjusted ebitda approaching fourth quarter levels and is expected to be the third best quarterly adjusted ebitda steel prices and demand were stable throughout january and february and our european segment benefited from having its third blast furnace back on line in february after a 60 day planned outage demand remains healthy from our facility in slovakia in march in light of the conflict in ukraine and our risk mitigation plans are working as we currently have inventory on site or in transit to continue meeting customer demand alternate sources of supply are underway to continue meeting demand as we closely monitor the rapidly changing geopolitical situation the tubular segment s

share facebook twitter linkedin pinterest by brianna gwirtz ocj field reporter the year 2010 was transformative for zane gross not only was it the year he met his now wife courtney it was also the year he took a leap of faith and bought his first four heifers the first generation cattleman got his start by taking 4 h and ffa projects to the county fair after a few years of showing calves and steers gross realized he was particularly drawn to the production side of the business in 2010 he purchased four limousine angus crossbred heifers and brought them back to his family s farm in ashland he raised calves for freezer beef for a few years before attending a dispersal sale in 2013 where gross bought his first registered angus cow the foundation for his herd buckeye creek angus i transitioned to an angus herd because i really grew a passion for genetics gross said the angus breed has an advanced genetic database with good epd tracking plus there s the angus type market incentives like certified angus beef it just was the best way for us to get started off on a good foot the second generation is getting an early start working on the farm while neither of them had grown up around cattle gross and his wife both learned more about beef production when they majored in animal sciences at the ohio state university zane started his college education at ohio state ati in neighboring wooster i only had a few cows at the time but it was nice to be able to come home in the evenings and on weekends gross said it was a balancing act for sure once we moved to columbus my parents helped us out a lot after completing their bachelor s degrees the two moved back to ashland and purchased the farm adjacent to gross parents juggling college internships and the cows was good practice for the family s future today zane and courtney are joined by their two kids nolan and sutton in raising between 15 to 20 registered angus cows in addition to feeding out steers for freezer beef named after the couple s beloved alma mater as well as the buckeye trees growing on their farm buckeye creek angus main focus is to raise bulls and replacement heifers that complement commercial cattlemen s herds every breeding decision has the goal of creating stock that increases other herds efficiency and adds value to future calves we ai everything to try to make improvements to the herd faster gross said in the last year or two we ve really noticed an increase in our genetic level gross full time position as the operations manager at e r boliantz co a local packing plant gives him a unique vantage point for his management practices when feeder cattle are ready to be harvested gross is able to see his breeding decisions come to fruition evaluating the carcasses himself with this job i get to see what an animal looks like in the barn but then i also get to see it on the rail gross said you get to learn a lot that way at work he lines up the day for the packing plant makes sure deliveries are ready and handles sales calls it s a job that requires many hats and long days i work a lot of 10 or 11 hour days and then spend evenings and weekends here on the farm it s tough to keep it all up but it s worth it gross said after over a decade of growing and learning within the cattle industry gross was recently honored by the ohio cattleman s association as the 2021 young cattleman of the year the award according to the oca is given to individuals or couples under the age of 40 who have demonstrated the initial stages of a successful beef operation and exhibited leadership potential it s an honor he had only hoped to achieve one day to win the actual award meant a lot it was really great going up on stage and accepting the award but i think it means more to me that someone thought highly enough of me and the work we ve been doing to nominate me for the award gross said it means we really are making a name for ourselves from nothing in august 2021 buckeye creek angus hosted the national cattleman s beef association and the oca for a filming of an episode of the show chef s roll the organization chef s roll inc partnered with ncba to produce videos highlighting the pasture to plate relationship between cattle farmers and chefs each episode brought chefs to the farm and then the farmer to the restaurant it was a big opportunity for us to host that here gross said we had chef rocco whalen from cleveland come to the farm whalen is a chef and owner of multiple restaurant concepts but is best known for his restaurant fahrenheit we showed him around the farm and talked to him about what we do here and then the next day we got to go eat at the restaurant and film and take pictures there too gross said one topic discussed at length on the show was sustainable beef practices sustainability to me is doing more with what we have we can t make more of the farm we have here so taking care of the land and the soil and not taking too much from it is important gross said rotating pastures has been really big for us we have a handful of pastures now that we ve acquired and we ve really seen a big difference in the grass growth since implementing the rotations gross said gross has also started to inter seed red clover in his pastures the legume not only benefits the soil but also improved calves weaning weights genetics play a big role into gross sustainability practices as well we don t want cattle that will require two times the amount of feed to get the same amount of product the focus is definitely on more productive cattle gross said protecting waterways and proper manure management are integral environmental practices on the farm too gross also recently got a bale wrapper and some newer equipment which has positively impacted hay palatability and body conditions of his cattle short term goals for us are to keep getting better at grass and manure management we would love to expand in the future but we don t want to get too far ahead of ourselves gross said to buckeye creek angus it s about doing things right the actions we take now are laying the ground work for the future getting the genetics dialed in getting our facilities and pastures all figured out is important so when my kids are older if they decide to pursue cattle production they ll have this option gross said as the first generation every year offers new lessons but gross looks forward to what the future holds for buckeye creek angus and for his family s involvement in the beef industry

operations and projects located in peru and brazil commenting on the mrmr update ignacio rosado ceo of nexa resources said our mineral exploration program in 2021 was still limited by the covid 19 protocols and consequently affected our ability to replace mineral reserves nevertheless our exploration program was focused on identifying new ore bodies in our operating mines and aripuanã we achieved positive results with the prospective of adding new mineral resources in the medium term potentially extending our life of mine as a major polymetallic and the 5th largest zinc producer worldwide nexa has a unique portfolio of operating mines with excellent exploration potential and a pipeline of greenfield exploration projects in 2022 our mineral exploration program will remain focused on the replacement of mineral reserves and upgrading mineral resources through infill drilling campaigns 2021 year end mineral reserves and mineral resources highlights mineral reserves note addition refers to new tonnages from brownfield and infill drilling and revision refers to changes in mineral reserves due to changes in mine design changes in economic parameters leading to a model review and update reserve numbers refer to zinc mines and projects zn equivalent kt for 2020 was updated using 2021 average metal prices as of december 31 2021 proven and probable mineral reserves estimates amounted to 97 0 million tonnes containing 5 146kt of zinc equivalent1 compared with 106 1 million tonnes containing 5 584kt of zinc equivalent as of december 31 2020 the decrease was the result of mining production depletion nexa s 2021 year end mineral reserves estimate also reflects changes in continuous refining of its geological modelling the depletion of 515kt zinc equivalent was partially replaced by the addition of 43kt zinc equivalent mainly as a result of drilling at el porvenir in 2021 nexa s exploration program was still limited by covid 19 health and safety protocols the net revision of 39kt zinc equivalent was primarily due to infill drilling increase in metal prices and cut off value reduction at el porvenir 111kt and infill drilling and model update at vazante

the el porvenir mine the revision reduced net 387kt of contained zinc equivalent mainly from vazante 188kt and aripuanã 202kt due to pillars and geotechnical revision at vazante and stope design and pillars revision at aripuanã at the 2021 year end nexa estimated inferred mineral resources of 10 095kt of contained zinc equivalent which is an increase from the total of 9 735kt at the end of 2020 the addition of 247kt of contained zinc equivalent was incorporated through exploration drilling model revisions improvements and mine design revisions accounted for an increase of 113kt of contained zinc equivalent notable additions from exploration drilling to inferred mineral resources included 160kt from vazante brownfield 59kt from cerro lindo infill drilling and geological interpretation revision accounted for 97kt of contained zinc equivalent from vazante 64kt of contained zinc equivalent from el porvenir and 11kt of contained zinc equivalent from aripuanã geological revision at

equivalent calculation exploration outlook nexa s exploration strategy for 2022 will remain focused on mineral resource expansion through brownfield and infill drilling near operating mines and extension drilling on advanced projects geographically we expect mineral exploration program to be approximately 40 in brazil 52 in peru and the remainder in other geographies our 2022 drilling program on brownfield projects aims to extend known ore bodies as well as investigate new mineralized zones in satellite targets at cerro lindo we plan to drill a total of 39 000 meters including detailing drilling at the pucasalla target and extension drilling on other targets at el porvenir we plan to drill 19 000 meters on satellite targets at vazante we plan to drill 7 000 meters to test the extensions of the known orebody in terms of our greenfield projects we will continue with our ongoing efforts to add resources and consolidate our pipeline at hilarión we plan to drill 5 500 meters on satellite targets at aripuanã the strategy is to drill 9 000 meters at babaçu including extension and infill drilling and 25 000 meters of infill drilling at the ambrex and link orebodies for mineral resources expansion and reclassification at bonsucesso we plan to drill 8 800 meters of extension and infill drilling for mineral resource expansion in namibia we plan to drill 10 000 meters to continue to investigate copper mineralization along the deblin trend we seek to preserve our investments in projects around the mines we already operate to fulfill our objective of prolonging their life of mine and invest in greenfield projects with the objective of developing new projects to achieve our growth strategy nexa did not engage in exploration activities in 2021 at

before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate or ebitdare adjusted ebitdare excluding noncontrolling interest as defined below hotel adjusted ebitdare and hotel adjusted ebitdare margin these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap in addition our calculation of these measures may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly the same as the company these non gaap measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap they should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss cash flow from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap these non gaap financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure we strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure we present ebitdare in accordance with guidelines established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as defined in its september 2017 white paper earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate we believe ebitdare is a useful performance measure to help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period in comparison to our peers nareit defines ebitdare as net income calculated in accordance with gaap plus interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change in control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in the value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity s share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates we make additional adjustments to ebitdare when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitdare excluding noncontrolling interest when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance in addition we use both ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare excluding noncontrolling interest as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions we adjust ebitdare for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitdare excluding noncontrolling interest

santa ana calif the ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products in santa ana is finalized and is expected to go into effect next month after the city council voted unanimously for the ban on march 15 the ban applies to flavored tobacco products including e cigarettes vapes hookah cigars and pipe tobacco the council s decision followed a series of discussions regarding the ban of the flavored products that tend to fall into the hands of youth we re here to protect the public and we need to ensure that we enforce this ordinance sooner rather than later councilwoman nelida mendoza said during the council meeting the seven city council members contemplated the issue of many small business owners in the area having to dispose of their supplies if they do not sell them before the enforcement date on april 14 councilwoman thai viet phan argued that april 14 is not enough time for business owners to sell off their flavored tobacco products she further proposed the council grant a six month period to allow retailers to sell bulk products outside of the city to other retailers mendoza urged the council to move forward and vote on a ban but suggested a three month period for businesses to rid of their products rather than six however councilman phil bacerra argued against the proposed change to the ordinance stating the council would be taking a step backward from its original agreement to move forward with the ban either we re gonna ban it or we re not he said this council voted to ban it and now we re backpedaling it s very disappointing meanwhile mayor vicente sarmiento further argued that retailers had enough time to consider selling out the rest of their stock since conversations of a potential ban circulated among the council at the end of 2021 there s been a sufficient notice sarmiento said i feel comfortable that there has been sufficient time as a good businessperson you navigate these changes the ordinance will enforce weekly business compliance checks to ensure that flavored tobacco products are not being sold businesses that continue to sell the illicit products past the enforcement date are at risk of losing their retail licenses

allkindza e via getty images europeâ s energy shortages and high energy prices here have made clear the importance of affordable reliable as well as environmentally friendly energy supplies thus exelonâ s exc spinoff of its exelon generation nuclear plants and other generating assets into the standalone and unregulated constellation energy corporation nasdaq ceg provides an opportunity to

constellation expects additional transaction costs of 150 million in 2022 and 60 million in 2023 emphasis added â on february 21 2021 exelonâ s board of directors approved a plan to separate its competitive generation and customer facing businesses into a stand alone publicly traded company the separation exelon completed the separation on february 1 2022 in order to govern the ongoing relationships between us and exelon after the separation and to facilitate an orderly transition we and exelon have entered into several agreements including a separation agreement tax matters agreement a transition services agreement and an employee matters agreement and other ancillary agreements â in connection with the separation we incurred transaction costs of 49 million for the year ended december 31 2021 which are recorded in operating and maintenance expense we expect to incur incremental transaction costs of approximately 150 million and 60 million in 2022 and 2023 respectively the transaction costs are primarily comprised of system related costs third party costs paid to advisors consultants lawyers and other experts assisting in the separation â other financial and stock highlights with constellationâ s march 16 2022 closing stock price of 51 77 share its market capitalization is 16 9 billion given a two month price range of 38 00 56 57 share the closing price is 92 of the high the companyâ s one year average analyst target price is 57 25 share putting its closing price at 90 of that level the average of analysts 2022 and 2023 earnings per share estimates are 2 60 and 3 55 respectively for forward price earnings ratios of 19 9 and 14 6 data by ycharts trailing twelve monthsâ operating cash flow was 1 34 billion trailing twelve monthsâ levered free cash flow was 1 95 billion at dec 31 2021 the company had 36 5 billion in liabilities including 8 0 billion of long term debt and 48 1 billion in assets giving constellation a steep liability to asset ratio of 76 the announced dividend of 0 56 share yields 1 1 institutional ownership of constellation is 81 3 the six largest institutional owners are vanguard wellington blackrock capital international investors state street and fmr fidelity some of these represent index fund investments that match the overall market notes on valuation with an enterprise value ev of 23 3 billion constellationâ s ev ebitda ratio is 6 1 well below the preferred maximum of 10 or less and so in bargain territory positive and negative risks the biggest risk for constellation is its lack of stand alone operating history for investors it is the companyâ s lack of financial history although note it has provided quite comprehensive information through its 10 k and its investor day presentations investors should consider their inflation and clean electricity demand growth as well as total electricity demand growth as the factors most likely to affect constellation particularly the current level of inflation is at a decades high at 7 9 and is expected to stay at or above this level for some time political and regulatory risk is actually a positive risk for constellation as state and federal governments have increasingly urged utilities to use clean nuclear plus renewables generation of electricity and constellation is the biggest nuclear electricity provider recommendations for constellation energy i donâ t recommend constellation energy to dividend hunting investors based on its operating history its position as the largest provider of nuclear power aka â largest us clean energy companyâ to a country that wants increasing amounts of non hydrocarbon sourced electricity its projected price earnings ratio and growth prospects its dividend and ebitda increases and the advantages it will gain as a standalone company i recommend constellation to esg and growth seeking investors including growth oriented utility investors

a man walks past the us federal reserve in washington dc on march 16 2022 it can be seen that this round of inflation in the united states is driven by multiple factors although it has similarities with previous rounds of inflation the differences are obvious in addition to the traditional factors currency over issue the impact of the epidemic and the geopolitical situation have all added more variables to the current round of inflation in the us these factors have exacerbated the demand driven inflation triggered by the joe biden administration s aggressive fiscal stimulus plans and the cost driven inflation due to rising labor costs and low labor participation rates under the epidemic the more important factor is the high inflation caused by the over issuance of the us currency after the federal reserve quickly lowered the federal benchmark interest rate to zero in order to save the market two years ago it quickly launched an unlimited quantitative easing monetary policy so far the fed s balance sheet has hit a record high of more than 8 trillion nearly 10 times what it was in 2008 however the over issuance of money in the real economy cannot be absorbed so it can only flood the market and push up prices the inflow into the stock market and the housing market also pushes up stock prices and house prices fiscal stimulus implemented by the us government has boosted inflation from the demand side as a result the us federal debt hit a record high of 30 trillion and its debt ratio jumped from 79 2 percent before the pandemic to more than 100 percent fiscal stimulus is invariably transformed to financial support or subsidies to households businesses local governments hospitals and the like however it is difficult for the economy to recover in the context of the intensified epidemic in the us and the influx of these funds into the realty market is pushing up house prices and the prices of commodities the combination of these factors has left the us facing inflation stoked by both rising costs and demand under the impacts of the pandemic the labor participation rate in the us has dropped sharply leading to an increase in employment costs which in turn has squeezed corporate profits and further inhibited investment thus creating a negative cycle therefore it may be difficult to control inflation simply by raising interest rates by a large margin in a short time 21st century business herald

living costs keep soaring is putting off retirement the answer it s no secret that living costs have been soaring since the latter part of 2021 but over the past few months americans have really been feeling the crunch and a recent uptick in gas prices is only making matters exponentially worse consumers are feeling so squeezed by inflation that many are putting off milestones in light of it for 13 of older americans that includes delaying retirement according to a new survey by the nationwide retirement institute if you re nearing retirement age you may be wondering whether it pays to postpone that stage of life and keep working here are a few things you should ask yourself to make that call 1 am i happy with my savings it may be that you ve saved nicely for retirement but your portfolio has taken a hit due to recent stock market volatility or it may be that you shifted toward safer investments in your ira or 401 k plan and aren t seeing many losses from recent stock market events but your total savings balance still leaves you questioning whether your nest egg will suffice either way if you think your savings could use some work then it pays to put off retirement especially at a time when living costs are so high if you retire soon you might really drain your nest egg and land in a scenario where you re facing years of financial woes 2 can i still grow my social security benefits the earliest age you can sign up for social security is 62 albeit at a reduced benefit you re entitled to your full monthly benefit based on your personal earnings history once you reach full retirement age or fra fra is 66 67 or somewhere in between depending on when you were born you can also delay your filing past fra and grow your benefits in the process for each year you hold off until age 70 your benefits increase 8 if you re already 70 or nearing that age your social security benefits won t have much or any room for growth but if you re a few years away from 70 delaying retirement could make it possible to snag a higher monthly social security benefit for life one that could go a long way toward helping you keep up with higher living costs 3 am i unhappy at work if you detest your job and it causes you a lot of stress then you may be eager to leave the workforce on schedule but if you don t mind working or you get enjoyment from what you do then you might consider delaying your retirement especially given the way living costs have risen holding off on retirement doesn t just give you a chance to pad your savings and grow your social security benefits it also makes it possible to leave your existing savings alone for longer unfortunately we could be in for many more months of rampant inflation if you re contemplating postponing retirement because of that you re in good company so take the time to think things through before making your choice

risk of imminent russian debt default appears to ebb russian officials said they had made interest payments on government debt diminishing the imminent risk of a default new york the possibility of an imminent russian debt default appeared to diminish thursday following statements from moscow and news of a payment to jpmorgan chase however a ratings agency warned of a continued risk of nonpayment the russian government faced a march 16 deadline to pay 117 million in interest on two dollar denominated bonds an obligation that looked vulnerable following a wave of western sanctions imposed following russia s invasion of ukraine the finance ministry said in a statement that a payment order worth 117 2 million was executed after it was sent to a bank monday jpmorgan received a payment from the central bank of russia which the bank processed after checking with us authorities a person familiar with the matter told afp jpmorgan a corresponding or intermediary bank then sent the funds to citigroup the agent in charge of paying bond holders said the person who did not specify the amount received citigroup and jpmorgan each declined afp s requests for comment however s p global ratings later on thursday downgraded russia s debt rating from ccc to cc saying it is our understanding that investors did not receive the coupon payment due wednesday owing to technical difficulties related to international sanctions at this point we consider that russia s debt is highly vulnerable to nonpayment the ratings agency said adding that its outlook for the country was negative russia was at risk of its first foreign debt default in more than a century though there is a 30 day grace period to provide the funds to creditors western sanctions have crippled the russian banking sector and financial system and precipitated a collapse of the ruble the penalties include efforts to freeze 300 billion of russia s foreign currency reserves held abroad a payment in rubles would constitute a default according to fitch ratings which warned last week that the possibility was imminent the us treasury confirmed that exemptions allowed under the sanctions imposed by washington include interest payments on government bonds issued before march 1 russia last defaulted on foreign currency held debt in 1918 when bolshevik revolution leader vladimir lenin refused to recognise the debts of the deposed tsar s regime the government missed payments on domestic ruble denominated debt in 1998 amid a financial crisis but moscow financial conditions improved dramatically since then thanks to some 600 billion in reserves stockpiled largely from oil and natural gas sales russia said thursday the debt payment was made in a foreign currency without specifying which the finance ministry added that it will provide additional information on the crediting of the funds russia previously said it had asked an american bank to process the payments kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said russia has all the necessary means to avoid a default any default that could arise would be purely artificial in nature peskov told reporters moscow s next debt payment of 66 million is due on march 21 according to a jpmorgan analyst report this month that payment can be made in several currencies including rubles

live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers the extraordinary events of the last two years make it easy to forget that the housing market was sizzling before the coronavirus ever made landfall the millennials america s largest living generation were nearing the apex of their prime homebuying years in 2019 a lumber shortage was making building materials expensive and hard to come by interest rates were low and new construction had been insufficient for years the u s real estate market was flying high pre covid said chuck vander stelt real estate agent and founder of quadwalls the arrival of the pandemic engaged the afterburners home prices soared by nearly 19 in 2021 the fastest growth in history and so far in 2022 the sky is still the limit here s a look back at how things got to where they are today and how the pandemic played a role every step of the way first came the urban exodus panic america s first coronavirus death was recorded in seattle on the last day of february 2020 according to the new yorker hotspots soon emerged in new york and other international urban centers suddenly city living was nothing to aspire to and the real estate market braced for a mass migration out of the country s most densely populated metros tomas satas founder and ceo of windy city homebuyer experienced firsthand how the panic in the industry didn t always line up with the realities on the ground the overall doomsday moving trend in chicago during the pandemic was quite overblown from what i have seen satas said chicago is mostly the same place it was before as the light at the end of the pandemic grows brighter the population of the chicago metro area increased in 2020 and so far this year while the city itself saw yet another minimal decrease the original shutdowns sparked one of history s hottest markets today s record high home prices cannot be traced to any one factor but the original shutdowns right at the start of the 2020 spring buying season were the catalyst that set the spark for the wild two years that would follow the initial stay at home order caused most people to halt their house hunting process causing a drastic dip in home sales said kenneth reed a real estate investor at better home buyers the selling process also stopped adding on the stoppage of new home construction there was a significant drop in home supplies all of these led to the prices of homes currently on the market skyrocketing remote work let people pick their places and cash became king when america s offices closed housing prices rose even higher as a crush of new telecommuters now had the freedom to abandon their pricey metros much has been written about that but what s less known is how the moment facilitated a shift to a cash market and that dynamic still remains in play today some new markets have seen a recent influx of cash offers driven by remote workers relocating from expensive cities like new york and san francisco to relatively affordable metros said vanessa famulener president of homelight homes a majority 58 of real estate agents expect the cash offers to grow in popularity beyond the 2021 housing market craze as sellers now have greater expectations for convenience speed and certainty record low interest rates cut both ways policymakers slashed interest rates to encourage borrowing and jumpstart the covid 19 economy in january 2021 the rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage hit 2 65 the lowest in history that of course flooded an already tight market with new buyers but it also might have prevented new inventory from ever getting listed the new rates had a lot of sellers taking advantage and refinancing their homes said bill samuel of blue ladder development we know for certain that many sellers never came back to the market to sell as the number of homes for sale is still very low i believe the new record low interest rates incentivized many homeowners to hang onto their homes versus sell them vaccine rollouts let real estate pros get back to work for real the arrival of safe and effective vaccines at the tail end of 2020 brought relief that the country and the world had been dreaming of for months but few people were happier than america s real estate professionals the rollout of vaccines allowed us more flexibility with showings said jorge sariego founder and ceo of boston one realty we went from handling a lot of showings virtually and closing deals by waving at a screen in rare cases we held select 1 1 tours without a congratulatory handshake or hug with a long standing client vaccines provided peace of mind as we continued to enforce health protocols and precautions with smaller crowds more from gobankingrates

as companies grapple with the highest inflation in 40 years consumers are feeling the impacts financially prices on everything from gasoline to groceries continue to soar as inflation climbed up to 7 9 in february on thursday the national average for a gallon of gas was 4 28 according to aaa related billionaire supermarket ceo buy now food inflation will only get much worse but if you haven t seen a price increase on a product or service you purchased recently chances are that the company may still be passing along the rising costs to you without the obvious price hikes how the answer is shrinkflation what is shrinkflation while shrinkflation is a catchy phrase a mash up of the words shrink and inflation it actually isn t a new term when raw materials cost producers more they sometimes react not by raising prices but by charging the same price for a package that contains a bit less according to merriam webster dictionary if you ever bought a candy bar or a bag of chips that seemed somehow smaller than you remembered but that still cost the same it s not an illusion it s shrinkflation a person shops for groceries at lincoln market on march 10 2022 in the prospect lefferts garden neighborhood of brooklyn borough in new york city the labor department reported that consumer inflation rose 7 9 over the past year the largest rise si expand while consumers are aware of the price of goods they may be less aware of a small change in the size or volume of the product rather than raise the price directly some manufacturers choose to make the product a little smaller and charge the same price it is a sneaky way to pass on a back door price increase that most shoppers will not notice said edgar dworsky a consumer expert with consumerworld org shrinkflation affects size volume of products this means companies are downsizing products in order to meet the demands of inflation without directly affecting your wallet it s a kind of downsizing that bucks the decades old trend of supersizing and you can see its effects in almost every aisle of the grocery store merriam webster noted dworsky said downsizing has been around since the days when candy bars cost a nickel while the trend comes in waves he said it s more prevalent during times of high inflation putting fewer sheets on your toilet paper or paper towel roll making orange juice containers hold less putting fewer cookies or potato chips in the package taking an ounce out of each box of cereal these are ways that manufacturers are costing you more dworksy continued this means you have to buy the product more often because it will run out faster putting a strain on the consumer s wallet without possibly even realizing it shrinkflation might sneak by shoppers but the tactic has become increasingly noticeable to consumers in a new subreddit on shrinkflation people have been chiming in and documenting their shrinking groceries credit consumerworld org mouseprint org one user on reddit wrote this pack of chicken strips lost 0 31kg since the last time i bought them another user shared a photo of their celery bag writing these celery stalks used to fill the bag and this one is literally half the bag in march alone dworsky documented the changes in size and volume in multiple products including cottonelle 284 2 ply sheets to just 268 sun maid raisins chobani yogurt dove body wash and safeguard soap credit consumerworld org mouseprint org over the past 60 years dworsky revealed charmin toilet paper reportedly went from 650 single ply sheets on a roll to the equivalent of 90 less assuming you could even find single rolls any longer his latest change showed ultra soft mega rolls going from 264 double ply sheets per roll to 244 and super mega rolls went from 396 sheets to 366 fox reached out to charmin for comment are doritos linked to shrinkflation doritos have been making headlines recently for being associated with shrinkflation last year dworsky noted the downsizing of the popular chip brand s volume eight years ago we brought you news that doritos had downsized its 11 3 4 ounce bags to just 11 ounces well we must have missed some additional changes to

as companies grapple with the highest inflation in 40 years consumers are feeling the impacts financially prices on everything from gasoline to groceries continue to soar as inflation climbed up to 7 9 in february on thursday the national average for a gallon of gas was 4 28 according to aaa related billionaire supermarket ceo buy now food inflation will only get much worse but if you haven t seen a price increase on a product or service you purchased recently chances are that the company may still be passing along the rising costs to you without the obvious price hikes how the answer is shrinkflation what is shrinkflation while shrinkflation is a catchy phrase a mash up of the words shrink and inflation it actually isn t a new term when raw materials cost producers more they sometimes react not by raising prices but by charging the same price for a package that contains a bit less according to merriam webster dictionary if you ever bought a candy bar or a bag of chips that seemed somehow smaller than you remembered but that still cost the same it s not an illusion it s shrinkflation a person shops for groceries at lincoln market on march 10 2022 in the prospect lefferts garden neighborhood of brooklyn borough in new york city the labor department reported that consumer inflation rose 7 9 over the past year the largest rise si expand while consumers are aware of the price of goods they may be less aware of a small change in the size or volume of the product rather than raise the price directly some manufacturers choose to make the product a little smaller and charge the same price it is a sneaky way to pass on a back door price increase that most shoppers will not notice said edgar dworsky a consumer expert with consumerworld org shrinkflation affects size volume of products this means companies are downsizing products in order to meet the demands of inflation without directly affecting your wallet it s a kind of downsizing that bucks the decades old trend of supersizing and you can see its effects in almost every aisle of the grocery store merriam webster noted dworsky said downsizing has been around since the days when candy bars cost a nickel while the trend comes in waves he said it s more prevalent during times of high inflation putting fewer sheets on your toilet paper or paper towel roll making orange juice containers hold less putting fewer cookies or potato chips in the package taking an ounce out of each box of cereal these are ways that manufacturers are costing you more dworksy continued this means you have to buy the product more often because it will run out faster putting a strain on the consumer s wallet without possibly even realizing it shrinkflation might sneak by shoppers but the tactic has become increasingly noticeable to consumers in a new subreddit on shrinkflation people have been chiming in and documenting their shrinking groceries credit consumerworld org mouseprint org one user on reddit wrote this pack of chicken strips lost 0 31kg since the last time i bought them another user shared a photo of their celery bag writing these celery stalks used to fill the bag and this one is literally half the bag in march alone dworsky documented the changes in size and volume in multiple products including cottonelle 284 2 ply sheets to just 268 sun maid raisins chobani yogurt dove body wash and safeguard soap credit consumerworld org mouseprint org over the past 60 years dworsky revealed charmin toilet paper reportedly went from 650 single ply sheets on a roll to the equivalent of 90 less assuming you could even find single rolls any longer his latest change showed ultra soft mega rolls going from 264 double ply sheets per roll to 244 and super mega rolls went from 396 sheets to 366 fox reached out to charmin for comment are doritos linked to shrinkflation doritos have been making headlines recently for being associated with shrinkflation last year dworsky noted the downsizing of the popular chip brand s volume eight years ago we brought you news that doritos had downsized its 11 3 4 ounce bags to just 11 ounces well we must have missed some additional changes to

on tuesday 360 digitech inc refuted allegations that it violated anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws according to tuesday s motion to dismiss the complaint improperly seeks to hold the company and its leaders accountable for failing to predict that its existing data privacy practices previously lauded by chinese regulators during the class period would later be deemed non compliant with new regulations the filing explains that the defendant is a leading chinese financial technology platform that connects individual borrowers with financial institutions primarily through its core product the 360 jietiao mobile application as previously reported a shareholder took issue with alleged misrepresentations made by the company in the summer of 2021 purportedly misstating the company s compliance with chinese privacy law the company s value on an american stock exchange reportedly dove more than 21 after chinese regulators said that 360 jietiao was collecting users personal data without their consent and temporarily removed it from app stores this week s motion comes two months after the shareholder plaintiff filed his amended complaint before delving into the substance of their arguments the defendants explained the chinese regulatory backdrop against which the case is set and the challenge of complying with ambiguous laws and fast changing goal posts digitech then made three arguments as to why the southern district of new york court should dismiss the lead plaintiff s case first the defendants contended that the plaintiff states no actionable misrepresentation or omission digitech defended that it disclosed the regulatory risks affecting its business including that it could be subject to adverse regulatory action if its existing measures were deemed non compliant with new data privacy regulations the company added that the plaintiff pleaded no allegations that it violated any then existing regulations during the apr 30 2020 to july 8 2021 class period second the defendants said that the plaintiffs fell short of pleading the requisite intent or scienter pointing to a lack of particularized facts that any defendant knew their statements were false when made its inability to plead motive leaves the plaintiff with threadbare allegations that courts routinely reject digitech argued lastly digitech contended that the plaintiff does not sufficiently plead loss causation because he did not prove that the drop in stock price was attributable to its alleged misrepresentations plaintiff s failure to plead any facts to disaggregate his alleged losses from an industry wide event triggering stock drops among numerous chinese companies is fatal to his claim the motion said labaton sucharow llp is lead counsel for the plaintiff and proposed class and skadden arps slate meagher flom llp represents digitech

ark remains down 35 per cent since the start of the year and 45 per cent over the past six months and the rally in tech stocks on the nasdaq in recent days is hardly reason to declare a revival in tech stocks but it is notable that a growing chorus of voices are emerging arguing tech stocks are starting to look oversold and the pain of the past six months may be almost done on thursday night jp morgan s bullish investment strategist marko kolanovic declared that too much negativity had been priced into stock prices and it was time to start adding risk while the commodity supercycle will persist in our view the correction in bubble sectors is now likely finished and geopolitical risk will likely start abating in a few weeks time while a comprehensive resolution may take a few months he said markets may anticipate these turning points sooner and we think it is time to start adding risk in many areas that overshot on the downside kolanovic has been telling clients to buy the dips for some time but what was notable was his advice to dive into the most beaten down stuff out there advertisement there are great opportunities in high beta beaten down segments that now include innovation tech biotech emerging markets e g china as well as more broadly in smaller capitalisation and more volatile stocks these segments are already pricing in a severe global recession which will not materialise in our view though it is not possible to rule out a recession in europe and further slowdown in the us from the time when we called the bubble these segments are down 60 per cent to 80 per cent which we think is the end of the correction and in some areas represents a liquidity driven overshoot in fact many of these market segments trade at all time valuation lows including previous recessions and periods of much higher interest rates in a world where the bombs are still falling in ukraine and the fed is just getting started on what looks likely to be a year long cycle of rising interest rates it would take a certain amount of bravery to embrace the sort of high tech long duration plays that wood favours volatility is guaranteed and the highest risk plays will be hit hardest every time advertisement still there are signs that a trickle back to tech stocks is under way bank of america s fund manager survey this week showed a sharp move away from banks and into tech total allocation to tech stocks rose 14 basis points in march to a net overweight of 5 per cent the largest overweight since december wedbush tech guru dan ives suggests a less risky approach than kolanovic he started the week by urging investors to look through the fog of macro issues and focus on the tech sector s underlying fundamentals arguing trends like cybersecurity and digitisation have a long way to run with only 44 per cent of workloads on the cloud today poised to hit 70 per cent by 2025 this fourth industrial revolution is not slowing down when the fed ripped the band aid off for the world to see by raising rates ives conviction only increased despite the fact rate rises are inherently bad for high valuation stocks advertisement in a nutshell we believe the tech sector is as oversold as we have seen in the last five years he declared while there could be major volatility we believe the tech bottom is now likely in for the year but ives says investors must be selective dodging the companies that benefited from covid 19 related demand and focusing on stalwart names such as microsoft oracle adobe salesforce and his top pick apple we view apple as both a rock of gibraltar defensive tech name as well as the best 5g tech play in the market with a massive product cycle that is gaining more steam along with its valuable services business which is being undervalued by the street ives has apple hitting us200 a share implying a gain of 25 per cent from its current price

in short the background demand for esg aligned companies and investment products are likely to continue to accelerate transformation of the investing landscape in 2022 the issues although investor demand for esg related transactions continues to grow these opportunities along with the markets and regulators focus on esg related issues can create significant legal uncertainty and risk for financial institutions the conflict in ukraine has only further complicated these considerations although the direction and scope of its impact on esg considerations is very much an open question looking ahead the prominence of esg related issues in both the financial markets and the public discourse will present opportunities but also create significant risks for financial institutions in 2022 which may be magnified in light of the current broader geopolitical context esg considerations will continue to play an ever increasing role in financial markets in 2022 esg related transactions will continue to present significant opportunities for financial institutions as they respond to and support the needs of the market however these opportunities along with the markets and regulators focus on other esg related issues can create significant risk esg focused concerns for financial institutions generally arise in two broad contexts i disclosure related risks and ii conduct related risks this commentary updates our prior observations concerning potential litigation and regulatory risks for financial institutions including risks posed by governmental and private actors we will provide additional updates including as the impacts of the conflict in ukraine continue to take shape increased engagement from regulators last year saw frequent engagement by financial regulators focused on esg issues including following president biden s may 2021 executive order directing multiple federal agencies to assess climate finance risks the executive order singled out financial institutions noting the failure of financial institutions to appropriately and adequately account for and measure threatens the competitiveness of u s companies and markets and the ability of u s financial institutions to serve communities this trend likely will continue in 2022 with regulators led in some respects most visibly by the sec poised to enact new reporting requirements focused on climate risk and other esg themes sec chair gary gensler has made clear that a new climate risk disclosure rule likely is forthcoming reports indicate that a proposed rule could be issued as early as march 21 2022 and we will provide further updates as appropriate in the coming days in the meantime the climate and esg task force created by the sec in 2021 continues its work on esg related enforcement initiatives which can proceed even in the absence of any new formal rulemaking process these developments are of particular significance to financial institutions both in connection with their preparation of disclosures concerning their own corporate activities as well as any disclosures they may be required to make concerning lending or investing activity other financial regulators are similarly expected to place greater emphasis and focus on climate change and broader esg issues in the coming months and in november 2021 the acting comptroller of the currency urged large bank boards to consider five climate change related questions to help put into motion the concrete steps that banks need to prudently manage climate risk the consumer financial protection bureau has also announced that it will take action focused on racial equity suggesting that it could even look beyond fair lending violations in charging unlawful discrimination market participants await further announcements from the department of labor regarding the october 2021 proposals regarding the extent to which investment manager fiduciaries may consider sustainability factors when assessing investment opportunities although it remains to be seen what the ultimate regulatory framework and reporting requirements for financial institutions will look like and how they will operate in practice the question of regulatory reporting and disclosures on esg alignment is no longer one of if as opposed to when and how increased engagement by ngos financial institutions esg alignment and mitigation of related risks will also likely continue to be a major focal point for non governmental organizations ngos and other private stakeholders including in light of the broader geopolitical context involving the conflict in ukraine and the increased focus on world energy markets financial institutions must balance pressure from ngos to reduce financing activities of so called fossil fuel companies with the practical reality that such companies outside of russia will need increased financing to meet the global demand for energy in 2021 numerous ngos scrutinized companies net zero commitments and other climate related statements both inside and outside of the courtroom and that trend is expected to continue in december 2021 for instance the sierra club and center for american progress jointly issued a report noting that the u s financial sector has not yet responded in a manner that suggests an understanding of either the scale of the crisis or the sector s role in causing it that report is just one of several issued in 2021 that critically examine the role financial institutions can and should play in climate change and these efforts are attracting the attention of lawmakers for example representative katie porter ca teaming up with stop the money pipeline a coalition of environmental groups targeting asset managers and banks with net zero pledges asserted that banks have bankrolled the climate crisis and they continue to do it today ngos are also actively considering litigation theories or other public pressure tactics against multinational companies in connection with the conflict in ukraine for example the french affiliates of friends of the earth and greenpeace are reported to have sent a letter to a major french energy company requesting it to end business activities connected to the russian energy market that may contribute to the commission of serious violations of human rights it is likely that financial institutions and large multinational organizations will continue to be a primary target of ngos and other activist organizations pursuing traditional litigation proceedings and less traditional dispute resolution mechanisms to advance their agendas the majority of this litigation activity has thus far proceeded outside of the united states with ngos and other organizations pursuing companies and financial institutions that they believe are not sufficiently aligned with esg objectives in 2021 for example five ngos brought a complaint to the sec alleging misstatements by the japan international cooperation agency regarding coal free bonds the proceeds of which allegedly could flow to coal fired power stations in bangladesh more may be on the way indeed the lead lawyer for milieudefensie the dutch wing of the environmental organization friends of the earth which obtained a ruling against shell in the netherlands requiring emissions reductions by 2030 the ruling is on appeal recently stated i think that the next step is to start also litigating against financial institutions who make these emissions and fossil fuel projects possible the materiality debate continues one area that should continue to receive attention is the ongoing debate surrounding what types of esg information are actually material to investment decisions in securities litigation where large financial institutions are likely to remain attractive targets in light of the scope of their operations and perceived deep pockets liability can turn on the specificity and materiality of the alleged misstatement typically if a statement is deemed vague or aspirational then courts have found that it cannot have been material to a reasonable investor and is therefore not actionable on the other hand if the statement is concrete enough and would alter the total mix of information that an investor would consider in making an investment decision then it can potentially support a claim for securities fraud notably on june 21 2021 the u s supreme court issued its decision in goldman sachs v arkansas teacher retirement system holding that at the class certification stage a court may consider whether a company s alleged misstatements were too generic to have impacted its stock price in advance of the ruling amicus briefs filed in support of the plaintiff investors argued that generic statements regarding esg may be material to investment decisions because investors now incorporate information about a company s esg performance into their decision making as more companies tout their esg commitments in public disclosures and as more investors claim to consider such factors when making investment decisions legal arguments around materiality of these statements should be monitored the debate over who should police esg from environmental issues to human trafficking a financial institution s role as a financer investor or financial intermediary for a transaction that has esg related goals can create the risk of an expectation that a financial institution is responsible for policing those goals even if that expectation is unreasonable unwarranted or unsupported by the transaction documents private citizens already have brought claims against banks as financers of third party projects with negative environmental consequences a group of residents of flint michigan for example sued the underwriters of a municipal water development bond offering alleging that they knew that the project would cause water contamination in violation of an asserted duty of care owed by the banks to those affected private financial institutions face growing scrutiny in connection with their financing activities in collaboration with international development banks at least one plaintiffs lawyer has suggested that banks are a potential target for claims asserting that they have ignored human trafficking related violations by their customers and derived benefits from facilitating illicit conduct by these customers similar claims may also give rise to follow on shareholder class action cases in the united states and abroad asserting violations of securities laws and or shareholder derivative claims as described above ngos have already emerged as a formidable constituency seeking to use litigation as a tool to move financial institutions toward a role in policing esg politicization of esg backlash and the catch 22 for financial institutions we also continue to monitor efforts by some parties to challenge existing and proposed esg related government action and the partisan nature of these issues some state attorneys general may be poised to challenge through litigation various efforts contemplated at the federal level to advance climate and other esg initiatives and some have committed to doing so for example west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey sent a letter to the sec in 2021 describing potential new regulations requiring esg related disclosures as unconstitutional similarly in may 2021 the west virginia treasurer on behalf of the treasurers of 15 states wrote to federal climate envoy john kerry to express concern that the biden administration is reportedly pressuring u s banks and financial intuitions to refuse to lend to or invest in fossil fuel companies separately in a recent op ed published in the wall street journal arizona attorney general mark brnovich who is a candidate in the republican primary for arizona s u s senate election to be held this november argued that coordinated efforts to divest from conventional energy resources may amount to an antitrust violation that he and other state attorneys general might pursue in 2021 texas took the lead by enacting two laws targeting financial institutions and other companies that were perceived to economically boycott oil and gas businesses one of the new texas laws prohibits state pension fund investment in companies deemed by the state comptroller to be boycotting oil and gas companies other resource rich states have passed or are considering similar legislation texas has subsequently required financial institutions to submit anti boycott certifications as prerequisites to engage in underwriting of municipal debt offerings in west virginia the state legislature recently passed a bill expected to be signed into law by the governor that would allow the state treasurer to refuse to enter into or remain in banking contracts with financial institutions that take any action intended to penalize inflict economic harm on or limit commercial relations with a company because the company engages in fossil fuel based energy activity in kentucky legislation that would require the state treasurer to maintain a list of financial companies engaged in energy company boycotts has passed the senate and awaits input from the house under the proposed legislation the treasurer s list would be shared with state government entities making investments of more than 1 million annually which then would be required to cease business with the listed firms highlighting the tensions financial institutions will continue to face in this politically fraught area recent media reports indicated that the sec s fort worth regional office has opened a preliminary investigation that may be targeting financial institutions that made certifications in connection with the texas statute the investigation may involve comparing the certifications against the companies climate disclosures emphasizing the challenges to financial institutions trying to navigate in this area in addition in june 2021 maine passed legislation requiring its pension funds to divest from fossil fuels by 2026 conclusion as esg considerations continue to drive transformative change in the financial markets they present significant opportunities for financial institutions to support market needs in green finance and elsewhere the prominence of these issues in industry and in public and political discourse including in light of the conflict in ukraine and its impact on world energy markets however will continue to bring sustained scrutiny from public and private parties including regulators market participants and ngos we will provide updates concerning these issues as they continue to unfold three key takeaways

by curt devine casey tolan and majlie de puy kamp cnn the sprawling billion dollar palace that sits on a hilltop overlooking the black sea is seen by some kremlin critics as the ultimate emblem of russian president vladimir putin s legacy of corruption dubbed putin s palace the 190 000 square foot mega mansion was purportedly built for his personal use with funds from billionaire oligarchs whom he allegedly allowed to flourish in russia s notoriously corrupt economy so long as they shared the wealth with him the property has its own amphitheater underground hockey rink and private seaport according to a documentary produced by jailed russian opposition leader alexey navalny s anti corruption group there is a no fly zone in the skies above and a no boating zone in the surrounding waters the magnificent fortress stands in stark contrast to the tiny 800 square foot apartment putin claims in his official 2020 financial disclosure yet despite the opulence of the hilltop retreat i would be very surprised if putin ever sets foot in there again nate sibley an expert on russian corruption who advises members of congress told cnn sibley said the palace symbolizes what he sees as a bygone era of putin pursuing through the wealth of oligarchs a luxurious lifestyle that he could never afford on his government salary while putin is believed to have amassed a hidden fortune by such means earlier in his career sibley said he has since become less reliant on his wealthy benefactors over the years and has surrounded himself instead with government and military loyalists who share his hardline nationalist views that shift some russia experts told cnn may make it more difficult to make putin personally feel the sting of economic sanctions the us and its european allies have imposed to punish him for invading ukraine putin has positioned himself as sibley put it above the fray it wasn t always that way nearly two decades before putin drew international ire for his most recent unprovoked invasion of ukraine the kremlin had russia s richest man plucked off his private jet and charged him with crimes against the state mikhail khodorkovsky an oligarch worth an estimated 15 billion at the time sat caged in the middle of the courtroom during his highly publicized trial khodorkovsky who had been critical of government corruption under putin s leadership was convicted of tax evasion and fraud though he argued the charges were politically motivated putin pardoned him in 2013 and he has since lived in exile putin s bold move against the billionaire oil magnate was seen as a message to other oligarchs you might be next the tactic demanded the unwavering loyalty of the oligarch class the ensuing influx of cash gifts and goodwill is one explanation for how putin who claims a salary of just 140 000 a year is suspected of being one of the richest people on the planet he is rumored to own or have access to not only the black sea palace but also a 100 million yacht according to published reports cnn was unable to verify putin s connection to the palace or yacht the kremlin has dismissed reports of putin s purported hidden wealth that the properties and other possessions aren t in his name doesn t matter said tom burgis author of a book on international money laundering called kleptopia burgis likened putin to the godfather and said it s understood that when he asks an oligarch for something it s not really a request ultimately they owe everything they have to the boss and with the click of a finger as he has shown in the past putin can take everything burgis said however influential they may seem they are ultimately dependent on him several of putin s closest associates including childhood friends a woman who was reportedly his former lover and a professional cellist who is the godfather of one of his daughters have secretly amassed huge fortunes outside russia during his time in power according to leaked financial documents a complicated web of shell companies offshore banks and hidden transactions obscures their wealth with accounts spirited away inside one another like russian nesting dolls but a series of leaks in recent years from firms that facilitate the offshore finance system including the panama papers and the pandora papers have stripped away some of those layers of secrecy the assets tied to putin s inner circle include an apartment in a monaco luxury building overlooking the principality s glitzy harbor the fourth floor flat was purchased in 2003 for 4 1 million by a shell corporation called brockville development ltd a company registered in the british virgin islands documents published by the washington post show the real owner of the company svetlana krivonogikh a former shop cleaner from st petersburg who reportedly had a romantic relationship with putin two decades ago according to documents obtained by the international consortium of investigative journalists and reported on by the post and the guardian the company was registered just weeks after krivonogikh who was 28 at the time gave birth to a girl proekt an independent russian media outlet that was banned in the country last year reported that putin started a relationship with krivonogikh in the 1990s before he became president and that her daughter has a patronymic middle name that means daughter of vladimir krivonogikh has declined to comment about putin to reporters but her daughter who had tens of thousands of instagram followers before recently deleting her account has acknowledged to interviewers that she shares a resemblance to the president in addition to the monaco apartment krivonogikh owns a majority share in a ski resort where putin has been seen hitting the slopes several other luxury apartments in st petersburg and a yacht the post and the guardian reported the leaked documents don t make clear the source of the fortunes amassed by putin s inner circle but in several cases businesses and financial institutions linked to them have won lucrative state contracts russia has the largest amount of wealth hidden in offshore tax havens both in terms of absolute volume conservative estimates peg it around 800 billion in 2017 and as a percentage of national gdp according to a 2020 report by the atlantic council on average 10 of world gdp is held offshore however in russia offshore wealth accounted for as much as 60 of gdp in 2015 according to a 2018 journal of public economics research paper the most recent estimate available experts say about a quarter of this dark money is indirectly controlled by putin and his tight knit circle of oligarchs and poses a serious national security threat to the united states the mueller report illustrated how russian offshore accounts were used to interfere in the 2016 elections earlier this month the justice department announced the formation of a task force devoted to enforcing sanctions and other economic restrictions designed to isolate russia from global markets the kleptocapture task force will target not only russian officials and oligarchs but those who aid or conceal their unlawful conduct gary kalman the director of the us office of transparency international an anti corruption advocacy group said enforcing sanctions will not be easy it is extraordinarily difficult for law enforcement to try and follow the money because at some point you are going to literally hit a brick wall kalman said there is literally no paper trail the united states and the united kingdom are ideal places to stash large amounts of money they are among the deepest financial markets in the world and both accept anonymous shell companies according to the atlantic council a group of international researchers found that shell companies in the us can be set up in under an hour for as little as 200 without having to legally disclose who owns or controls it for decades western companies banks and law firms have profited from helping russian oligarchs hide their money setting up complicated corporate structures that make it nearly impossible to link assets or bank accounts to individuals in the eyes of some longtime putin observers the enigmatic russian leader has shifted his focus from pursuit of wealth to consolidation of power it s difficult to understand precisely what s happening inside the kremlin and inside the mind of vladimir putin but he is more and more in a tight relationship with a very small group of people and they tend to be more on the military and intelligence side rather than business people said jill dougherty former moscow bureau chief for cnn because obviously if putin cared about business he would not be prosecuting this war in ukraine right now it is not up to the oligarchs said stanislav markus an associate professor of international business at the university of south carolina it is the guns not the money that speak loudest in the kremlin today regardless of whether priorities have shifted inside the kremlin maria pevchikh head of investigations navalny s anti corruption foundation argues both the palace near the black sea and russia s invasion of ukraine demonstrate the way putin sees himself as much more than a government official he sees himself as a czar as king of some sort pevchikh told cnn he has huge plans he has the vision of him being a historical figure being so powerful so mighty so important and they invest a lot of money into this narrative the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved scott

a modified 2022 tesla model s plaid just lapped the grand course at virginia international raceway vir in 2 50 7 that s 4 5 seconds quicker than we recorded with a production porsche taycan turbo s at our 2021 lightning lap the model s plaid had aftermarket carbon ceramic front brakes and was driven by a professional but it wore standard michelin pilot sport 4s tires clarification 3 18 22 this story has been updated to clarify that because the model s plaid was modified its lap time is not directly comparable to our lightning lap results as we always run unmodified production vehicles we ve long known that teslas can be absurdly quick in a straight line but they ve never really shone when they had to turn a hot lap that type of performance has so far been reserved for porsche s all electric phenom the four door taycan however the tables have turned because a tesla model s plaid just posted a quicker unofficial lap time around a big time racetrack than a porsche taycan turbo s with a professional driver behind the yoke and some aftermarket front brakes carmine cupani s privately owned 22 model s plaid on stock michelin pilot sport 4s rubber lapped vir s grand course in 2 50 7 according to a video posted on cupani s youtube channel while it s an awesome accomplishment it s not directly comparable to our lightning lap results because we only run unmodified production vehicles and the tesla is obviously modified still the plaid s time beats the 2 55 2 lap we set with a production 2020 porsche taycan turbo s at last year s lightning lap the 4 5 ticks that separate the tesla from the porsche are especially impressive since a 2016 model s p85d we tried to run at vir several years ago couldn t even complete a single lap under full power let alone set a record in a phone interview with car and driver cupani says the plaid s track mode played a big role in breaking the record because it effectively kept the battery and electric motors cool during each 20 minute session he said in track mode that the plaid s prodigious power felt easier to manage and that the accelerator s responses felt more linear it all went down at car and driver s track day event held on march 15 at vir which gave regular folks a chance to test their skills in their cars on the same grand course configuration that we use for our annual lightning lap in the case of the model s plaid cupani had his friend and pro driver johan schwartz set the record lap in between track sessions the two would drive to the nearest tesla supercharger about 25 minutes from vir spend another 40 minutes getting a full charge and then drive back all the while discussing different strategies to take down the taycan as shown in the video schwartz does a masterful job driving the model s plaid around the grand course including one sphincter clenching moment when disaster almost struck at the 1 03 minute mark in the video schwartz can be seen climbing the esses at about 120 mph when he nearly loses control for a split second schwartz frantically saws at the tesla s much derided yoke before somehow saving the car and the lap i was shitting my pants looking at that video cupani laughed nervously over the phone also detailed in the three minute video that was posted on youtube today are modifications cupani made to the tesla the model s plaid is apparently fitted with unplugged performance s carbon ceramic front brake kit which cupani says has smaller diameter rotors and smaller size calipers than tesla s said to be upcoming 20 000 carbon ceramic brake package it is also claimed in the video that the rear calipers and rotors are completely stock as previously mentioned the wheel and tire setup is said to be stock too featuring 21 inch arachnid wheels wrapped with michelin pilot sport 4s tires that are currently part of a 4500 package on the model s the 22 model s plaid currently starts at 131 440 it s the first tesla that s powered by three electric motors one at the front and two at the rear which combine to generate 1020 horsepower and 1050 pound feet of torque the version we tested hit 60 mph in 2 1 seconds and completed the quarter mile in 9 4 seconds at 151 mph for comparison a 2022 taycan turbo s starts at 186 350 and has a 750 hp dual electric motor setup with a unique two speed transmission the last taycan turbo s we tested hit 60 mph in 2 4 seconds and finished the quarter mile in 10 5 ticks at 130 mph
salt lake city march 10 2022 globe newswire sintx technologies inc www sintx com nasdaq sint sintx or the company an original equipment manufacturer of advanced ceramics announced today a phase 1 grant of 300k awarded by the national institutes of health nih to develop design and characterize 3d printed implants for craniomaxillofacial cmf applications using a composite of silicon nitride and polyetherketoneketone sn pekk the phase i grant represents the second grant awarded to sintx by the nih in the past six months sintx will collaborate with drexel university thomas jefferson university and the university of pennsylvania over the next 9 11 months to develop and test a new composite material for implants that combines the flexibility and durability of pekk with the antibacterial and bone integrating properties of silicon nitride if successful the new material could be used in place of other implant materials with higher failure rates and greatly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs the continued need for medical imaging compatible 3d printed biomaterials for cmf osteoplasty that can be personalized promote integration and prevent infection is significant said dr ryan bock vice president of research development sintx technologies we believe that this high performance silicon nitride pekk material is a promising biomaterial for cmf applications because of its antibacterial activity osseointegration radiographic imaging and durability we re eager to demonstrate proof of concept through this nih phase i grant the u s government funded research grant aims to provide a strong rationale and preliminary data to support the further study and commercialization of 3d printable silicon nitride pekk composite for cmf implants which could substantially reduce implant failures due to infection and poor bone integration today more than 235 000 americans undergo cmf surgery annually with implant failure rates averaging 5 5 percent failures are often attributed to infections poor osseointegration corrosion and fracture most can be linked to implant materials that underperform in bioactivity infection control osseous integration or mechanical stability americans undergo reconstructive surgery to repair cmf damage due to injury or disease and receive treatment for severe cranial and facial bone injuries using medical implants pre shaped metal polymer or bioactive implants are used in cases that require bone repair or replacement however those materials often fail due to poor osseointegration prosthetic infections and material degradation and fracture which often lead to revision surgery hardware removal debridement long term antibiotic use and implant replacement a better material is needed to overcome these problems and sintx believes its materials have the potential to accelerate bone healing reduce potential of infections eliminate metal toxicity and enhance radiographic imaging research reported in the development

tangled web shutterstock in 2016 angelina jolie and brad pitt announced their separation amidst an ugly tabloid laden scandal including accusations of alcohol abuse lying and betrayal a few months later angelina revealed to the hollywood reporter that she has taken over a year off now because of my family situation to take care of my kids although the pair have yet to finish dividing their substantial assets after nearly 6 years declaring a date of legal separation allows them each to push forward with their individual lives and careers during this very tumultuous time much more was at stake for angelina than just her family s well being under california law all assets and income including movie contracts acquired after the date of separation are not considered marital or community property even if the parties have not terminated or adjudicated their status in other words they are still legally married was angelina s break from the big screen really to focus on her children perhaps could she have also been trying to delay entering into high value contracts for her work until that income could no longer be considered marital property it s highly probable in many states the date of separation dos is a significant line of demarcation a proverbial line in the sand dictating which income belongs to the community and which income belongs to the soon to be separate individual in a handful of states the date of separation means nothing for example in colorado the date of separation isn t relevant without a formal decree of legal separation income earned and debts incurred during a physical separation are still considered marital property as colorado is an equitable division state the court will consider the facts and circumstances of each case when determining how to divide marital property focusing on the financial impact of the decisions that must be made during a separation process is very difficult when the emotional impact of the situation is so taxing the division of significant assets such as homes rental property retirement assets cash or brokerage accounts stock options or other equity compensation closely held businesses and professional licenses can be a very complex and confusing task as is always the case the best thing to do is to get educated about this step and prepared for the negotiations to come each state has its own set of rules when it comes to marital or community property before we dive into the whole separate versus community discussion it s important to know what kind of state you live in to understand which marital asset division rules you ll be dealing with most states operate under the common law system of property ownership which makes it very easy to understand which spouse owns what if your name only is on the account deed title or registration then that asset is yours regardless of how it was acquired or who initially paid for it there are a handful of states however that operate under the community property guidelines i happen to live in one such state the golden state of california where the taxes are high real estate prices are even higher and instead of keeping up with the joneses we re keeping up with the kardashians it s no easy feat for all these reasons it should come as no surprise that we have some of the longest most drawn out divorce proceedings in the nation the stakes are very high when it comes to proving or disproving a separate property claim telling the difference between separate property and marital property let s start by breaking down the legal difference between marital property and separate property each state differs in some of the granular detail but typically separate property can be defined as property owned by either spouse prior to entering into the marriage or that which was inherited during the marriage absent a prenuptial agreement any income or asset acquired during the marriage by either spouse is considered marital property there are a few key exceptions to this rule though a gift received such as a family heirloom your grandmother gives you before her passing could be considered separate property as could be a payment received from a personal injury judgement each state has a method for determining separate property versus marital or community property so understanding your state s statutes is going to be very important here your attorney will be well versed in this area of state law and can advise you appropriately if you live in a state where the date of separation is vital to the separate versus community marital property issue like california it is best to issue a note in writing via email or text to your spouse letting them know that you are officially separated as of the specific day month and year agreeing which assets are separate property is not often easy making the determination often requires the expertise of a forensic accountant who can review asset statements debt statements money flows and tax returns to help you follow the money trail both literally and figuratively if separate assets have been comingled with community marital property it is a more onerous task to prove the separate nature of those assets during the dissolution for example while inherited assets may still be separate property even if they are comingled with joint funds it certainly makes it harder to ultimately prove in mediation or at trial that these originated from a source apart from the marriage the burden of proof falls to the party making the separate property claim as well as this is often where the forensic accountants must get involved this is one of the reasons why you want to try to keep your separate property separate says tracy katz esq cpa cff and forensic accountant with gursey schneider in los angeles it is a lot more cost effective for you upon separation to be able to show the inheritance you received from your aunt 7 years ago was deposited into a separate account and never comingled all that requires is proof of the inheritance and the bank statements reflecting there were no other sums deposited into that account during marriage and that inheritance will have been proved or traced as separate property however if that same inheritance was deposited into the community brokerage account now you have to prove your separate property still exists inside that account tracy continues there likely might have been transfers from the joint brokerage account to the checking account to fund living expenses and whose money was it that got transferred there may have been margin borrowing or risky investments which lost money in that joint brokerage account and again whose money was used you can see how complicated this can be and the mountain of documentation needed to prove your separate property still exists through all this now it isn t just the proof of inheritance and the statements from the community brokerage account that are needed but now you also need statements from every account money was transferred to i always tell people we have to follow the bouncing ball tracing analysis shutterstock tracing analysis which is performed by the forensic account can be a lengthy costly and very necessary expense in a high net worth divorce if you think that you are entitled to a separate property claim or conversely if your spouse is making a separate property claim that you believe to be false the important point here is that even if separate and joint funds were commingled during the marriage that act alone doesn t change the character of the assets from separate property to marital or community property many accounts even when created or funded during the marriage will bear the name of only one spouse but don t be fooled if your spouse was granted stock options deferred compensation a defined benefit plan or any kind of retirement plan through their employer while they were married to you don t think you aren t entitled to your fair share simply because your name isn t attached to it or because they tell you that it is work related and has absolutely nothing to do with you or even because they started participating in that plan before they even met you if your soon to be ex earned any of these perks or contributed to a retirement plan at all during the marriage you are entitled to your fair share so what is your fair share during the discovery process all documentation related to these complex employer sponsored plans are produced by your spouse and reviewed by your attorney or forensic accountant a determination is then made regarding how much of the current plan assets are separate property and how much are community property based on the date of the marriage and the date of separation specifically how much was contributed prior to versus during the marriage along with the investment earnings or losses provide the basis of the calculation that determines each spouse s allotment of the asset upon divorce these retirement accounts are not impacted by the almighty date of separation dos while a spouse s contributions to an account post the date of separation from his or her separate earnings will be allocated to their separate property in the analysis the market fluctuations in these accounts will be apportioned between marital and separate property until the ultimate division of the account the rate of return on the assets during the marriage will also be accounted for in this equation the assets contributed to the plan either by the employer or the employee were likely invested and growing during the marriage and each party is entitled to the growth of their respective share of the asset or conversely as has happened in years past during turbulent times when the market suffers both the marital and separate property bear their respective share of the losses employer sponsored retirement accounts are split up during divorce by a document commonly referred to as a qdro which stands for qualified domestic relations order the qdro provides legal instructions to the plan administrator about how to pay the non employee s share of the plan assets allowing those funds to be withdrawn and placed into an outside retirement account in their name typically an ira many divorcees make the mistake of assuming that their divorce decree will fully protect their rights to their portion of their ex spouse s retirement account this is usually not the case and a properly executed qdro presented to the employer prior to finalizing the divorce is essential what if my spouse owns a home in their separate name if the home was acquired during the marriage in joint title or if joint assets were used to pay the mortgage or expenses associated with that home it will be considered marital property tracy warns her california clients that it can be a different situation if the home is acquired by one spouse prior to the marriage but is then signed over via quitclaim deed placing the home into the community pool if someone acquires a house before the marriage and it is separately titled but signs a deed adding their new spouse as an owner we now have a joint asset the person whose separate property it was property to adding their spouse to the deed is entitled to a reimbursement based on the value of the property when the spouse is added to title however the appreciation of the home from the date of the house goes into joint title would now be considered community she says if the home was acquired by one spouse before the marriage and is separately titled but income earned during the marriage was used to pay the mortgage and or to improve the residence then in california the community acquires a pro tanto interest in the residence pro tanto basically means to the extent describing the ratio of community funds invested i e used to improve the residence or pay down principal to the ratio of separate property funds invested i e the initial down payment principal pay down and improvements prior to marriage and or either of which was made during marriage with separate property this ratio determines the equity ownership of the home between the separate individual and the community for asset division purposes two keys with splitted or broken key rings with pendant in shape of house divided in two parts on wooden background with copy space dividing house when divorce division of property real estate heritage getty images istockphoto the main point to remember when it comes to the home is this if the couple together pay the mortgage principal or improves the residence that is how the community acquires an interest in a separate property residence if the couple is just paying property taxes or just paying other use like bills then the community is not going to get an interest in the home tracy recalled the story of a client who was particularly savvy having already been through one divorce during his second marriage while living in his separate property residence he made sure to write two checks every month for the mortgage payment one from the community account for interest charges and one from his separate account for the principal payment during the entirety of his 9 year marriage the community never obtained an interest in his separate property residence a lot of considerations go into property division during divorce and many states handle these matters in their own unique way make sure you educate yourself about your state s laws and partner with an attorney and a financial advisor who can help you navigate the twists and turns of this winding road community property states include arizona california idaho louisiana nevada new mexico texas washington
