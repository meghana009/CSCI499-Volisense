getting deeper by the day as the reversal that started so dramatically on wednesday picked up the pace the bounce of the first half of the week is a distant memory beauchamp said growth worries are back to the fore and investors are back to selling every bounce as they fret about a recession in the us and elsewhere the end of earnings season might provide some brief respite from all the negativity but with more high inflation readings and interest rate hikes to come stocks are going to suffer a lot more bad news city index and forex com market analyst fawad razaqzada said investors list of worries continues to grow even larger including inflation interest rate hikes low economic growth stagflation and recession perhaps most importantly for stocks the fed is not there to provide cushion like before in one of his most hawkish remarks fed chair jerome powell on tuesday said that interest rates will rise until there is clear and convincing evidence that inflation is in retreat that could be a long wait he said razaqzada noted that consumer confidence was likely to drop further as incomes were squeezed those big falls in shares of retailers target and walmart and others such as amazon and apple we saw on wednesday certainly point towards this trend as profit margins are squeezed at a time when consumers are likely to cut back on their spending he said producers will be passing on raised input costs onto consumers and this will ensure inflation is not going to be easing significantly any time soon at a time when the economic outlook also appears grim target and

the us equity market facing its seventh consecutive negative week it was unsurprising there was little focus on the annoucement with so many other major factors being considered the spectre of a recession is back in focus and investors have sought safe havens sturgeon said if us markets do fall this week it will be the longest run since 2001 the mere fact that this didn t happen during the great financial crisis and with many indicators pointing towards being in oversold territory perhaps investors should hold their nerve 6 30am stocks seen continuing downtrend us stocks were expected

soaring inflation said naeem aslam chief market analyst at avatrade he said the latest set of disappointing earnings from large us retailers signal that conditions must be immensely dire for smaller to medium businesses that do not have the luxury of passing off higher costs to consumers raising fears of a recession the earnings results from walmart and target have made one thing clear for them that inflation is such a problem that retail giants like target are struggling to absorb the shock created by it he added aslam noted that talk in the market of some consumers continuing to maintain their lifestyles by borrowing is adding to market concerns because higher debt at a time of looming recession is the perfect cocktail for a major disaster major retailers have blamed rising costs sluggish sales and supply chain disruptions for their weak earnings and later today investors will be looking for fresh evidence from others such as vf corp kohl s and bj wholesale club to see if they

farrell mairal he has kindly joined us to provide the argentine law perspective and note any considerations companies should keep in mind as they engage in business in argentina great let s jump right into it many u s based companies are doing business in argentina and are perplexed by the fx situation in the country and the regulatory framework around it can you start by giving us a brief overview fred gebauer sure jess i d be happy to over the last 20 years or so and particularly over the last 10 years argentina s economy has struggled with inflation as an example in 2020 inflation was 42 and in 2021 it reached a whopping 50 9 the highest figure in the latin american region the government has sought to control and reduce inflation in several different ways but unfortunately none of them have been very successful this in turn has resulted in a significant devaluation of the currency when it comes to fx controls to make a very long and complicated story short in 2019 the argentine government implemented a series of fx controls to try and protect the argentine economy against this devaluation and maintain the argentine central bank s reserve of usd essentially the government has set an artificially low official exchange rate that significantly deviates from the market prices of the currency over time these controls have started to pose significant challenges for businesses operating in argentina because the government has also restricted companies and individuals ability to purchase usd at the official exchange rate note as an example of this exchange rate disparity on today s date may 18 the official exchange rate was approximately 1 usd 118 07 ars while the market exchange rate was approximately 1 usd 205 98 ars the exchange controls have several different components and regulations have changed over time moreover the regulatory framework around them changes often sometimes even daily or weekly and of course it s quite complex so by way of illustration we ll speak about the exchange controls at a high level with the understanding that the situation is constantly evolving and each company s specific circumstances can have very different implications from the fx tax financial and legal perspectives at this point i ll ask my colleague kristiana to provide a more detailed overview kristiana bankova thanks a lot fred for outlining these key points before we get into the details of how the fx market works to distill a very complex issue into a simple example as we mentioned earlier the main purpose of the exchange controls is to keep the argentine central bank s reserve of usd safe so to maintain a steady quantity of usd within the bank s reserves the controls themselves work as follows the argentine central bank has set an official exchange rate that fluctuates slightly over time for illustrative purposes we can say the exchange rate is ars 100 so when you bring 1 usd into argentina the central bank will give you ars 100 for it this rate is very favorable to the argentine central bank because the equivalent free market value of the ars is actually around half of this official rate when companies and individuals bring usd into argentina they are generally required to convert this money to ars as an example if i m an argentine business and i charge a u s based customer let s say usd 10 000 for a service they would pay me in usd then when they send the money to argentina i would have around five business days to convert this to ars and i would receive ars 1 million i can use these ars 1 million to pay my expenses and any costs i incur in argentina but if i want to convert this money back to usd i start to face challenges the main reason for these challenges is that the argentine government restricts who has the ability to buy usd at the official fx rate and in what circumstances they can do it in practice most businesses and individuals actually cannot buy usd at the official fx so to name a few examples if a business wants to convert money to usd because it prefers to maintain savings in usd they typically would actually not be permitted to do this similarly if a business wants to purchase usd to make payments to argentine residents the government also would not give them access to the official fx on the other hand if a business needs usd to purchase raw materials or supplies from abroad they typically would be able to get access to the official exchange rate and here again i used the word typically because even in this scenario there are restrictions for example the government recently has started monitoring companies that have savings in usd so if a company that has usd in nominated savings wants to purchase supplies from abroad they would typically be asked to use their savings first before they can get access to the official exchange rate these couple of situations that i just outlined are hypothetical examples but we do see a lot of our clients face these challenges day to day for example retail chains and other types of chains making payments to in country franchises manufacturers who need to purchase materials from the u s and pharmaceutical companies making payments to business partners and research partners jessica soto considering all these restrictions what do companies and individuals do when they want to purchase usd fred gebauer jess it s an excellent question of course because the economy in argentina is quite volatile both companies and individuals generally prefer to keep their savings in usd since in many cases companies and individuals cannot purchase usd from the central bank an alternate avenue called the blue chip swap has developed in summary here s how it works usd can be bought through the purchase and sale of securities so to put it in practical terms if i want to buy usd i purchase a security that is listed both in argentina and the united states i would purchase that security in argentina using ars then i would sell it in the united states for usd i would receive usd that i can hold in my american bank account as a consequence of this transaction the good thing about the blue chip swap is that it is legal and the transactions can be made in the mainstream financial market however it also has some drawbacks for example the exchange rate you get in this market is the true market exchange rate so it is much less favorable than the official exchange rate recently usds have been twice as expensive in the blue chip swap market than in the official argentine market while we ve seen many of these transactions go through without question we ve also seen that these trades are receiving increased scrutiny from the argentine government and that in turn could pose or trigger additional compliance and regulatory risks although this isn t the focus of our conversation today i also wanted to point out that in addition to the blue chip swap market a true black market where usds are purchased and sold for cash off exchange also exists this market is significantly less transparent than the blue chip swap and although it s not common for larger companies to engage in this market it is certainly possible that it could happen in one off cases this is an area of significant enforcement by the argentine government and carries heightened risk for companies jessica soto considering this complex and evolving situation what options do companies doing business in argentina have when they transact in usd fred gebauer for companies doing business in argentina one of the principle challenges is figuring out how to structure transactions given the exchange rate so that they can do two things 1 avoid regulatory scrutiny and compliance issues and 2 retain as much value as possible though there is no perfect one size fits all solution there are several different strategies that all have their benefits drawbacks and risks as we mentioned before the regulations around this topic are also constantly changing so a certain structure that works for your business today may not be available or practical tomorrow some of the options that businesses have today include the following first capital contributions if a u s based company makes a capital contribution denominated in usd to its subsidiary in argentina the subsidiary may be allowed to retain the money in usd so this is something worth exploring when it comes to intercompany transactions i also wanted to talk a little bit more about other options a majority of time clients are not making payments to their own subsidiaries or the capital contribution structure may not be viable because of tax or regulatory implications in these cases there are other options available for example you can make payments in usd and simply undergo the required conversion to ars when a company receives the ars the next step is to think about what to do with those ars they can keep their money in local currency or potentially convert to usd when making these decisions different factors to consider include the following how much of the money received can they use to pay expenses incurred locally in argentina how much of this money do they truly not need right away and what should they do with it if they want to have some of the money should they continue to keep the savings in ars or do they need to obtain usd if a company keeps the money in ars which companies often choose to do it is important to think about how to best preserve the value of that money on the other hand if the company decides that they would like to buy usd there are many different considerations to evaluate first they should assess whether there are any avenues to acquire the usd at the official exchange rate for example if the money will be used to purchase raw materials from abroad second if the money cannot be acquired from the argentine central bank at the official exchange rate then companies have to go to the blue chip swap and this carries a number of potential regulatory implications jessica soto thank you fred it sounds like there are still several good options to successfully transact business in argentina can you speak a bit more about the key considerations for companies when engaging in the different options that you just outlined what are the main risks and what can be done to mitigate them kristiana bankova thanks jess i think i can take that question and before we start discussing each option i want to emphasize that every situation is unique and in each case it s very important to carefully consider the regulatory and business impacts to all parties in the transaction we can definitely talk about some of the high level concepts but if you are engaged in business in argentina it s always a best practice to get as much guidance as possible from your local affiliate in argentina from internal and external counsel accountants tax professionals bankers and also your business partners this is especially important given the evolving regulatory and legal landscape in argentina things there may change at any time so getting an up to date opinion is key getting into more of the details of some of the options that fred outlined the first option was a capital contribution first and foremost this option is generally available only when you are making a transfer to your own subsidiary the benefits here are that you able to preserve the value of the usd and you are likely able to do it within the existing legal framework when you do this in my perspective there are three key risks to consider first if the amount to be transferred is very large this can lead to regulatory scrutiny and it might impact or limit future capitalizations of your business second there could be tax implications for the local subsidiary and last but not least this is a regulatory loophole that currently enables companies to do this so if this is a part of a longer term plan it s important to consider that the law may change in the future the second option or one of the second options that fred mentioned was payment in usd and subsequent conversion to ars this is probably the most straightforward option when the usd enter argentina they are converted to ars then at that point the company has ars at its disposal generally if you are going with this option it s really important to manage the funds well and to hedge so that you can preserve the largest amount of value possible really just like in any other financial transaction and if you choose to keep the money in ars which is likely the least risky option from a regulatory perspective there are a number of natural hedging options for example to the extent possible the money should be used to pay ars denominated obligations for companies that are based in argentina it s crucial that they try to denominate their contracts and their obligations in ars to the extent possible that way their liabilities are in the same currency as the cash they receive in the country so they can use the ars they receive without worrying about having to convert them along these same lines if you are as u s based company working with a business partner in argentina one of the best practices is to make small payments over time as your business partner needs the money that way you can take advantage of a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations when i talk about hedging it s also important to point out that some companies choose to hedge by converting the ars received back to usd because of the complex regulations in argentina this does carry a number of legal and financial risks that i wanted to briefly mention first of all if a company isn t able to get access to the official exchange rate which they most likely want they typically have to go to the blue chip swap market and as fred mentioned although this market is legal these transactions are monitored by the government and they may lead to scrutiny just to mention two examples of potential areas of scrutiny terms and conditions of certain covid 19 funding actually prohibit companies from trading in the blue chip swap for a certain period of time after they receive the money similarly the argentine tax authority monitors blue chip swap trades to identify potential non compliance with tax laws similar to some of the other options that are available although the blue chip swap trades are currently legal there s also somewhat of a regulatory loophole so it s possible that the law and the regulations around this might change in the future as for one of the third common options payment to bank accounts based outside of argentina we ve seen from our experience that a lot of business partners will ask for payment to be made to bank accounts outside of argentina so they can avoid this mandatory conversion of usd to ars although of course financially this might be a very attractive option for the business partner it carries a number of legal and compliance risks that are important to consider so discussions with legal counsel and other advisors in this case are key before making any decisions on next steps one quick risk to just point out before i wrap up is that when the money is brought into argentina from the third country this might be done through a blue chip swap transaction and that blue chip swap activity carries the same legal risks that i previously outlined and that fred also mentioned jessica soto thanks for that great background information kristiana and fred i now turn to maría who will discuss some of the legal risks of these fx issues in particular can you discuss the risks with the second option we just covered the reconversion of ars back to usd maría gonzález calvet sure jess thank you companies operating in argentina face a variety of risks as we ve already begun to hear the primary risk though is running afoul of the foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa through third party liability and due to failure to maintain reasonably accurate books and records jessica soto to remind everyone at a high level the fcpa prohibits the corrupt offer payment promise to pay or authorizing the payment or offer of money or anything of value to a foreign official to obtain or retain business a company is liable for fcpa violations if it provides something of value to a third party while aware or substantially certain that the third party will offer give or promise something of value to a foreign official maría gonzález calvet furthermore the accounting provisions of the fcpa require issuers to make and keep books records and accounts in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances now that language is complex and broad what it doesn t do is specify a particular set of controls that issuers are required to implement it also doesn t mention the types of records needed to show the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the transaction as such companies have the responsibility to maintain practices that are reasonable to its business and jurisdiction the fx market in argentina presents a challenge for companies because should third parties engage in the blue chip swap market that we ve heard about to hedge or trade for the most favorable rate the recordkeeping associated with those trades becomes very complex and companies may not have the visibility or the understanding to ensure that their third parties or their argentina operations are complying with fcpa requirements these risks are exacerbated by the geographic location corruption in argentina remains a serious problem especially in public procurement the judicial system customs administration and the tax sector as an illustration there is a very high risk of corruption in argentina s public procurement sector in particular we see this in irregular payments and bribes that are routinely exchanged in connection to the awarding of contracts and companies report that government officials show favoritism to well connected firms and individuals when deciding upon policies and contracts former vice president amado boudou was recently convicted for a number of charges including the misuse of public funds and bribery and current vice president cristina fernandez de kirchner has been accused of accepting bribes money laundering and corruption of course that doesn t even begin to mention the economic turmoil that has only exacerbated matters jessica soto maría i d like to dig in more to the two main areas of potential liability third party risk and books and records let s discuss what about third parties makes companies vulnerable to liability as it relates to fx controls maría gonzález calvet thank you jess importantly under the fcpa a company can be held accountable for actions of a third party acting on its behalf more than 90 of fcpa enforcement actions against companies involve a third party providing some service to the company a third party who provides services for a company or acts on its behalf such as a distributor or a sales agent can subject the company to liability for their own corrupt actions regardless of whether the company directed them to violate the law or whether the company had actual knowledge of the third party s intent to violate that law that is a company can be liable for the third party s actions if it was aware that the actions were substantially certain to occur aware of a high probability that they would occur or where the company consciously avoided knowing or was willfully blind to the third party s corrupt conduct jessica soto right and in addition to sales agents and distributors other examples of third parties that can create fcpa risks include consultants customs brokers freight forwarders tax consultants who interact with foreign government tax and revenue authorities and political lobbyists whether or not registered who interact with foreign legislative or ministerial authorities maría gonzález calvet in the case of the fx controls issues that we ve been discussing there s a risk that third parties with whom companies partner will engage in improper currency trading due to strict restrictions placed on purchasing foreign currency that we ve heard about the dollar demand in argentina has turned to other markets the black market or the sale of cash dollars and the blue chip swap where trades are executed through the purchases of bonds in addition if a business partner utilizes the blue chip swap market it is more difficult for a company to understand the exchange rate that the business partner is getting which may open avenues to free up more money for it to retain a profit or to pay bribes or to engage in other elicit activity companies will need more information to understand how much money their business partners actually have on hand and where it s going to mitigate the fcpa risk arising from third party actions companies must conduct and document due diligence on any third parties that they engage with and ensure that there are contractual provisions such as auditing clauses and a prohibition to hedging currency or trading in the black market in the contracts between the third party and the company itself companies should also consult with counsel to ensure that the contractual provisions are adequate and provide as much protection as is required in addition to the legal risks companies should also consider the reputational risks related to working with third parties who are using the blue chip swap even though the blue chip swap is legal the argentine government tries to discourage companies from using it so business partners engaging in the swap might be perceived by the argentine government as avoiding certain controls jessica soto that s great advice maría what about the books and record provisions what should companies keep in mind to ensure that they are keeping reasonably accurate books and records what is the risk here maría gonzález calvet as we ve mentioned before the capital controls generally force companies operating in argentina to convert payments from abroad into ars at the official exchange rate companies may engage in other dollar exchange markets to hedge currency all of these options obfuscate how much money is on hand this presents a recordkeeping risk because companies conducting business using the blue chip swap exchange rate may report their usd denominated cash and earnings on their financial statement using the official rate thus the company actually has more money on hand than it represented on its financial statement these types of recordkeeping discrepancies make it difficult to keep accurate books and records u s enforcement agencies need to be able to understand where money has gone to ensure that a company s records are clear enough to ensure that funds have not been used to pay bribes or to commit any other elicit conduct companies should keep in mind and consult with counsel or experts like fred and kristiana should they face any accounting issues due to these market concerns jessica soto maría what about the last option offered by fred and kristiana payments to a bank account outside of argentina to avoid capital controls what risks are present in that scenario maría gonzález calvet if companies choose to send funds to a country other than where they will ultimately be used there is a risk that the money will be laundered with argentina in particular a number of companies may decide to transfer funds to neighboring uruguay uruguay is known for its more lenient tax structures it is very attractive to investors due to its lack of reporting mandates argentine regulators have increasingly focused on these transactions to assess their legitimacy and u s enforcement agencies are not likely to look favorably to these types of maneuvers but companies should consult with internal and external counsel in the u s and in argentina if they re considering this path jessica soto now i d like to welcome andrés o farrell to the conversation andrés will provide that local perspective andrés thank you for joining us could you please share from an argentine law perspective what should u s based companies doing business in argentina consider when it comes to the fx situation the blue chip swap and the regulatory framework andrés o farrell thank you jess in the scenario that s been so well described by fred kristiana and maría it is only natural that argentine companies and individual service providers have become nothing short of obsessed with receiving payment abroad in order to sidestep the cost of conversion to argentine pesos at the official exchange rate this also means moving the transactions off the books obviously which in turn entails evasion of applicable taxes most notably income tax so all in all the financial incentives for this option are massive i will start by pointing out that fx regulations and sanctions for violations thereof apply only to the argentine resident therefore as a general rule it is the local business partner that must worry about compliance with the central bank regulations the same applies to tax obligations in the event of any violation it is the argentine taxpayer that will eventually face scrutiny by the local tax authorities that being said there are important considerations for the foreign partner to keep in mind as we were saying it is increasingly frequent to see argentine exporters requesting payment to a u s bank account if this account is opened to the name of the argentine entity or individual then there is generally no cause for concern to the u s client at least under argentine law it is perfectly legal for argentine residents to hold and operate a foreign bank account as long as they comply with all applicable fx and tax obligations problems normally arise when intermediaries are involved not all argentine service providers have u s bank accounts and even if they do they may need to receive part of payment in argentina to cover operational costs in this context many argentine exporters rely on informal financial intermediaries locally known as financieras or cuevas which literally translates as caves these are unlicensed unregulated brokers that act as middle men for clients with opposite needs i e those that need to bring money into argentina and those needing to wire it out of the country these financieras hold several bank accounts in different jurisdictions usually to the name of different legal entities in a nutshell they either receive cash in argentina and make bank deposit abroad or receive deposits abroad and deliver cash in argentina in exchange for a fee the activity of these financieras makes up an informal payments system that runs parallel to the official financial market of course this is a completely unregulated activity with no due diligence or kyc procedures of any kind as it is probably evident by now dealing with financieras poses a significant money laundering risk these accounts are used for hundreds of transactions involving unknown parties and money of undetermined origin therefore making any type of transfer to or from these accounts could mean comingling your payment with potentially illicit funds this entails a substantial risk under argentine money laundering legislation and i presume under u s laws as well in short u s companies with business in argentina should know that it is possible and legitimate for an argentine entity or individual to receive payment in a u s bank account but the account must always be to the same name of the argentine partner who must at the same time provide a reasonable explanation for receiving funds abroad for example if they need to pay foreign service or supply providers also it is important for the u s partner to request an official invoice that must be issued through the argentine tax authority or afip in the electronic invoicing tool jessica soto thank you so much for that andrés for that useful information in closing i ll underscore that every company should have an fcpa compliance program tailored to its specific operations and any risks created by those operations doing business in argentina is particularly complicated due to the capital controls and foreign exchange markets that are ripe for financial manipulation as well as the overall risk of becoming entangled in the corruption present in the country companies should ensure that they have an fcpa compliance policy that addresses these concerns and that is flexible enough to adapt and evolve as the company s operations change over time having an effective compliance policy can protect the company and its officers and employees from criminal and civil liability under the fcpa and other argentine anti corruption laws ropes gray specializes in creating and evaluating these types of compliance policies and the firm is available to provide strategic advice to companies seeking to address the

by david haggith i still beg to differ with those who say the plunge from a positive 6 9 gdp growth rate in the last quarter of 2021 to minus 1 4 in the first quarter of 2022 is just noise it s just a passing anomaly they say on the contrary i am certain the anomaly was the 6 9 reported for the end of 2021 created by everyone stocking up on everything they could get their hands on in a panic over the shortages we saw coming well before the sanctions over putin s invasion of ukraine that big surge that made up for the lockdowns is over it was a last hurrah for the economy the third quarter of 2021 after all had only seen 2 3 growth putting the economy back at the mean for the past thirty years 2 3 was a return to what had become the new normal since the great recession began it s not reasonable to expect the post pandemic lockout blowout would last much longer than that clearly recovery from the most extraordinary quarantine lockdowns in history was the anomaly it was an unexpected storm that created rogue waves throughout the global economy in fact 6 9 gdp growth is such an obvious outlier in itself that you have to go back more than two decades to find another quarter that matches up to it excluding of course the one of a kind anomaly that happened upon the immediate re opening of the economy in the third quarter of 2020 after the first covid lockdown so let s take a look at what is actually happening this quarter all around us without waiting for the next numeric gdp report in order to understand the waters we are now sailing through let s gauge the sentiment of the captains of industry regarding their present circumstances and let s look at the way the passengers consumers feel about how their ship is tossing in fact look to your own gut level churning as one of those passengers about the current rocking and rolling you can sense and see you if you don t have a sinking feeling that the 1 4 drop in the economy last quarter was due to the ship you are riding in breaking up from all the storms that have already tossed it around can you not hear the groaning of metal as it bends in the waves ceo confidence lowest since the start of the covidcrisis ceo confidence as measured in a major survey sank 15 points from the first quarter yes ceo s who should have a pretty clear sense of their own business conditions see the present quarter as worse than the last quarter the one where gdp took that 1 4 drop into a recessionary trough and in fact worse than anytime going through the pandemic that s pretty bad a reading below fifty is consistent with slowing for sure and other metrics so i think we need to watch this closely ceos are really expecting slowing they have not been passing all those costs on to the consumer yet 54 of ceos said they expect to still pass costs on consumers are changing buying behaviors this set of circumstances is not likely to get better anytime soon the story told here is almost all about inflation and supply chain issues it s not about stocks it s not about what the fed is going to do the story these mariners have to tell is all about inflation slamming into the hulls of their businesses rising waves of higher wages and falling circumstances like the supply chain shortages the war in ukraine and continuing covid shutdowns they are navigating a business environment full of hazards piloting through a surging sea with rocks and cross currents everywhere so let s forget stocks and bonds and cryptos for the moment and get real here about the economic shitstorm on main street and in our households because that is where recessions happen though i ll note in passing that zero hedge says the mood on wall street has never been more apocalyptic and wednesday s events in the stock market certainly demonstrated the truth of that but let s look at how main street feels housing is capsizing the housing market has begun to turn over at last demand for home mortgages has already listed 12 in just one week as homes themselves are not listing for sale sellers are not putting homes on the market because they afraid of being left adrift with nowhere to live that they can afford because they will have to refinance their replacement home at higher interest mortgage applications to purchase a home declined 12 week to week and were 15 lower compared with the same week one year ago mortgage rates have risen over 2 full percentage points since the start of the year and home prices are up more than 20 from a year ago cnbc prices swelling by that much compounded by interest rising that much is the kind of rogue wave that forms when two waves come together from different angles that kind of action can lift a ship straight up and throw it right over on its back at the same time inflation isn t helping consumers feel particularly flush either general uncertainty about the near term economic outlook as well as recent stock market volatility may be causing some households to delay their home search said joel kan an mba economist under those conditions refinancing of course has plunged 76 from a year ago there are two kinds of refinancing one is to get a lower payment obviously no one is likely to refinance their home now that interest rates are higher than they ve been in years in hopes of a lower payment so there is not economic significance to that kind of drop in refis the other kind of refinancing is for things like building additions and making improvements to homes that kind has slowed way down too and that does have economic impact in the all important home construction industry who wants to raise the entire payment on their home to twice interest rate just to fund a remodel project the worst part of this story is the darkness it shows on the horizon for some buyers are so desperate to get into a home they have done the dumbest thing you could possibly do at times like this they have grasped for adjustable rate mortgages the very time bomb that swamped the housing market in 2008 you do not go for an adjustable rate mortgage when interest rates are rising at the fastest clip in history that s financial suicide yet arms have risen from constituting 3 of mortgage applications a year ago to 10 5 now that still leaves a small aggregate of total mortgages that are arms compared to where we were in 2008 so it is not so far a time bomb for the entire market but it will likely become a financial wreck for everyone who has entered one the inventory of homes on the market is growing but not because more builders are building more homes or because more sellers are coming on the market but simply because buyers are jumping out of the market in total discouragement those who are wise enough not to take the arm twisting necessary to afford a mortgage are abandoning ship in this situation rising inventories help no one they are a rising tide that simply signifies the death of the housing market there is just no way but suicidal finance to get into a house now for most people anyway better to sit out the collapse and then buy in when things are in your favor the monthly mortgage payment on the median asking price home which has risen to 408 458 has hit a record high of 2 404 at the current 5 27 mortgage rate per redfin that s 42 higher than the 1 688 monthly payment a year earlier when mortgage rates were 2 96 homebuyers continue to be squeezed in nearly every way possible which is causing some to take a step back from the market says redfin chief economist daryl fairweather axios the plunge off the face of that wave has already began as inventories rise homeowners that are selling start cutting prices 15 of homeowners are now starting to cut prices not a lot but some that is opposed to 9 a year ago nevertheless most homes are still selling above asking and in record time so this is only the start of things rolling over it usually takes a long time for sellers to capitulate and lower prices because their home is their most important asset so waiting for a market of this size to overturn becomes an extended waiting game between sellers and buyers i wouldn t call this a crash but we are listing away from the most significant economic driver in this nation home construction and with the cost of materials shifting faster than contractors can keep track of over the past year it was already a perilous environment to navigate it is no wonder therefore that homebuilder sentiment has become as unsettled as ceo sentiment yet look at how far it has to plunge to catch up with the puking seen in homebuyer sentiment you can see builder sentiment usually tracks fairly close with what buyers are feeling because it has to in order to avoid major business mistakes with five straight months of decline and a lot of catching up to the reality of homebuyers still to do how is this quarter going to show better business growth in the nation s main economic sector than last quarter that fantasy makes no sense whatsoever you can just look at what is clearly already happening what people who are in that major market all feeling at both the buying and selling ends of the market and say this quarter is not going to come out well for the nation s most important business sector people wouldn t all be feeling so low if things were cruising right along so as members of the fed tell you as they did yesterday we have a strong economy tell them to shut up and it is not as though the picture improves any on the commercial side of there real estate market the news for the office sector of commercial real estate just keeps getting worse some tech and social media companies have announced hiring freezes others have made cutting costs suddenly a priority promising very constrained hiring numerous startups are laying off people mortgage lenders from wells fargo on down have started laying off significant portions of their employees as mortgage lending is now in the dumps in addition there is the shift working from home for office employees and hybrid models where employees show up at the office only every now and then availability rates which sounds less bad than vacancy rates have shot up during the pandemic and in many cities have continued to rise through q1 2022 and are now in the astronomical zone wolf street several major markets now have office vacancy rates above 30 that clearly doesn t speak of things getting any better in q2 of this year if anything that sector will weigh heavier on cpi than it did last quarter when the first decline happened san fran which had been the nation s hottest commercial market prior to the covidcrisis now has a vacancy rate of 26 8 the worst the city has seen in its entire recorded office history things have shifted from how are we going to find enough offices for all the business growth to maybe we can lease the space out for raising hogs ok it s not quite that bad but building owners now have to find alternative uses or some buildings will go derelict and mortgages will default naturally pirate infested sand flea covered shoals like chicago have the worst numbers but that city has brought its extreme problems upon itself thanks to having the nation s ugliest mayor lori lightfoot whose name is aptly associated in ballads with the wreck of the edmond fitzgerald which sank in the great lakes as lightfoot s city is doing in its own political and social flotsam even lord blankfein former pirate captain of that great merchant ship known as the goldman sachs says recession is a very very high risk factor if i were running a big company i would be very prepared for it if i were a consumer i d be prepared for it though blankenstein is not saying recession is happening yet he is evidence that even those at the top of the food chain feel the heaviness of recession in the wind shipping has sunk sanctions now blanket the world the eu has said it cannot handle any more suffering shanghai may be showing signs that its port will no longer shanghai global markets but will reopen soon however worker shortages all over the world are keeping many docks closed or running below their normal volumes and keeping trains from running on time for now shipping companies are running out of ships but it is not because there is so much traffic of goods it is because so many of their ships are stalled at sea waiting to offload their cargo from los angeles to hamburg scores of containers ships are waiting for weeks to berth at ports nixon said there s currently a queue of 130 vessels waiting off the world s biggest port in shanghai he said yahoo we needed chinese ports to plug tight right now like we needed one of the world s largest container ships the ever given to jam up the suez canal it seems the world at present is ever given to one stoppage after another in the realm of the oceanic transport ever given blocking the suez canal maybe shanghai clears maybe it doesn t and maybe the black sea reopens its mined waters and maybe months from now shipping traffic slowly unjams and starts to flow like normal lot s of maybes but the reality we have before us right now is that shipping has never looked this bad in world history except maybe during world war ii maybe diesel shortages and prices are raging some fuel pumps on the east coast were closed briefly due to being out of fuel and truckers and trains are all upping their prices rationing on the east coast is anticipated by summer it s not happening yet but it s coming said william lewie pugh an executive vice president who worked as a leased owner operator for 24 years said of free agent independent drivers either leaving the business or deciding to change the way they operate for owner operators the fat city of the past two years has lost some weight diesel prices in the new england and mid atlantic regions which are experiencing acute shortages of diesel continued their climb prices in new england hit 6 43 a gallon according to eia data prices in the mid atlantic were reported at 6 38 a gallon meanwhile spot prices for dry van services have collapsed falling an eye popping 1 per mile year to date as concerns rise that the pace of the pandemic driven pull through of consumer buying is leveling off according to data published monday by keybanc capital markets dry van spot rates ex fuel are down 30 from their late 2021 peak freightwaves there is a lot of up and down action on the sea right now costs way up revenues way down doesn t sound like we are skirting a stagflationary recession to me sounds like we are in the throes of one we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the same can be said for the cost of fueling all those ships idling at sea these costs either get passed through or people go out of business that affects almost every good on earth and the pass through price war of survival is here to stay because high fuel prices are here to stay according to oilprice com most of the first quarter did not know those exorbitant costs because the invasion of ukraine didn t start until the end of february so how is it that a full quarter of higher fuels prices than we had in the first quarter is not going to raise the prices of everything and therefore reduce the demand for everything or put people out of business and either way bring gdp lower if you can look at something and know it is worse all over the nation this quarter than it was last then you know it will be weighing on this quarter s gdp you don t need the gdp report to know that fuel factors into the costs of all businesses and all products and the mobility of all consumers and the strength of their budgets so three months of higher fuel prices weighs down everything in the face of distress so widespread i think the burden of proof lies upon those who do not believe this quarter will eventually print through a negative gdp number how with the broadest cost factor in all industries riding so high is this quarter going to turn out better than last other than for those who have oil to sell the claims make no sense to me that ship has sailed and not upon friendly seas this is a perfect storm of problems and if you don t have enough food stockpiled you should be learning and trying to grow whatever you can to be as self sustaining as possible this is going to impact the already hard hit food supply and by the time the majority of the country figures it out it will be too late shtf consumer sentiment sinks to deeply depressing lows with all of that in view how do you think people are feeling about this right now we call them consumers but they are people and right now these people are feeling depressed and anxious not a little but a lot americans are more stressed about money than ever and it s hurting our mental health americans are more stressed about money than they ve ever been according to the american psychological association s latest stress in america survey eighty seven percent of americans said that inflation and the rising costs of everyday goods is what s driving their stress said vaile wright senior director of health care innovation at the american psychological association more than 40 of u s adults say money is negatively impacting their mental health according to bankrate s april 2022 money and mental health report cnbc you re telling me that that many people are at that level of stress over finances and we haven t even entered recession yet some may need the numbers to figure it out but i go by the environment and this is recession if i ve ever seen or felt it you may recall that i wrote several months ago that few people were caring much about inflation at that time because most had not lived through the stagflation of the seventies that i said would change once they started to experience the daily stress of worrying about how seriously prices were going to stretch their budgets as incomes always grow slower than inflation rises some things you have to experience in order to realize how they start to become a part of your daily thinking and feelings and decisions this is what some writers meant when they warned months ago that the fed s slowness to deal with inflation could result in inflation becoming a new mindset that pressured spending downward and wages demands up adding to the inflation spiral because of built in expectations that would form changing consumer behavior we have now sailed past a line of demarcation on that to where el erian says us can t avoid stagflation even as fed tightens the us economy won t be able to avoid a bout of stagflation and markets have yet to tune into the risk of a significant slowdown in growth said mohamed el erian the chair of gramercy fund management and former chief executive officer of pimco we ve seen growth coming down and we re seeing inflation remaining high as for how investors should respond he said they have still to price in a significant slowdown in growth which means there s more of an adjustment to make yahoo it can t avoid it because it is already in it growth down inflation high is the definition of stagflation significant slowdown doesn t sound like the economy will be pushing back up from that 1 4 the burden of proof belongs to those trying to argue 1 4 is not the new trend when everything happening around us howls like the wind and groans like bending steel and certainly feels like things are falling apart badly i say that is the new trend you ll have to try pretty hard to convince me it is not and that this fractured battered creaking economy is sailing along just fine over the bounding main and is not already a shipwreck sinking sentiment equals sagging sales that heavy consumer sentiment is what is now causing retail to tank in addition to lack of goods and tank badly yes i know we recently got a retail report that said retail was rising the government told us in its advance retail sales report that total sales rose 1 month on month whoop dee doo part of that was inflation because the measure used was dollars the only thing they reported as falling in that dubious report was food apparently people are tightening their belts after laying on the covid 19 around their waist and are eating less it s a little hard for me to believe food sales are falling even measured in dollars when inflation alone should have shot them upward but people are out buying electronics really something is fishier than moby dick in those numbers moreover it certainly doesn t square with what the captains of industry are telling us in their all important stock reports in which you can be certain they do not want in such perilous times of falling stocks to send their stocks down harder with a message any worse than they have to tell by sec rules when the market is soaring one might prepare for a quarter expected to be worse by lowering the sails to let a little air out in order to lower expectations a little but these are not those kinds of times yet the heads of major retailers have sounded such alarm that they scuttled their own stock prices target shares plunged an entire bear market drop and then some in a single rush down 25 after it reported inflation hits and resulting earnings misses that was its worst fall since black monday 1987 you re going to tell me that happens without a recession of course back then target s stock values were much smaller and making it even easier for smaller numbers to see major percentage drops than larger numbers so really this was more improbable than the good times plunge of 87 the massive flash crash of 87 is one of the few that happened outside of a recession as you can see it looks like nothing but percentage wise logarithmic scale it was bigger than what is happening today even in target s stocks you can also see that the fed s inflation probability indicator usually doesn t move until the recession hits so it s not much of an indicator except to say we re there when it does show up and remember a gray shaded recession area won t show up for the present time at the end of the graph until more than two quarters after it began then the present time will suddenly pop up gray as the officials finally say oh yeah we re in a recession that started in the first quarter of 2022 walmart made itself into the buoy bell of commerce this week clanging away about forward earnings going down instead of up as had almost always been the case and was certainly expected by those who don t believe we are already in the thralls of a recessionary storm as a result it took it largest post report plunge since well 1987 too apparently it is a good time for major retail to crash like it was 1987 only from much greater heights walmart blamed rising labor costs heavy inventories that weren t selling and high fuel costs each accounted for a third of walmart s earnings shortfall didn t someone here say that the fourth quarter s inventory build in 2021 was just sales brought forward by retailers that would not be happening again in the following quarter because customers had also stocked up so now we re sitting on stockpiles that s good because we ll need them as more shortages start coming through but it doesn t foreshadow good news for the economy today for right now q4 s big inventory build is a bit plugged up the fact that inventories have backed up even when shortages of a few products are starting to appear because some products are not being shipped making inventory spotty indicates those people who are eating less may be buying less of everything in spite of what the government numbers reported who are you going to believe the government where biden s ruling party faces elections this year or the companies that are crashing their own stocks with frightful stock pounding news that i m sure they would do anything they could to avoid giving walmart by the way is the largest retailer in the world and one of the least expensive which makes it a bellwether for the rest of the industry prior to covid at any rate it was double the size of amazon though those numbers have clearly changed a lot since covid drove customers to buy more online walmart s earnings are a big deal and a strong indication 2 3rds of the economy personal consumption is in trouble consider this pic twitter com 8t7esxzvdi michael lebowitz cfa michaellebowitz may 18 2022 walmart is as stated in the tweet above a strong indication of how 2 3 of the retail economy is doing and as goes the retail economy so most likely are going the lives of everyone s customers and so is going the consumer driven economy of the us here is another measure that says this is the right way to gauge where the economy is now the average customer is not as well off financially as many think because consumer debt has recently spiked way way up that kind of truly historic rise indicates an emergency consumers have used up their savings and are now buying on credit even when the cost of credit is rising to where buying on credit is clearly less desirable given that american consumer credit is suddenly doing this i think it is pretty clear the american consumer is tapped out and yet we have a lot more months of inflation to come we ve never seen that before and it matches up to what the fed s personal savings data is also showing us while the savings rate is not the same as the aggregate in savings but is how much of a person s income they are banking each month or quarter it is pretty likely that if people are putting away less money than anytime since the great recession they are depleting their savings and right when prices are going through the roof no wonder such a large percentage of people are worried back in the covidcrisis they were banking those stimulus checks and some were making megabucks on robinhood now they re losing it on bad stock bets and have likely spent out the stimulus money just when things were looking hopeful the wind swung around the other other way and just that soon they are looking quite bleak the other sector to fall hard in stocks on wednesday 10 was trucking what only months ago we couldn t find enough truckers or trucks then a week ago freightwaves spoke of a coming trucking recession due in part to soaring fuel costs few believed them given how backed up shipping is but i guess investors became believers on wednesday trucking stocks submerged deep below the briny surface because target and walmart stocks fell everyone wednesday seemed to become at last believers in a world where fewer products will be moving around due to shortages screaming fuel costs and general inflation across the board slowing down consumers so oh yeah deutsche bank boldly predicted as i reported a couple of days ago see the fed is still spiking the inflation punch bowl but the party is in recess anyway that we will be sailing into a recession a year and a half from now what are these pirates smoking how can anyone believe this badly foundering economy still has a year and a half of clear sailing ahead i just shake my head and ask can you not feel the roiling sea washing over the deck you re standing on this ship is already on the rocks denial is an amazing thing so we talked stocks today only to the point of showing how poorly retail is actually doing gaining some sense by those stock reports that turned great vessels upside down in the market of how most of the hardest hits seem to be coming in the consumer sector now all of the hardest pounding on wednesday came in retail or areas that serve retail such as trucking all were hard enough slams to wash you right off the tilted deck in an economy that is mostly consumer driven that sounds like recession to me cisco the big internet equipment company also did a faceplant today falling a massive 20 in seconds so big tech is still taking the waves broadside too i can feel the recession in the fusty gusty air all around me now i can hear it in the groaning steel i can taste the salt of it on my lips and the sting of it in my eyes i can feel the flexing deck shivering and rolling beneath my feet can t you trust your feelings this is what sinking into the tides of stagflation feels like stagnant economy but with sweltering inflation if the next gdp report comes out positive it ll be a miracle or a lie i have never experienced anything that looked or felt more like a truly perilous global recession than right now have you trust your instincts and find a lifeboat before they are all full or have gone down with the ship

by may 19 2022 05 00 pm washington a closely divided house approved legislation thursday to crack down on alleged price gouging by oil companies and other energy producers as prices at the pump continue to soar a bill backed by house democrats would give president joe biden authority to declare an energy emergency that would make it unlawful to increase gasoline and home energy fuel prices in an excessive or exploitative manner the bill directs the federal trade commission to punish companies that engage in price gouging and adds a new unit at the ftc to monitor fuel markets at a time when people across the country are feeling the pinch at the gas pump congress needs to be doing all it can to bring down costs for american families said rep kim schrier d wash who co sponsored the bill she called it infuriating that spikes in gas prices were happening at the same time that gas and oil companies are making record profits and taking advantage of international crises to make a profit this must stop the measure was approved 217 207 republicans unanimously opposed the bill along with four democrats it now goes to the senate where a similar bill faces steep odds amid a 50 50 split between democrats and republicans the focus on price gouging comes as gas prices hit an average of 4 59 per gallon thursday 49 cents a gallon higher than a month ago and 1 55 higher than a year ago according to aaa exxonmobil chevron and other major oil companies announced surging profits totaling more than 40 billion in the first quarter of the year a fact democrats repeatedly cited in floor debate many of the companies are spending billions on stock buybacks and dividend payments to investors big oil is price gouging families because they can said rep katie porter d calif another co sponsor enough is enough republicans and industry groups called the bill misguided saying there is no evidence of price gouging oil is a global commodity and prices are set on the global market gas prices rose late last year amid supply chain problems and increased demand as the economy recovered following the covid 19 pandemic but prices have spiked ever higher since russia s feb 24 invasion of ukraine the u s has banned imports of russian oil and other countries are seeking alternatives to russian energy driving prices up biden aware of the political stakes has vowed to do all he can to ease pain at the pump for american families including ordering release of record amounts of oil from the nation s strategic reserve white house press secretary karine jean pierre said biden welcomes all ideas to protect consumers and to make sure that oil companies aren t taking advantage of russian president vladimir putin s war and are competing fairly republicans say the answer to higher gas prices is to increase production here in the united states louisiana rep steve scalise the no 2 house republican called the bill an attempt by democrats to distract and shift blame from the administration s self inflicted energy and inflation crisis scalise called the bill a socialist price fixing scheme that hurts small businesses and consumers the most he accused democrats of politicizing the ftc by giving the commission wide ranging powers based on undefined parameters that will allow it to usurp market forces and set government controlled gasoline prices rep chris pappas d n h said the bill was needed the price of crude oil fell last month yet the prices consumers pay at the pump continued to rise we have to put an end to this corporate profiteering and give families relief he said the american exploration and production council a lobbying group that represents independent oil and gas producers called the bill counter productive energy prices are determined by supply and demand not false accusations of price gouging motivated by the upcoming election said anne bradbury the group s ceo the house vote comes as interior secretary deb haaland said she will release a long delayed five year plan that allows interior to conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales the current plan expires june 30 and administration officials had not said when or if a replacement would be released even as they canceled three offshore lease sales scheduled in the gulf of mexico and off the alaska coast haaland told the senate energy committee the new plan will be made public by june 30 the plan does not issue specific leases or authorize any drilling project as we take this next step we will follow the science and the law as we always do haaland said thursday vowing a robust and transparent review process that includes input from states the public and tribes the biden administration has come under pressure to increase u s crude production as fuel prices spike because of the pandemic and the war in ukraine biden also faces pressure from democrats and environmental groups urging him to do more to combat climate change even as his legislative proposals on climate and clean energy remain stalled in a sharply divided congress sen joe manchin a west virginia democrat who chairs the energy panel and plays an outsized role on energy policy said thursday that even as we see russia wage a war enabled by energy insecurity in europe this administration has made its opposition to domestic oil and gas production crystal clear manchin said he supported a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters announced by biden soon after taking office in january 2021 by last summer he told haaland the time for a pause had come and gone now 16 months after the pause was announced we still have no new leases manchin said i m sorry to say it has become crystal clear that the pause is in fact a ban interior conducted an offshore lease sale last fall responding to a court order but the sale was later vacated by a federal judge the administration has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly western states however officials scaled back the amount of land offered for drilling and raised royalty rates charged to energy companies by 50 the four democrats who opposed the house bill are reps lizzie fletcher of texas jared

indicator of demand for mortgages when more people are unemployed fewer people will be looking to get a mortgage and buy a home and that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is the united states central bank but it doesn t actually set mortgage rates rather multiple things the fed does influence mortgage rates for example while mortgage rates don t mirror the fed funds rate the rate banks apply when borrowing lending money to each other overnight

the covid 19 pandemic is one of the most manipulated infectious disease events in history characterized by official lies in an unending stream lead by government bureaucracies medical associations medical boards the media and international agencies we have witnessed a long list of unprecedented intrusions into medical practice including attacks on medical experts destruction of medical careers among doctors refusing to participate in killing their patients and a massive regimentation of health care led by non qualified individuals with enormous wealth power and influence for the first time in american history a president governors mayors hospital administrators and federal bureaucrats are determining medical treatments based not on accurate scientifically based or even experience based information but rather to force the acceptance of special forms of care and prevention including remdesivir use of respirators and ultimately a series of essentially untested messenger rna vaccines for the first time in history medical treatment protocols are not being formulated based on the experience of the physicians treating the largest number of patients successfully but rather individuals and bureaucracies that have never treated a single patient including anthony fauci bill gates ecohealth alliance the cdc who state public health officers and hospital administrators the media tv newspapers magazines etc medical societies state medical boards and the owners of social media have appointed themselves to be the sole source of information concerning this so called pandemic websites have been removed highly credentialed and experienced clinical doctors and scientific experts in the field of infectious diseases have been demonized careers have been destroyed and all dissenting information has been labeled misinformation and dangerous lies even when sourced from top experts in the fields of virology infectious diseases pulmonary critical care and epidemiology these blackouts of truth occur even when this information is backed by extensive scientific citations from some of the most qualified medical specialists in the world incredibly even individuals such as dr michael yeadon a retired ex chief scientist and vice president for the science division of pfizer pharmaceutical company in the uk who charged the company with making an extremely dangerous vaccine is ignored and demonized further he along with other highly qualified scientists have stated that no one should take this vaccine dr peter mccullough one of the most cited experts in his field who has successfully treated over 2000 covid patients by using a protocol of early treatment which the so called experts completely ignored has been the victim of a particularly vicious assault by those benefiting financially from the vaccines he has published his results in peer reviewed journals reporting an 80 reduction in hospitalizations and a 75 reduction in deaths by using early treatment despite this he is under an unrelenting series of attacks by the information controllers none of which have treated a single patient neither anthony fauci the cdc who nor any medical governmental establishment has ever offered any early treatment other than tylenol hydration and call an ambulance once you have difficulty breathing this is unprecedented in the entire history of medical care as early treatment of infections is critical to saving lives and preventing severe complications not only have these medical organizations and federal lapdogs not even suggested early treatment they attacked anyone who attempted to initiate such treatment with all the weapons at their disposal loss of license removal of hospital privileges shaming destruction of reputations and even arrest a good example of this outrage against freedom of speech and providing informed consent information is the recent suspension by the medical board in maine of dr meryl nass medical license and the ordering of her to undergo a psychiatric evaluation for prescribing ivermectin and sharing her expertise in this field i know dr nass personally and can vouch for her integrity brilliance and dedication to truth her scientific credentials are impeccable this behavior by a medical licensing board is reminiscent of the methodology of the soviet kgb during the period when dissidents were incarcerated in psychiatric gulags to silence their dissent go to other unprecedented attacks another unprecedented tactic is to remove dissenting doctors from their positions as journal editors reviewers and retracting of their scientific papers from journals even after these papers have been in print until this pandemic event i have never seen so many journal papers being retracted the vast majority promoting alternatives to official dogma especially if the papers question vaccine safety normally a submitted paper or study is reviewed by experts in the field called peer review these reviews can be quite intense and nit picking in detail insisting that all errors within the paper be corrected before publication so unless fraud or some other major hidden problem is discovered after the paper is in print the paper remains in the scientific literature we are now witnessing a growing number of excellent scientific papers written by top experts in the field being retracted from major medical and scientific journals weeks months and even years after publication a careful review indicates that in far too many instances the authors dared question accepted dogma by the controllers of scientific publications especially concerning the safety alternative treatments or efficacy of vaccines these journals rely on extensive adverting by pharmaceutical companies for their revenue several instances have occurred where powerful pharmaceutical companies exerted their influence on owners of these journals to remove articles that in any way question these companies products worse still is the actual designing of medical articles for promoting drugs and pharmaceutical products that involve fake studies so called ghostwritten articles richard horton is quoted by the guardian as saying journals have devolved into information laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry proven fraudulent ghostwritten articles sponsored by pharmaceutical giants have appeared regularly in top clinical journals such as jama and new england journal of medicine never to be removed despite proven scientific abuse and manipulation of data ghostwritten articles involve using planning companies whose job it is to design articles containing manipulated data to support a pharmaceutical product and then have these articles accepted by high impact clinical journals that is the journals most likely to affect clinical decision making of doctors further they supply doctors in clinical practice with free reprints of these manipulated articles the guardian found 250 companies engaged in this ghostwriting business the final step in designing these articles for publication in the most prestigious journals is to recruit well recognized medical experts from prestigious institutions to add their name to these articles these recruited medical authors are either paid upon agreeing to add their name to these pre written articles or they do so for the prestige of having their name on an article in a prestigious medical journal of vital importance is the observation by experts in the field of medical publishing that nothing has been done to stop this abuse medical ethicists have lamented that because of this widespread practice you can t trust anything while some journals insist on disclosure information most doctors reading these articles ignore this information or excuse it and several journals make disclosure more difficult by requiring the reader to find the disclosure statements at another location many journals do not police such statements and omissions by authors are common and without punishment as concerns the information made available to the public virtually all the media is under the control of these pharmaceutical giants or others who are benefitting from this pandemic their stories are all the same both in content and even wording orchestrated coverups occur daily and massive data exposing the lies being generated by these information controllers are hidden from the public all data coming over the national media tv newspaper and magazines as well as the local news you watch every day comes only from official sources most of which are lies distortions or completely manufactured out of whole cloth all aimed to deceive the public television media receives the majority of its advertising budget from the international pharmaceutical companies this creates an irresistible influence to report all concocted studies supporting their vaccines and other so called treatments in 2020 alone the pharmaceutical industries spent 6 56 billion dollars on such advertising pharma tv advertising amounted to 4 58 billion an incredible 75 of their budget that buys a lot of influence and control over the media world famous experts within all fields of infectious diseases are excluded from media exposure and from social media should they in any way deviate against the concocted lies and distortions by the makers of these vaccines in addition these pharmaceutical companies spend tens of millions on social media advertising with pfizer leading the pack with 55 million in 2020 while these attacks on free speech are terrifying enough even worse is the virtually universal control hospital administrators have exercised over the details of medical care in hospitals these hirelings are now instructing doctors which treatment protocols they will adhere to and which treatments they will not use no matter how harmful the approved treatments are or how beneficial the unapproved treatments are never in the history of american medicine have hospital administrators dictated to its physicians how they will practice medicine and what medications they can use the cdc has no authority to dictate to hospitals or doctors concerning medical treatments yet most physicians complied without the slightest resistance the federal care act encouraged this human disaster by offering all us hospitals up to 39 000 dollars for each icu patient they put on respirators despite the fact that early on it was obvious that the respirators were a major cause of death among these unsuspecting trusting patients in addition the hospitals received 12 000 dollars for each patient that was admitted to the icu explaining in my opinion and others why all federal medical bureaucracies cdc fda niaid nih etc did all in their power to prevent life saving early treatments letting patients deteriorate to the point they needed hospitalization meant big money for all hospitals a growing number of hospitals are in danger of bankruptcy and many have closed their doors even before this pandemic most of these hospitals are now owned by national or international corporations including teaching hospitals it is also interesting to note that with the arrival of this pandemic we have witnessed a surge in hospital corporate chains buying up a number of these financially at risk hospitals it has been noted that billions in federal covid aid is being used by these hospital giants to acquire these financially endangered hospitals further increasing the power of corporate medicine over physician independence physicians expelled from their hospitals are finding it difficult to find other hospitals staffs to join since they too may be owned by the same corporate giant as a result vaccine mandate policies include far larger numbers of hospital employees for example mayo clinic fired 700 employees for exercising their right to refuse a dangerous essentially untested experimental vaccine mayo clinic did this despite the fact that many of these employees worked during the worst of the epidemic and are being fired when the omicron variant is the dominant strain of the virus has the pathogenicity of a common cold for most and the vaccines are ineffective in preventing the infection in addition it has been proven that the vaccinated asymptomatic person has a nasopharyngeal titer of the virus as high as an infected unvaccinated person if the purpose of the vaccine mandate is to prevent viral spread among the hospital staff and patients then it is the vaccinated who present the greatest risk of transmission not the unvaccinated the difference is that a sick unvaccinated person would not go to work the asymptomatic vaccinated spreader will what we do know is that major medical centers such as mayo clinic receive tens of millions of dollars in nih grants each year as well as monies from the pharmaceutical makers of these experimental vaccines in my view that is the real consideration driving these policies if this could be proven in a court of law the administrators making these mandates should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sued by all injured parties the hospital bankruptcy problem has grown increasingly acute due to hospitals vaccine mandates and resulting large number of hospitals staff especially nurses refusing to be forcibly vaccinated this is all unprecedented in the history of medical care doctors within hospitals are responsible for the treatment of their individual patients and work directly with these patients and their families to initiate these treatments outside organizations such as the cdc have no authority to intervene in these treatments and to do so exposes the patients to grave errors by an organization that has never treated a single covid 19 patient when this pandemic started hospitals were ordered by the cdc to follow a treatment protocol that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of patients most of whom would have recovered had proper treatments been allowed the majority of these deaths could have been prevented had doctors been allowed to use early treatment with such products as ivermectin hydroxy chloroquine and a number of other safe drugs and natural compounds it has been estimated based on results by physicians treating the most covid patients successfully that of the 800 000 people that we are told died from covid 640 000 could have not only been saved but could have in many cases returned to their pre infection health status had mandated early treatment with these proven methods been used this neglect of early treatment constitutes mass murder that means 160 000 would have actually died far less than the number dying at the hands of bureaucracies medical associations and medical boards that refused to stand up for their patients according to studies of early treatment of thousands of patients by brave caring doctors seventy five to eighty percent of the deaths could have been prevented incredibly these knowledgeable doctors were prevented from saving these covid 19 infected people it should be an embarrassment to the medical profession that so many doctors mindlessly followed the deadly protocols established by the controllers of medicine one must also keep in mind that this event never satisfied the criteria for a pandemic the world health organization changed the criteria to make this a pandemic to qualify for a pandemic status the virus must have a high mortality rate for the vast majority of people which it didn t with a 99 98 survival rate and it must have no known existing treatments which this virus had in fact a growing number of very successful treatments the draconian measures established to contain this contrived pandemic have never been shown to be successful such as masking the public lockdowns and social distancing a number of carefully done studies during previous flu seasons demonstrated that masks of any kind had never prevented the spread of the virus among the public in fact some very good studies suggested that the masks actually spread the virus by giving people a false sense of security and other factors such as the observation that people were constantly breaking sterile technique by touching their mask improper removal and by leakage of infectious aerosols around the edges of the mask in addition masks were being disposed of in parking lots walking trails laid on tabletops in restaurants and placed in pockets and purses within a few minutes of putting on the mask a number of pathogenic bacteria can be cultured from the masks putting the immune suppressed person at a high risk of bacterial pneumonia and children at a higher risk of meningitis a study by researchers at the university of florida cultured over 11 pathogenic bacteria from the inside of the mask worn by children in schools it was also known that children were at essentially no risk of either getting sick from the virus or transmitting it in addition it was also known that wearing a mask for over 4 hours as occurs in all schools results in significant hypoxia low blood oxygen levels and hypercapnia high co2 levels which have a number of deleterious effects on health including impairing the development of the child s brain we have known that brain development continues long after the grade school years a recent study found that children born during the pandemic have significantly lower iqs yet school boards school principals and other educational bureaucrats are obviously unconcerned go to tools of the indoctrination trade the designers of this pandemic anticipated a pushback by the public and that major embarrassing questions would be asked to prevent this the controllers fed the media a number of tactics one of the most commonly used was and is the fact check scam with each confrontation with carefully documented evidence the media fact checkers countered with the charge of misinformation and an unfounded conspiracy theory charge that was in their lexicon debunked never were we told who the fact checkers were or the source of their debunking information we were just to believe the fact checkers a recent court case established under oath that facebook fact checkers used their own staff opinion and not real experts to check facts when sources are in fact revealed they are invariably the corrupt cdc who or anthony fauci or just their opinion here is a list of things that were labeled as myths and misinformation that were later proven to be true the asymptomatic vaccinated are spreading the virus equally as with unvaccinated symptomatic infected the vaccines cannot protect adequately against new variants such as delta and omicron natural immunity is far superior to vaccine immunity and is most likely lifelong vaccine immunity not only wanes after several months but all immune cells are impaired for prolonged periods putting the vaccinated at a high risk of all infections and cancer covid vaccines can cause a significant incidence of blood clots and other serious side effects the vaccine proponents will demand numerous boosters as each variant appears on the scene fauci will insist on the covid vaccine for small children and even babies vaccine passports will be required to enter a business fly in a plane and use public transportation there will be internment camps for the unvaccinated as in australia austria and canada the unvaccinated will be denied employment there are secret agreements between the government elitist institutions and vaccine makers many hospitals were either empty or had low occupancy during the pandemic the spike protein from the vaccine enters the nucleus of the cell altering cell dna repair function hundreds of thousands have been killed by the vaccines and many times more have been permanently damaged early treatment could have saved the lives of most of the 700 000 who died vaccine induced myocarditis which was denied initially is a significant problem and clears over a short period special deadly lots batches of these vaccines are mixed with the mass of other covid 19 vaccines several of these claims by those opposing these vaccines now appear on the cdc website most still identified as myths today extensive evidence has confirmed that each of these so called myths were in fact true many are even admitted by the saint of vaccines anthony fauci for example we were told even by our cognitively impaired president that once the vaccine was released all the vaccinated people could take off their masks oops we were told shortly afterward the vaccinated have high concentrations titers of the virus in their noses and mouths nasopharynx and can transmit the virus to others in which they come into contact especially their own family members on go the masks once again in fact double masking is recommended the vaccinated are now known to be the main superspreaders of the virus and hospitals are filled with the sick vaccinated and people suffering from serious vaccine complications another tactic by the vaccine proponents is to demonize those who reject being vaccinated for a variety of reasons the media refers to these critically thinking individuals as anti vaxxers vaccine deniers vaccine resisters murders enemies of the greater good and as being the ones prolonging the pandemic i have been appalled by the vicious often heartless attacks by some of the people on social media when a parent or loved one relates a story of the terrible suffering and eventual death they or their loved one suffered as a result of the vaccines some psychopaths tweet that they are glad that the loved one died or that the dead vaccinated person was an enemy of good for telling of the event and should be banned this is hard to conceptualize this level of cruelty is terrifying and signifies the collapse of a moral decent and compassionate society it is bad enough for the public to sink this low but the media political leaders hospital administrators medical associations and medical licensing boards are acting in a similar morally dysfunctional and cruel way go to logic reasoning and scientific evidence has disappeared in this event has scientific evidence carefully done studies clinical experience and medical logic had any effect on stopping these ineffective and dangerous vaccines absolutely not the draconian efforts to vaccinate everyone on the planet continues except the elite postal workers members of congress and other insiders in the case of all other drugs and previous conventional vaccines under review by the fda the otherwise unexplained deaths of 50 or less individuals would result in a halt in further distribution of the product as happened on 1976 with the swine flu vaccine with over 18 000 deaths being reported by the vaers system for the period december 14 2020 and december 31st 2021 as well as 139 126 serious injuries including deaths for the same period there is still no interest in stopping this deadly vaccine program worse there is no serious investigation by any government agency to determine why these people are dying and being seriously and permanently injured by these vaccines what we do see is a continuous series of coverups and evasions by the vaccine makers and their promoters the war against effective cheap and very safe repurposed drugs and natural compounds that have proven beyond all doubt to have saved millions of lives all over the world has not only continued but has stepped up in intensity doctors are told they cannot provide these life saving compounds for their patients and if they do they will be removed from the hospital have their medical license removed or be punished in many other ways a great many pharmacies have refused to fill prescriptions for lvermectin or hydroxy chloroquine despite the fact that millions of people have taken these drugs safely for over 60 years in the case of hydroxy chloroquine and decades for ivermectin this refusal to fill prescriptions is unprecedented and has been engineered by those wanting to prevent alternative methods of treatment all based on protecting vaccine expansion to all several companies that make hydroxy chloroquine agreed to empty their stocks of the drug by donating them to the strategic national stockpile making this drug far more difficult to get why would the government do that when over 30 well done studies have shown that this drug reduced deaths anywhere from 66 to 92 in other countries such as india egypt argentina france nigeria spain peru mexico and others the critics of these two life saving drugs are most often funded by bill gates and anthony fauci both of which are making millions from these vaccines to further stop the use of these drugs the pharmaceutical industry and bill gates anthony fauci funded fake research to make the case that hydroxy chloroquine was a dangerous drug and could damage the heart to make this fraudulent case the researchers administered the sickest of covid patients a near lethal dose of the drug in a dose far higher than used on any covid patient by dr kory mccullough and other real and compassionate doctors physicians who were actually treating covid patients the controlled lap dog media of course hammered the public with stories of the deadly effect of hydroxy chloroquine all with a terrified look of fake panic all these stories of ivermectin dangers were shown to be untrue and some of the stories were incredibly preposterous the attack on ivermectin was even more vicious than against hydroxy chloroquine all of this and a great deal more is meticulously chronicled in robert kennedy jr s excellent new book the real anthony fauci bill gates big pharma and the global war on democracy and public health if you are truly concerned with the truth and with all that has occurred since this atrocity started you must not only read but study this book carefully it is fully referenced and covers all topics in great detail this is a designed human tragedy of biblical proportions by some of the most vile heartless psychopaths in history millions have been deliberately killed and crippled not only by this engineered virus but by the vaccine itself and by the draconian measures used by these governments to control the pandemic spread we must not ignore the deaths by despair caused by these draconian measures which can exceed hundreds of thousands millions have starved in third world countries as a result in the united states alone of the 800 000 who died claimed by the medical bureaucracies well over 600 000 of these deaths were the result of the purposeful neglect of early treatment blocking the use of highly effective and safe repurposed drugs such as hydroxy chloroquine and ivermectin and the forced use of deadly treatments such as remdesivir and use of ventilators this does not count the deaths of despair and neglected medical care caused by the lockdown and hospital measures forced on healthcare systems to compound all this because of vaccine mandates among all hospital personnel thousands of nurses and other hospital workers have resigned or been fired this has resulted in critical shortages of these vital healthcare workers and dangerous reductions of icu beds in many hospitals in addition as occurred in the lewis county healthcare system a specialty hospital system in lowville n y closed its maternity unit following the resignation of 30 hospital staff over the state s disastrous vaccine mandate orders the irony in all these cases of resignations is that the administrators unhesitatingly accepted these mass staffing losses despite rantings about suffering from short staffing during a crisis this is especially puzzling when we learned that the vaccines did not prevent viral transmission and the present predominant variant is of extremely low pathogenicity go to dangers of the vaccines are increasingly revealed by science while most researchers virologists infectious disease researchers and epidemiologists have been intimidated into silence a growing number of high integrity individuals with tremendous expertise have come forward to tell the truth that is that these vaccines are deadly most new vaccines must go through extensive safety testing for years before they are approved new technologies such as the mrna and dna vaccines require a minimum of 10 years of careful testing and extensive follow up these new so called vaccines were tested for only 2 months and then the results of these safety test were and continue to be kept secret testimony before senator ron johnson by several who participated in the 2 months study indicates that virtually no follow up of the participants of the pre release study was ever done complains of complications were ignored and despite promises by pfizer that all medical expenses caused by the vaccines would be paid by pfizer these individuals stated that none were paid some medical expenses exceed 100 000 dollars as an example of the deception by pfizer and the other makers of mrna vaccines is the case of 12 year old maddie de garay who participated in the pfizer vaccine pre release safety study at sen johnson s presentation with the families of the vaccine injured her mother told of her child s recurrent seizures that she is now confined to a wheelchair must be tube fed and suffers permanent brain damage on the pfizer safety evaluation submitted to the fda her only side effect is listed as having a stomachache each person submitted similar horrifying stories the japanese resorted to a foia freedom of information act lawsuit to force pfizer to release its secret biodistribution study the reason pfizer wanted it kept secret is that it demonstrated that pfizer lied to the public and the regulatory agencies about the fate of the injected vaccine contents the mrna enclosed nano lipid carrier they claimed that it remained at the site of the injection the shoulder when in fact their own study found that it rapidly spread throughout the entire body by the bloodstream within 48 hours the study also found that these deadly nano lipid carriers collected in very high concentrations in several organs including the reproductive organs of males and females the heart the liver the bone marrow and the spleen a major immune organ the highest concentration was in the ovaries and the bone marrow these nano lipid carriers also were deposited in the brain dr ryan cole a pathologist from idaho reported a dramatic spike in highly aggressive cancers among vaccinated individuals not reported in the media he found a frighteningly high incidence of highly aggressive cancers in vaccinated individuals especially highly invasive melanomas in young people and uterine cancers in women other reports of activation of previously controlled cancers are also appearing among vaccinated cancer patients thus far no studies have been done to confirm these reports but it is unlikely such studies will be done at least studies funded by grants from the nih the high concentration of spike proteins found in the ovaries in the biodistribution study could very well impair fertility in young women alter menstruation and could put them at an increased risk of ovarian cancer the high concentration in the bone marrow could also put the vaccinated at a high risk of leukemia and lymphoma the leukemia risk is very worrisome now that they have started vaccinating children as young as 5 years of age no long term studies have been conducted by any of these makers of covid 19 vaccines especially as regards the risk of cancer induction chronic inflammation is intimately linked to cancer induction growth and invasion and vaccines stimulate inflammation cancer patients are being told they should get vaccinated with these deadly vaccines this in my opinion is insane newer studies have shown that this type of vaccine inserts the spike protein within the nucleus of the immune cells and most likely many cell types and once there inhibits two very important dna repair enzymes brca1 and 53bp1 whose duty it is to repair damage to the cell s dna unrepaired dna damage plays a major role in cancer there is a hereditary disease called xeroderma pigmentosum in which the dna repair enzymes are defective these ill fated individuals develop multiple skin cancers and a very high incidence of organ cancer as a result here we have a vaccine that does the same thing but to a less extensive degree one of the defective repair enzymes caused by these vaccines is called brca1 which is associated with a significantly higher incidence of breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men it should be noted that no studies were ever done on several critical aspects of this type of vaccine they have never been tested for long term effects they have never been tested for induction of autoimmunity they have never been properly tested for safety during any stage of pregnancy no follow up studies have been done on the babies of vaccinated women there are no long term studies on the children of vaccinated pregnant women after their birth especially as neurodevelopmental milestone occur diabetes heart disease atherosclerosis neurodegenerative diseases neuropsychiatric effects induction of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia long term immune function vertical transmission of defects and disorders cancer autoimmune disorders it has never been tested for effects on a long list of medical conditions previous experience with the flu vaccines clearly demonstrates that the safety studies done by researchers and clinical doctors with ties to pharmaceutical companies were essentially all either poorly done or purposefully designed to falsely show safety and coverup side effects and complications this was dramatically demonstrated with the previously mentioned phony studies designed to indicate that hydroxy chloroquine and ivermectin were ineffective and too dangerous to use these fake studies resulted in millions of deaths and severe health disasters worldwide as stated 80 of all deaths were unnecessary and could have been prevented with inexpensive safe repurposed medications with a very long safety history among millions who have taken them for decades or even a lifetime it is beyond ironic that those claiming that they are responsible for protecting our health approved a poorly tested set of vaccines that has resulted in more deaths in less than a year of use than all the other vaccines combined given over the past 30 years their excuse when confronted was we had to overlook some safety measures because this was a deadly pandemic in 1986 president reagan signed the national childhood vaccine injury act which gave blanket protection to pharmaceutical makers of vaccines against injury litigation by families of vaccine injured individuals the supreme court in a 57 page opinion ruled in favor of the vaccine companies effectively allowing vaccine makers to manufacture and distribute dangerous often ineffective vaccines to the population without fear of legal consequences the court did insist on a vaccine injury compensation system which has paid out only a very small number of rewards to a large number of severely injured individuals it is known that it is very difficult to receive these awards according to the health resources and services administration since 1988 the vaccine injury compensation program vicp has agreed to pay 3 597 awards among 19 098 vaccine injured individuals applying amounting to a total sum of 3 8 billion this was prior to the introduction of the covid 19 vaccines in which the deaths alone exceed all deaths related to all the vaccines combined over a thirty year period in 2018 president trump signed into law the right to try law which allowed the use of experimental drugs and all unconventional treatments to be used in cases of extreme medical conditions as we have seen with the refusal of many hospitals and even blanket refusal by states to allow ivermectin hydroxy chloroquine or any other unapproved official methods to treat even terminal covid 19 cases these nefarious individuals have ignored this law strangely they did not use this same logic or the law when it came to ivermectin and hydroxy chloroquine both of which had undergone extensive safety testing by over 30 clinical studies of a high quality and given glowing reports on both efficacy and safety in numerous countries in addition we had a record of use for up to 60 years by millions of people using these drugs worldwide with an excellent safety record it was obvious that a group of very powerful people in conjunction with pharmaceutical conglomerates didn t want the pandemic to end and wanted vaccines as the only treatment option kennedy s book makes this case using extensive evidence and citations dr james thorpe an expert in maternal fetal medicine demonstrates that these covoid 19 vaccines given during pregnancy have resulted in a 50 fold higher incidence of miscarriage than reported with all other vaccines combined when we examine his graph on fetal malformations there was a 144 fold higher incidence of fetal malformation with the covid 19 vaccines given during pregnancy as compared to all other vaccines combined yet the american academy of obstetrics and gynecology and the american college of obstetrics and gynecology endorse the safety of these vaccines for all stages of pregnancy and among women breast feeding their babies it is noteworthy that these medical specialty groups have received significant funding from pfizer pharmaceutical company the american college of obstetrics and gynecology just in the 4th quarter of 2010 received a total of 11 000 from pfizer pharmaceutical company alone funding from nih grants are much higher the best way to lose these grants is to criticize the source of the funds their products or pet programs peter duesberg because of his daring to question fauci s pet theory of aids caused by hiv virus was no longer awarded any of the 30 grant applications he submitted after going public prior to this episode as the leading authority on retroviruses in the world he had never been turned down for an nih grant this is how the corrupted system works even though much of the grant money comes from our taxes go to hot lots deadly batches of the vaccines a new study has now surfaced the results of which are terrifying a researcher at kingston university in london has completed an extensive analysis of the vaers data a subdepartment of the cdc which collects voluntary vaccine complication data in which he grouped reported deaths following the vaccines according to the manufacturer s lot numbers of the vaccines vaccines are manufactured in large batches called lots what he discovered was that the vaccines are divided into over 20 000 lots and that one out of every 200 of these batches lots is demonstrably deadly to anyone who receives a vaccine from that lot which includes thousands of vaccine doses he examined all manufactured vaccines pfizer moderna johnson and johnson janssen etc he found that among every 200 batches of the vaccine from pfizer and other makers one batch of the 200 was found to be over 50x more deadly than vaccines batches from other lots the other vaccine lots batches were also causing deaths and disabilities but nowhere near to this extent these deadly batches should have appeared randomly among all vaccines if it was an unintentional event however he found that 5 of the vaccines were responsible for 90 of the serious adverse events including deaths the incidence of deaths and serious complications among these hot lots varied from over 1000 to several thousand percent higher than comparable safer lots if you think this was by accident think again this is not the first time hot lots were in my opinion purposefully manufactured and sent across the nation usually vaccines designed for children in one such scandal hot lots of a vaccine ended up all in one state and the damage immediately became evident what was the manufacture s response it wasn t to remove the deadly batches of the vaccine he ordered his company to scatter the hot lots across the nation so that authorities would not see the obvious deadly effect all lots of a vaccine are numbered for example modera labels them with such codes as 013m20a it was noted that the batch numbers ended in either 20a or 21a batches ending in 20a were much more toxic than the ones ending in 21a the batches ending in 20a had about 1700 adverse events versus a few hundred to twenty or thirty events for the 21a batches this example explains why some people had few or no adverse events after taking the vaccine while others are either killed or severely and permanently harmed to see the researcher s explanation go to in my opinion these examples strongly suggest an intentional alteration of the production of the vaccine to include deadly batches i have met and worked with a number of people concerned with vaccine safety and i can tell you they are not the evil anti vaxxers you are told they are they are highly principled moral compassionate people many of which are top researchers and people who have studied the issue extensively robert kennedy jr barbara lou fisher dr meryl nass professor christopher shaw megan redshaw dr sherri tenpenny dr joseph mercola neil z miller dr lucija tomjinovic dr stephanie seneff dr steve kirsch and dr peter mccullough just to name a few these people have nothing to gain and a lot to lose they are attacked viciously by the media government agencies and elite billionaires who think they should control the world and everyone in it go to why did fauci want no autopsies of those who died after vaccination there are many things about this pandemic that are unprecedented in medical history one of the most startling is that at the height of the pandemic so few autopsies especially total autopsies were being done a mysterious virus was rapidly spreading around the world a selected group of people with weakened immune systems were getting seriously ill and many were dying and the one way we could rapidly gain the most knowledge about this virus an autopsy was being discouraged guerriero noted that by the end of april 2020 approximately 150 000 people had died yet there were only 16 autopsies performed and reported in the medical literature among these only seven were complete autopsies the remaining 9 being partial or by needle biopsy or incisional biopsy only after 170 000 deaths by covid 19 and four months into the pandemic were the first series of autopsies actually done that is more than ten and only after 280 000 deaths and another month were the first large series of autopsies performed some 80 in number sperhake in a call for autopsies to be done without question noted that the first full autopsy reported in the literature along with photomicrographs appeared in a medico legal journal from china in february 2020 sperhake expressed confusion as to why there was a reluctance to perform autopsies during the crisis but he knew it was not coming from the pathologists the medical literature was littered with appeals by pathologist for more autopsies to be performed sperhake further noted that the robert koch institute the german health monitoring system at least initially advised against doing autopsies he also knew that at the time 200 participating autopsy institutions in the united states had done at least 225 autopsies among 14 states some have claimed that this dearth of autopsies was based on the government s fear of infection among the pathologists but a study of 225 autopsies on covid 19 cases demonstrated only one case of infection among the pathologist and this was concluded to have been an infection contracted elsewhere guerriero ends his article calling for more autopsies with this observation shoulder to shoulder clinical and forensic pathologists overcame the obstructions of autopsy studies in covid 19 victims and hereby generated valuable knowledge on the pathophysiology of the interaction between the sars cov 2 and the human body thus contributing to our understanding of the disease suspicion concerning the worldwide reluctance of nations to allow full post mortem studies of covid 19 victims may be based on the idea that it was more than by chance there are at least two possibilities that stand out first those leading the progression of this non pandemic event into a perceived worldwide deadly pandemic were hiding an important secret that autopsies could document namely just how many of the deaths were actually caused by the virus to implement draconian measures such as mandated mask wearing lockdowns destruction of businesses and eventually mandated forced vaccination they needed very large numbers of covid 19 infected dead fear would be the driving force for all these destructive pandemic control programs elder et al in his study classified the autopsy findings into four groups certain covid 19 death probably covid 19 death possible covid 19 death not associated with covid 19 despite the positive test what possibly concerned or even terrified the engineers of this pandemic was that autopsies just might and did show that a number of these so called covid 19 deaths in truth died of their comorbid diseases in the vast majority of autopsy studies reported pathologists noted multiple comorbid conditions most of which at the extremes of life could alone be fatal previously it was known that common cold viruses had an 8 mortality in nursing homes in addition valuable evidence could be obtained from the autopsies that would improve clinical treatments and could possibly demonstrate the deadly effect of the cdc mandated protocols all hospitals were required to follow such as the use of respirators and the deadly kidney destroying drug remdesivir the autopsies also demonstrated accumulating medical errors and poor quality care as the shielding of doctors in intensive care units from the eyes of family members inevitably leads to poorer quality care as reported by several nurses working in these areas as bad as all this was the very same thing is being done in the case of covid vaccine deaths very few complete autopsies have been done to understand why these people died that is until recently two highly qualified researchers dr sucharit bhakdi a microbiologist and highly qualified expert in infectious disease and dr arne burkhardt a pathologist who is a widely published authority having been a professor of pathology at several prestigious institutions recently performed autopsies on 15 people having died after vaccination what they found explains why so many are dying and experiencing organ damage and deadly blood clots they determined that 14 of the fifteen people died as a result of the vaccines and not of other causes dr burkhardt the pathologist observed widespread evidence of an immune attack on the autopsied individuals organs and tissues especially their heart this evidence included extensive invasion of small blood vessels with massive numbers of lymphocytes which cause extensive cell destruction when unleashed other organs such as the lungs and liver were observed to have extensive damage as well these findings indicate the vaccines were causing the body to attack itself with deadly consequences one can easily see why anthony fauci as well as public health officers and all who are heavily promoting these vaccines publicly discouraged autopsies on the vaccinated who subsequently died one can also see that in the case of vaccines that were essentially untested prior to being approved for the general public at least the regulatory agencies should have been required to carefully monitor and analyze all serious complications and certainly deaths linked to these vaccines the best way to do that is with complete autopsies while we learned important information from these autopsies what is really needed are special studies of the tissues of those who have died after vaccination for the presence of spike protein infiltration throughout the organs and tissues this would be critical information as such infiltration would result in severe damage to all tissues and organs involved especially the heart the brain and the immune system animal studies have demonstrated this in these vaccinated individuals the source of these spike proteins would be the injected nanolipid carriers of the spike protein producing mrna it is obvious that the government health authorities and pharmaceutical manufacturers of these vaccines do not want these critical studies done as the public would be outraged and demand an end to the vaccination program and prosecution of the involved individuals who covered this up go to conclusions we are all living through one of the most drastic changes in our culture economic system as well as political system in our nation s history as well as the rest of the world we have been told that we will never return to normal and that a great reset has been designed to create a new world order this has all been outlined by klaus schwab head of the world economic forum in his book on the great reset this book gives a great deal of insight as to the thinking of the utopians who are proud to claim this pandemic crisis as their way to usher in a new world this new world order has been on the drawing boards of the elite manipulators for over a century in this paper i have concentrated on the devastating effects this has had on the medical care system in the united states but also includes much of the western world in past papers i have discussed the slow erosion of traditional medical care in the united states and how this system has become increasingly bureaucratized and regimented this process was rapidly accelerating but the appearance of this in my opinion manufactured pandemic has transformed our health care system over night as you have seen an unprecedented series of events have taken place within this system hospital administrators for example assumed the position of medical dictators ordering doctors to follow protocols derived not from those having extensive experience in treating this virus but rather from a medical bureaucracy that has never treated a single covid 19 patient the mandated use of respirators on icu covid 19 patients for example was imposed in all medical systems and dissenting physicians were rapidly removed from their positions as caregivers despite their demonstration of markedly improved treatment methods further doctors were told to use the drug remdesivir despite its proven toxicity lack of effectiveness and high complication rate they were told to use drugs that impaired respiration and mask every patient despite the patient s impaired breathing in each case those who refused to abuse their patients were removed from the hospital and even faced a loss of license or worse for the first time in modern medical history early medical treatment of these infected patients was ignored nationwide studies have shown that early medical treatment was saving 80 of higher number of these infected people when initiated by independent doctors early treatment could have saved over 640 000 lives over the course of this pandemic despite the demonstration of the power of these early treatments the forces controlling medical care continued this destructive policy families were not allowed to see their loved ones forcing these very sick individuals in the hospitals to face their deaths alone to add insult to injury funerals were limited to a few grieving family members who were not allowed to even sit together all the while large stores such as walmart and cosco were allowed to operate with minimal restrictions nursing home patients were also not allowed to have family visitations again being forced to die a lonely death all the while in a number of states the most transparent being in new york state infected elderly were purposefully transferred from hospitals into nursing homes resulting in a very high death rates of these nursing home residents at the beginning of this pandemic over 50 of all death were occurring in nursing homes throughout this pandemic we have been fed an unending series of lies distortions and disinformation by the media the public health officials medical bureaucracies cdc fda and who and medical associations physicians scientists and experts in infectious treatments who formed associations designed to develop more effective and safer treatments were regularly demonized harassed shamed humiliated and experience a loss of licensure loss of hospital privileges and in at least one case ordered to have a psychiatric examination anthony fauci was given essentially absolute control of all forms of medical care during this event including insisting that drugs he profited from be used by all treating physicians he ordered the use of masks despite at first laughing at the use of masks to filter a virus governors mayors and many businesses followed his orders without question the draconian measures being used masking lockdowns testing of the uninfected use of the inaccurate pcr test social distancing and contact tracing had been shown previously to be of little or no use during previous pandemics yet all attempts to reject these methods were to no avail some states ignored these draconian orders and had either the same or fewer cases as well as deaths as the states with the most strictly enforced measures again no amount of evidence or obvious demonstration along these lines had any effect on ending these socially destructive measures even when entire countries such as sweden which avoided all these measures demonstrated equal rates of infections and hospitalization as nations with the strictest very draconian measures no policy change by the controlling institutions occurred no amount of evidence changed anything experts in the psychology of destructive events such as economic collapses major disasters and previous pandemics demonstrated that draconian measures come with an enormous cost in the form of deaths of despair and in a dramatic increase in serious psychological disorders the effects of these pandemic measures on children s neurodevelopment is catastrophic and to a large extent irreversible over time tens of thousands could die as a result of this damage even when these predictions began to appear the controllers of this pandemic continued full steam ahead drastic increases in suicides a rise in obesity a rise in drug and alcohol use a worsening of many health measures and a terrifying rise in psychiatric disorders especially depression and anxiety were ignored by the officials controlling this event we eventually learned that many of the deaths were a result of medical neglect individuals with chronic medical conditions diabetes cancer cardiovascular disease and neurological diseases were no longer being followed properly in their clinics and doctor s offices non emergency surgeries were put on hold many of these patients chose to die at home rather than risk going to the hospitals and many considered hospitals death houses records of deaths have shown that there was a rise in deaths among those aged 75 and older mostly explained by covid 19 infections but for those between the ages of 65 to 74 deaths had been increasing well before the pandemic onset between ages of 18 and aged 65 years records demonstrate a shocking hike in non covid 19 deaths some of these deaths were explained by a dramatic increase in drug related deaths some 20 000 more than 2019 alcohol related deaths also increased substantially and homicides increased almost 30 in the 18 to 65 year group the head of the insurance company oneamerica stated that their data indicated that the death rate for individuals aged 18 to 64 had increased 40 over the pre pandemic period scott davidson the company s ceo stated that this represented the highest death rate in the history of insurance records which does extensive data collections on death rates each year davidson also noted that this high of a death rate increase has never been seen in the history of death data collection previous catastrophes of monumental extent increased death rates no more than 10 percent 40 is unprecedented dr lindsay weaver indiana s chief medical officer stated that hospitalizations in indiana are higher than at any point in the past five years this is of critical importance since the vaccines were supposed to significantly reduce deaths but the opposite has happened hospitals are being flooded with vaccine complications and people in critical condition from medical neglect caused by the lockdowns and other pandemic measures a dramatic number of these people are now dying with the spike occurring after the vaccines were introduced the lies flowing from those who have appointed themselves as medical dictators are endless first we were told that the lockdown would last only two weeks they lasted over a year then we were told that masks were ineffective and did not need to be worn quickly that was reversed then we were told the cloth mask was very effective now it s not and everyone should be wearing an n95 mask and before that that they should double mask we were told there was a severe shortage of respirators then we discover they are sitting unused in warehouses and in city dumps still in their packing crates we were informed that the hospitals were filled mostly with the unvaccinated and later found the exact opposite was true the world over we were told that the vaccine was 95 effective only to learn that in fact the vaccines cause a progressive erosion of innate immunity upon release of the vaccines women were told the vaccines were safe during all states of pregnancy only to find out no studies had been done on safety during pregnancy during the safety tests prior to release of the vaccine we were told that careful testing on volunteers before the eua approval for public use demonstrated extreme safety of the vaccines only to learn that these unfortunate subjects were not followed medical complications caused by the vaccines were not paid for and the media covered this all up we also learned that the pharmaceutical makers of the vaccines were told by the fda that further animal testing was unnecessary the general public would be the guinea pigs incredibly we were told that the pfizer s new mrna vaccines had been approved by the fda which was a cleaver deception in that another vaccine had approval comirnaty and not the one being used the biontech vaccine the approved comirnaty vaccine was not available in the united states the national media told the public that the pfizer vaccine had been approved and was no longer classed as experimental a blatant lie these deadly lies continue it is time to stop this insanity and bring these people to justice go to footnotes how to cite this article blaylock rl covid update what is the

local businesses are at the heart of our community they shape the character of our towns and keep our economy churning employing workers providing us with critical goods and services and drawing in out of towners to spend their dollars here in contrast to the ceos and shareholders of mega corporations who see our county as little more than a location where they could potentially reap a profit local business owners are invested in the well being of our community as a whole because it s their community as well they send their kids to our schools enjoy our local landscape drink our water breathe our air and keep savings in our banks while we have certainly experienced lucrative boom times when huge corporations have invested in projects here in our county it s always a gamble they will invest in a project when it serves their bottom line but abandon the project as soon as that calculation shifts if we want to build a strong resilient economy we need to limit our reliance on multinational corporations and build up our local business community placing our future in the hands of corporations that care nothing about our community is a risky proposition this month marks the 40th anniversary of when garfield county learned this lesson in a big way exxon terminated its colony shale oil project on may 2 1982 and our community went from boom to bust practically overnight over 2 100 people were suddenly jobless and the local economy was plunged into an economic depression that lasted almost a decade banks failed people s homes and businesses were foreclosed in droves though exxon s decision was an economic disaster for our community it was great news for exxon shareholders the value of their stock increased significantly after the project was axed this kind of situation is still business as usual and the standard today corporate executives make cold hearted decisions based on profit margins and earnings for shareholders all while the rest of us are left holding the bag currently we feel the impact of greedy corporate decision making every time we fill up our gas tanks prices have soared since russia s invasion of ukraine higher gas prices mean an increase in the cost of shipping which increases the price of almost everything the cost of living is rising across the board meanwhile the biggest oil and gas corporations have been raking in record profits shell recently reported its largest ever quarterly profit 9 1 billion corporate executives are using these windfall profits to line their pockets and the pockets of their shareholders when they could be using those billions to lower the price of gas or they could be re hiring workers who have been laid off in recent years instead they have shown the same disregard for their workers that they have for years in 2021 these companies laid off 60 000 workers even though they pocketed 8 2 billion in pandemic stimulus funding do we really want to entrust the future of our county to corporate executives that are making these kinds of decisions it s time to re examine how our tax dollars are being spent with regard to the economic development of our communities since 2019 garfield county commissioners have spent close to 2 million of county funds trying to woo back the multi national fossil fuel industry many of these funds have been spent on out of town pr firms and expensive denver attorneys at the same time the commissioners record for investing in local businesses is dismal during the first year of covid 19 they refused to follow the lead of glenwood springs which provided small grants to help local restaurant owners weather the pandemic this past march the commissioners neglected to approve a one time 10 000 investment in a regional housing coalition even though the housing crisis is keeping businesses from hiring needed workers at the same meeting the commissioners approved their annual 5 000 fee for a pro oil and gas development group working on another jordan cove type pipe dream there are creative proactive ways we could be investing county funds to strengthen our local business community we could develop efforts to convince people to shop locally rather than online we could work to bring light manufacturing businesses to the county and we could take inspiration from eagle county where commissioners initiated four early childhood provider support programs after access to child care was identified as a major barrier to business ability to attract and retain employees we need our elected leaders to be forward thinking and innovative rather than throwing money at the fossil fuel industry while local businesses miss out on real chances to grow we need leaders who will invest county funds in ways that strengthen our local business community and develop our self reliance as a community let s be certain that we re firmly holding the reins to our economic future confident in the direction we re heading debbie bruell of carbondale chairs the garfield county democrats
a closely divided house approved legislation thursday to crack down on alleged price gouging by oil companies and other energy producers as prices at the pump continue to soar a bill backed by house democrats would give president joe biden authority to declare an energy emergency that would make it unlawful to increase gasoline and home energy fuel prices in an excessive or exploitative manner the bill directs the federal trade commission to punish companies that engage in price gouging at a time when people across the country are feeling the pinch at the gas pump congress needs to be doing

as morgan fabry drives around chicago looking for baby formula that is in short supply she can t help but be bothered by comments from people who don t understand why she can t breastfeed exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life by major medical entities like the world health organization giving rise to the saying breast is best but breastfeeding doesn t work for everyone and that mantra is only adding to the stress fabry and other parents feel as the shortage drags on the bottom line is fed is best said fabry 34 i m getting triggered by people who say oh just breastfeed at the center of the shortage is the largest domestic manufacturing plant in michigan which the u s government is working to reopen the biden administration is also allowing more imports from other countries corryn chini avoided the baby formula aisle during her grocery shopping trip in dayton ohio this week with enough formula in her cupboard at home for a week or two there was no sense in letting the empty shelves trigger feelings of anxiety and guilt for chini the guilt comes from lingering feelings of failure after she was unable to exclusively breastfeed starting with her first baby in 2018 jane varghese williams has grappled with feelings of guilt around not breastfeeding her son who has a feeding disability since he was born last november breastfeeding was a huge struggle and i felt an immense amount of guilt around not succeeding chini said in the end i was never able to produce enough and we had a late diagnosis of tongue tie and it was a mess when i had my second i thought i can do this i can advocate for myself and again it just didn t work her youngest evangeline was born three months ago chini is supplementing with formula there are various barriers to breastfeeding including medical issues for the baby or mom and work and living conditions dr lori feldman winter chair of the american academy of pediatrics breastfeeding group said exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is recommended and safe for most babies but meeting the recommendations can be very challenging infants with an uncommon condition called classic galactosemia are unable to metabolize sugar in breast milk and need to be fed formula feldman winter said some medical conditions make it difficult for women to breastfeed and it isn t recommended for those with hiv or undergoing cancer treatment and exclusive breastfeeding is difficult for working women who have to pump repeatedly throughout the day there s even greater barriers in underserved areas women working for hourly wages in low paying jobs those women tend to have even fewer supports to be able to continue to breastfeed stress releases a hormone that makes it difficult to produce milk she said millions of babies in the u s rely on formula which is the only source of nutrition recommended for infants who aren t exclusively breastfed shortages have forced some parents to switch formulas which doctors say is fine in most cases but two children in memphis tennessee were recently hospitalized due to a switch in formula related to the shortage dr mark corkins of the le bonheur children s hospital told the associated press wednesday the division chief of pediatric gastroenterology at the hospital said the two children who previously required a specific dietary needs formula were admitted earlier this month for dehydration after the parents attempted to switch to a separate formula one child was discharged tuesday while the other remained in the hospital in stable condition the two received iv fluids and supplemental nutrition when isabel ramos gave birth in february she worked hard to try to breastfeed her son believing it would be beneficial for his immune system and enhance the mother child connection she tried pumping and worked with lactation consultants but the infant wouldn t latch onto her breast you feel like a failure because you re not able to give your baby what it needs and what it wants said the first time mom from lawrenceville georgia because of the stigma it took her a while to tell people she wasn t breastfeeding she s struggling with those feelings again because she keeps hearing things from relatives and strangers online like she should try harder to breastfeed because of the formula shortage a lot of men have opinions on it i m sorry are you trying to breastfeed then no leave me alone ana rodney who runs momcares a baltimore organization that provides baby supplies and support to new mothers in the city s black community said the shortage has hit many families there hard formula feeding is typically more common among black women often because they don t get breastfeeding encouragement or support from the white medical community rodney said breastfeeding requires time being able to sit with your baby being able to bond with your baby and working on your milk supply not being able to go back to work she said it s not that easy for some of us even if we want to callie salaymeh s baby hazel was just a couple of weeks old when salaymeh found blood in her diaper and took her to a chicago emergency room the baby had an intolerance to some of the proteins in salaymeh s breastmilk and cutting foods from salaymeh s own diet didn t help hazel had to be switched to a special prescription formula for babies with gastrointestinal conditions the shortage felt like it hit us before it hit the general public salaymeh said when her pharmacy called to say the prescription formula was out of stock when they had just one can left salaymeh began mixing the prescription formula with an over the counter formula for babies with sensitive tummies until more of the prescription formula could be found they mixed formulas for about three weeks hoping little hazel wouldn t get sick luckily hazel seemed to do fine with the mix and salaymeh hopes she might soon outgrow the food intolerance as most babies eventually do before her twins arrived five weeks early alexandra clark of sawyer michigan decided she would breastfeed and supplement with formula working full time as owner of a detroit chocolate company clark knew she d be facing enough new mom challenges without trying to produce enough milk for two babies clark 34 said she s grateful for support even from friends with a breast is best mindset instead of feeling judgment some of my really breastfeeding advocate friends who are still lactating have offered to pump for me if i need it which is pretty much the kindest thing ever clark said

commencement of loan repayments won t make a dent in reserves by sanath nanayakkare the amount of foreign reserves possessed by the central bank of sri lanka is now poised to exceed u5d 5 billion and the commencement of foreign loan repayments in the coming months won t make a dent in current reserves state minister of finance ranjith siyambalapitiya told the media yesterday responding to a query from the media whether the commencement of foreign debt repayments could see an immediate dip in the reserve levels the state minister said that the whole objective of debt restructuring is to avert a significant depletion of foreign reserves the debt restructuring process agreed with bilateral creditors and commercial creditors is being designed to ensure effective management of our foreign reserves it is all about adjusting our loan repayments in line with the central bank s foreign reserves the balance of payment bop transactions which consist of imports and exports of goods services remittances as well as transfer payments will be executed in a way that won t put pressure on foreign reserves he said however he mentioned that the government would not completely remove its ban on importing vehicles any time soon as it is a key measure of keeping tabs on foreign exchange outflows the central bank acquired this desired level of foreign reserves by purchasing us dollars from the market this is a favourable development all import bans and restrictions have now been lifted except for vehicle imports that too we are opening according to emerging requirements for example we have allowed the importation of 750 vans and 250 buses to be deployed for tourist transportation as the requirement for it was justified in a similar manner vehicle imports will be allowed in accordance with the requirements so in future vehicle imports will be allowed only if the government sees the genuine need for that he said when the island financial review contacted ranjith sudasinghe vice president of sri lanka chauffeur tourist guide lecturers association he said that members of their association would be at risk when they don t get new vehicles for tourist transportation while only select big companies in the industry would get them we have made repeated appeals to sri lanka tourism authorities pointing out that our vehicles are old and tourists won t find them appropriate for a round tour of sri lanka even destination management companies dmcs would reject our vehicles when they get new vehicles so the authorities should create a level playing field for all tourist transportation stakeholders the government should consider allowing us to import vehicles at a concessional duty rate after an assessment of the conditions of our vehicles farmers get fertilize subsidies fisher folks get facilities from the government but the chauffeur guides are receiving a step motherly treatment from the authorities which is not fair we are only asking to replace our old tourist vehicles with news ones at a concessional duty rate at present we are charging less than what a three wheeler charges per kilometer because we are told to be competitive with fares in the regional countries now with the new tourist vehicles coming in and we have been left out of the process we are going to be squeezed out of our livelihoods he said

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox washington a closely divided house approved legislation thursday to crack down on alleged price gouging by oil companies and other energy producers as prices at the pump continue to soar a bill backed by house democrats would give president joe biden authority to declare an energy emergency that would make it unlawful to increase gasoline and home energy fuel prices in an excessive or exploitative manner the bill directs the federal trade commission to punish companies that engage in price gouging and adds a new unit at the ftc to monitor fuel markets at a time when people across the country are feeling the pinch at the gas pump congress needs to be doing all it can to bring down costs for american families said rep kim schrier d wash who co sponsored the bill she called it infuriating that spikes in gas prices were happening at the same time that gas and oil companies are making record profits and taking advantage of international crises to make a profit this must stop the measure was approved 217 207 republicans unanimously opposed the bill along with four democrats it now goes to the senate where a similar bill faces steep odds amid a 50 50 split between democrats and republicans the focus on price gouging comes as gas prices hit an average of 4 59 per gallon thursday 49 cents a gallon higher than a month ago and 1 55 higher than a year ago according to aaa exxonmobil chevron and other major oil companies announced surging profits totaling more than 40 billion in the first quarter of the year a fact democrats repeatedly cited in floor debate many of the companies are spending billions on stock buybacks and dividend payments to investors big oil is price gouging families because they can said rep katie porter d calif another co sponsor enough is enough republicans and industry groups called the bill misguided saying there is no evidence of price gouging oil is a global commodity and prices are set on the global market gas prices rose late last year amid supply chain problems and increased demand as the economy recovered following the covid 19 pandemic but prices have spiked ever higher since russia s feb 24 invasion of ukraine the u s has banned imports of russian oil and other countries are seeking alternatives to russian energy driving prices up biden aware of the political stakes has vowed to do all he can to ease pain at the pump for american families including ordering release of record amounts of oil from the nation s strategic reserve white house press secretary karine jean pierre said biden welcomes all ideas to protect consumers and to make sure that oil companies aren t taking advantage of russian president vladimir putin s war and are competing fairly republicans say the answer to higher gas prices is to increase production here in the united states louisiana rep steve scalise the no 2 house republican called the bill an attempt by democrats to distract and shift blame from the administration s self inflicted energy and inflation crisis scalise called the bill a socialist price fixing scheme that hurts small businesses and consumers the most he accused democrats of politicizing the ftc by giving the commission wide ranging powers based on undefined parameters that will allow it to usurp market forces and set government controlled gasoline prices rep chris pappas d n h said the bill was needed the price of crude oil fell last month yet the prices consumers pay at the pump continued to rise we have to put an end to this corporate profiteering and give families relief he said the american exploration and production council a lobbying group that represents independent oil and gas producers called the bill counter productive energy prices are determined by supply and demand not false accusations of price gouging motivated by the upcoming election said anne bradbury the group s ceo the house vote comes as interior secretary deb haaland said she will release a long delayed five year plan that allows interior to conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales the current plan expires june 30 and administration officials had not said when or if a replacement would be released even as they canceled three offshore lease sales scheduled in the gulf of mexico and off the alaska coast haaland told the senate energy committee the new plan will be made public by june 30 the plan does not issue specific leases or authorize any drilling project as we take this next step we will follow the science and the law as we always do haaland said thursday vowing a robust and transparent review process that includes input from states the public and tribes the biden administration has come under pressure to increase u s crude production as fuel prices spike because of the pandemic and the war in ukraine biden also faces pressure from democrats and environmental groups urging him to do more to combat climate change even as his legislative proposals on climate and clean energy remain stalled in a sharply divided congress sen joe manchin a west virginia democrat who chairs the energy panel and plays an outsized role on energy policy said thursday that even as we see russia wage a war enabled by energy insecurity in europe this administration has made its opposition to domestic oil and gas production crystal clear manchin said he supported a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters announced by biden soon after taking office in january 2021 by last summer he told haaland the time for a pause had come and gone now 16 months after the pause was announced we still have no new leases manchin said i m sorry to say it has become crystal clear that the pause is in fact a ban interior conducted an offshore lease sale last fall responding to a court order but the sale was later vacated by a federal judge the administration has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly western states however officials scaled back the amount of land offered for drilling and raised royalty rates charged to energy companies by 50 the four democrats who opposed the house bill are reps lizzie fletcher of texas jared golden of maine stephanie murphy of florida and kathleen rice of new york

the center square public pensions in pennsylvania have a transparency problem though the public retirement systems pay performance based fees to investment managers these fees aren t reported or publicly available their costs however can be quite high pennsylvania s public pensions have some of the lowest funding ratios in the country the more fees the state pays out the harder it is to ensure worker retirements are fully funded a proposed bill would change that state of affairs requiring pension fund fees to be reported to the general assembly allowing the public to know how much investment managers earn from public pensions hb1671 sponsored by rep brett miller r lancaster echoes the recommendations from a 2018 public pension management and asset investment review commission report on the commonwealth s pension issues it was fascinating to me that for alternative investments in particular in pennsylvania a member of the general assembly could not get the fees miller said a member a beneficiary a recipient of pension funds could not know what the fees were no member of the public could get these fees it seemed to me to be counterintuitive in what we believe in about transparency those fees are not a trifling matter these hidden fees can amount to hundreds of millions even billions of dollars which ultimately take away from pension fund balances needed to pay pension obligations miller wrote in a legislative memo those pension obligations are not fully funded though the retirement systems have improved in recent years the public school employees retirement system was only 59 2 funded in 2021 while the state employee retirement system was 59 4 funded in 2020 that means psers has an unfunded accrued liability of 44 billion and sers has a liability of 22 4 billion the tax foundation ranked pennsylvania 41st in the nation for its funding of state pension systems the national average is closer to a funding ratio of 72 the bill would require the public school employees retirement board and the state employees retirement board to livestream their meetings and post a written record of their meetings online other records relating to the boards investments would be deemed public with some exceptions for sensitive information alternative investment vehicles which are investments that aren t stocks or bonds such as real estate transactions would be subject to more disclosure requirements such as rates of return on those investments most importantly management fees costs and expenses paid for those investments would become publicly available sers and psers would also be required to post the fees performance of all investments and an itemized list of fees and expenses paid to investment managers along with travel or other expenses for system staff paid by an external investment manager fund or consultant better awareness of the fees could mean better management of public pensions the ability of the tax base to fund public pensions is a huge huge issue miller said success an email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup error there was an error processing your request get our free newsletters never miss a headline with northcentralpa com newsletters sign up today morning headlines would you like to receive our daily morning newsletter afternoon update what s happening today here s your update daily obits get a daily list straight to your email inbox

bally s stock sentiment close to bottom says analyst posted on may 19 2022 02 40h last updated on may 19 2022 03 06h bally s nyse baly is among the many repudiated gaming equities a 12 month decline of 53 49 confirms as much but at least one analyst says sentiment on the downtrodden name is nearing a bottom bally s casino in kanas city an analyst says more clarity is on the way for the stock image bally s in a note to clients stifel s jeffrey stantial reiterates a buy rating on the regional casino operator with a 49 price target implying the shares can nearly double from a close of 25 14 today the note arrives following the research firm s meetings with key bally s executives as the analyst notes some of the overhang weighing on bally s stock is attributable to complexity execution and messaging some of those issues arrived by way of hedge fund standard general bally s biggest shareholder attempting to acquire the gaming company for 38 a share and the casino operator ultimately rejecting that offer the rhode island based company proceeded to make a tender offer for 500 million worth of its stock a move that may have further muddied the near term waters based on our recent discussions with investors we expect complexity and unclear messaging have been key drivers of underperformance of late specifically we heard questions throughout our meetings regarding 1 the decision to launch a tender rather than agreeing to the standard general takeout offer and 2 an announcement of the tender ahead of receiving financing notes stantial the analyst believes that as management adds clarity to the stock s story and as online gaming and regulatory trends improve in the uk among other factors upside is possible bally s stock has catalysts drawbacks undoubtedly bally s has catalysts those include its status as a dedicated buyer of its own shares a restrained approach to marketing spending on domestic online casinos and sportsbooks and growth in the uk other positives include the operator owning the bulk of the real estate on which it operates gaming venues the potential for a japan footprint and the possibility of balance sheet firming moves conversely there are points of concern in the investment community too those include how the operator will finance improvements at tropicana las vegas as well plans to build a 1 7 billion integrated resort in chicago an effort that s already encountering resistance among local politicians we came away from our meetings with the impression that management fully understands the concerns in the market today and recognizes it is incumbent on them to improve messaging and simplify the story moving forward which we see likely improving as quickly as alongside the planned tender adds stantial bally s stock somewhat misunderstood down 34 year to date it s not a stretch to say bally s stock is one of the more misunderstood stories in the gaming industry as stifel s stantial points out investors may not be giving the operator adequate credit for factors such as added atlantic city room supply improved player quality the addition of a convention center at its lake tahoe venue completion of kansas city expansion and various cost cutting moves all told despite recent volatility we see more of an upside bias to consensus estimates for the casinos segment despite conservative commentary on lower income play keeping us constructive on the brick mortar business despite very tempered investor expectations concludes the analyst

corbis via getty images this year could be your best chance in a generation to get into an m7 business school like harvard stanford gsb wharton or columbia according to my colleagues at fortuna admissions as business industry experts and former mba admissions directors to the world s top mba programs we have been observing the changing political and economic cycles that influence application volume including the historic uncertainty wrought by the pandemic and its uneven impacts around the world given our analysis of market forces and what we re seeing in candidate activity we believe the upcoming admissions season of 2022 23 to be a once in a lifetime opportunity why here s the context we saw near record mba application volume prior to the pandemic nudging some 10 000 applications to harvard business school and over 8 000 to stanford gsb this was then pushed further across the rest of the world s top business schools during the first wave of covid lockdowns none of us will forget march 2020 it was like turning on a tap and there was suddenly a deluge of people throwing their hats into the ring to apply to business school says fortuna s caroline diarte edwards former insead director of admissions and financial aid when job security was reaching its most uncertain anyone who had imagined pursuing an mba in the future decided that moment had come at fortuna we received a surge of demand from individuals looking to exit the workforce to pursue an mba in the hopes of sharpening their skill sets building their credentials gaining broader experience and building networks that would put them on stronger ground when the economy restabilized but now a strong us job market is postponing domestic appetite for an mba and employers are working hard to keep their top talent the graduate management admission council gmac has indicates a decline of around 25 in gmat test taking volume and though the gre picks up some slack as an alternative standardized testing option the number of us candidates planning to apply this year has clearly slowed the international picture is more mixed at fortuna we speak every year with mba hopefuls from over 120 countries and witness first hand changing attitudes and ambitions with a change of administration in the white house 18 months ago and a more encouraging message about h1b visas applications from india have soared fortuna estimates a more than 30 uptick in indian demand for top us b schools chinese applicants however haven t come back yet and we may need to see more stable geopolitical relations for that to happen and with such a strong us dollar there s fitful demand for us programs in the latin american market while european candidates seem happy with shorter programs in their back yard but here s the big unknown the volatility of the financial markets since the start of the year with seven uninterrupted weeks of s p 500 decline as i write this article has many people asking if the fed s moves to tame inflation with a calendar of interest rate hikes will be the catalyst for a recession and if that plays out in the second half of 2022 we ll see applicant numbers to the top b schools climb again in the world of mba admissions there is often a marked counter cycle broadly speaking when the economy is thriving people are reluctant to leave their jobs and aren t necessarily motivated to pursue a business education when the economy tanks as it did when the dot com bubble burst in 2001 or the financial crisis of 2008 09 people figure it is a great time to go back to school fortuna admissions fortuna s judith silverman hodara was acting director of wharton admissions when lehman brothers collapsed in 2008 kicking off an unprecedented global recession i remember that day incredibly well says judith we all looked at each other and said wow hold on to your hats because we are about to get a deluge of applications for the next cycle a lot of people recognize that it s a good place to park yourself for two years and to gain some invaluable skills it s within this dynamic context that my fortuna admissions colleagues and i discussed application strategies for round 1 in september 2022 versus round 2 in january 2023 during our most recent mba admissions masterclass why this year it s better to apply in round 1 vs round 2 ride the wave while round 1 application volume will likely be down unless you are an indian male engineer a recession in the second half of the year will see round 2 picking up again but the mba admissions offices of boston palo alto and philadelphia can only work with what they have in front of them at any given time and will still look to fill half of next year s class in round 1 with the lower volumes they are likely to receive instead of a 1 in 10 chance at hbs your admissions odds may be considerably better again this is a pretty unusual place that we re in right now where we see the pressure building in terms of applicant numbers explains my co director caroline diarte edwards now it s as if you re looking at it like an ocean you ve still got time to ride in the wave before the bigger wave is coming in behind you right now in the final push for mba classes starting in the fall of 2022 schools are clearing more people than expected from the waitlists because others are hesitating about going off to business school they re getting promotions they re getting pay rises they re getting great job offers with a strong job market if you re a management consultant or a back office investment banker both of which are overrepresented profiles in the mba applicant pool the strong job market is an indicator that fewer of your colleagues may be motivated to apply right now this could be your chance to stand out in an otherwise crowded pool caution don t rush an unfinished application that said while applying in round 1 may be an advantage do not rush to submit a hurried and under weight application can you credibly say that your application will be at its best in this round if not it s far better to wait until round 2 as caroline says the single most important thing you can do when you hit submit on your mba application is to be confident that it s the very best reflection of you and your candidacy no matter which admissions round you re targeting it s not round 1 or never and it s important to keep some perspective if you start now on your mba applications you will need to set aside time to prepare and take the gmat or the gre start the process of researching the schools and connecting with students or alumni and dive into the self reflection required to produce compelling applications for your top choice schools you might decide you re going to apply to just one or two of your top schools for round 1 and maybe one or two of your mid tier schools in round 2 to spread your efforts out the long term roi of pursuing your mba now but stepping back for a moment even if your company is trying to keep you with offers of promotion and a salary increase is that really going to give you the momentum to change lives change organizations change the world as stanford gsb likes to put it going to business school is one of the biggest decisions and investments you will make but is also one of the most rewarding not just financially but in what you learn about yourself and what you can achieve how you build your self confidence and open new doors and become part of an extraordinary network that is there to support you we know that mckinsey and others are now hiring associates with eye watering starting salaries which can send an unspoken message what s the value of the mba that s what s giving some people pause about heading off to business school right now others are questioning whether it makes sense for them financially to go to business school so it s essential to take a long term perspective in study after study whether it s in the short term or in the longer term particularly if you go to a top program you will see an impressive return financially over time and that doesn t factor myriad other benefits in speaking with prospective candidates who are on the fence i encourage them to think beyond the thrill of that extra 15 000 in salary that might entice them to stay put another year corbis via getty images there are a lot of unquantifiable aspects as well reminds caroline for one an mba gives you the ability to change careers not just when you come out of the mba initially but at any point in your career it opens doors that otherwise might have remained closed and gives you a network of support it also gives you a solid foundation of skills to tackle running any part of a business you re not stuck in a particular function whether it s finance or marketing but you have the credibility and the confidence to tackle any challenge that comes your way the current economic cycle is one of many still to come adds caroline i ve seen it myself with my own peer group from the insead class of 03 and also in my husband s peer group from the stanford gsb class of 98 you imagine that your career is going to be this constant upward trajectory over time but it s often a roller coaster even for the best qualified people and the most talented people unexpected things happen it s incredibly valuable to have that strong foundation that credential and that network of people who are willing to help you when you when you face an unexpected challenge when did it ever make sense to not invest in yourself
this month thailand dropped its cumbersome on arrival testing procedure after getting rid of the pre departure test in april all of this is reason for optimism fisher says we re very grateful for the government support i think once the borders fully open more thais will take the opportunity to go out and more foreigners will come in like singapore malaysia vietnam and south korea thailand is now open to all vaccinated travellers though you still need to get covid 19 insurance and permission to enter in the form of the thai travel pass a health and quarantine checklist singapore requires a similar form but the vast testing facility at changi airport has disappeared and been replaced by people with luggage passenger traffic doubled to more than 40 per cent of pre covid levels in may compared to just under 20 per cent in march while this is encouraging europe and the us are streets ahead foot traffic is up at jewel changi airport mall in singapore bloomberg regrettably asia continues to lag the recovery willie walsh director general of the international air transport association iata said in singapore this week in the first three months of this year international air traffic worldwide was back to 48 per cent of what it was in 2019 in europe north america and latin america the recovery has reached around 60 per cent walsh told the changi aviation summit asia is at just 17 per cent of pre pandemic levels but take out china and there are some hopeful signs across south east asia the relaxation of restrictions is prompting airlines to rebuild schedules the latest data from consultancy cirium shows the number of departing seats from thailand in the second quarter is 12 26 million it s a glass half full situation you can either compare it to the month before in which case it looks great because the number of seats doubled or go back to 2019 and realise it s still down 50 per cent the big issue that south east asia faces in terms of attracting international tourists this year is competition says hannah pearson founding partner of kuala lumpur based tourism consultancy pear anderson so many countries have now re opened she says the region may have missed the boat when it comes to attracting europeans for mid year holidays yes south east asia has removed a lot of the testing restrictions and the quarantine restrictions and that s a massive step forward but for many countries you still have to apply beforehand there are still hoops to jump through advertisement the war in ukraine has increased the cost of jet fuel and led to reroutes for those flying from northern europe in addition to a longer more expensive flights they also face the added inconvenience of having to apply through a system all of that could lead you to think it s not worth it pearson says recovery could take years suphajee suthumpun is chief executive of the dusit international group a hospitality group listed on the thailand stock exchange from her vantage point in bangkok she expects the recovery will take years it won t be this year or even next when everything returns to normal and there are 40 million tourists arriving and we won t be able to do everything the same way we did before in the past we have focused on providing warm care respect and personalised service post covid we have to add more elements we will need to add more local connections and local experiences at chiang mai airport in thailand s north about 740 kilometres from bangkok international arrivals are greeted by a well oiled machine staff helpfully hold up signs listing the three documents needed at immigration passport travel pass and arrival card the gleaming terminal is clearly set up to handle a steady stream of international visitors at the moment it s barely a trickle there s more than 20 planes coming from bangkok each day but only one or two international flights operated by low cost asian airlines such as scoot which flies from singapore in 2019 some 11 million tourists visited chiang mai a city that has a population of about 450 000 earlier this month the thai hotels association reported the hotel booking rate in the city is around 15 per cent thai travellers accounted for the majority of guests chiang mai s once bustling night bazaar is a shadow of its former self stall operators almost outnumber the tourists the city is slowly coming back says edward snoeks general manager of the meliá chiang mai hotel which opened last month snoeks moved to chiang mai in 2020 to oversee the complete refurbishment of the hotel after a change in ownership for the last two years the only thing that has been happening here is us when i first came the shops and restaurants were still open then they gradually started to disappear everyone here relied on tourism here either directly or indirectly and it was just gone advertisement last week around 40 per cent of the available rooms in his hotel were occupied it s a gradual opening and he s taking heart from the number of inquiries and forward bookings that are coming through every week is better than the one before the testing requirements were an obstacle with the recent changes i think travellers are more confident about coming to thailand before the pandemic finn air and qatar airways flew direct to chiang mai as well asian flag carriers including singapore airlines travellers from europe and the uk would stay for a couple of days looking at the temples within and beyond the old city s wall and perhaps venturing up to the mountainous city of chiang rai near the borders of laos and myanmar it may take a while for visitors from the northern hemisphere to return in large numbers but snoeks notes chiang mai has many fans singapore has always been good for us and traditionally taiwan korea and hong kong those markets are just starting again now except for hong kong although we have heard flights will start again from there in july i feel quite optimistic thailand has a history of rebounding quickly our message to international visitors is we re ready

an annual survey of the chesapeake bay has found the blue crab population at its lowest level since scientists began tracking the beleaguered species more than 30 years ago the finding is expected to set off discussions about whether to tighten restrictions on crab harvests such as what size crabs commercial watermen can legally collect how many female crabs they can harvest and what hours they can spend crabbing crab season technically began april 1 but does not get going in earnest until waters are warm enough for the crustaceans liking about 58 degrees at least the continued struggles for the state s signature shellfish come weeks after more promising news on the bay s other popular seafood export with maryland s largest harvest of wild oysters reported since 1987 but show the difficulties of managing species whose welfare depends not just on harvest pressures but on the whims of winds and weather that means fluctuations in the crab population are common yet the trend line for various markers of the species abundance and health are pointing downward blue crabs are estimated to number 229 million across both maryland and virginia waters a third consecutive year over year decline according to the survey a cooperative effort of the maryland department of natural resources and the virginia institute of marine sciences that low number compares to an estimate of nearly 600 million as recently as 2019 and a record high of 852 million in 1993 scientists from both states have worked together to calculate the population estimates each winter since 1990 counting and measuring crabs hibernating in mud at 1 500 sites around the bay the number of spawning age female crabs estimated to be in the bay based on this winter s survey fell to 97 million down from 158 million a year earlier though still above a threshold of 72 5 million spawning age female crabs considered necessary to produce a sustainable population for the years ahead the estimated juvenile crab population grew slightly to 101 million up from 86 million the previous year but that means a third straight year of smaller than average young crab generations maryland department of natural resources officials said it s impossible to pinpoint what caused the population decline chesapeake blue crabs are spawned near the mouth of the bay in virginia waters and as larvae rely on winds and currents to make it back into the bay where they develop their shells and make their way up the bay in search of food and spawning grounds the state officials said they would be working with counterparts in virginia and on the potomac river fisheries commission on a coordinated approach to set management measures for the 2022 crabbing season that address the conservation needs of the resource environmentalists called the survey results a troubling sign that crabs are suffering amid water pollution and related declines in underwater grasses as well as increased predation from invasive catfish that have been multiplying in the bay in recent years development use of fertilizers and inadequate wastewater treatment can all be linked to the health of blue crab habitat and thus the abundance of the species itself the results of this year s survey continue a worrying trend for blue crabs in the chesapeake bay region said chris moore the chesapeake bay foundation s senior regional ecosystem scientist in a statement the continued low abundance of juveniles and adult males indicates the urgent need for action to protect these segments of the population acreage of underwater grasses has declined for two straight years after a recent recovery in the bay s aquatic vegetation the bay foundation said grasses have suffered because of excess sediment and nutrients washing into the bay clouding waters and blocking sunlight from reaching plant life that is bad news for crabs because juveniles use grasses to hide from predators such as the blue catfish the fish can grow to massive sizes devouring fish and clams which blue crabs also rely on for food and feeding on young crabs as well to give the crab population a boost moore suggested more should be done to protect adult female crabs from harvest so they can successfully spawn maryland limits how many bushels of adult female crabs commercial watermen can harvest in 2021 depending on the type of crabbing license they hold watermen were limited to collecting at most 20 bushels of she crabs a day in july and august and at most 39 bushels in september and october a bushel typically contains as few as 5 dozen large crabs to as many as 7 dozen small crabs the state s seafood industry itself beleaguered and often at odds with environmental groups could resist such changes aubrey vincent sales manager at lindy s seafood in dorchester county said she is eager for the state to explore further what may be hindering blue crabs from reproducing and growing something s definitely having a negative impact she said it doesn t look like it s the commercial harvest because that s pretty steady in fact the blue crab harvest has declined in recent years with the 41 6 million pounds harvested baywide in 2020 well below a 30 year average of about 61 million pounds according to a panel of scientists known as the chesapeake bay stock assessment committee vincent said the seafood industry would work to help crabs recover however that may be possible we need to be respectful and make sure we re not putting additional harvest pressure on she said we ve adjusted what we re doing but it doesn t seem to be getting us the results meanwhile scarcity of crabs can often mean what s become a pricey delicacy gets pricier the cost of crab meat has skyrocketed in recent years given the limited supply of local shellfish as well as factors related to the pandemic including labor shortages and supply chain issues to what extent that trend continues this year will become apparent soon with temperatures forecast to surge into the 90s this weekend watermen expect waters will warm enough to start to get this year s crop of crabs stirring at last

been is short supply in many stores around the country for several months photo by scott olson getty images dr kelsey klaas a pediatrician at mayo clinic agrees calling the current baby formula shortage anxiety provoking we all should be concerned when the needs of our most vulnerable including nutritional needs are unmet klass said the formula shortage is absolutely contributing to parents anxiety because a large part of what we do as parents is nourish and feed our kids to support their growth and development why is baby formula in short supply this is likely not the first story you ve heard especially recently from families struggling to find baby formula due to a nationwide shortage the problem was initiated by supply chain disruptions which have caused major delays among retailers and companies this has also caused stores to put limitations on how much baby formula customers can buy a safety recall issued earlier this year has also compounded these challenges in february the food and drug administration warned consumers to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a sturgis michigan facility run by abbott nutrition which then initiated a voluntary recall according to findings released in march by federal safety inspectors abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant the fda launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant all four babies were hospitalized and two died chicago based abbott said in a statement there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses abbott noted that samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company s factory related what s driving the baby formula shortage the fda announced it would allow abbott to resume producing certain baby formula products on a case by case basis the combination of supply chain issues and the recall has wiped out many brands covered by women infants and children wic a federal program like food stamps that serves to help families though the program now permits brand substitutes when will baby formula

to monitor possible price gouging and work with trading partners in mexico chile ireland and the netherlands on imports even though 98 of baby formula is currently domestically made so what should parents do if they re having trouble finding baby formula should mothers try breastfeeding should expecting parents stock up on a supply of formula if they can find it breast milk and baby formula are both excellent sources of nutrition for infants both provide the right balance of fat carbs protein vitamins and minerals to help babies grow steven miller a pediatric gastroenterologist at johns hopkins children s center told fox breastfeeding is recommended if possible choosing whether to breastfeed or formula feed a baby can be one of the biggest decisions expectant and new parents will make the decision is an important one as formula and breast milk provide an effective balance of certain minerals that a cow s milk cannot provide according to the american academic medical center mayo clinic breastfeeding provides the best nutrition for an infant and is the most widely recommended way to feed a newborn breast milk contains the right balance of nutrients for your baby and boosts your baby s immune system jay l hoecker an emeritus pediatrics specialist at mayo clinic said it s considered the gold standard for infant nutrition dr cynthia blanco a neonatologist in texas and a member of the american academy of pediatrics aap echoed hoecker sayiing if you have a healthy term baby your best choice will always be breast milk and a number of health organizations including the aap the american medical association ama and the world health organization who agree recommending breastfeeding as the best choice for babies experts say breastfeeding has chemicals that help defend against infections prevent allergies and protect against a number of chronic conditions additionally breast milk is the most cost effective option since it doesn t cost a cent and formula quickly adds up this shortage is a major headache and if moms make their own milk rather than buying it from the store that is one less thing to worry about miller noted adding the other thing doctors like about breastfeeding is that when babies breastfeed they can decide when they are full more easily than they can with formula this is part of why babies who are breastfed turn into kids who have a lower chance of being obese i am definitely a big fan of breastfeeding klaas noted she always encourages mothers to breastfeed when possible i absolutely support breastfeeding when possible we know that breastfeeding has benefits to both the infant and mother over formula feeding klass explained adding the current formula shortage highlights one particular benefit of breastfeeding which is that for a parent who is able to produce enough milk to meet the infant s needs infant nutrition is not reliant on external supplies health experts suggest that mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding asking their baby s pediatrician about vitamin d supplements for their baby since breast milk alone does not provide an adequate amount of the vitamin which helps the baby absorb calcium and phosphorus nutrients necessary for strong bones women who are breastfeeding will also need to be aware of what they eat and drink since this can be passed to the baby through the breast milk it s always exhausting and amazing to have a new baby but right now it s extra stressful because of the added worries around how to feed the baby miller continued if you want to breastfeed now is an especially good time to do it and don t be afraid to ask for help if you choose to use formula be flexible about the brand and know that formula works really well to grow healthy kids mothers who are anxious about breastfeeding may want to contact friends or family who have successfully breastfed as they may be a good source of information support organizations such as la leche league along with lactation consultants at many hospitals and clinics are available to help as well routine milk pumping is the best way to increase supply said jackee haak a north dakota based registered nurse and board member of the united states lactation consultant association related baby formula shortage which foods and techniques boost breast milk production rachel taylor a registered nurse postpartum and lactation advocate from birmingham alabama told fox news digital that she mainly recommends lactation cookies teas water and a few dietary supplements or ingredients that have demonstrated beneficial results for nursing mothers how long should i breastfeed my baby the american academy of pediatrics recommends mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first six months after birth followed by a combination of breast milk with solid foods until at least the age of one extended breastfeeding is recommended as long as the mother and baby wish to continue major infant formulas are safe effective while most health experts believe breast milk is the best nutritional choice for infants breastfeeding may not be possible for all women for many the decision to breastfeed or formula feed is based on their comfort level lifestyle and specific medical situations the topic has sparked controversy and forced parents into online groups across social media with many users citing momshaming to those criticizing other mothers for opting to use formula if it s affecting the mother s life it s affecting the mother s mental health if it s affecting you as a woman that s not good for your baby either blanco shared most doctors agree that major infant formulas are an effective source of nutrition and can help babies grow and keep them healthy and thus parents can feel safe supplying it despite this most doctors agree that major infant formulas are an effective source of nutrition and can help babies grow and keep them healthy and thus parents can feel safe supplying it we need to recognize that breastfeeding is a lot of work if breastfeeding doesn t work formula feeding is a safe alternative which provides adequate nutrition for the infant klaas explained when prepared as directed infant formula supports healthy babies who have typical dietary needs in fact a baby who has special nutritional needs might require a special formula baby formula is of course an attempt to approximate breast milk as closely as possible it contains macronutrients carbohydrates fat and protein as well as micronutrients these elements can be replicated pretty effectively which means that properly made formula will meet an infant s nutritional needs klaas continued most formulas are made from protein from cow s milk that has been altered to be easier to digest and has been enhanced with extra nutrients needed for growth and development related alaska mom says baby formula shortage creating extra panic as she launches group for struggling parents the fda also regulates formula companies to ensure they provide all the necessary nutrients including vitamin d in their formulas according to a survey by the centers for disease control and prevention 84 1 of infants born in 2017 started breastfeeding but only 58 3 of infants were breastfeeding at six months this means after the six month time period more than 40 of parents were still required to find formula as a baby s digestive system isn t ready for cow s milk until they re about one year old according to pampers mothers face a number of challenges to long term breastfeeding including returning to work and finding the time and equipment needed to pump breast milk some women who breastfeed including sarah jobin smith are worried they may need to join other mothers in the hunt for formula if they are not able to produce enough milk my oldest is about to turn three but when she was a newborn i struggled producing jobin smith told fox our second was just born on april 18th and i have this fear of not producing enough again she continued i do worry that as she grows i won t be able to keep up with the demand and i may be another parent out there looking for formula where can i find formula there are many reasons women choose to use formula instead of breast milk so what should a parent do if they can t find formula my advice in the time of formula shortages is not to be brand specific miller suggested adding this means that you can look around for other brands or store brands which are often very good experts say generic formulas are also fda approved and meet the same requirements as brand names in addition no generic formulas were impacted in february s recall however doctors suggest talking to your pediatrician first especially if your baby must use a hydrolyzed or amino acid based formula also it s not advised to give toddler formulas to young infants especially under 9 months of age if you re still struggling to find formula or your baby requires a specific brand experts suggest talking with your pediatrician or calling a local food bank to see if they can help locate some options they also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies which may still have supplies when larger stores run out baby formula can also be very costly so for families who qualify based on income the wic can provide formula free of charge doctors also suggest seeking out local groups online many local parent groups have postings about unopened unexpired formula canisters available to give away or sell during this time experts say it s okay to look for formula online but check that it is sold by a reputable supplier unopened and unexpired bottom line blanco says if you cannot find any formula at all to call your pediatrician or local hospital there is not a parent that we have not been able to help blanco added should i make homemade baby formula stock up amid shortage while the baby formula shortage is a challenge for many parents doctors say parents should not try to make their own formula at home from cow s milk or add extra water to the formula to stretch supplies both of these things could make the baby sick related pediatrician s plea to parents do not make your own baby formula sarah adams who is with ohio s pediatric primary care hudson made it quite clear on this point i do not recommend making your own formula adding the aap strongly advises against homemade formula she continued these are not safe and not fda approved infant deaths have been reported many do it yourself formula recipes are made from cow s milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest they also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and fda approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition adams also recommends not watering down formula citing this practice as dangerous that can lead to poor nutritional balance and serious complications additionally most experts don t defend stocking up on formula for just in case scenarios in general i m not in favor of parents buying up a ton of formula that they aren t sure they will need people stockpiling formula is part of why stores are running low miller explained that being said it would be ok for new parents to have a can or two of formula at home especially if they are thinking of using formula if you are actively using baby formula the aap advises buying no more than a ten day to two week supply of formula the shortage is temporary parents are in this together please avoid stockpiling help your neighbors and focus on infant safety klaas concluded blanco added don t panic that you may not have any next week you will have some next week and if you don t then again seek out your medical team of experts the associated press and fox news contributed to

but the faults recede because the violence is the film those who have complained that there s too much of it might as well complain that there s too much punching in a prizefight to reduce it would be to make it something else the violence is in the attitudes as well as the actions for example the opening sequence is an ambush by the bounty hunters of the outlaws in the middle of a town and it doesn t matter a damn to the law or to the outlaws that they are firing through dozens of bystanders there is a climactic scene in a huge mexican courtyard which contains so much shooting and stabbing of soldiers outlaws girls and old men with a wild machine gun clattering away that it becomes a kind of lethal becchanalia it may horrify but it isn t ludicrous and this is to peckinpah s credit the details are lurid when men are shot in the back blood spurts out just as it does from disemboweled swordsmen in kurosawa a throat is cut before your eyes and often when men fall peckinpah catches the fall in slow motion the obvious point of comparison is the end of bonnie and clyde there are also other comparisons with that picture but penn used slow motion to try to poeticize the deaths of two particular people with peckinpah it is only extras who fall in slow motion depersonalized death his interest is in the ballet not the bullet and this insistent esthetics is perhaps the cruelest of all the film s cruelties the slow motion snatches are irritating in two ways first because they draw our attention to the film as such second because peckinpah is right right to remind us that more than one prism of vision is possible at every moment of life and that this prism at this moment magnifies the enjoyment of killing the context of the film is the supposed passing of an era and the aging of the outlaws there are conversations between holden and borgnine around the campfire in which they talk about the onset of autumn in their careers and at the end the theme is well utilized after a night of carousing with a couple of girls holden and borgnine wake up quietly and quietly go off to pay a debt of honor simply because they re too old to care about saving their skins it s a well written and well directed sequence

a closely divided house approved legislation thursday to crack down on alleged price gouging by oil companies and other energy producers as prices at the pump continue to soar a bill backed by house democrats would give president joe biden authority to declare an energy emergency that would make it unlawful to increase gasoline and home energy fuel prices in an excessive or exploitative manner the bill directs the federal trade commission to punish companies that engage in price gouging at a time when people across the country are feeling the pinch at the gas pump congress needs to be doing all it can to bring down costs for american families said rep kim schrier d wash who co sponsored the bill she called it infuriating that spikes in gas prices were happening at the same time that gas and oil companies are making record profits and taking advantage of international crises to make a profit this must stop related gas prices average over 4 in all 50 states for 1st time ever the measure was approved 217 207 republicans unanimously opposed the bill along with four democrats it now goes to the senate where a similar bill is pending but faces steep odds amid a 50 50 split between democrats and republicans gas prices hit record highs the focus on price gouging comes as gas prices hit an average of 4 59 per gallon thursday 49 cents a gallon higher than a month ago and 1

billions on stock buybacks and dividend payments to investors big oil is price gouging families because they can said rep katie porter d calif another co sponsor enough is enough republicans and industry groups called the bill misguided saying there is no evidence of price gouging oil is a global commodity and prices are set on the global market gas prices rose late last year amid supply chain problems and increased demand as the economy recovered following the covid 19 pandemic but prices have spiked ever higher since russia s feb 24 invasion of ukraine the u s has banned imports of russian oil and other countries are seeking alternatives to russian energy driving prices up biden aware of the political stakes has vowed to do all he can to ease pain at the pump for american

washington dc photo by chip somodevilla getty images republicans say the answer to higher gas prices is to increase production here in the united states louisiana rep steve scalise the no 2 house republican called the bill an attempt by democrats to distract and shift blame from the administration s self inflicted energy and inflation crisis scalise called the bill a socialist price fixing scheme that hurts small businesses and consumers the most he accused democrats of politicizing the ftc by giving the commission wide ranging powers based on undefined parameters that will allow it to usurp market forces and set government controlled gasoline prices related united airlines to start using fuel made of animal fat cooking oil on some flights the american exploration and production council a lobbying group that represents independent oil and gas producers called allegations of price gouging false and counter productive the ftc has conducted numerous investigations that have shown that changes in gasoline prices are based on market factors not illegal behavior said anne bradbury the group s ceo biden under pressure to increase us crude production the vote on the house bill comes as interior secretary deb haaland said she will release a long delayed five year plan that allows interior to conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales the current plan expires june 30 and administration officials had not said when or if a replacement would be released even as they canceled three offshore lease sales scheduled in the gulf of mexico and off the alaska coast haaland told the senate energy committee the new plan will be made public by june 30 the plan does not issue specific leases or authorize any drilling project as we take this next step we will follow the science and the law as we always do haaland said thursday vowing a robust and transparent review process that includes input from states the public and tribes the biden administration has come under pressure to increase u s crude production as fuel prices spike because of the pandemic and the war in ukraine related nationwide gas prices could exceed 6 by end of summer analysts warn biden also faces pressure from democrats and environmental groups urging him to do more to combat climate change even as his legislative proposals on climate and clean energy remain stalled in a sharply divided

insecurity in europe this administration has made its opposition to domestic oil and gas production crystal clear washington dc may 19 u s sen joe manchin d wv chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee talks to reporters before a hearing with interior secretary deb haaland at the dirksen senate office building on may 19 2022 in wa expand manchin said he supported a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters announced by biden soon after taking office in january 2021 by last summer he told haaland the time for a pause had come and gone now 16 months after the pause was announced we still have no new leases manchin said i m sorry to say it has become crystal clear that the pause is in fact a ban interior conducted an offshore lease sale last fall responding to a court order but the sale was later vacated by a federal judge the administration has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly western states however officials scaled back the amount of land offered for drilling and raised royalty rates charged to energy companies by 50

to replace banned russian crude notably on the price differential front wti notched a 47 cent premium over brent on the day upsetting a long held relationship between the benchmarks in which brent is the pricier of the two the relative strength of wti may stem from the drop in u s oil and gasoline inventories possibly coupled with demand weakness in europe due to energy supply disruptions as the eu scrambles to replace russian oil natural gas and refined products traditionally brent which reflects north sea crude is more easily shipped out to capitalize on higher prices while wti has been somewhat landlocked and more at the will of central u s markets the isolation of wti is less of a factor now due to infrastructure additions that facilitate ocean shipping of wti oil at a time when

organizations because it allows us to go into the market and accompany people in finding the housing of their choosing still as welcome hall mission ceo samuel watts notes not all rent supplements are equal what we really need in our sector is rent supplements that are tied to an individual rather than linked to a particular apartment because it gives us the flexibility depending on the different

washington the number of americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week reaching a four month high and potentially hinting at some cooling in demand for workers amid tightening financial conditions still the labour market remains tight as the report from the labor department yesterday also showed the ranks of the unemployed were the smallest in almost 52â½ years in early may signs of ebbing demand for labour were also evident in a survey from the philadelphia federal reserve showing a decline in the share of firms reporting higher employment levels and the average work at factories in the mid atlantic region this month the federal reserveâ s aggressive monetary policy stance as it fights inflation has sparked a stock market sell off and boosted us treasury yields and the dollar several retailers including walmart inc this week cut their full year earnings forecasts warning that inflation was squeezing profits â this will lead to slower job growth in the retail and e commerce industries â said bill adams chief economist at comerica bank in dallas texas â the stock market sell off could dampen business sentiment and make some businesses more cautious about hiring especially those that are cash flow negative and rely on investorsâ money to fund operations like many startups â initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 21 000 to a seasonally adjusted 218 000 for the week ended may 14 the highest level since january economists polled by reuters had forecast 200 000 applications for the latest week there was a jump of 6 728 in claims in kentucky while california reported an increase of 3 315 there were also notable gains in filings in pennsylvania ohio and illinois claims have been largely treading water since hitting more than a 53 year low of 166 000 in march they have dropped from an all time high of 6 137 million in early april 2020 some economists viewed the rising claims as the start of the normalizing process for the labor market after distortions caused by the covid 19 pandemic there were a record 11 5 million job openings as of the end of march and an all time high of 4 5 million people quit their jobs the misalignment between supply and demand is generating strong wage gains that are helping to fan overall inflation in the economy the fed has raised its policy interest rate by 75 basis points since march the us central bank is expected to increase the overnight rate by half a percentage point at each of its next meetings in june and july â the tight labour market has likely caused employers to focus on employee retention resulting in much lower than normal initial claims â said isfar munir an economist at citigroup in new york â the increase we are seeing now could just be a first step towards normalizing labor markets â last weekâ s data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the non farm payrolls portion of may s employment report claims rose between the april and may survey period while that would imply a moderation in the pace of job growth this month data next week on the ranks of the unemployed in mid may will shed more light on the state of job growth this month payrolls increased by 428 000 in april the 12th straight month of employment gains in excess of 400 000 the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 25 000 to 1 317 million during the week ending may 7 that was the lowest level for the so called continuing claims since december 1969 continuing claims have been trending lower even as initial applications for benefits have risen â one possible explanation for the recent combination of initial claims trending higher and continuing claims trending lower is that layoffs have picked up but people are still able to easily find other jobs â said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york in a separate report on thursday the philadelphia fed said its business conditions index dropped to a two year low reading of 2 6 in may from 17 6 in april a reading above zero indicates growth in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern pennsylvania southern new jersey and delaware the surveyâ s measure of factory employment dropped to 25 5 from 41 4 in april its gauge of the average workweek fell to 16 1 from 20 8 in the prior month nearly 27 of the firms

while there were some big moves down in the likes of the banks 1 8 materials 1 7 and energy 1 6 it was consumer sectors that really copped the brunt the sudden shift in sentiment followed on from wall street overnight when walmart had posted a weak result the night before as did target on wednesday night both posting falls not seen since the 87 crash thus our discretionary sector was down 3 1 yesterday after rising 1 1 on wednesday on easing rba aggression fears while staples fell 3 7 after having already fallen 1 0 against the tide on wednesday following the walmart result in the us walmart the staple had fallen 11 while target discretionary fell 25 so why have staples been more hammered locally likely because staples have throughout a weak 2022 been a port in the storm a reliable safe haven amidst high inflation and rising rates and hence the sector had become overcrowded discretionary on the other hand has had its ups and down although it could have been worse for discretionary if aristocrat leisure all had not jumped 6 7 on its earnings result aristocrat is a top 20 stock but so is wesfarmers wes which owns target here it fell 7 8 among other discretionary heavyweights jb hi fi jbh fell 6 6 and super retail sul 6 0 among staples woolworths wow fell 5 6 coles col 3 4 and metcash mts 6 5 the question is one of just how much we can directly link the australian consumer to the us consumer and the australian economy to the us economy despite both suffering from supply chain issues yet us household balance sheets are in good shape while we re in debt up to our eyeballs just as house prices begin to fall hence the banks fell 1 8 speaking of households josh was cock a hoop yesterday when the unemployment rate showed a drop to 3 9 in april from 5 4 no sorry 4 0 in march except it didn t because march was revised down to 3 9 and only 4 000 jobs were added when economists had forecast 30 000 the split was nonetheless a gain of 92 100 full time jobs versus a loss of 88 400 part time although this would simply reflect more hours being worked by the same part time employees amidst businesses inability to find new employees thus bumping them up to full time status participation dropped to 66 3 from 66 4 so more people gave up on the workforce within other sectors yesterday technology fell 2 7 but that s just an average day while healthcare actually bucked the trend in rising 0 1 as investors went in search of a new defensive safe haven we re all individuals networking software company cisco systems reported in wednesday night s aftermarket and last night fell 14 leading the dow to underperformance cisco declared the problem to simply be a supply side one as demand remains strong the dow fell 450 points early last night session but in a the sort of classic headless chook session that typically follows a big one day fall was up 80 points heading into the last hour and down 236 at the close another us discretionary retailer by the name of ross stores reported in last night s aftermarket and is down 22 as i write having cited supply issues but not all retailers have been tarred with the same brush despite wednesday night s panic exit from the sector department store chain kohl s for example reported last night and rose 4 4 other reporters in this the week of retailer reporting have also posted gains on their results including during wednesday night s stampede the bottom line is some retailers are managing supply problems well and some aren t and this theme can be extrapolated across the wider stock market analysts agree that there are currently quality stocks on offer at beaten down prices or at least more realistic valuations while others should not be touched investors did begin piling back into some of the hardest hit growth names on the nasdaq last night while eschewing the likes of apple 2 5 although the excitement did fizzle a bit to the close the reality is that at this level the micro is becoming more important than the macro and investors need to choose widely is this the bottom the s p500 did not last night crash below the 20 down level but if we had a dollar for every time
