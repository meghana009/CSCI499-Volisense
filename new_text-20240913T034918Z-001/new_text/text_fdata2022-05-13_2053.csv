is with great pleasure that i report the inaugural first quarter s results of the new capstone copper and i would particularly like to take this opportunity to thank everybody in our organization for their tremendous support as we integrate our business despite inflationary pressures facing the entire mining industry capstone delivered strong financial results highlighted by adjusted ebitda of 123 million that included only a nine day contribution from our mantoverde and mantos blancos mines since the combination took effect on march 23 2022 said john mackenzie ceo this is a transformational year for capstone as we ramp up our new mantos blancos mill construct the mantoverde sulphides project and deliver a district integration plan for santo domingo with mantoverde these are critical steps toward achieving over 40 copper production growth by 2024 and a further 45 when santo domingo goes into production in the context of the current macro environment we have critically evaluated our business to provide guidance for the remaining 9 months of 2022 and expect to produce 136 000 to 150 000 tonnes of copper at c1 cash costs of 2 55 to 2 70 per pound q1 2022 operational and financial highlights the transaction to combine with mantos to create capstone copper corp was completed on march 23 2022 the transaction establishes capstone copper as a premier copper producer with a diversified portfolio of high quality long life operating assets focused in the americas with an extensive pipeline of near term fully permitted organic growth opportunities net income of 35 1 million or 0 08 per share adjusted net income1 of 61 1 million or 0 14 per share for q1 2022 with the main reconciling item for q1 2022 being 19 9 million of transaction and integration costs related to the transaction operating results include nine days of earnings from operations of the mantos blancos and mantoverde mines adjusted ebitda1 of 123 4 million compared to 118 7 million in q1 2021 operating cash flow before changes in working capital1 of 70 4 million in q1 2022 compared to 245 0 million in q1 2021 which includes a 150 million precious metal stream deposit the variance is related to increased operating cash flow of 21 5 million on copper sales and prices offset by transaction costs of 19 9 million and 22 9 million higher annual tax payment in mexico related to 2021 income the company is in a net cash position of 64 9 million and total available liquidity1 is 638 1 million the balance sheet was further expanded with the acquisition of cash and debt on the transaction the net cash position of 64 9 million as at march 31 2022 consists of cash and short term investments of 413 1 million netted against long term debt of 348 2 million consolidated copper production of 22 500 tonnes at c1 cash costs1 of 2 31 lb of copper produced for q1 2022 which consisted of 14 400 tonnes at pinto valley 5 900 tonnes at cozamin and the balance for the chilean mines for the nine day stub period mantos blancos and mantoverde contributed an additional 0 14 per pound to the consolidated c1 cash costs1 excluding the stub period reporting capstone copper s consolidated c1 cash costs1 were 2 17 per pound mantos blancos concentrator debottlenecking project mb cdp ramp up to 20 000 tonnes per day tpd is progressing well throughput averaged over 18 000 tpd during the last week of april the focus is on ramping up to name plate capacity optimization and achieving targeted recoveries in q3 2022 mantoverde development project mvdp construction is progressing well with earthworks mostly completed and major construction commenced in late march 2022 numerous marine cargo shipments of major plant equipment are now en route to site the total project capital budget is now estimated to be 825 million compared to previously 787 million the increase relates to diesel prices impacting pre stripping costs by 23 million plus additional contingency of 15 million the majority of the capital costs are fixed due to the nature of the lump sum turn key contract with ausenco of 525 million and the purchase of major mining equipment was price fixed prior to the current inflationary environment for approximately 140 million the mantoverde santo domingo district integration plan will outline the approach capstone copper is taking to maximize value creation including synergies across the district the integration plan will outline the optimized flowsheet to create a world class district which is targeted for early q4 2022 ahead of the chile analyst tour and investor day during the week of november 14th the company expects the integration plan to contribute to the feasibility studies for santo domingo h1 2023 mantoverde phase ii h2 2023 and mantoverde santo domingo cobalt and oxides h2 2023 financial flexibility enhanced with amendment of revolving credit facility rcf to 500 million plus 100 million accordion subsequent to quarter end the rcf was amended and will become available after all the security is in place and other customary conditions are met which is expected to occur before july 2022 mantos and capstone mining transaction on november 30 2021 capstone mining announced it had entered into a definitive agreement the agreement with mantos to combine pursuant to a plan of arrangement the transaction was completed on march 23 2022 and the combined company was renamed capstone copper corp capstone copper is headquartered in vancouver b c and listed on the tsx pursuant to the agreement each capstone mining shareholder received one newly issued capstone copper share per capstone mining share the exchange ratio and the existing mantos shareholders maintained their capstone copper shares at completion of the transaction former capstone mining and mantos shareholders collectively owned approximately 60 75 and 39 25 of capstone copper respectively on a fully diluted basis refer to the business combination note in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements following completion of the transaction capstone copper operates four mines including two mines run by mantos copper in chile since 2015 the mantos blancos 100 owned open pit copper mine is located forty five kilometers northeast of antofagasta in the antofagasta region and produces copper concentrate and copper cathodes the mantoverde 70 owned open pit mine is located fifty kilometers southeast of chanaral in the region of atacama and produces copper cathodes mantoverde is the site of the mvdp sulphide expansion currently in construction the new capstone copper has a broad portfolio of largely permitted brownfield projects located at our sites that facilitate disciplined capital allocation

production sales and costs consolidated q1 2022 consolidated production of 22 500 tonnes of copper is higher than the 21 700 tonnes in q1 2021 and primarily relates to addition of nine day production at the mantos blancos and mantoverde mines the main driver for the 0 61 lb increase in c1 cash costs1 in q1 2022 compared to q1 2021 is higher unit costs at pinto valley plus the inclusion of the mantos blancos and mantoverde mines which impacted consolidated c1 cash costs1 by 0 14 lb prior to the inclusion of the mantos blancos and mantoverde results for the stub period the capstone mining results would have been 2 17 lb c1 cash costs1 increased from 1 70 to 2 17 lb due to 0 12 lb on lower production of 1 400 tonnes 0 09 lb due to higher tcrc s 0 05 due to lower by product revenue and stockpile drawdown and the balance of 0 20 lb due to inflationary pressures pinto valley mine q1 2022 production decreased by 13 compared to the same period last year due to 11 lower head grades for

work progressed on the pre feasibility study pfs for pv4 which aims to maximize the conversion of approximately one billion tonnes of mineral resources to mineral reserves significantly extending pinto valley s mine life and increasing the mine s copper production profile the pv4 study is focused on modest expansion of existing mill throughput to range of 65 000 to 70 000 tpd with an extended life of mine the pv4 study is expected to be released in h1 2023 the application of the following new technologies and innovation is being considered expansion of the use of jetti catalytic leach technology which has the potential to increase mill cut off grades and increase tonnage available for leaching column leach and test heap work are ongoing and the results will be included in the pv4 study an expanded dump leach strategy would translate to higher grades sent to the mill for processing and increased copper cathode production by expanding dump leach tonnage pyrite agglomeration with strong positive environmental social and governance esg implications as it would divert acid generating minerals including pyrite and chalcopyrite from tailings to the dump leach operation additional copper recovery and lower costs via production of sulphuric acid would be key economic drivers for this project cozamin mine q1 2022 production increased by 15 compared to the same period last year mainly due to higher mill throughput 3 704 tpd versus 3 345 tpd in q1 2021 and head grades 1 84 versus 1 79 in q1 2021 recoveries were comparable quarter over quarter c1 cash costs1 in q1 2022 were higher than the same period last year due to planned higher mechanical part spend in order to increase underground equipment availability and reliability and some inflationary pressures on steel and explosives 0 13 lb lower zinc by product credits due to planned lower zinc production 0 06 lb and higher treatment and refining costs 0 03 lb partially offset by higher copper production 0 06 lb mantoverde development project construction of the mvdp located at the existing mantoverde oxide operation continues to progress well the mvdp is expected to enable us to process 235 million tonnes of copper sulphide reserves over a 20 year expected mine life in addition to our existing oxide reserves the mvdp involves the addition of a sulphide concentrator 12 3 million tonnes per year and tailings storage facility and the expansion of our existing desalination plant we expect completion of the mvdp to increase production from approximately 49 000 tonnes of copper cathodes only in 2021 to approximately 120 000 tonnes of copper copper concentrate and cathodes post project completion in 2024 in parallel c1 cash costs1 are expected to decrease from 2 79 lb in 2021 to under 1 70 lb to 1 80 lb in 2024 the decline in expected costs will be driven by the mine s transition to becoming a primary producer of copper concentrate the mine will also benefit from the production of approximately 31 000 ounces of gold per year that will generate by product credits upon completion of mvdp approximately 75 of mantoverde s production will come from the lower cost sulphide copper mvdp is being progressed under a lump sum turn key engineering procurement and construction epc arrangement with ausenco limited a multi national engineering procurement and construction management company with broad experience in the design and construction of copper concentrator projects of this scale in the international market the execution plan includes a capstone copper owner s team working with the contractors during the execution phase as of april 30 2022 the mvdp had achieved overall progress of 49 and construction progress of 14 and the schedule remains intact the target for completion of construction remains late 2023 all contractors have been mobilized to site and all required permits are in place work completed in q1 includes bulk earthworks for the primary crusher and grinding area platforms bypass water pipeline with the internal lining trench excavation and pipeline installation in the trench drilling for all pumping and monitoring wells at the tailings storage facility tsf allowing for the commencement of the major tsf construction activities 13 komatsu 830e haulage trucks have been received according to plan and are operating at mine site construction camp complete and operational the costs to date of the major equipment purchases pre stripping owner s costs and the epc lump sum turnkey are aligned with the budget close ongoing monitoring is being done to identify potential impacts due to an environment marked by covid 19 stressed logistics chains and inflation in costs the total project capital budget is now estimated to be 825 million and spend to date totals 338 million the epc contract total budget is approximately 525 million of which 220 million has been spent to date the total project costs have increased slightly from 787 million to 825 million due to diesel price impact on pre stripping costs of 23 million plus additional contingency of 15 million the majority of the capital costs are fixed due to the nature of the lump sum turn key contract with ausenco of 525 million or 67 of the original capital major mining equipment was price fixed prior to the current inflationary environment for approximately 140 million or 18 of the total original capital mantos blancos concentrator debottlenecking project the purpose of the mb cdp is to increase throughput capacity at the sulphide concentrator plant from 11 000 tpd to 20 000 tpd or from 4 2 million tonnes per year to 7 3 million tonnes per year construction of the mb cdp was completed and includes the modification of certain processes and the installation of new crushers one new ball mill four new rougher flotation cells and a new thickener at quarter end the project commissioning is complete and the ramp up of the project continued to progress throughput of the plant averaged over 18 000 tpd during the last week of april representing over 90 of nameplate capacity looking forward the focus becomes sustaining throughput at targeted levels and optimization of the circuit to achieve targeted recoveries in q3 2022 upon completion of the mb cdp we expect mantos blancos production to increase from approximately 45 000 tonnes of copper in 2021 to approximately 53 000 tonnes of copper in 2023 in parallel c1 cash costs1 are anticipated to decrease from current guidance of 2 81 lb in 2021 to 2 00 lb in 2023 as an even greater share of mantos blancos production is sourced from the lower cost copper concentrate production mantos blancos phase ii mantos blancos is currently analyzing the potential to increase the throughput of the mantos blancos sulphide concentrator plant from 7 3 million tonnes per year to 10 0 million tonnes per year using the existing currently unused underutilized ball mills and process equipment as part of the mantos blancos phase ii project we are also evaluating the potential to extend the life of copper cathode production a pre feasibility study on the mantos blancos phase ii project will be completed in q2 2022 which will be incorporated into a feasibility study fs in q4 2022 santo domingo upon closing of the transaction the santo domingo team has been integrated into the larger capstone copper team in chile the integrated project team is focused on identifying and evaluating the optimal integrated development plan for the mantoverde santo domingo district the mantoverde operation is located approximately 30km southwest of the santo domingo project the company expects the integrated district plan to study alternatives and identify the best path forward to develop the copper sulphides and oxides gold iron and cobalt across both properties an integrated development approach is likely to maximize potential synergies associated with the proximity of santo domingo to the existing mantoverde operation existing infrastructure including a desalination plant roads power and pipelines and integration of other assets such as the santo domingo port contract with puerto abierto s a the potential synergies the company expects to be maximized through an optimal integrated district development plan include the following infrastructure synergies including desalination plant power pipelines port integrated mine and process approach construction and supply chain synergies cobalt and sulphuric acid enhancements enabling revenue lines for mantoverde cobalt and magnetite using excess solvent extraction and electrowinning sx ew capacity the revenue enhancing opportunities include using excess electrowinning capacity at mantoverde to potentially process both santo domingo oxide material and additional low grade sulphides enabled by jetti catalytic leach technologies which capstone copper has been first to implement at pinto valley in addition the potential cobalt plant may unlock cobalt production from mantoverde while producing a by product of sulphuric acid which can then be used internally to further significantly lower operating costs on the leaching process at mantoverde cobalt feasibility study update the cobalt recovery process consists of a concentration step an oxidation step and a cobalt recovery step the concentration step considers a conventional froth flotation circuit treating copper flotation tails to produce a cobaltiferous pyrite concentrate for the base case the pyrite concentrate which contains between 0 5 and 0 7 co is oxidized in a fluidized bed roaster to produce a cobalt calcine and a concentrated sulphuric acid by product the calcine is then subjected to various precipitation leaching solvent extraction and crystallization steps to produce battery grade cobalt sulphate heptahydrate at an expected 10 4 million pounds of cobalt production per year this would be one of the largest and lowest cost cobalt producers in the world additional benefits of this project include the generation of carbon free energy from waste heat emitted by the roaster and the production of by product sulphuric acid which can be used for heap or dump leaching to produce low cost copper cathodes at mantoverde and elsewhere in the district the prefeasibility study is also evaluating different flow sheet alternatives for cobalt production in consideration of potential synergies between mantoverde and santo domingo initial trade off studies have confirmed the potential of acid pressure oxidation pox as a potentially lower cost alternative to roasting the company is developing both options in parallel to gain maturity and provide a robust recommendation on the path forward in q4 2022 along the same timeline q4 2022 we intend to release an updated cobalt resource for santo domingo as well as an initial cobalt resource for mantoverde oxide drilling program santo domingo contains oxide ore that could be processed with available capacity of the electrowinning plant at mantoverde for cathode production during q1 2022 the company developed a preliminary business case and started an exploratory metallurgical program scheduled to be completed in q3 2022 which will improve the understanding of copper solubility and acid consumption subject to positive metallurgical results the company is planning to complete a subsequent oxide drilling program starting in late 2022 to delineate an oxide mineral resource ultimately this work will feed into a further updated santo domingo fs in late 2023 corporate exploration update cozamin exploration the focus during q1 2022 was on testing the mala noche footwall zone and mala noche main vein west target with one surface rig and one underground rig from the recently completed west exploration crosscut station

inflationary environment and current spot pricing in the sulphuric acid market for the chilean mines in 2022 we have assumed sulphuric acid prices of 280 tonne which compares to 180 tonne in the mantoverde and mantos blancos technical reports which increases c1 cash costs1 by approximately 0 22 lb on a consolidated basis the purchase price for approximately 65 of required sulphuric acid for the balance of 2022 has been fixed with suppliers for the nine month period april 1 2022 to december 31 2022 expected sulphuric acid consumption at mantoverde and mantos blancos is 540 000 tonnes and 140 000 tonnes respectively 680 000 tonnes total the impact of a 100 tonne price increase is 68 million dollars or 0 22 lb consolidated the impact to c1 cash costs1 at mantoverde are 0 70 lb and at mantos blancos either 0 15 lb overall or 0 66 lb on cathode c1 cash costs1 respectively in addition mantoverde and mantos blancos are experiencing general cost inflation most notably increased diesel prices although sulphuric acid is a significant input cost to our oxide cathode business unit over time sulphide production is expected to increase with the ramp up of mb cdp and the completion of the sulphide concentrator at mantoverde making consolidated c1 cash costs1 less exposed to changes in acid prices in the future expected 2022 cathode production is 33 of total copper production cathode production is expected to be only 18 of total copper production in 2024 and is expected to further decline to under 6 with future production contribution from santo domingo pinto valley c1 cash costs1 are expected to be higher than guidance in january 2022 primarily due to general observed cost inflation planned maintenance at pinto valley and the ramp up of mb cdp in the second quarter are

this is more than just an airlines story this story goes all the way up to space what happened for six straight trading days boeing ba 1 02 stock has moved in only one direction down and i fear thursday is going to be no different as trading begins to wind down for the day thursday shares of aerospace giant boeing are down in the dumps once again off 6 6 as of 2 55 p m et two explanations for this fact suggest themselves so what the first issue concerns boeing s flagship commercial aviation business cnbc is reporting today that the rising cost of plane tickets is depressing demand for air travel and that flight bookings dropped 17 in april as a result further up the supply chain decreased demand for air travel has the potential to depress demand for new airplanes which would obviously affect boeing s sales that being said rising ticket prices are more likely tied to rising oil prices than to anything boeing has control over so this is not really a problem that the company can be blamed for or that it can fix in time travelers will adjust to the new reality that prices are higher and i d expect prices and demand to stabilize now what of greater interest is the negative press boeing is catching this week over a reuters report on its clash with space stock supreme aerojet rocketdyne ajrd which manufactures the propulsion system for boeing s cst 100 starliner space capsule last year stuck valves on the starliner s steering jets forced boeing to scrub a planned launch that would be a key milestone toward getting starliner certified to carry astronauts to orbit boeing blames aerojet for the mishap citing design flaws aerojet says boeing got the valves stuck itself by using the wrong kind of cleaning chemicals and aerojet is refusing to redesign the system unless boeing antes up more money for the work you might think this is just a run of the mill contract dispute and one that will eventually be resolved by boeing paying aerojet some money or suing aerojet to fix the problem for free but the stakes here are actually much higher and much more time sensitive boeing you see has been trying to get its cst 100 certified for human spaceflight for more than two years now and so far unsuccessfully if a planned rerun of its test flight on may 19 is delayed again or fails because of a sticky valve this would be a real disaster for boeing s space business potentially forcing it to admit only spacex has the ability to put americans in space for years to come it s not too much of an overstatement to say that the fate of boeing s space program now hinges upon a single sticky valve and unless it gets this problem solved in the next seven days its stock could have even further to fall

the biden administration is canceling three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of alaska removing millions of acres from possible drilling as u s gas prices reach record highs the interior department announced the decision wednesday night citing a lack of industry interest in drilling off the alaska coast and conflicting court rulings that have complicated drilling efforts in the gulf of mexico where the bulk of u s offshore drilling takes place the decision likely means the biden administration will not hold a lease sale for offshore drilling this year and comes as interior appears set to let a mandatory five year plan for offshore drilling expire next month unfortunately this is becoming a pattern the administration talks about the need for more supply and acts to restrict it said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters as geopolitical volatility and global energy prices continue to rise we again urge the administration to end the uncertainty and immediately act on a new five year program for federal offshore leasing he said the lease cancellations come as gas prices have surged to a record 4 40 a gallon amid the war in ukraine and other disruptions that have pushed prices 1 40 a gallon higher than a year ago consumer prices jumped 8 3 last month from a year ago the government said wednesday about 6 to 10 of food prices come from transportation costs and with fuel prices rising the increased cost to transport food could be passed onto the consumer many plastics used in packaging and clothing are made from petroleum products as well john quelch dean of the university of miami herbert business school joined lx news to explain how rising fuel prices will affect american households a federal appeals court in new orleans meanwhile is considering a challenge to a moratorium on new federal leasing that biden imposed soon after taking office in january 2021 biden said the administration needed to consider the effect of new drilling on climate change and conduct proper environmental reviews louisiana and 12 other states challenged biden s order saying laws passed in response to the 1970s oil crisis require lease sales on federal lands and waters the biden administration failed to grapple with prior analyses of the planned sales to give a valid reason for postponing or canceling them louisiana deputy solicitor general joseph scott st john told a 5th u s circuit court of appeals panel this week the three judge panel did not indicate when they will rule environmental groups hailed the latest lease cancellation saying the administration needs to do more to curb greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels that are driving climate change to save imperiled marine life and protect coastal communities and our climate from pollution we need to end new leasing and phase out existing drilling said kristen monsell oceans legal director at the center for biological diversity an environmental group republicans denounced the decision as harmful to consumers and u s national security the interior department s decision approaches levels of irresponsibility and reckless stupidity never seen before said rep garret graves r la we are paying record prices for gasoline and to heat and cool our homes rather than using american energy sources to help solve the problem and lower prices the biden administration continues to carry out policies that benefit iran saudi arabia venezuela and other countries graves said new leasing will not lower current gas prices countered dustin renaud a spokesman for the environmental coalition healthy gulf it takes several years for new leases to begin producing oil he noted adding that the industry is already sitting on over 8 million acres of unused offshore leases the state challenge to biden s leasing order has not yet gone to trial but a federal judge blocked the order in a preliminary injunction last year writing that since federal law does not state the president can suspend oil lease sales only congress can do so after u s district judge terry doughty ruled for the states the interior department held an offshore lease sale last fall which a federal judge in washington d c later blocked the administration has appealed doughty s ruling but has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly western states however the administration scaled back the amount of land offered for drilling and raised royalty rates by 50 biden has come under pressure to increase u s crude production as fuel prices spike because of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in ukraine the united states and other nations have banned imports of russian oil driving up prices worldwide biden also faces pressure from democrats and environmental groups urging him to do more to combat climate change even as his legislative proposals on climate and clean energy remain stalled in a sharply divided congress interior cannot conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a required five year plan the current plan expires june 30 and administration officials have not said when or if a replacement will be released interior secretary deb haaland said last month that the oil and gas industry is set with the amount of drilling permits at its disposal she defended biden administration actions to scale down federal leasing saying that industry has about 9 000 permits that have been approved but are not being used the industry is free to use these permits in a way they see fit they just haven t acted on those haaland told a house committee last week oil companies say they have increased production as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic but they have been reluctant to ramp up production further citing a shortage of workers and restraints from investors wary that today s high prices won t last decisions by the opec oil cartel led by saudi arabia and russia to only modestly increase supplies to the world market have also kept prices high major oil companies reported surging profits in the first quarter and are sending tens of billions of dollars in dividends to shareholders along with stock buybacks that have sharply increased the value of investor holdings democrats accuse the industry of price gouging and have vowed to bring legislation cracking down on price manipulation to votes in the house and senate a bid to impose a windfall profits tax on oil producers has generated little support in congress ___

some ev stocks have fallen by 30 in the last month now there seems to be a bit of a relief rally happening what happened investors turned beaten down electric vehicle ev manufacturers into some of thursday s big winners on wall street ev makers lucid group lcid 2 41 fisker fsrn 129 31 and heavy truck maker hyzon motors hyzn 4 62 soared to gains of between 15 and 18 5 at their session peaks as of 2 30 p m et lucid fisker and hyzon were still up by 11 5 9 2 and 11 1 respectively so what lucid reported its first quarter results last week and thursday s rally can in part be attributed to the fact that a peer that released its results on wednesday night mirrored what lucid had to say about 2022 production levels specifically as lucid did last week rivian automotive said it was maintaining its previous guidance for production even in the face of continued supply chain challenges this seemed to spark a rally after ev stocks had been punished by investors worried that guidance would continue to be lowered especially by younger manufacturers just starting to ramp up their vehicle production now what lucid and other manufacturers that are just beginning to produce vehicles are struggling to get enough parts on one hand and struggling with rising raw material costs on the other the fact that lucid and now rivian feel confident enough to maintain their production guidance may have given investors a reason to stop relentlessly bidding down the prices of many electric vehicle stocks even with this bounce lucid shares are down nearly 60 year to date and almost half of that drop came in just the past month neither fisker nor hyzon is bringing in meaningful revenue yet those stocks are down 27 and 36 respectively in the last month fisker plans to begin production of its first vehicle the ocean suv in november on thursday however it did release some news that might also be boosting investor interest in its stock fisker is using a contract manufacturing model and said that its second vehicle model will be produced at a foxconn factory in ohio the fisker pear looks to be a vehicle geared toward city driving and the company says its unique platform will also be used for two additional models to be introduced at a later date fisker expects the pear to be priced under 30 000 and plans to begin production of it in 2024 the company also shared that it expects a production volume of 250 000 units annually once operations are ramped up these stocks have been pummeled lately so at this point investors seem to be buying in something of a relief rally if these ev companies expect their growth to remain on pace despite the well known headwinds there may be more room for investors to keep that rebound going

the united states is facing an increasingly dire nationwide shortage of baby formula in early 2021 the national baby formula out of stock rate fluctuated between 2 percent and 8 percent the out of stock rate began to rise in july eventually reaching 31 percent and then in the last three weeks of april the rate suddenly shot up again to 40 percent nationwide in many places the situation is especially dire with 26 states reporting rates above the average hitting up to 57 percent in some areas even in the united states the richest country on earth that is home to 735 billionaires whose combined fortune totals 4 7 trillion capitalism is unable to ensure access to something as fundamental as food for babies inflation and pandemic related supply chain issues have exacerbated a pre existing problem of inaccessible baby products baby formula has long been notoriously expensive in the united states leading it to become one of the most commonly stolen items at drugstores this past year prices of major formula brands leapt another 18 percent lining the pockets of the companies that produce them and hitting poor families the hardest additionally there have been crises in formula manufacturing that have worsened the shortage such as the shutdown of abbott nutrition last february due to safety issues at company plants major formula brands like similac alimentum and elecare were recalled after several infants contracted rare bacterial infections from the products this distressing shortage has pushed parents of infants to great lengths some have driven out of state to locate formula or attempted bartering in online groups where scams and price gouging abound parents who are lucky enough to find formula have felt compelled to purchase as large a quantity as they can afford leading some stores to place transaction limits on the product desperate parents have even felt forced to dilute their stocks with water in order to stretch their supply as long as possible something that could cause babies to suffer seizures or brain damage as a result of nutrient deficiency the baby formula shortage is now a national crisis three out of every four parents or caregivers of infants in the united states rely on formula in some capacity special types of formula intended for babies with life threatening allergies or special conditions are even more difficult to find than normal versions it is especially ironic that the formula shortage is taking place in the context of the nationwide fight for abortion rights if the so called pro life anti abortion forces real goal is to preserve the life and health of babies why are they not showing any outrage or concern whatsoever for the plight of parents of babies who are actually alive clearly these bigots only concern is controlling women s bodies the fda claims it is working to address the infant formula shortages but the end of this issue is not yet in sight amid the incredible wealth and luxury of this grossly unequal society the babies of working class parents still face malnutrition because of the failures of the system

which they are based ore grades and recoveries prices for gold silver and base metals remaining as estimated currency exchange rates remaining as estimated prices and inflation rates for energy inputs

known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements to be materially different such factors include among others risks and uncertainties relating to the impact of covid 19 on the company s ability to operate and conduct exploration work including drilling plans as anticipated and the risk of an unplanned partial or full shutdown of the company s mines and processing plants whether voluntary or imposed which would adversely impact the company s revenues financial condition and ability to meet its production and cost guidance and fund its capital programs and repay its indebtedness the inherent risk that estimates of mineral reserves and resources may not be accurate and accordingly that mine production will not be as estimated or predicted planned exploration activities including plans for further exploration drilling and infill drilling may not result in the discovery of new mineral resources definition of mineral resources and readers are cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no defined economic viability there is no certainty that the company will be able to define a mineral resource with infill drilling and the company is undertaking new mineral resource studies at urn and is not treating the amc historical estimate as a current mineral resource estimate open pit mining operations at tucano have a limited established mine life and the company may not be able to extend the mine life for tucano open pit operations beyond 2025 as anticipated gold silver and base metal prices may decline or may be less than forecasted fluctuations in currency exchange rates including the u s dollar to brazilian real exchange rate may increase costs of operations operational and physical risks inherent in mining operations including pit wall collapses tailings storage facility failures environmental accidents and hazards industrial accidents equipment breakdown unusual or unexpected geological or structural formations cave ins flooding and severe weather may result in unforeseen costs shut downs delays in production and drilling and exposure to liability potential political and social risks involving great panther s operations in a foreign jurisdiction the potential for unexpected costs and expenses or overruns shortages in the ability to procure equipment and operating supplies without interruption including the inability of the company to resolve concerns over lost production and equipment availability issues with contractor u m and avoid any escalation to a formal dispute employee and contractor relations relationships with and claims by local communities the company s inability to obtain all necessary permits licenses and regulatory approvals in a timely manner on favourable terms changes in laws regulations and government practices in the jurisdictions in which the company operates legal restrictions related to mining diminishing quantities or grades of mineral reserves as properties are mined operating or technical difficulties in mineral exploration changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined the company s inability to meet its production forecasts or to generate the anticipated cash flows from operations could result in the company s inability to

financing to fund its operations capital requirements or maturing debt obligations as required the ability to maintain and renew agreements with local communities to support continued operations ability to identify or complete acquisition opportunities or to complete acquisitions that are accretive to the company the potential for incremental closure bond requirements with respect to the

james s brady press briefing room 3 43 p m edt ms psaki hi everyone all right just wanted to start with one topper for all of you president biden has directed the administration to work urgently to ensure that infant formula is safe and available for families across the country during the abbott nutrition voluntary recall this has been this is work that s been underway for months today president biden spoke with retailers and manufacturers including the ceos of walmart target reckitt and gerber to call on them to do more to help families purchase infant formula he discussed reckitt and gerber s efforts to increase production which have made up for the loss of production by abbott and asked them to identify other ways the administration can help them on top of the actions being announced today the conversation with the ceos of walmart and target focused on how they are working to stock shelves including in rural areas and any regional disparities they are seeing and the president asked what more his team can do to help move product and get more product to those communities he also announced additional steps to get infant formula onto store shelves as quickly as possible without compromising safety these steps include cutting red tape to get more infant formula to store shelves quicker by urging states to provide consumers flexibility on the types of formula they can buy with wic dollars calling on the ftc and state attorneys general to crack down on any price gouging or unfair market practices related to sales of infant formula like third party sellers reselling formula at steep prices and increasing the supply of formula through increased exports imports the biden harris administration will continue to monitor this situation and identify other ways we can support the safe and rapid increase in the production and distribution of baby formula today we also marked and you heard the president do this this morning a tragic milestone in the united states 1 million lives lost due to covid 19 our hearts go out to those grieving a loved one and those families forever changed because of the pandemic as the president said this morning we cannot grow numb to the urgency of this crisis it is critical that we honor those who have been lost by doing everything we can to prevent as many deaths as possible you saw that this morning from the president as he kicked off the covid 19 summit today s summit highlighted american leadership in action together with our co hosting nations we we united the world to commit to vaccinating the to vaccinating the world saving lives and building better health security with an inspiring response we rallied 3 billion from other nations more than three 3 2 at this point in time still counting from other nations and partners around the world to address the global response and the president issued a stark warning about our ability to continue fighting covid globally if congress fails to act as we heard through the summit now is not the time for complacency we need congress to show up not with empty words but with action to fight covid at home and abroad as we mark this tragic milestone our hope is to avoid another tragic one like this and that will only come if we act with urgency throughout the remaining fight against the pandemic go ahead josh q thanks jen two questions first on the baby formula abbott says once the fda gives them notice it ll take them two weeks to restart the site and then an additional six to eight weeks to get formula on the shelves with what the president heard today does he believe that we ll have the tools to bridge what could be a two month plus shortage ms psaki well i would say that the president is going to continue to use every tool we have in order to bridge that gap and this has been work that has been underway for weeks and months now we know that as if they get approval obviously as you noted it will take them some time to get up and running again so what we need to do and what you ve seen the president announce earlier today and i just reiterated is steps we can take from here to increase supply make sure it s on the shelves that includes increasing imports it also includes ensuring we re working with retailers as the president did during his calls to make sure that shelves are stocked it also includes ensuring that lower income families can access different brands of baby formula by working through with the wic for the exemptions for the wic program so we recognize that this is certainly a challenge for people across the country something the president is very focused on and we re going to do everything we can to cut red tape and take steps to increase supply on the marketplace q secondly aaa is saying you know record high nominal gasoline prices again today but americans are also seeing news about oil leases and auctions not going forward what was the administration s thinking on not having those auctions ms psaki well the department of interior who they have put out some comments on this and what they have made quite clear is that the cook inlet cancellation which you re referring to was due to a lack of industry interest and the gulf sales were as a result of delays due to a number of factors including conflicting court rulings so those were the two areas where you ve seen the pause but there was not interest i would note that if we take a step back and look at what is available out there and look at the supply needed as you noted at the top of as part of your question leasing and production offshore is a lengthier process it can take up to 10 years to create supply so let s start there secondly of the more than 10 9 million offshore acres currently under lease industry is not producing on 8 26 million acres that s about seven point 75 more than 75 percent that is non producing of the 24 9 million onshore acres under lease industry is not producing on 12 3 million acres that s almost 50 percent and there are also over 9 000 onshore permits that have been approved and are waiting to be used onshore so just to reiterate what we expect u s production is expected to increase by over 1 million barrels a day this year and hit a new record record next year this these specific actions were as a result of lack of industry interest and a and conflicting court rulings go ahead q thank you i guess sort of the bottom line is you know on formula this is a problem i mean i think other parents here in the room can probably attest i myself went to three stores this morning still haven t found what what we need when will parents be able to get the formula they need what is your best sense of when store shelves will be stocked again ms psaki well i think it s also important to note that the reason we re here is because the fda took a step to ensure that babies were taking safe formula there were babies who died from taking this formula so they were doing their jobs we have been working this administration has been working for weeks now to address in anticipation of where we thought there could be shortages we have also seen an increase over the last four weeks of supply available which has been an increase over the four weeks prior to the recall that is a good sign but obviously the steps the president took today are an acknowledgement and a recognition that more needs to be done that we do not want parents mothers families out there to be stressed and worried about feeding their babies that is why the president today had conversations with the ceos of walmart and target why he had conversations with reckitt and gerber about efforts to increase production why we re taking steps to ensure that we are making we are making wic dollars available to a range of other supply so we re working we re seeing increases over the last couple of weeks more needs to be done we re going to cut every element of red tape we can cut we re going to work with manufacturers we re going to import more to expedite this as quickly as possible q but if you are a parent who is looking for formula right now struggling to find what you need do you have even a rough guess of how long these shortages are going to last what should parents be bracing for here ms psaki well we ve already seen an increase in supply over the past couple of weeks what we are seeing which is an enormous problem is hoarding people hoarding because they re fearful that is one element of it and people hoarding because they are trying to profit off of fearful parents so that is also something we re focused on taking efforts to track and adjust and address and look into but again more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than in the four weeks preceding the recall we re taking every step to increase that so our message to parents is we hear you we want to do everything we can and we re going to cut every element of red tape to help address this and make it better for you to get formula on the shelves go ahead q and as you mentioned this obviously stems from the fda taking necessary steps to try and deal with a very serious problem and as josh noted you know abbott says that subject to fda approval they could restart at this site within two weeks do you have a sense of why it may be taking so long to get this factory back up and running or what the holdup is from the fda s perspective ms psaki i would point you to the fda but again i d go back to why this decision was made in the first place which was to save babies lives and the fda is not going to approve manufacturing again unless they are certain of the safety go ahead q when the president spoke with philippines president elect ferdinand marcos last night did they discuss either the dispute with china in the west philippine sea or the court u s court judgments against the president elect ms psaki i m not aware of those being a part of the discussion but i can check and see after the briefing if there s more details q thank you and then on nato if finland and sweden are successful in their attempts to join nato that would put the u s on the hook again for military defending those countries even potentially with nuclear weapons what benefit is that to u s citizens ms psaki well first let me say that we would support the united states would support a nato application by finland and or sweden should they choose to apply we of course will respect whatever decision they make both finland and sweden are close and valued defense partners of the united states and of nato i would note that even without them being members of nato our militaries have worked together for many years we re confident that we can find ways to work with them address any concerns either country may have about the period now or whatever is required if they were to join nato i would say in terms of how this benefits the american people i think is sort of what you re asking about having a strong nato alliance a strong western alliance which is a defensive alliance by the way is good for our security around the world and certainly having a strong partnership with a range of countries including sweden and finland if they decide to join should be reassuring to the american people about our own security interests q and then finally when the president visits south korea next week does he intend to visit the demilitarized zone and what s your current assessment of the threat of a north korean nuclear test ms psaki well on the first question we re still finalizing details of the schedule for the trip and what it looks like obviously that is a step that is taken by many who visit the region but i expect we ll have our national security advisor here in the briefing room next week with karine to preview the trip in terms of whether we expect a test we the united states assesses that the democratic repub people s republic of korea could be ready to conduct a test there as early as this month this would be its seventh such test we ve shared this information with allies and partners and are closely coordinating with them as you noted the president is traveling to the republic of korea and japan next week where he will continue strengthening these alliances and make clear our commitments to the security of the republic of korea our intelligence assessment is consistent with the dprk s recent public statements and destabilizing actions including the test launch of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles but this is information again we ve shared with our partners and allies and of course will certainly be a topic of discussion when the president travels next week go ahead q just one more on the baby formula shortage ms psaki sure q obviously some parents are feeling panicked and they re feeling desperate and a big reason for that is because there s no substitute for formula if you don t have access to breast milk i m just wondering if you re a parent today and you go to the store you can t find any formula on the shelves as is being reported across the country what is the step that they should take what is the administration s guidance on the immediate step that they should take is there a hotline that they can call should they take a baby to the hospital what should they do ms psaki well i would say those are important public health questions but what i can report on here or what i can convey to all of you is what we re doing to address exactly that concern which is taking every step we can to ensure there is supply on store shelves and we have increased the supply over the last four weeks and as the president as i noted at the top of this briefing we re going to take every step we can to cut red tape to ensure we re working with retailers like walmart and ceos that we re working with reckitt and gerber and others who can produce more to ensure we are getting supply out to stores and out to retailers so that parents don t have that concern but beyond that that s what i can read out for all of you from here q since you said it was a public health question which agency should that question be directed to just the very practical immediate question of if you can t find formula and you need it for your baby to eat what should they be doing ms psaki we would certainly encourage any parent who has concerns about their child s health or wellbeing to call their doctor or pediatrician q i just had one more ms psaki yeah q just quickly on the student loan debt cancellation can you give us a sense of whether the president is any closer to making a decision and just sort of his frame of mind as he s thinking about what amount he would be willing to cancel ms psaki well i think as i ve mentioned in here before on the campaign when he was talking about student loans he talked about a frame of about 125 000 a year that is not related to necessarily what this final policy will look like but i ve used that as a point of reference to remind everyone some who covered the campaign and some who did not that he s always felt it should be targeted this type of relief and focused on the people who need help the most i don t have any update on a final decision i would remind you all that again no one has paid a dime in federal student loans since the president took office and he s continuing to consider a range of options and policy here go ahead q on the formula shortage just two quick ones you said that this has been something that s been in the works for several months mostly through the fda when was the first time the president was briefed on the shortage ms psaki i m not going to get into internal briefings he s been made aware of it through the process and there s been steps q before this week ms psaki it would have been yes q okay has there been any consideration of using the defense production act to accelerate production ms psaki there are a range of there are a range of options including that under consideration ed but i would note the issue here is that a manufacturer was taken offline because they did not produce a safe baby formula so what we re doing here at this point in time is working with other manufacturers who can produce safe baby formula and we ve had success in increasing our productivity their productivity over the last four weeks and we re going to continue to work on that q but he would have known about this before this week it wasn t like this suddenly popped up ms psaki this has been something the administration has been working on for some time now q okay on ukraine senator rand paul has delayed passage of the aid for ukraine by insisting a new inse inspector general be established to track how the taxpayer money is being spent on the war it s going to delay passage of this probably now until next week would the president support establishing some kind of watchdog office to track this we ve asked about this before it s now a congressional issue any consideration of that ms psaki well i would say that we agree oversight is critical that s why the package already includes millions of dollars to support additional oversight measures including additional funding for existing inspectors general and we encourage all senators to promptly pass the bill as it stands we feel what s in there is sufficient q and one other thing that was left out of it at least in the house was an attempt to legalize the status of tens of thousands of afghan evacuees brought into the u s last year ms psaki yeah q does the white house see opportunity somewhere else soon to convince congress to get that across the finish line ms psaki we have been having conversations with congressional leadership about this they are ongoing on the best path forward for this and other priorities that were not included in the package we know this bill sends a clear message to ukraine to russia and to the world that we stand with the people of ukraine it doesn t mean every component of it has everything we want in it including that as an example but it s important to move it forward go ahead jacqui q thank you jen a couple of quick follow ups on baby formula and then i want to get to something else it does seem like we should have seen this coming that maybe the fda could have done more on the baby formula shortage the whistleblower who used to work at that sturgis plant warned the fda top officials about safety concerns in october but they didn t interview that whistleblower until december the inspection was until january 31st the recall happened february 17th so is that timeline acceptable to the white house and if not what is the white house doing to correct that at the fda ms psaki i m sure there will be plenty of time to take a look at if there are any issues that could have been improved here i don t have any specific analysis of that at this moment in time what i will note is that there has been work ongoing on this for months that s how we increase the supply and how we re able to you know increase the sales based on the month of april overall but there s more that needs to be done clearly we don t want any parent to fear about not being able to provide formula to their child and as i noted at the top the president is you know leaving no stone unturned in addressing this q i didn t see anything in the factsheet related to possible antitrust concerns according to one report 89 percent of the market is controlled by four companies i know the president has tried to increase competition in other areas where it s consolidated like meatpacking so is there going to be any call for increased competition in that industry coming from the white house ms psaki jacqui it s a good question i have not been made aware of that being a concern here but i m happy to raise it and see if there s more to tell you q and then i wanted to ask shift gears only slightly ms psaki sure q to crack pipes ms psaki okay q you said in february that no money from a 30 million harm reduction program would fund distribution of crack pipes in safe smoking kits the washington free beacon reported that they went to harm reduction facilities in five cities and all of those facilities had crack pipes in their kits hhs would not say which programs had applied for funding and the recipient list is not out yet so i m just wondering if the white house can say if any taxpayer dollars paid for these crack pipes ms psaki no federal funding has gone to it q and is there any oversight to ensure that when that money goes out for the program that these organizations will not use federal dollars for crack pipes ms psaki this policy does not allow for crack pipes to be included i would just note that this is a bit of a conspiracy theory that s been spread out there it s not accurate there s important drug treatment programs for people who have been suffering from what we ve seen as an epidemic across the country and money is not used for crack pipes q and i wanted to ask about the president s comments last night he went off about maga again ms psaki yeah maga king king maga q yes he referred to former president trump as the ultra maga king he s been decrying ultra maga republicans and saying he s going to be doing it more ms psaki mm hmm q but hillary clinton expressed some regret not too long ago for referring to trump voters as deplorables who couldn t be redeemed and considering that trump got 74 million votes in the last election i m just wondering if this is the best strategy for biden to win people over win over support ahead of the midterms especially given his inaugural theme being america united ms psaki well i would say that the president is not afraid to call out what he sees as extreme positions that are out of line with where the american people stand and whether that is supporting a tax plan that will raise taxes on 75 million americans making less than 100 000 a year or whether it is supporting efforts to overturn roe v wade something that two thirds of the american people in a fox news poll may i add supported and there are countless examples from there the president believes that there is still work we can do together the bipartisan innovation act is a good example of that but again he is not going to stand back and stand aside while people are pushing for extreme positions that are not in the interests or supported by the vast majority of the american people q on inflation today ro khanna just sort of feeding into his comments about last night from last night about inflation and the president was talking about the economy when he was referring to ultra maga and ro khanna said today that blaming putin may not be effective he said we need to say inflation is a real threat it s an emergency so it seems like the president has been ratcheting up this rhetoric you know blaming republicans blaming putin we ve heard all of the reasons why the pandemic is a factor but ro khanna is asking you know this white house to call inflation an emergency and call up the national guard to help with supply chains are those things that you d consider this white house would consider ms psaki jacqui i don t think anyone doesn t think inflation is an issue the president has said that countless times the question is q is it an emergency though ms psaki it doesn t matter what you call it the president just gave a speech on it yesterday the issue the question is what is your plan to address it he laid out a very a multipart plan yesterday he has taken a range of steps including steps that he even announced this week to lower the price of high speed internet for tens of millions of americans to give farmers the tools and resources they need to boost production to lower the deficit something that happened on his watch last year which will help to release 1 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to fix the family glitch what is the plan on the other side we all recognize it s a problem but if you open the cupboard door there s nothing there and that s the issue go ahead q jen the flags are flying at half staff above the white house and at federal locations across the country kristin urquiza her dad died in june of 2020 you likely know he was in an arizona hospital the only person there to hold his hand in the icu was the nurse she is now the founder of a group called marked by covid they have about 100 000 members right now they re advocating for a national day of remembrance a covid memorial day of sorts does the president support a national day of remembrance a covid memorial day ms psaki well peter i would say that we re still in a fight against covid and a battle against covid there are still far too many people getting sick getting hospitalized and dying and this is not the last time we will commemorate or the last step that the president will take to commemorate but i don t have anything to predict about the future q i imagine the same applies to a covid monument right you don t have any decisions made on that ms psaki those are all important questions and as the president has said before people who have lost loved ones obviously a million lives have been lost there are a lot of people across this country still in mourning he recognizes that we need to continue to commemorate that but we re still a fight in a fight with the virus q so on this day 1 million american lives lost an unimaginable figure only two plus years ago at 400 000 lives lost the president then president elect and vice president elect were there at the lincoln memorial 400 lights for 400 000 lives for 500 000 lives lost there was a moment of silence on the south lawn today was a bit different his only public comments were prerecorded remarks to the global covid summit i guess i m asking why not a more prominent remembrance for today s anniversary for today s marking ms psaki well i would say first the president publicly addressed this day and marked it we also lowered the flags for five days they will be lowered for five days and we will continue to mark and commemorate the lives lost what people care about the country though most is our action and what actions the president will continue to take and obviously since he took office according to a yale study it s estimated we ve saved over 2 2 million american lives and 900 billion in healthcare costs there s more work that needs to be done more work to fight misinformation more work to get more people vaccinated and action is what people care about q and people care about transparency as you indicate as well so my last question on this topic is can you help people better understand what data dr ashish jha was pointing to when he warned that the u s could potentially see 100 million infections in the u s if covid relief isn t passed now over the course of the fall and winter waves expected ms psaki there s a range of studies that are ongoing dr jha talks to a range of people internally health experts and externally and this is in the range of what they have conveyed to him directly and i expect there ll be more studies that come out in the coming months go ahead q thanks jen as you know north korea is on lockdown because a case of covid there ms psaki just one case q yeah ms psaki remarkable q the country laughter the country has previously rejected offers from covax for vaccinations i m wondering if the white house will launch a renewed push to try to get vaccines to north korea obviously almost their entire population or their entire population has not been vaccinated ms psaki yeah you re right and as you noted the dprk has repeatedly refused vaccine donations from covax we do not the united states does not currently have plans to share vaccines with the dprk we do continue to support international efforts aimed at the provision of critical humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable north koreans and this is of course a broader part of the dprk continuing to exploit its own citizens by not accepting this type of aid as you know it s not just vaccines it s also a range of humanitarian assistance that could very much help the people in the country and instead they divert resources to build their unlawful nuclear and ballistic missiles programs but yes we support international efforts no current plans for the u s to donate sp you know from the united states supply q and then just briefly on crypto as you know the crypto market is in something of a tailspin there has been an executive order that was put out in march to look into regulations and study the issue does does the process need to be sped up now given what we re seeing ms psaki well that was significant at the time i know it was you know only about two months ago because there had not been an acknowledgement about the need to look into crypto both the benefits and the challenges and it s an ongoing effort to do exactly that i know that those who are running it from the department of treasury and otherwise want to make sure it s thorough and that they re assessing both of those important questions the opportunities and the challenges so i would point you to them on whether there could be any effort to expedite or whether that s possible q rory hu is from nick news ms psaki i know rory we ve met q i know she s excited ms psaki rory go ahead q hi i just have a question and a follow up so first there are concerns about the negative impacts of social media on the mental health of children will the white house take any actions to prevent these adverse effects ms psaki as a mom myself rory my daughter is younger than you she d think you were very hip and cool no doubt this is a huge concern that i have we have the president has is the impact of social media platforms their enormous power and the fact that it is largely unchecked it is certainly something that our surgeon general dr vivek murthy has talked about in terms of the impact of social media platforms and what the impact they re having on the mental health the self esteem of young people and so i would say the president the first lady all of us believe that more needs to be done q and the internet has become a tool for children s education a lot of students use the internet to learn so how will the white house prevent children from getting misinformed from the internet ms psaki such a good question too well i know reporters like yourself and people that other kids listen to are good voices to provide accurate information and you ask coming here and asking tough questions is an important part of that i would say that you know one of the things that we encourage parents to do is you know make sure you are educating yourself on all of these platforms and what information is available and working with your kids to make sure they understand what s accurate and inaccurate there are certainly steps the government can take but there s also an ongoing development of new tools and we as parents need to keep educating ourselves about what s out there so we can make sure our kids have access to good information informative information we watch a lot of animal videos in my house that s all good and positive and not access to information that s inaccurate and misleading or problematic go ahead q thanks she s much better than portnoy so laughter ms psaki yeah hard con hard confirm laughter go ahead q our friends at reuters reported that there s no executive order being drafted to give hhs and doj new powers to block chinese access to vulnerable to americans sensitive information and so i was wondering if you have a sense of timeline on this but also the idea that there s been frustration with the administration frustration within the administration over some of the slow walking at commerce on rulemaking and investigations that that may have prompted this action by the president ms psaki well i would say that certainly the protection of the privacy of american citizens and ensuring that no foreign actors whether state owned or otherwise have access to the information of americans is of utmost concern to the president and to our national security advisor and others these processes can take some time to develop to investigate to finalize it s not a surprise if there is a frustration by anyone who s a part of that process but i can t speak to that from here but i can tell you certainly ensuring we are protecting americans privacy is of utmost concern to the president q a minister in the bolsonaro government said that he may skip the summit of the americas coming up because he wants to campaign if he is not going mexico says that they may not go and because venezuela cuba nicaragua may not be invited are we reaching a point where the summit may no longer be successful because so many key leaders in the hemisphere even though ones obviously that the president has had key disagreements with won t be attending ms psaki well no invitations have gone out for the summit so that is obviously something that will happen in short order given the summit is coming up in june i would note that secretary of state tony blinken spoke today with his counterparts and reiterated not only his appreciation for the continued collaboration we have with mexico but also noted that special advisor for the summit of the americas christopher dodd will travel to mexico later this month to further discuss preparations for the summit so these conversations are ongoing obviously important questions about what the final invitation list will look like we are certainly eager to host the summit something that you know is our highest priority for the hemisphere and it would be an important opportunity to talk about a range of issues including democracy including climate goals including the covid 19 response and addressing the root causes of migration so we are fully planning and moving forward but no final decisions about the invites have been made yet q and then a last one there was a report earlier this week that the president may be meeting with or speaking to the king of jordan obviously also i think we asked last week about this possibility of a regional summit in israel so i m wondering if you could confirm either of those things and specifically on the last whether saudi arabia is being weighed as a participant in that summit oil production obviously a kind of primary concern for many americans right now ms psaki yes okay first yes he will be meeting with the king of jordan i can get you the details of that after the briefing and on the second part of your question i think you re referring to what his travel might look like in june around the other summits we re still finalizing what that looks like there have been good questions about whether or not he will go to israel given he has committed to prime minister or accepted the invitation of prime minister bennett but that trip we re not quite there yet we re still finalizing the next trip we have had senior members of the national security team travel to saudi arabia to talk about a range of issues including regional cooperation obviously the war in yemen and supply on the global marketplace but i don t have anything to predict in terms of an upcoming visit by the president go ahead q yeah back on infant formula senator gillibrand in an interview with npr said that this is a life or death issue and that the other companies aren t stepping up they aren t producing as much formula as they should or could be and that she is going to ask the president to invoke the defense production act on this is that the kind of request that will be entertained ms psaki yes we re exploring every option i think when you look at the defense production act you have to ensure that it would actually achieve what you re trying to achieve and so we re also looking at that as well and we have been working this is one of the reasons obviously the president called ceos today of some of these vital companies to determine what more can be done because we know that with one major supplier having part of their supply off the marketplace the one of the easiest and fastest ways to address that is to increase supply from some of the other suppliers and also to import more which is a step we re working to take as well q they didn t happen to ask him to invoke the defense production act did they when ms psaki i m not aware of that being a specific ask from them i can see if there s more to read out from the from the calls as well q okay and just quickly on the covid deaths going back to the group marked by covid they re also asking the president to meet with people who ve lost loved ones to you know express his empathy and also sort of feel what they re feeling when is the last time he met with the loved ones of people who have died from covid and would he consider such a meeting ms psaki he certainly would and i think there even people who may not like the president may probably would not question his level of empathy and compassion for people who have lost loved ones and certainly addressing and talking about that impact is something you hear him do every time nearly every time he talks about covid he certainly would be open to doing that i don t have anything to predict in terms of the future schedule but yes go ahead q jen two of the or some of the steps at least two of them announced today on infant formula seem like things that could have been announced and steps that could have been taken earlier and any woman following this on any mom s list or whatever has known of rumblings of this crisis since nearly the plant shut down in february why why did it take so long to announce the steps you announced today ms psaki well again some of these steps we ve been working on just because we haven t been announcing them publicly including increasing supply and working with producers and suppliers some of the challenges we re also seeing let me just note it and i noted this a little bit earlier is this hoarding issue and we are also have been also calling on retailers to impose purchasing limits to prevent the possibility of hoarding because we know that that is an issue again sometimes it s people who are fearful but which is understandable but also it is also there s an element of people who are trying to benefit financially off of that fear which is where we have a concern but since the reca recall we ve been working nonstop to address and alleviate supply issues by working with these retailers engaging with the fda on additional steps we could take and obviously we re talking about laying all the specifics out now go ahead q and briefly on a different topic of ultra maga now you saw representative elise stefanik saying i m ultra maga and i m proud of it former trump super pac blasted out a t shirt of him as an ultra maga superman he on his own twitter alternative platform released a meme of him as the ultra maga king i guess i m curious what the administration makes of republicans and the former president sort of co opting this and elevating what president biden clearly intended as a pejorative ms psaki well i think if that means that the individuals you ve mentioned are embracing their opposition to a woman s right to make choices about her own healthcare if they re embracing a plan that will raise taxes on 75 million americans if they re embracing the importance of fighting mickey mouse over virtually any other issue i guess that s their platform good for them we re happy to have a debate about that go ahead q jen at the risk of sending you back to your state department days i was wondering if you could come back to the embrace of sweden and ms psaki sure q finland for nato and walk us through the distinction now between their qualifications and ukraine now that we have invested so much more heavily in making sure that ukraine remains an independent state and that it irreversibly could not be invaded again ms psaki well i would leave that to my nato spokesperson colleague to speak to what i would say david is that what we support is a nato application by finland or sweden should they choose to apply we know that they have been close and valued defense partners there are a range of requirements i m sure my nato counterparts could speak to including addressing a range of issues like corruption and how you would participate in the defense of the collective nato alliance but i will let them to speak speak to that we of course support the nato s nato s open door policy and the aspirations of any country to apply to join but i think this speaks to our longstanding relationship and military partnerships with finland and sweden q so you re saying that for finland and sweden you re supporting their application their right to apply but you re not embracing yet whether or not you would actually vote inaudible ms psaki we would support a nato application by finland and sweden yeah q okay and then take that the next step for us if you can which is to say that you ve heard what the russians how they reacted to this given the debate that took place back in the 15 20 years ago about expanding nato and the president s concerns at that time does he think that expanding it again just risks further provocation here and is that is the benefit at this point of having them in the alliance greater than the risk of the provocation ms psaki well i would go i would just like to quote the president of finland and what he said which i don t think i could state it better in response to this question which is as it relates to russia you caused this look at the mirror and you know that is nato is a defensive alliance it s not an offensive alliance both finland and sweden are close and valued defense partners of the united states and nato they re thriving democracies they ve worked closely with nato for years there s no aggressive intent from nato from the united states from finland or sweden obviously they can speak for themselves to russia but again this is president putin who caused this look at the mirror and i think that also probably is the reason for what you ve seen as public support for joining nato increase in these countries as well go ahead q thanks jen one on the covid summit and then if i can a follow up ms psaki sure q to what tam was asking about the dpa during the summit today did the u s hear any concerns from other countries about the delay in securing u s funding for the global effort or that there s a potential that that funding will not come through if congress doesn t move forward on it ms psaki i don t have a thorough readout and i d point you to other countries to speak to what they did or didn t express i would note that the vice president in her comments specifically highlighted the need to get additional funding including the 5 billion that is up for international covid relief which is part of the 22 5 we requested and she did that because there s a recognition an acknowledgement that we want to continue to be part of this effort to continue to lead this effort and without that funding we won t be as well positioned i would note that what is a success from this summit is of course the fact that we have been able to put together 3 2 billion in contributions from a range of countries attending to this global effort and that is part of was part of the purpose to ensure that we were elevating this working together coordinating you know to prevent complacency to prevent deaths to prevent and plan for future variants and that kind of money from other countries is an important step forward q and to follow up on the dpa question obviously baby formula is a very specific product but is there a lesson that can be learned from the covid supplies of ppe and vaccines and scaling up production that the administration could apply to this situation right now ms psaki that s a very good question karen i think one of the challenges in this cycle of the supplies here is that companies are going to produce what the market needs right and if you look at things like tests or masks you know back in the fall remember we had a shortage of tests this summer we had an abundance of tests to the point where companies were shutting down manufacturing so the challenge is is that it s about what the demand is in the marketplace and obviously now there s high demand because there s a shortage because of this recall which was done again to save babies lives and you know clearly our efforts and focus now is on increasing supply from other suppliers and importing more so that we can meet the current demand and needs now go ahead q thank you so much another one on baby formula that families with babies who are sick and relying on specialty mix ms psaki yeah q and that i understand that are only manufactured in this plant that is offline now so what s the plan for those families ms psaki i addressed this a little bit yesterday or the day before i guess it was the day before which is part of our effort is to ensure and work with other suppliers who can ma who make baby formula who can meet the same needs of children who have special needs or who have specific needs for what formula they can take to ensure that supply is on the marketplace as well q okay and just on this ms psaki and the fda has been doing that but go ahead q on this whole supply chain issue we often hear the president saying the solution to supply chain problems is to produce in the united states in this case we have a product that is manufactured i think 98 percent in the united states so how do you reconcile these two messages you know made in america ms psaki well there because the reason for this shortage is not because there was a supply chain issue in a foreign country that s a different issue that s one supply chain issue this issue is because there was unsafe product that the fda recalled to save babies lives so it s just a different issue go ahead q thank you a senior administration official yesterday said that the president s trip to south korea and japan later this month is part of his plans to inaudible policy and he s the first administration to be raise it to the leadership level does the president have plans to visit the other two countries india and australia and when that is going to ms psaki i m sure he will in the future but we have two foreign trips we re still trying to finalize at this point and so i don t have any predictions about when q is it going to be in the first term of the president ms psaki i can t make a prediction of that but there s a lot of time left in the first term so that s the good news a lot of time for travel q and the second question what is u s expectations from india on the two wars the world is fighting one is the ukraine war the other is covid 19 ms psaki well we continue to remain in close touch with india about you know our efforts to rally the world to stand up against russian aggression that means implementing and abiding by sanctions that have been put in place and as you know daleep took a trip our deputy national security advisor took a trip just a few weeks ago there to have a conversation about that we continue to encourage countries to speak out about russian aggression and obviously on covid 19 we ve been an important partner with india in providing supply and vaccines and needs in their times of need over the course of the last 15 months and certainly we ll continue to work with them on that go ahead q thanks jen one on finland one on israel when russia threatened military technical means against ukraine many months ago you were sounding the alarm bells you were doing very specific projections as to what the russians were going to do they invoked that term again after finland s announcement what do you make of it what are your concerns about russia s response to this ms psaki about russia s con q about russia s response to a finnish application for nato membership ms psaki well i would say that the facts are important here which is that nato is a defensive alliance nato has no aggressive intent again against russia nor does the united states nor do finland and sweden we have long supported before the invasion after the invasion the open door policy and certainly given finland and sweden are have longstanding important partnerships with the united states with nato countries they re longstanding democracies that s why we support their application but you know beyond that i think it s important to note what the facts are here which is that there s no aggressive intent at all q on the killing of shireen abu akleh in jenin you called for an investigation a swift investigation i guess the question is what kind of investigation the israelis have extended an offer for the palestinians to participate in a joint investigation should they be accepting that offer and they ve also asked for u s oversight over some examination of for example the bullet that killed shireen you know what have you responded to that offer what would you like to see ms psaki well we understand that both israel and the palestinian authority are already conducting investigations into the circumstances of the killing we encourage both parties to do so thoroughly and transparently and to share their findings to ensure that all evidence in this case is available and fully assessed we stand ready to assist either party in any way that we can neither side has asked for our assistance at this time and such a request would be required in order for us to do so go ahead q so as part of this ultra maga rollout the president has talked a lot about sort of what the republican what he thinks the republican party now stands for he s also you know thrown out some tough language saying they were petty and mean spirited and sort of cowering to former president trump does he but he s also said he s been surprised by that does he still feel like the fever will break in washington ms psaki well you mean in terms of the ultra maga followers of the former president q just in terms of if ultra maga you know as he says controls the party that would be the party that he thought would come around ms psaki well i just want to make sure i understand your question q sure ms psaki are you asking me if he thinks that there will ever be a period of time where there will not be a ultra maga party or if q does he does he feel like there will be a period in time when he is president in which the ultra maga wing of the republican party doesn t control it and that the fever will break in washington ms psaki well that s certainly his hope the president has long believed that democrats and republicans can work together can work together to get things done he signed 80 bipartisan bal bills into law last year the bipartisan innovation act is something we re still working to get through and his view is that this is a conversation a lot of it s happening in washington and they are for the american people and the american public a lot of these policies that the ultra maga wing the maga king all the different terminology where the president is using out there does not align with where the vast majority of the public is and elected officials should be doing what the vast majority of the public wants them to do q does the white i and excuse me if you guys have already reacted to this does the white house have a comment on the latest round of subpoenas by the january 6th commission ms psaki we certainly support the work of the january 6th committee we ll continue to support their work we believe it s vital and essential to get to the bottom of what happened on january 6th one of the darkest days in our democracy so we ll continue to support their work go ahead q jen last question ms psaki okay last one go ahead q thanks jen staying on ultra maga and the rick scott ms psaki yeah q obviously the president himself is not subject to the hatch act but as the midterms start to take over basically everything can you just talk about how the white house is navigating the distinction between political speech and official events ms psaki for the pres in what the president is doing or how he spends his time q in terms of the appropriateness of making explicitly political or campaign focused messages during official white house events ms psaki well i would say that i am subject to the hatch act as i have noted in a sternly written letter to me but the president is not as you know and he is the leader of the democratic party he s also the commander in chief he s also the leader of the free world and what he is pointing out is what he sees to be a troubling trend in our democ into our country that s a threat to our democracy a threat to progress and certainly he s going to continue to draw the contrast for the american people on what the options present all right i m just going to do patsy and april because i patsy go ahead q thank you jen so on the u s asean summit can you give us a sense of how hard the president will push on the issue of ukraine for example whether the administration will be pushing to include the word russia in the final communiqué as you know asean have so far avoided using that word on any of their statements on the ukraine crisis and i have a follow up on afghanistan if you don t mind ms psaki sure so on the asean summit ukraine will absolutely be on the agenda in terms of what the final communiqué will look like i don t expect it will be ready for more than 24 hours and there s lots of conversations that need to happen between now and then so i can t make a prediction of it but i will say that a number of the asean participants have been important partners in calling out the aggressive action of russia and invading ukraine in participating and in supporting sanctions and certainly abiding by them and obviously the conflict we re seeing is a unique moment in modern global history so it will certainly be on the agenda okay go ahead last thing and then i ll go to april and then i got to go q can you confirm reports that jake sullivan recently met with the chief of the pakistani spy agency in washington d c can you share anything from that meeting and whether the two sides discussed counterterrorism cooperation in afghanistan ms psaki i don t have any details on that reported meeting i can certainly check and see if there s more okay april wrap it up q yes wrapping it up i m going to share on another meeting ms psaki sure q if there s more information congressman greg meeks the chair of the house foreign affairs committee met with the president he was part of a group meeting with the president this week and he talked about issues that he talked with was it president zelenskyy and one of those issues that president zelenskyy specifically brought up to meeks and the contingent was ukrainian grains and how it is impacting the lack of ukrainian grains going out to the world is impacting africa meeks said the president spoke about it can you drill down a little bit more about this has the president has said he wants it to go out to the world can you drill down a little bit more especially when it comes to africa because there s a concern about many of those countries to include ethiopia and the congo ms psaki yeah q that s already going through crisis ms psaki yeah it s an important issue we re seeing food shortages in the world including in parts of africa other parts of the middle east this is one of the reasons why the president went to chicago and raised the issue of doing everything we can to increase supply here in the united states while we don t expect shortages here we want to be providers of american grains to the rest of the world as we re seeing shortages in part because of the war in ukraine we ve also provided a large amount of assistance to global food programs global aid programs in anticipation of what we see as a potential shortage of food and we ll continue to work on it q cross talk by reporter q i m sorry i m sorry does this give the president more pause that president zelenskyy himself brought that issue of grain for africa up specifically africa the continent ms psaki well we are working on this issue and have been working on this issue for months now that is the president went on a trip just yesterday to elevate and talk about the steps we re taking to increase supply of grains and wheat here in the united states to address exactly this issue and we are far and away the world s largest provider of assistance in aid to global food programs in order to address what we know could be a shortage around the world thank you everyone 4 36 p m edt

statements and information reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions that while considered reasonable by the company are inherently subject to significant operational business economic and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies these assumptions include continued operations and exploration work including plans to complete infill drilling at tucano in 2022 without significant interruption due to covid 19 or any other reason the accuracy of the company s geological modeling at tucano and the assumptions upon which they are based ore grades and recoveries prices for gold silver and base metals remaining as estimated currency exchange rates remaining as estimated prices and inflation rates for energy inputs labour materials supplies and services including transportation all necessary permits licenses and regulatory approvals for the company s operations and exploration work are received in a timely manner on favourable terms including permitting for tailings dam construction in tucano tucano will be able to continue to use cyanide in its operations the company will not be required to impair

its current mining contractor in tucano u m to resolve equipment availability issues and restore contracted volume deficits without escalating to a formal dispute the ability to fully mobilize the company s new mine contractor minax in q2 that there are no material unanticipated variations in the cost of energy or supplies operations not being disrupted by issues such as pit wall failures or instability mechanical failures labour disturbances and workforce shortages illegal occupations or mining seismic events and adverse weather conditions the company s ability to comply with environmental health and safety laws the company s ability to comply with brazil s new tailings dam criteria and review processes and to secure the required permits for new tailings storage capacity beyond mid 2024 at competitive costs and the company s ability to maintain its stock exchange listings the foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements to be materially different such factors include among others risks and uncertainties relating to the impact of covid 19 on the company s ability to operate and conduct exploration work including drilling plans as anticipated and the risk of an unplanned partial or full shutdown of the company s mines and processing plants whether voluntary or imposed which would adversely impact the company s revenues financial condition and ability to meet its production and cost guidance and fund its capital programs and repay its indebtedness the inherent risk that estimates of mineral reserves and resources may not be accurate and accordingly that mine production will not be as estimated or predicted planned exploration activities including plans for further exploration drilling and infill drilling may not result in the discovery of new mineral resources definition of mineral resources and readers are cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no defined economic viability there is no certainty that the company will be able to define a mineral resource with infill drilling and the company is undertaking new mineral resource studies at urn and is not treating the amc historical estimate as a current mineral resource estimate open pit mining operations at tucano have a limited established mine life and the company may not be able to extend the mine life for tucano open pit operations beyond 2025 as anticipated gold silver and base metal prices may decline or may be less than forecasted fluctuations in currency exchange rates including the u s dollar to brazilian real exchange rate may increase costs of operations operational and physical risks inherent in mining operations including pit wall collapses tailings storage facility failures environmental accidents and hazards industrial accidents equipment breakdown unusual or unexpected geological or structural formations cave ins flooding and severe weather may result in unforeseen costs shut downs delays in production and drilling and exposure to liability potential political and social risks involving great panther s operations in a foreign jurisdiction the potential for unexpected costs and expenses or overruns shortages in the ability to procure equipment and operating supplies without interruption including the inability of the company to resolve concerns over lost production and equipment availability issues with contractor u m and avoid any escalation to a formal dispute employee and contractor relations relationships with and claims by local communities the company s inability to obtain all necessary permits licenses and regulatory approvals in a timely manner on favourable terms changes in laws regulations and government practices in the jurisdictions in which the company operates legal restrictions related to mining diminishing quantities or grades of mineral reserves as properties are mined operating or technical difficulties in mineral exploration changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined the company s inability to meet its production forecasts or to generate the anticipated cash flows from operations could result in the company s inability to meet its scheduled debt payments when due or to meet financial covenants to which the company is subject or to fund its exploration programs as planned the company s ability to raise additional financing to fund its operations capital requirements or maturing debt obligations as required the ability to maintain and renew agreements with local communities to support continued operations ability to identify or complete acquisition opportunities or to complete acquisitions that are accretive to the company the potential for incremental closure bond requirements with respect to the company s coricancha mine and whether such requirements would have a material and adverse effect on the company s liquidity and could require additional financing to be raised the risk that the company does not maintain its listing on the exchanges where it trades and that any delisting may have a material impact on the liquidity of its stock and its ability to raise capital the potential for tsf permitting regulations in brazil to negatively impact the company s ability to maintain its existing tailings facilities without any modifications and to secure new tailings capacity at

an infant formula shortage that began several months ago is reaching crisis proportions in the united states as a combination of supply chain problems and a major recall are making it difficult or impossible for many parents to secure the product the shortage has prompted retailers to limit the amount of formula that individuals can buy in order to deter hoarding it has also placed enormous strain on social services programs such as the federal special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children known by the acronym wic the unprecedented scope of this infant formula recall has serious consequences for babies and new parents brian dittmeier senior director of public policy at the national wic association said in a statement provided to voa assurances from manufacturers that production has ramped up have not yet translated to new product on the shelf each day that this crisis continues parents grow more anxious and desperate to find what they need to feed their infants some health departments said that they had with a few exceptions been able to keep formula in stock for wic recipients in an email exchange with voa a district of columbia health department spokesperson said since the beginning of the national infant formula shortage dc health has been working with its wic formula vendor local retail stores and its wic grantees to ensure all families receiving dc wic benefits have continuous access to infant formula while there have been spot shortages of infant formula in some stores dc health and its wic grantee partners are assisting dc wic families and currently these families are able to purchase a range of infant formulas using their wic benefits a crisis with multiple causes the baby formula supply started to become unsteady in the second half of 2021 according to datasembly a firm that tracks sales at grocery and retail stores in the first half of last year out of stock rates for infant formula held steady between 2 and 8 the company found as the year went on however the rates began climbing ending the year at over 15 the growing scarcity in the u s was primarily attributed to various supply chain woes caused by the coronavirus pandemic rates climbed sharply in february after abbott one of the three companies that produce virtually all infant formula in the u s announced a voluntary recall of its products after discovering dangerous bacteria in one of its manufacturing plants the abbott plant was shut down and as of thursday it still had not received permission to begin production again by the beginning of april datasembly was reporting out of stock rates above 30 at the end of last week the rate had leaped to 43 few import options when u s domestic production of crucial goods is disrupted market participants natural reaction is to import foreign made goods to satisfy demand but with infant formula it s not that simple food and drug administration rules covering infant formula are so strict that almost all foreign made formula cannot be legally sold in the u s that includes formula that meets standards for sale in the european union and in developed countries such as canada and mexico abbott which has an fda certified manufacturing facility in ireland has been air shipping formula from the country daily but the volume has not been meeting the need increasing production difficult converting other food manufacturing facilities to produce infant formula is not feasible because it poses an unacceptable health risk the fda said in a statement it s important to understand that only facilities experienced in and already making essentially complete nutrition products are in the position to produce infant formula product that would not pose significant health risks to consumers the agency said the fda is aware that parents nationwide are struggling commissioner robert m califf said in a statement we are doing everything in our power to ensure there is adequate product available where and when they need it he said ensuring the availability of safe sole source nutrition products like infant formula is of the utmost importance to the fda our teams have been working tirelessly to address and alleviate supply issues and will continue doing everything within our authority to ensure the production of safe infant formula products white house announces actions on thursday the white house announced the administration of president joe biden was taking several steps to alleviate the crisis the administration said it would work with states to loosen the rules wic participants follow when buying formula the program usually requires them to use wic funds to buy specific kinds of formula and in packages of a specific volume easing those rules will help reduce the stress on many families the administration said the white house said it would ask the federal trade commission to crack down on any businesses taking advantage of the shortage to raise prices to unfair levels finally the administration said that in the coming days the fda would announce steps to make it easier to import infant formula from other countries congress gets involved in congress representative frank pallone a democrat who chairs the house energy and commerce committee said wednesday that his committee would investigate the formula shortage this month the focus of this hearing will be on better understanding the causes of the shortage what has been done to increase production and supply thus far and what more still needs to be done to ensure access to safe formula across the nation pallone said while pallone praised the biden administration s actions the top republican on the committee representative cathy mcmorris rodgers of washington state criticized the white house for its slow response we are asking the questions we ve been raising the alarm to president biden for months she said we ve been seeing the empty shelves we ve been seeing the rising cost on families she added on behalf of every parent and caregiver who is unsure as to whether they will be able to feed their children we need answers and we need accountability structural problems some people involved in the wic program question the wisdom of allowing a system to persist in which only a few companies supply something as vital as infant formula they also question the tactics of infant formula manufacturers who provide free samples to new mothers which many see as discouraging breastfeeding as a country we must take a hard look at how we got to this moment said dittmeier of the national wic association the infant formula industry is highly concentrated with only three companies bidding for contracts in the wic space he said for decades this small number of manufacturers have been allowed to target new parents in hospitals and other settings undermining public health efforts to promote breastfeeding these tactics are abetted by policies that do not support new mothers in sustaining breastfeeding including the more than 9 million women who work in jobs that do not have statutory protections for nursing or pumping he added every day we hear from parents who are hurt angry anxious and scared the lives of their infants are on the line it is time for answers and accountability as we all work to improve the supply and ease the worries of parents enduring this national crisis

hey there time traveller this article was published 11 05 2022 705 days ago so information in it may no longer be current washington ap federal reserve chair jerome powell fresh off winning senate confirmation for a second term earlier in the day acknowledged for the first time thursday that high inflation and economic weakness overseas could thwart his efforts to avoid causing a recession for weeks powell has portrayed the fed s drive to raise interest rates as consistent with a so called soft landing for the economy under that scenario the fed would manage to tighten borrowing costs enough to cool the economy and curb inflation without going so far as to tip the economy into recession but in an interview on npr s marketplace powell conceded that that balancing act which many economists have said they doubt the fed can achieve could be undercut by economic slowdowns in europe and china federal reserve board chair jerome powell speaks during a news conference at the federal reserve wednesday may 4 2022 in washington the federal reserve intensified its drive to curb the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short term interest rate by a sizable half percentage point ap photo alex brandon the question whether we can execute a soft landing or not it may actually depend on factors that we don t control the fed chair said there are huge events geopolitical events going on around the world that are going to play a very important role in the economy in the next year or so such comments reflect less confidence in avoiding a recession than powell has previously conveyed just last week he said at a news conference i think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome on thursday he said that slowing inflation to the fed s 2 annual target from its current 6 6 according to the central bank s preferred measure will also include some pain but ultimately the most painful thing would be if we were to fail to deal with it and inflation were to get entrenched in the economy at high levels winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement europe s economies are suffering from high inflation exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine and the resulting spike in natural gas and oil prices europe has been far more dependent on russian energy supplies than the united states has been china s strict covid lockdown policies have shut down ports hindering exports and slowing consumer spending in cities like shanghai where millions of chinese have been largely restricted to their homes for weeks in his interview with npr powell also seemed to suggest that the fed would at least consider raising its benchmark rate by an extremely large three quarters of a point if inflation failed to show signs of easing in the coming months last week the stock market initially soared when powell appeared to take a three quarter point rate hike off the table after repeating his comment from last week that half point hikes were likely at each of the next two fed meetings in june and july powell added thursday if things come in better than we expect then we re prepared to do less if they come in worse than when we expect then we re prepared to do more when asked if do more meant a three quarter point hike powell said you ve seen this committee adapt to the incoming data and the evolving outlook and that s what we ll continue to do

get inflation under control that s unusual since there s a code in ottawa that arm s length crown corporations especially the central bank should be spared that level of political attack as it undermines confidence that technocrats will be left alone to do their work without interference from elected officials does it matter in some ways it doesn t to make good on his threat poilievre will first have to win the leadership vote on sept 10 he would then have to win the next federal election which probably won t happen until the autumn of 2025 if the minority liberal government and the new democratic party stay true to their power sharing agreement by then it could be time to start looking for a new governor no matter who is running the prime minister s office macklem s seven year term ends in june 2027 however poilievre s threat comes at a delicate time for the bank of canada macklem last month conceded that he and his deputies had misjudged the strength of inflation implying they probably left interest rates too low for too long the consumer price index surged 6 7 per cent in march from a year earlier one of the fastest rates of growth since the early 1980s the bank of canada s primary mission is to keep the consumer price index advancing at a year over year pace of about two per cent noon news roundup your weekday lunchtime roundup of curated links news highlights

article content advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content central banks almost everywhere are in a similar predicament but that excuse probably only goes so far with a public that has made its dislike of inflation very clear to pollsters the bank of canada has a credibility issue that probably won t be resolved until it deflates the cost of living which macklem has pledged to do he raised the benchmark interest rate a quarter point on march 2 a half point on april 13 and has all but said there will be another half point increase on june 1 that would put the policy rate at 1 5 per cent ahead of the summer he has also said he s prepared to push the rate above three per cent if that is what is needed to take the heat out of prices that brings us back to poilievre who is backed by 53 members of the conservative caucus compared with jean charest s 13 endorsements to some extent controlling inflation is about psychology if we have faith in the bank of canada to get inflation back to two per cent we probably won t insist on cost of living adjustments of seven or eight per cent poilievre is actively undermining confidence in the central bank s ability to execute its mission he has a unique ability to sow doubt because he has captured the imagination of the mainstream press the same way donald trump did on his way to the white house that means his words are amplified on a regular basis at the same time poilievre is more than capable of getting his message out on his own he has nearly 371 000 twitter followers and tens of thousands of people watch his youtube videos advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content is this new the bank of canada has been here before james coyne who served as governor from 1955 to 1961 resigned amid a political and personality clash with former prime minister john diefenbaker that episode led to the rewriting of the bank of canada act as coyne s successor louis rasminsky insisted on clear guidelines that would leave the central bank alone to manage monetary policy on a day to day basis diefenbaker rewrote the law to state that if the government disagreed with monetary policy it would issue a formal directive on what it wanted the central bank to do if the governor ever disagrees it s understood that he or she will resign more recently another career politician jean chrétien was highly critical of bank of canada governor john crow on his way to winning the 1993 election for the liberals crow favoured zero inflation and the high interest rates required for that approach to monetary policy were choking economic growth however chrétien never intended to fire crow at least according to paul martin john crow symbolized monetary probity to the markets so i wanted him to stay martin who was chrétien s first finance minister wrote in his political memoir jean chrétien wanted him to stay for the same reason despite having been very critical of him when we were in opposition if we let him go we thought it was going to be a major blot on our economic copybook before we even got started advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content crow s term was up for renewal a couple of months after the liberals were elected in november martin wrote that he wanted an inflation target of around two per cent while crow insisted the target should be closer to zero martin appointed gordon thiessen crow s deputy instead what s poilievre s problem poilievre a longtime member of the house finance committee tends to take an orthodox approach to economics he dislikes quantitative easing qe an aggressive approach to monetary policy whereby central banks create money to purchase financial assets usually government bonds because they tend to serve as a benchmark for other assets the bank of canada along with many other central banks deployed qe during the covid 19 recession after it dropped its policy rate to nearly zero poilievre accused the bank of canada of being the federal government s atm poilievre s critique of qe is based on the tenet that more money chasing fewer goods is necessarily inflationary however qe didn t cause runaway inflation a decade ago when central banks in the united states and europe aggressively used it to reverse the great recession central bankers mostly stopped worrying about the money supply decades ago and some economists including former bank of canada governor stephen poloz are skeptical that qe does much more than signal to bond traders where interest rates are headed advertisement 6 story continues below

its mistakes that s bull david dodge fires back at poilievre s criticism of the bank of canada bank of canada s carolyn rogers seeks to shore up central bank s credibility amid political attacks the current burst of inflation could spark a rethink of the role money creation plays in the economy but any critique that puts the blame for inflation on central banks overstates their role because most of the price pressure is the result of supply constraints related to the pandemic and the surge in commodity prices related to russia s invasion of ukraine it has to be said and repeated this current round of inflation this latest leg up has nothing to do with what the boc was implementing two years ago said bay street economist david rosenberg founder of toronto based rosenberg research it s totally ridiculous here s what the bank of canada has to say it s not the bank s role to comment on political debates said paul badertscher director of media relations at the bank of canada governor macklem was appointed by the bank of canada s board of directors with the approval of the governor in council for a seven year period and his term runs until june 2027 advertisement 7 story continues

the end of 2024 suggesting that if poilievre cares about getting the cost of living under control then he may get his wish years before he would have a chance to fire macklem poilievre also needs to win the leadership race things look good for him based on the number of elected conservatives he s recruited to his side the relatively large crowds that consistently show up at his events and the buzz his candidacy is creating however his lead is narrower by another important metric money poilievre has raised about 545 000 compared with charest s 490 000 the race isn t over yet email

applying transformative chemistry to improve prescription drug safety and performance focused on reducing abuse and overdose today reported financial results for the first quarter 2022 dr lynn kirkpatrick chief executive officer of ensysce commented the first few months of 2022 are off to an exciting start evident in the most recent clinical results from trials pf614 102 and pf614 mpar 101 as we progress on our studies and clinical trials we are closer to realizing our mission providing abuse and overdose protection where needed i look forward to our upcoming corporate update call next week to discuss the recent results from the trials especially regarding the longer lasting profile of pf614 and the encouraging initial data from our overdose protection study additionally we expect the bioequivalence be trial data of our taap opioid pf614 to be available prior to the end of the second quarter positioning pf614 as our first commercial candidate and demonstrating progress towards our goal to bring a unique pipeline of products to the market taaptm opioid abuse deterrent program updates on may 5 2022 the company announced clinical trial results from trial pf614 102 confirming the safety and longer lasting profile of pf614 versus oxycontin the results of the study show the longer lasting half life of pf614 versus oxycontin as seen in the prior phase 1 single ascending dose study of pf614 oral solution versus oxycontin we believe this data confirms the findings from our phase 1 study that demonstrate pf614 should provide true twice daily dosing the safety data for the study also showed that pf614 performed similarly to oxycontin with no serious treatment emergent adverse events recorded the second part of the pf614 102 study the bioequivalence be arm continues to be analyzed and as reported previously we anticipate that this be data will be available by the end of the second quarter of 2022 the company believes that the data will support the 505 b 2 regulatory path for clinical development of pf614 an abbreviated pathway to fda approval human abuse liability hal studies to determine labeling claims for pf614 are scheduled to initiate in the second quarter of 2022 pf614 is designed using the abuse protective platform taap trypsin activated abuse protection a chemical modification which inactivates the active ingredient in ensysce s opioid products including pf614 until swallowed and exposed to the enzyme trypsin in the digestive system our taap platform which we believe provides abuse protection and resistance to manipulation and other forms of recreational drug abuse should also control the rate of release of the active opioid mpartm opioid abuse deterrent and overdose protection program updates on may 5 2022 the company announced initial results from trial pf614 mpar 101 providing first human data showing the potential for overdose protection with mpar multi pill abuse resistance this data demonstrated how the combination product pf614 mpar could reduce the trypsin activation and reduce the release of oxycodone in a simulated overdose situation it also demonstrated the pf614 in the systemic circulation simulated injection did not convert to oxycodone we believe this is the first step to identifying the first mpar drug product that will be marketed in the coming years the study is continuing with additional subjects

parents swap sell baby formula as biden focuses on shortage parents across the country are struggling to find baby formula in stock in stores because of supply chain disruptions combined with a massive safety recall ap photo david zalubowski by josh boak and pat eaton robb washington ap a baby formula shortage in the united states is driving parents to swap sell and offer leftover supplies to each other while president joe biden spoke with manufacturers and retailers thursday about the plight facing families the president discussed with executives from mead johnson and gerber how they could increase production and how his administration could help and talked with leaders from walmart and target about how to restock shelves and address regional disparities in access to formula according to the white house the administration plans to monitor possible price gouging and work with trading partners in mexico chile ireland and the netherlands on imports even though 98 of baby formula is domestically made the problem is the result of supply chain disruptions and a safety recall and has had a cascade of effects retailers are limiting what customers can buy and doctors and health workers are urging parents to contact food banks or physicians offices in addition to warning against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes the shortage is weighing particularly on lower income families after the recall by formula maker abbott stemming from contamination concerns that recall wiped out many brands covered by wic a federal program like food stamps that serves mothers infants and children though the program now permits brand substitutes the biden administration is working with states to make it easier for wic recipients to buy different sizes of formula that their benefits might not currently cover parents particularly moms are using social media to bridge the supply gaps ashley maddox a 31 year old mother of two from san diego started a facebook group on wednesday after failing to find formula for her 5 month old son cole at the commissary on the navy base i connected with a gal in my group and she had seven cans of the formula i need that were just sitting in her house that her baby didn t need anymore she said so i drove out it was about a 20 minute drive and picked it up and paid her it was a miracle she said there was already a stigma attached to being a non breastfeeding mom and that the group has become supportive to not be able to have that formula it s scary she said jennifer kersey 36 of cheshire connecticut said she was down to her last can of formula for her 7 month old son blake kersey jr before someone saw her post on a facebook group and came by with a few sample cans at first i was starting to panic she said but i m a believer in the lord so i said god i know you re going to provide for me and i just started reaching out to people hey do you have this formula she said she and others in the group are helping each other finding stores which may have the formula in stock and getting formula to mothers who need it kimberly anderson 34 of hartford county maryland said her 7 1 2 month old son takes a prescription formula that has been nearly impossible to find locally she turned to social media and said people in utah and boston found the formula which she paid to have shipped they say it takes a village to raise a baby she said little did i know my village spans the entire u s as i ping friends family for their zip codes so i can check their local walmarts to have them ship directly to me erika thompson 28 a mother of three in wallingford connecticut said it s become almost a full time job for her to track down the hypoallergenic formula her 3 1 2 month old daughter everly must have she said friends out of state have also been looking for her and shipping cans if they find them she is down to one small sample can which she said might last a couple more days you can travel everywhere countless towns stores amazon online she said honestly it s heartbreaking she said she was unable to produce an adequate supply of milk but she should not have to explain that to people it s not our fault she said shortages of basic goods have been a problem since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 access to medical supplies computer chips household appliances autos and other goods has been hurt by closed factories and outbreaks of the virus as well as storms and other climate related events a safety recall compounded the challenges regarding baby formula the food and drug administration warned consumers on feb 17 to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a sturgis michigan facility run by abbott nutrition which then initiated a voluntary recall according to findings released in march by federal safety inspectors abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant the fda launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant all four had to be hospitalized and two died chicago based abbott said in a statement there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company s factory abbott noted abbott said that pending fda approval we could restart the site within two weeks the company would begin by first producing elecare alimentum and metabolic formulas and then start production of similac and other formulas once production began it would take six weeks to eight weeks for the baby formula to be available on shelves on tuesday the fda said it was working with u s manufacturers to increase their output and streamlining paperwork to allow more imports the agency noted that supply chain issues associated with the pandemic were part of the problem and that consumers bought more baby formula in april than in the month before the recall

me confidence on our ability to perform also our ability to maintain non gaap net income of 405 000 for the first quarter of 2022 or 0 02 per basic and diluted common share is a solid metric these numbers were particularly impressive considering that we faced headwinds in the first quarter which do appear to be subsiding we noted an increase in customers that contracted or closed their businesses toward the end of the year in december it appeared that both customers and potential customers were spending less and delaying certain capital expenditures due to the uncertainty surrounding the economy inflation and supply chain issues product revenue was down quarter over quarter since the deferred purchasing decisions affected the sale of newer desktop devices we believe these conditions are improving and we expect those effects to be short lived we believe it is not a matter of if but when before most companies move to the cloud and crexendo is particularly suited to benefit from that migration mihaylo added our integration continues to be going well and will provide substantial benefits to both customers of the software solutions division and the telecom division we are seeing continued excitement for the crexendo vip platform powered by the award winning netsapiens technology which i am convinced provides the best benefits in the industry as well as the best

and improve our sales and marketing programs all of which will benefit the company its customers its employees and most importantly its shareholders i continue to be highly confident that we will continue to grow the business both organically as well as through additional accretive acquisitions and stand behind my earlier expectation of growing the business this year by 40 to 50 this is a very exciting time for crexendo doug gaylor president and chief operating officer stated i agree with steve that the results are solid and that we are beginning to see improvements in the deferred

measures to evaluate our business we consider and use non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap net income and adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of operating performance these measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period to period basis we consider non gaap net income to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to evaluate results without the effects of share based compensation acquisition related expenses changes in fair value of contingent consideration and amortization of intangibles we define ebitda as u s gaap net income loss before interest income interest expense other income and expense provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization we believe ebitda provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for acquisition related expenses changes in fair value of contingent consideration and share based compensation we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance we also believe use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period as well as across companies in our may 12 2022 earnings press release as furnished on form 8 k we included non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda the terms non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not defined under u s gaap and are not measures of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be

taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements while share based compensation is a component of operating expense the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock and other companies may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our u s gaap results and using non gaap net income ebitda

caryn mackoff 39 does most of her grocery shopping online and never had an issue finding the formula for her 8 month old yakova about two weeks ago mackoff noticed her online orders weren t getting filled her family is one of many in austin and around the country thatare struggling to find the formula needed to feed their babies a national formula shortage was triggered in part by the closure of a plant in michigan after unsanitary conditions were found that abbott plant which makes the similac brand could begin production again in two weeks datasembly which tracks grocery availabilities and prices estimates that as of may 8 43 of formula brands were out of stock across the country in austin grocery chain h e b is limiting the amount of formula shoppers can purchase though some popular brands remain available texas wic which helps families afford formula through its benefits program has expanded which formulas families can buy using their women infants and children benefits that list of approved brands can be found at texaswic org the federal government has also launched a site to help families find formula hhs gov formula index html the shortage has been especially hard for families like mackoff who have babies with certain medical conditions and food allergies because the abbott plant made some of those metabolic formulas yakova has eczema and acid reflux and can only take the enfamil nutramigen infant formula my husband went to randall s and he went to walgreens and he went to a bunch of places and he couldn t find it and we have actually yet to find it in the city of austin she said my mom found two cans in houston of my particular formula but she said that there s really no other formula available and so she s been kind in helping us because my formula is also extremely expensive a 12 ounce can of the formula is more than 30 we re blessed in that we make ok money and we can buy ahead of time out of convenience not necessarily out of necessity mackoff said i m just thinking about people who don t have that money people who are living paycheck to paycheck what are they doing they can t buy out of convenience and now there s an extreme shortage and you can t just switch formulas en espan ol escasez de fo rmula para bebe s asi es co mo mantener a su bebe sano y alimentado dr sunaina suhag a pediatrician at austin regional clinic s east seventh street clinic said shortages have been felt throughout the pandemic but this has been a time of great need for her patients especially those who use specialty formulas at dell children s medical center of central texas the hospital has not seen any cases of babies being malnourished because of the shortage but doctors say it is a concern dr meena iyer dell children s chief medical officer recommends people call their pediatricians first if they cannot find their usual brand of infant formula your doctor or nurse will be able to recommend other brands that are similar this is especially important for babies who have specialized formulas or allergies switching formulas can cause babies to get a rash have distended bellies be nauseated vomit or have loose bowels stool changes are normal and anything in the fall colors brown green yellow is normal be concerned if there is mucus blood or red flecks if they are having tummy troubles you can try using the over the counter medication simethicone or gripe water for babies suhag said you also can do belly massages warm baths tummy time or bicycle the legs to get the gas out you also can pace out the feedings by doing a little at a time more often switching formula can take two weeks for babies to make the transition suhag said the american academy of pediatrics has tips on what parents should do dr steven abrams a professor of pediatrics at dell medical school at the university of texas wrote the tips try to find a formula with the same ingredients try to find a formula with the same ingredients as your preferred brand it does not matter as long as the content is the same iyer said most of the generic formulas are made by the same manufacturer so that should not matter you can also try using the same manufacturer but switching to a gentle or sensitive or other type in that same brand you can buy the premixed version instead of the powder of your brand don t wait until you run out don t wait until you run out of your formula always think ahead about what will happen if suddenly yours is the one that is unavailable if it does run out at the store and you have some on hand you can mix your preferred brand with the new brand to get your baby used to the new brand ideally the transition would be done over three to four days but right now that s not often possible suhag said don t water it down don t water down formula to make it last formulas are engineered to provide the proper nutrition reducing food allergies allergy treatment takes girl from fear of cashews to no worry birthday cake don t use toddler or imported formula don t use toddler formula for babies their nutritional ratios are not the same but if it s an emergency look at that toddler formula to make sure it has similar nutritional values as the infant type some are close enough i wouldn t do it long term but it s a bridge suhag said don t try to use an imported formula those aren t regulated by the u s food and drug administration which means you don t know what s in them or their safety records don t make your own don t try to make your own formula it s not safe and doesn t have the nutritional criteria baby safety your baby needs you to stop making your own baby formula look for alternative places to get formula look for alternative places to get your formula suhag has had good luck by checking pharmacy and grocery store websites and smaller stores to find supplies use social media to see if friends or neighbors might have your formula and can share or are no longer using it ask your pediatrician s office for samples if you are breastfeeding keep breastfeeding if you are already breastfeeding keep breastfeeding if you do both try pumping more if you can to offset the use of formula breastfeeding however is not something you can just start if your baby is being formula fed because the milk supply is now gone it takes medical supervision possibly medication and time to get a milk supply back if it s even possible suhag said milk banks such as mothers milk bank require a prescription from the baby s doctor to supply breast milk infant safety how to protect your kids from drowning in the pool the lake or even the bathtub don t try to introduce foods earlier don t try to introduce foods earlier or switch to just solid foods formula is the primary mode of nutrition for infants because of the nutritional value including vitamins and nutrients such as iron in general babies begin solid food around 6 months but they have to be ready to sit up on their own hold their neck be interested in food and not have a tongue reflex or it will be a choking hazard foods should be introduced one at a time starting with those that don t tend to be allergens such as rice and oats infant nutrition what to feed baby when don t switch to cow s or nut plant based milks don t switch to cow s milk cow s milk should not be started until age 1 and even then it s whole milk in a pinch the american academy of pediatrics says you could start at 6 months but you have to make sure your baby is getting enough iron by supplementing ideally though you would wait until 10 months or later don t switch to nut milks or other plant based milks they don t have enough of the proteins and nutrients that babies need babies don t have the ability to regulate their electrolytes and these milks as well as homemade milks can create an electrolyte imbalance and harm the brain suhag said don t switch to water babies need the nutrients in the formula have extra formula central texas food bank would love to have it as long as it is not expired
alan fram the associated press washington kentucky republican sen rand paul defied leaders of both parties and single handedly prevented rapid senate approval thursday of an additional 40 billion to help ukraine and its allies withstand russia s three month old invasion with the senate poised to debate and vote on a package of military and economic aid paul denied leaders the unanimous agreement they needed to proceed the bipartisan measure backed by president joe biden under scores u s determination to reinforce its support for ukraine s outnumbered forces it seemed likely that paul s objection would delay final senate action until next week the plan has been approved overwhelmingly by the house and has strong bipartisan support in the senate and passage soon still seems certain repeated threats paul a libertarian who often opposes u s intervention abroad said he wanted language inserted into the bill without a vote that would have an inspector general scrutinize the new spending he has a long history of demanding last minute changes by holding up or threatening to delay bills on the brink of passage including measures dealing with lynching the defense budget and providing health care to the sept 11 attack first responders democrats opposed his effort and along with senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky offered to have a vote on paul s language which would have likely lost but paul turned that down he argued that the added spending was a significant sum would deepen federal deficits and worsen inflation last year s budget deficit was almost 2 8 trillion we cannot save ukraine by dooming the u s economy paul said it s clear from the junior senator from kentucky s remarks he doesn t want to aid ukraine said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y all he will accomplish with his actions here today is to delay that aid not to stop it bipartisan underscoring their joint desire to approve the bill immediately schumer and mcconnell stood nearly side by side as they tried pushing the legislation forward they re only asking for the resources they need to defend themselves against this deranged invasion said mcconnell and they need this help right now earlier thursday mcconnell called on both sides meaning republicans and democrats to help us pass this urgent funding bill today his pointed inclusion of his own gop colleagues came as the only apparent stumbling blocks to quick approval seemed to be demands for new language or votes by a handful of republicans the house voted 368 57 on tuesday to approve the measure all democrats and most republicans backed it though every no vote came from the gop the bipartisan backing for ukraine has been partly driven by accounts of russian atrocities against ukrainian civilians that have been impossible to ignore it also reflects strategic concerns about letting russian president vladimir putin seize european territory unanswered as his assault on his neighbor to the west grinds into its 12th week helping ukraine is not an instance of mere philanthropy mcconnell said it bears directly on america s national security and vital interests that russia s naked aggression not succeed and carries significant costs overall biden administration officials have said they expect the latest aid measure to suffice through september but with ukraine taking heavy military and civilian losses and no sign of when the fighting might end congress will ultimately face decisions about how much more aid to provide at a time of huge u s budget deficits and a risk of recession that could demand added spending at home the latest bill when added to the 13 6 billion congress approved in march would push american aid to the region well above 50 billion for perspective that would total 6 billion more than the u s spent on military and economic aid around the world in 2019 according to the nonpartisan congressional research service the push toward passage came as russia continued blasting ukrainian forces and cities in southern and eastern portions of the country reflecting international concerns prompted by the assault finland s leaders announced their support for joining nato and sweden seemed not far behind biden asked congress for 33 billion two weeks ago it didn t take lawmakers long to add 3 4 billion to his requests for both military and humanitarian programs the measure includes 6 billion for ukraine for intelligence equipment and training for its forces plus 4 billion in financing to help kyiv and nato allies build up their militaries there s 8 7 billion for the pentagon to rebuild stocks of weapons it has shipped to ukraine and 3 9 billion for u s troops in the region the measure also includes 8 8 billion to keep the kyiv government functioning more than 5 billion to provide food to countries around the world that rely on ukrainian crops devastated by the fighting and 900 million to teach english and provide other services to ukrainian refugees who have moved to the united states the biggest hurdle to rapid approval of the assistance was cleared this week when biden and democrats dropped their demand to include billions more in the measure to bolster u s efforts to counter the coronavirus pandemic republicans want separate covid 19 legislation to be a battleground for an election season fight over immigration that divides democrats the aid bill lacks biden proposals to help qualifying afghan refugees to remain permanently in the u s and 500 million to pay u s farmers to grow more crops to compensate for ukraine s curtailed food production also gone are biden requests to help russian scientists emigrate to the u s and to let the justice department transfer money to ukraine that the u s has acquired by seizing russian oligarch s assets

by howard schneider and ann saphir washington reuters calling stable prices the bedrock of the economy federal reserve chair jerome powell said on thursday the u s central bank s battle to control inflation would include some pain as the impact of higher interest rates is felt but that the worse outcome would be for prices to continue speeding ahead we fully understand and appreciate how painful inflation is powell said in an interview with the marketplace national radio program repeating his expectation that the fed will raise interest rates by half a percentage point at each of its next two policy meetings while pledging that we re prepared to do more if data turn the wrong way nothing in the economy works the economy doesn t work for anybody without price stability powell said we went through periods in our history where inflation was quite high the process of getting inflation down to 2 will also include some pain but ultimately the most painful thing would be if we were to fail to deal with it and inflation were to get entrenched in the economy at high levels and we know what that s like and that s just people losing the value of their paycheck with perfect hindsight powell said it would have been better to have begun raising rates earlier than march of this year given inflation began a sharp turn higher in 2021 after using aggressive monetary policy to support the economy through the covid 19 pandemic the fed approved a quarter percentage point rate increase in march but some analysts believe policymakers have fallen too far behind to curb price increases without the sort of sharp rate hikes that might cause a recession powell said he believes the country can avoid a serious downturn but on the same day that the senate confirmed him to a second four year term as fed chief in a bipartisan 80 19 vote powell also made the central bank s priorities clear above all else we can t fail to restore price stability he said the u s economy is facing its toughest inflation problem since the 1970s and early 1980s when prices at one point rose at an annual rate of 14 5 and then fed chief paul volcker used punishing interest rates to twice throw the economy into recession the unemployment rate climbed above 10 powell has paid frequent homage to volcker s commitment to beating inflation while also saying he still hopes to avoid the sharp tradeoffs that volcker used to bring prices under control while inflation is not approaching volcker era levels the quick run up in the cost of food gas housing and other daily staples has become a politically explosive issue for president joe biden s administration consumer prices in april were 8 3 higher than a year ago feel that pain interest rates are rising sharply as a result of the policy steps already taken by the fed with the rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage jumping from less than 3 last year to more than 5 and volatile stock markets wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth that will likely prompt some consumers to spend less and curb inflation in the process if you re going to use monetary policy to get inflation under control what you got to do is to tighten up on the consumer to reduce spending certain industries most notably housing are going to feel that pain you re going to have mortgage rates over 6 it s going to make it harder for potential homebuyers to buy said stan shipley a strategist at evercore isi biden now has filled the top two fed jobs and seen two of his other appointees confirmed to the central bank s seven seat board of governors the president made clear this week he was giving them full sway to try to lower inflation tackling inflation is my top domestic priority the democratic president said after powell s senate confirmation the fed will bring the skill and knowledge needed at this critical time for our economy and families across the country powell who opened a news conference after last week s policy meeting by saying he wanted to restore price stability on behalf of american families used the radio interview on thursday to amplify that broad message to the public

helena with gas prices continuing to rise many people are already dialing back plans for summer travel but we re definitely thinking about cutting back or at least staying in state rather than looking at going to the coast or something like that says stefan wall in downtown helena wall says that filling up his gas tank has an effect on his budget and may very well prevent adventures this summer with average national gas prices hitting 3 for regular gas at this time last year filling a ford f 150 with a 26 gallon tank would cost about 78 filling that same tank a year later would cost you over 114 but living in montana finding alternatives to transportation by car can be difficult you know you live in montana there aren t a lot of options with public transportation or even carpooling necessarily so we kind of grin and bear it says wall because of high gas prices some hobbies may not get as much attention as they did in previous years for example anthony cacace participates in stock car racing with no track in helena he has to drive out of town if he wants to enjoy his sport it will definitely increase the costs you know just to get to and from the dirt tracks but you know that s it s a hobby so if i have to cut it out i can no problem with that says cacace and nick gevock says that new ways of getting around might be necessary during this time carpool drive less ride your bike to work i mean do what it takes says gevock

washington kentucky republican sen rand paul defied leaders of both parties thursday and single handedly delayed until next week senate approval of an additional 40 billion to help ukraine and its allies withstand russia s three month old invasion with the senate poised to debate and vote on the package of military and economic aid paul denied leaders the unanimous agreement they needed to proceed the bipartisan measure backed by president joe biden underscores u s determination to reinforce its support for ukraine s outnumbered forces the legislation has been approved overwhelmingly by the house and has strong bipartisan support in the senate final passage is not in doubt even so paul s objection was an audacious departure from an overwhelming sentiment in congress that quickly helping ukraine was urgent both for that nation s prospects of withstanding vladimir putin s brutal attack and for discouraging the russian president from escalating or widening the war it was also a brazen rebellion against his fellow kentucky republican senate minority leader mitch mcconnell mcconnell began thursday s session by saying senators from both sides meaning republicans and democrats needed to help us pass this urgent funding bill today gesturing emphatically as he said today sen rand paul r ky at a senate health education labor and pensions committee hearing on capitol hill on sept 30 2021 shawn thew pool via ap file paul a libertarian who often opposes u s intervention abroad said he wanted language inserted into the bill without a vote that would have an inspector general scrutinize the new spending he has a long history of demanding last minute changes by holding up or threatening to delay bills on the brink of passage including measures dealing with lynching the defense budget and providing health care to the sept 11 attack first responders democrats and mcconnell opposed paul s push and offered to have a vote on his language paul was likely to lose that vote and rejected the offer he argued that the added spending was a significant sum that would deepen federal deficits and worsen inflation last year s budget deficit was almost 2 8 trillion but likely headed downward and the bill s spending is less than two tenths of 1 the size of the u s economy suggesting its impact on inflation would be negligible no matter how sympathetic the cause my oath of office is to the national security of the united states of america paul said we cannot save ukraine by dooming the u s economy democrats said they were objecting to paul s plan because it would expand the powers of an existing inspector general whose current purview is limited to afghanistan that would deny biden the chance past presidents have had to appoint the person to the post they said it s clear from the junior senator from kentucky s remarks he doesn t want to aid ukraine said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y all he will accomplish with his actions here today is to delay that aid not to stop it underscoring their joint desire to approve the bill immediately schumer and mcconnell stood nearly side by side as they tried pushing the legislation forward they re only asking for the resources they need to defend themselves against this deranged invasion mcconnell said of the ukrainians and they need this help right now the house voted 368 57 on tuesday to approve the measure all democrats and most republicans backed it though every no vote came from the gop the bipartisan backing for ukraine has been partly driven by accounts of russian atrocities against ukrainian civilians that have been impossible to ignore it also reflects strategic concerns about letting putin seize european territory unanswered as his assault on his neighbor to the west grinds into its 12th week helping ukraine is not an instance of mere philanthropy mcconnell said it bears directly on america s national security and vital interests that russia s naked aggression not succeed and carries significant costs biden administration officials have said they expect the latest aid measure to suffice through september but with ukraine taking heavy military and civilian losses and no sign of when the fighting might end congress will ultimately face decisions about how much more aid to provide at a time of huge u s budget deficits and a risk of recession that could demand added spending at home the latest bill when added to the 13 6 billion congress approved in march would push american aid to the region well above 50 billion for perspective that would total 6 billion more than the u s spent on military and economic aid around the world in 2019 according to the nonpartisan congressional research service the push toward passage came as russia continued blasting ukrainian forces and cities in southern and eastern portions of the country reflecting international concerns prompted by the assault finland s leaders announced their support for joining nato and sweden seemed not far behind biden asked congress for 33 billion two weeks ago it didn t take lawmakers long to add 3 4 billion to his requests for both military and humanitarian programs the measure includes 6 billion for ukraine for intelligence equipment and training for its forces plus 4 billion in financing to help kyiv and nato allies build up their militaries there s 8 7 billion for the pentagon to rebuild stocks of weapons it has shipped to ukraine and 3 9 billion for u s troops in the region the measure also includes 8 8 billion to keep the kyiv government functioning more than 5 billion to provide food to countries around the world that rely on ukrainian crops devastated by the fighting and 900 million to teach english and provide other services to ukrainian refugees who have moved to the united states the biggest hurdle to rapid approval of the assistance was cleared this week when biden and democrats dropped their demand to include billions more in the measure to bolster u s efforts to counter the coronavirus pandemic republicans want separate covid 19 legislation to be a battleground for an election season fight over immigration that divides democrats the ukraine bill

the biden administration is canceling three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of alaska removing millions of acres from possible drilling as u s gas prices reach record highs the interior department announced the decision wednesday night citing a lack of industry interest in drilling off the alaska coast and conflicting court rulings that have complicated drilling efforts in the gulf of mexico where the bulk of u s offshore drilling takes place the decision likely means the biden administration will not hold a lease sale for offshore drilling this year and comes as interior appears set to let a mandatory five year plan for offshore drilling expire next month unfortunately this is becoming a pattern the administration talks about the need for more supply and acts to restrict it said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here as geopolitical volatility and global energy prices continue to rise we again urge the administration to end the uncertainty and immediately act on a new five year program for federal offshore leasing he said the lease cancellations come as gas prices have surged to a record 4 40 a gallon amid the war in ukraine and other disruptions that have pushed prices 1 40 a gallon higher than a year ago consumer prices jumped 8 3 last month from a year ago the government said wednesday about 6 to 10 of food prices come from transportation costs and with fuel prices rising the increased cost to transport food could be passed onto the consumer many plastics used in packaging and clothing are made from petroleum products as well john quelch dean of the university of miami herbert business school joined lx news to explain how rising fuel prices will affect american households a federal appeals court in new orleans meanwhile is considering a challenge to a moratorium on new federal leasing that biden imposed soon after taking office in january 2021 biden said the administration needed to consider the effect of new drilling on climate change and conduct proper environmental reviews louisiana and 12 other states challenged biden s order saying laws passed in response to the 1970s oil crisis require lease sales on federal lands and waters the biden administration failed to grapple with prior analyses of the planned sales to give a valid reason for postponing or canceling them louisiana deputy solicitor general joseph scott st john told a 5th u s circuit court of appeals panel this week the three judge panel did not indicate when they will rule environmental groups hailed the latest lease cancellation saying the administration needs to do more to curb greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels that are driving climate change to save imperiled marine life and protect coastal communities and our climate from pollution we need to end new leasing and phase out existing drilling said kristen monsell oceans legal director at the center for biological diversity an environmental group republicans denounced the decision as harmful to consumers and u s national security the interior department s decision approaches levels of irresponsibility and reckless stupidity never seen before said rep garret graves r la we are paying record prices for gasoline and to heat and cool our homes rather than using american energy sources to help solve the problem and lower prices the biden administration continues to carry out policies that benefit iran saudi arabia venezuela and other countries graves said new leasing will not lower current gas prices countered dustin renaud a spokesman for the environmental coalition healthy gulf it takes several years for new leases to begin producing oil he noted adding that the industry is already sitting on over 8 million acres of unused offshore leases the state challenge to biden s leasing order has not yet gone to trial but a federal judge blocked the order in a preliminary injunction last year writing that since federal law does not state the president can suspend oil lease sales only congress can do so after u s district judge terry doughty ruled for the states the interior department held an offshore lease sale last fall which a federal judge in washington d c later blocked the administration has appealed doughty s ruling but has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly western states however the administration scaled back the amount of land offered for drilling and raised royalty rates by 50 biden has come under pressure to increase u s crude production as fuel prices spike because of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in ukraine the united states and other nations have banned imports of russian oil driving up prices worldwide biden also faces pressure from democrats and environmental groups urging him to do more to combat climate change even as his legislative proposals on climate and clean energy remain stalled in a sharply divided congress interior cannot conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a required five year plan the current plan expires june 30 and administration officials have not said when or if a replacement will be released interior secretary deb haaland said last month that the oil and gas industry is set with the amount of drilling permits at its disposal she defended biden administration actions to scale down federal leasing saying that industry has about 9 000 permits that have been approved but are not being used the industry is free to use these permits in a way they see fit they just haven t acted on those haaland told a house committee last week oil companies say they have increased production as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic but they have been reluctant to ramp up production further citing a shortage of workers and restraints from investors wary that today s high prices won t last decisions by the opec oil cartel led by saudi arabia and russia to only modestly increase supplies to the world market have also kept prices high major oil companies reported surging profits in the first quarter and are sending tens of billions of dollars in dividends to shareholders along with stock buybacks that have sharply increased the value of investor holdings democrats accuse the industry of price gouging and have vowed to bring legislation cracking down on price manipulation to votes in the house and senate a bid to impose a windfall profits tax on oil producers has generated little support in congress ___

who suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility abbott is one of only a handful of companies that produce the vast majority of the u s formula supply so their recall wiped out a large segment of the market what is in baby formula most formulas contain protein from cow s milk that s been altered to be easier to digest and enhanced with extra nutrients needed for growth and development the food and drug administration sets specific nutritional requirements including minimum amounts of protein fat calcium and a number of vitamins formula makers achieve those levels by adding various sugars oils and minerals the formulas are designed to mimic breast milk though studies have repeatedly shown better health outcomes for babies who are breastfed why can t all mothers rely on breast milk health professionals recommend exclusively breastfeeding babies until they are 6 months old but federal figures show that only 1 in 4 are relying solely on breast milk at that age mothers face a number of challenges to long term breastfeeding including returning to work and finding the time and equipment needed to pump breast milk about 60 of mothers stop breastfeeding sooner than they had planned according to the centers for disease control and prevention state and federal laws have been enacted to encourage breastfeeding by requiring break time and accommodations for mothers of infants rates of breastfeeding have consistently been lower among black babies than other groups about three quarters of black babies are breast fed in infancy below the national average of 84 according to the cdc what should parents do if they are having trouble finding formula talk with your pediatrician or call a local food bank to see if they can help locate some options experts also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies which may still have supplies when larger stores run out most regular baby formulas contain the same basic ingredients and nutrients so parents shouldn t hesitate to buy a different brand if they re having trouble finding their regular one some infants require specialty formulas due to allergies digestive problems and other medical conditions parents should talk to their doctor if they can t find those products which manufacturers usually distribute through pharmacies and clinics families that qualify for wic a federal program similar to food stamps that pays for about half the formula used in the u s can also contact their local agency health officials also warn against buying formula via social media websites or outside of conventional retailers because they could be counterfeit why are parents told not to use make your own formula recipes online many do it yourself formula recipes are made from cow s milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest they also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and fda approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition particularly for small babies many of these formulas and mixtures that are found online don t contain even the most basic nutrient mixes that babies need to survive said dr steven abrams a pediatrician at the university of texas austin abrams also stressed that parents should never dilute infant formula what are retailers doing to keep formula in stock several national chains have limited the number of containers customers can purchase in stores and online for cvs and walgreens the limit is three per customer target limits purchases to four per person when buying online amazon said thursday it is working to keep the products available on its website and monitoring third party sellers for price gouging if we identify a price that violates our policy we remove the offer and take appropriate action with the seller a company spokesperson said in a statement when are supplies likely to improve health regulators recently announced several steps designed to boost supply including allowing faster importation of formula made overseas typically 98 of baby formula consumed in the u s is made domestically according to federal officials the fda is working with abbott to fix the violations that triggered the shutdown of its michigan plant which produces similac elecare and several other leading powdered formulas the company says its products have not been directly linked to the bacterial infections in children pointing out that genetic samples collected from its factory did not match those found in several infants who got sick the chicago based company said this week that pending fda approval it could restart manufacturing at its plant within two weeks after that it would take another six to eight weeks before new products hit store shelves but even then experts caution that many of the industrywide issues will continue to restrain supplies this is going to be a problem and it s not going away for at least a period of several months abrams said ___ ap

thousands use of non gaap financial measures to evaluate our business we consider and use non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap net income and adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of operating performance these measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period to period basis we consider non gaap net income to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to evaluate results without the effects of share based compensation acquisition related expenses changes in fair value of contingent consideration and amortization of intangibles we define ebitda as u s gaap net income loss before interest income interest expense other income and expense provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization we believe ebitda provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for acquisition related expenses changes in fair value of contingent consideration and share based compensation we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance we also believe use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period as well as across companies in our may 12 2022 earnings press release as furnished on form 8 k we included non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda the terms non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not defined under u s gaap and are not measures of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with u s gaap some of these limitations include but are not limited to ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt that we may incur they do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements while share based compensation is a component of operating expense the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock and other companies may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our u s gaap results and using non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental support for management s analysis of business performance non gaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows for the periods presented reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in accordance with the requirements of regulation g issued by the sec we are presenting the most directly

relates to addition of nine day production at the mantos blancos and mantoverde mines the main driver for the 0 61 lb increase in c1 cash costs1 in q1 2022 compared to q1 2021 is higher unit costs at

the use of jetti catalytic leach technology which has the potential to increase mill cut off grades and increase tonnage available for leaching column leach and test heap work are ongoing and the results will be included in the pv4 study an expanded dump leach strategy would translate to higher grades sent to the mill for processing and increased copper cathode production by expanding dump leach tonnage pyrite agglomeration with strong positive environmental social and governance esg implications as it would divert acid generating minerals including pyrite and chalcopyrite from tailings to the dump leach operation additional copper recovery and lower costs via production of sulphuric acid would be key economic drivers for this project cozamin mine q1 2022 production increased by 15 compared to the same period last year mainly due to higher mill throughput 3 704 tpd versus 3 345 tpd in q1 2021 and head grades 1 84 versus 1 79 in q1 2021 recoveries were comparable quarter over quarter c1 cash costs1 in q1 2022 were higher than the same period last year due to planned higher mechanical part spend in order to increase underground equipment availability and reliability and some inflationary pressures on steel and explosives 0 13 lb lower zinc by product credits due to planned lower zinc production 0 06 lb and higher treatment and refining costs 0 03 lb partially offset by higher copper production 0 06 lb mantoverde development project construction of the mvdp located at the existing mantoverde oxide operation continues to progress well the mvdp is expected to enable us to process 235 million tonnes of copper sulphide reserves over a 20 year expected mine life in addition to our existing oxide reserves the mvdp involves the addition of a sulphide concentrator 12 3 million tonnes per year and tailings storage facility and the expansion of our existing desalination plant we expect completion of the mvdp to increase production from approximately 49 000 tonnes of copper cathodes only in 2021 to approximately 120 000 tonnes of copper copper concentrate and cathodes post project completion in 2024 in parallel c1 cash costs1 are expected to decrease from 2 79 lb in 2021 to under 1 70 lb to 1 80 lb in 2024 the decline in expected costs will be driven by the mine s transition to becoming a primary producer of copper concentrate the mine will also benefit from the production of approximately 31 000 ounces of gold per year that will generate by product credits upon completion of mvdp approximately 75 of mantoverde s production will come from the lower cost sulphide copper mvdp is being progressed under a lump sum turn key engineering procurement and construction epc arrangement with ausenco limited a multi national engineering procurement and construction management company with broad experience in the design and construction of copper concentrator projects of this scale in the international market the execution plan includes a capstone copper owner s team working with the contractors during the execution phase as of april 30 2022 the mvdp had achieved overall progress of 49 and construction progress of 14 and the schedule remains intact the target for completion of construction remains late 2023 all contractors have been mobilized to site and all required permits are in place work completed in q1 includes bulk earthworks for the primary crusher and grinding area platforms bypass water pipeline with the internal lining trench excavation and pipeline installation in the trench drilling for all pumping and monitoring wells at the tailings storage facility tsf allowing for the commencement of the major tsf construction activities 13 komatsu 830e haulage trucks have been received according to plan and are operating at mine site construction camp complete and operational the costs to date of the major equipment purchases pre stripping owner s costs and the epc lump sum turnkey are aligned with the budget close ongoing monitoring is being done to identify potential impacts due to an environment marked by covid 19 stressed logistics chains and inflation in costs the total project capital budget is now estimated to be 825 million and spend to date totals 338 million the epc contract total budget is approximately 525 million of which 220 million has been spent to date the total project costs have increased slightly from 787 million to 825 million due to diesel price impact on pre stripping costs of 23 million plus additional contingency of 15 million the majority of the capital costs are fixed due to the nature of the lump sum turn key contract with ausenco of 525 million or 67 of the original capital major mining equipment was price fixed prior to the current inflationary environment for approximately 140 million or 18 of the total original capital mantos blancos concentrator debottlenecking project the purpose of the mb cdp is to increase throughput capacity at the sulphide concentrator plant from 11 000 tpd to 20 000 tpd or from 4 2 million tonnes per year to 7 3 million tonnes per year construction of the mb cdp was completed and includes the modification of certain processes and the installation of new crushers one new ball mill four new rougher flotation cells and a new thickener at quarter end the project commissioning is complete and the ramp up of the project continued to progress throughput of the plant averaged over 18 000 tpd during the last week of april representing over 90 of nameplate capacity looking forward the focus becomes sustaining throughput at targeted levels and optimization of the circuit to achieve targeted recoveries in q3 2022 upon completion of the mb cdp we expect mantos blancos production to increase from approximately 45 000 tonnes of copper in 2021 to approximately 53 000 tonnes of copper in 2023 in parallel c1 cash costs1 are anticipated to decrease from current guidance of 2 81 lb in 2021 to 2 00 lb in 2023 as an even greater share of mantos blancos production is sourced from the lower cost copper concentrate production mantos blancos phase ii mantos blancos is currently analyzing the potential to increase the throughput of the mantos blancos sulphide concentrator plant from 7 3 million tonnes per year to 10 0 million tonnes per year using the existing currently unused underutilized ball mills and process equipment as part of the mantos blancos phase ii project we are also evaluating the potential to extend the life of copper cathode production a pre feasibility study on the mantos blancos phase ii project will be completed in q2 2022 which will be incorporated into a feasibility study fs in q4 2022 santo domingo upon closing of the transaction the santo domingo team has been integrated into the larger capstone copper team in chile the integrated project team is focused on identifying and evaluating the optimal integrated development plan for the mantoverde santo domingo district the mantoverde operation is located approximately 30km southwest of the santo domingo project the company expects the integrated district plan to study alternatives and identify the best path forward to develop the copper sulphides and oxides gold iron and cobalt across both properties an integrated development approach is likely to maximize potential synergies associated with the proximity of santo domingo to the existing mantoverde operation existing infrastructure including a desalination plant roads power and pipelines and integration of other assets such as the santo domingo port contract with puerto abierto s a the potential synergies the company expects to be maximized through an optimal integrated district development plan include the following infrastructure synergies including desalination plant power pipelines port integrated mine and process approach construction and supply chain synergies cobalt and sulphuric acid enhancements enabling revenue lines for mantoverde cobalt and magnetite using excess solvent extraction and electrowinning sx ew capacity the revenue enhancing opportunities include using excess electrowinning capacity at mantoverde to potentially process both santo domingo oxide material and additional low grade sulphides enabled by jetti catalytic leach technologies which capstone copper has been first to implement at pinto valley in addition the potential cobalt plant may unlock cobalt production from mantoverde while producing a by product of sulphuric acid which can then be used internally to further significantly lower operating costs on the leaching process at mantoverde cobalt feasibility study update the cobalt recovery process consists of a concentration step an oxidation step and a cobalt recovery step the concentration step considers a conventional froth flotation circuit treating copper flotation tails to produce a cobaltiferous pyrite concentrate for the base case the pyrite concentrate which contains between 0 5 and 0 7 co is oxidized in a fluidized bed roaster to produce a cobalt calcine and a concentrated sulphuric acid by product the calcine is then subjected to various precipitation leaching solvent extraction and crystallization steps to produce battery grade cobalt sulphate heptahydrate at an expected 10 4 million pounds of cobalt production per year this would be one of the largest and lowest cost cobalt producers in the world additional benefits of this project include the generation of carbon free energy from waste heat emitted by the roaster and the production of by product sulphuric acid which can be used for heap or dump leaching to produce low cost copper cathodes at mantoverde and elsewhere in the district the prefeasibility study is also evaluating different flow sheet alternatives for cobalt production in consideration of potential synergies between mantoverde and santo domingo initial trade off studies have confirmed the potential of acid pressure oxidation pox as a potentially lower cost alternative to roasting the company is developing both options in parallel to gain maturity and provide a robust recommendation on the path forward in q4 2022 along the same timeline q4 2022 we intend to release an updated cobalt resource for santo domingo as well as an initial cobalt resource for mantoverde oxide drilling program santo domingo contains oxide ore that could be processed with available capacity of the electrowinning plant at mantoverde for cathode production during q1 2022 the company developed a preliminary business case and started an exploratory metallurgical program scheduled to be completed in q3 2022 which will improve the understanding of copper solubility and acid consumption subject to positive metallurgical results the company is planning to complete a subsequent oxide drilling program starting in late 2022 to delineate an oxide mineral resource ultimately this work will feed into a further updated santo domingo fs in late 2023 corporate exploration update cozamin exploration the focus during q1 2022 was on testing the mala noche footwall zone and mala noche main vein west target with one surface rig and one underground rig from the recently completed west exploration crosscut station copper cities arizona on january 20 2022 capstone mining announced that it had entered into an 18 month access agreement with bhp

of 280 tonne which compares to 180 tonne in the mantoverde and mantos blancos technical reports which increases c1 cash costs1 by approximately 0 22 lb on a consolidated basis the purchase price for approximately 65 of required sulphuric acid for the balance of 2022 has been fixed with suppliers for the nine month period april 1 2022 to december 31 2022 expected sulphuric acid consumption at mantoverde and mantos blancos is 540 000 tonnes and 140 000 tonnes respectively 680 000 tonnes total the impact of a 100 tonne price increase is 68 million dollars or 0 22 lb consolidated the impact to c1 cash costs1 at mantoverde are 0 70 lb and at mantos blancos either 0 15 lb overall or 0 66 lb on cathode c1 cash costs1 respectively in addition mantoverde and mantos blancos are experiencing general cost inflation most notably increased diesel prices although sulphuric acid is a significant input cost to our oxide cathode business unit over time sulphide production is expected to increase

daniel rabasco and jeffrey burger the federal reserve s hawkish pivot inflationary pressure and uncertainty driven by the russian invasion of ukraine contributed to uncertainty across all fixed income assets they said the result they said has been the heaviest net outflows since the onset of the pandemic in 2020 and is in stark contrast to a stream of almost continuous inflows over the year prior they noted that these types of sell offs have been rare in muni history when they have happened insight investment strategists said the market has consistently rebounded strongly with inflows sharply rebounding they expect a potentially similar trajectory particularly as technicals are set to reverse by the summer from a supply perspective 39 billion of munis are scheduled to mature in june

currently offer a 35 basis point yield pickup over double a rated corporate bonds historically during rising rate periods retail investors have sought shelter in municipals to benefit from higher tax exempt interest rates they said further supply tends to fall as municipalities prefer to avoid raising debt at higher rates we believe that the perfect storm of municipal bond underperformance has

suggests inflation remains the april producer price index much as the consumer price index a day earlier suggested inflation will continue to haunt americans despite the sharp moderation in april the solid 11 0 increase from a year ago suggests producer inflation will persist and will likely be passed along to consumers in the months ahead thereby keeping consumer inflation elevated said scott anderson chief economist at bank of the west with food and energy costs still pushing prices higher albeit less than in march the core rate which excludes those volatile factors he said slowed to 8 8 year on year from 9 6 in march a modest step in the right direction still higher fuel and energy prices are likely to exert further upward pressure on distribution and shipping costs while the effects of disruptions to production and supply chains related to russia s invasion of ukraine and china s lockdowns could further exacerbate price pressures said mickey levy berenberg capital markets chief economist for the u s americas and asia the jump from year ago levels he said points to continued increases in consumer prices as businesses adjust prices with a lag although a critical consideration going forward is the degree to which businesses will maintain pricing power amid the current backdrop of four decade high inflation depressed consumer confidence and squeezed real purchasing power the markets still focus on the federal reserve rate hikes edward moya senior market analyst at oanda said persistent inflation uncertainty with commodity prices impacted by the war in ukraine and china s covid situation are all short term risks that could lead to aggressive tightening by the fed later in the year indeed neither cpi or ppi confirm we passed the peak of the inflation mountain said liz young head of investment strategy at sofi and until there is a clear decline in inflation that allows the fed to retract its claws she said volatility is likely to persist even with a drop in inflation young said it s going to be sticky and uncomfortably high without a deeper pullback in demand but morgan stanley s key takeaway was the big divergence in outcomes for key details that matter for the april pce inflation data pointed to an increasingly stark divergence between cpi and pce inflation while airfares played a major role in cpi s increase they said ppi details pointed to a lower outcome for pce inflation where we expect airfares will only be up about 3 compared with a more than 18 increase in cpi airfares and while inflation may have peaked scott ruesterholz a portfolio manager at insight investment said it will stay well above target through the year finishing 2022 near 4 this means that the fed s hiking cycle may already be priced in to a large extent allowing diligent investors to find value opportunities he said absent falling commodity prices it will be incredibly challenging for the fed to bring inflation close to its 2 target over the next year ultimately we believe rate hikes alone will not be enough besides rate hikes ruesterholz said the fed will need assists from fading fiscal stimulus supply chain improvements housing supply increases and slowing consumer demand the good news is that many of these scenarios are starting to transpire

the biden administration is canceling three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of alaska removing millions of acres from possible drilling as u s gas prices reach record highs the interior department announced the decision wednesday night citing a lack of industry interest in drilling off the alaska coast and conflicting court rulings that have complicated drilling efforts in the gulf of mexico where the bulk of u s offshore drilling takes place the decision likely means the biden administration will not hold a lease sale for offshore drilling this year and comes as interior appears set to let a mandatory five year plan for offshore drilling expire next month unfortunately this is becoming a pattern the administration talks about the need for more supply and acts to restrict it said frank macchiarola senior vice president of the american petroleum institute the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters as geopolitical volatility and global energy prices continue to rise we again urge the administration to end the uncertainty and immediately act on a new five year program for federal offshore leasing he said the lease cancellations come as gas prices have surged to a record 4 40 a gallon amid the war in ukraine and other disruptions that have pushed prices 1 40 a gallon higher than a year ago consumer prices jumped 8 3 last month from a year ago the government said wednesday about 6 to 10 of food prices come from transportation costs and with fuel prices rising the increased cost to transport food could be passed onto the consumer many plastics used in packaging and clothing are made from petroleum products as well john quelch dean of the university of miami herbert business school joined lx news to explain how rising fuel prices will affect american households a federal appeals court in new orleans meanwhile is considering a challenge to a moratorium on new federal leasing that biden imposed soon after taking office in january 2021 biden said the administration needed to consider the effect of new drilling on climate change and conduct proper environmental reviews louisiana and 12 other states challenged biden s order saying laws passed in response to the 1970s oil crisis require lease sales on federal lands and waters the biden administration failed to grapple with prior analyses of the planned sales to give a valid reason for postponing or canceling them louisiana deputy solicitor general joseph scott st john told a 5th u s circuit court of appeals panel this week the three judge panel did not indicate when they will rule environmental groups hailed the latest lease cancellation saying the administration needs to do more to curb greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels that are driving climate change to save imperiled marine life and protect coastal communities and our climate from pollution we need to end new leasing and phase out existing drilling said kristen monsell oceans legal director at the center for biological diversity an environmental group republicans denounced the decision as harmful to consumers and u s national security the interior department s decision approaches levels of irresponsibility and reckless stupidity never seen before said rep garret graves r la we are paying record prices for gasoline and to heat and cool our homes rather than using american energy sources to help solve the problem and lower prices the biden administration continues to carry out policies that benefit iran saudi arabia venezuela and other countries graves said new leasing will not lower current gas prices countered dustin renaud a spokesman for the environmental coalition healthy gulf it takes several years for new leases to begin producing oil he noted adding that the industry is already sitting on over 8 million acres of unused offshore leases the state challenge to biden s leasing order has not yet gone to trial but a federal judge blocked the order in a preliminary injunction last year writing that since federal law does not state the president can suspend oil lease sales only congress can do so after u s district judge terry doughty ruled for the states the interior department held an offshore lease sale last fall which a federal judge in washington d c later blocked the administration has appealed doughty s ruling but has scheduled onshore lease sales next month in eight mostly western states however the administration scaled back the amount of land offered for drilling and raised royalty rates by 50 biden has come under pressure to increase u s crude production as fuel prices spike because of the coronavirus pandemic and the war in ukraine the united states and other nations have banned imports of russian oil driving up prices worldwide biden also faces pressure from democrats and environmental groups urging him to do more to combat climate change even as his legislative proposals on climate and clean energy remain stalled in a sharply divided congress interior cannot conduct new offshore oil and gas lease sales until it has completed a required five year plan the current plan expires june 30 and administration officials have not said when or if a replacement will be released interior secretary deb haaland said last month that the oil and gas industry is set with the amount of drilling permits at its disposal she defended biden administration actions to scale down federal leasing saying that industry has about 9 000 permits that have been approved but are not being used the industry is free to use these permits in a way they see fit they just haven t acted on those haaland told a house committee last week oil companies say they have increased production as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic but they have been reluctant to ramp up production further citing a shortage of workers and restraints from investors wary that today s high prices won t last decisions by the opec oil cartel led by saudi arabia and russia to only modestly increase supplies to the world market have also kept prices high major oil companies reported surging profits in the first quarter and are sending tens of billions of dollars in dividends to shareholders along with stock buybacks that have sharply increased the value of investor holdings democrats accuse the industry of price gouging and have vowed to bring legislation cracking down on price manipulation to votes in the house and senate a bid to impose a windfall profits tax on oil producers has generated little support in congress ___

dw burnett at this point what is there to say about the dodge challenger the model we know today debuted in the 2008 model year it predated the bank bailout its biggest aesthetic update in 2015 brought a hugely improved interior and redesigned front and rear fascias but not one inch of change to the sheetmetal if you ve spent 5 minutes on a corner where people cruise or in a parking lot ripe for donuts or in the social media alleys where vehicular hooliganism is documented you ve seen and heard a million challengers and yet dodge keeps managing to create new challengers to sell first we had the hellcat in 2015 with 707 supercharged horsepower then in 2017 came the demon an ultra limited edition machine built for the drag strip it made 808 hp on pump gas rising to 840 with a custom ecu and 104 octane race fuel the demon had barely street legal drag radials 315 mm wide tucked under tack on fender flares that made the already huge challenger somehow huger that widebody look trickled down to the hellcat and naturally aspirated challenger 392 in 2019 a year that also brought the hellcat redeye a 797 hp middle ground between the base hellcat and the discontinued demon dw burnett now we have this the 2022 dodge challenger srt super stock it s a hellcat a redeye and most of a demon all in one out of the thousands of variants dodge will sell you this one embodies the spirit of the challenger better than any other the super stock starts as a hellcat redeye and adds 10 horsepower bringing the total to 807 torque stays the same at 707 lb ft it comes from the factory on four nitto nt05r drag radials 315 40r 18s identical to the tires that 3000 lucky demon owners got on their dragsters with the blistered fenders to match the super stock revs 100 rpm higher than the redeye to 6400 and gets the demon s adaptive suspension track mode softens the rebound on the front dampers to improve rear weight transfer on a launch you thought track meant turn this thing is all about the quarter mile dw burnett the super stock also gets the demon s power chiller also available on redeye which reroutes the car s air conditioning to cool down the engine intake charge for more launch horsepower it also benefits from the demon s drag optimized traction control which combats wheelspin while still keeping the engine at full boost it does not however get the demon s tricky transmission brake which locks the gearbox to hold the car at the starting line also the super stock sacrifices one horsepower compared to the demon on pump gas and it won t make any more power if you fill up with 104 hierarchy must be maintained long story short it s another drag racing dodge i took it on the windiest narrowest most challenging mountain roads outside san francisco anyway i drove the super stock on my visit to northern california as part of road track s route to vine a three day road rally that saw us climbing out of san francisco and exploring the secret mountain switchbacks of the region s finest roads at first blush the super stock seemed woefully ill prepared those squishy tall tires are designed to sag on a hard launch they maximize grip but sponge away any semblance of cornering feedback the 18 inch wheels they re mounted to require a brake downgrade the front rotors 1 2 inches smaller making do with four piston front calipers to the redeye s six our guests showed up in ferraris porsches c7 and c8 corvettes muscle wagons too a moody gray audi rs6 and a stately blue mercedes amg e63 my challenger stuck out like a double quarter pounder on a caviar tray i looked at our route three days of serpentine switchbacks through vineyards and redwoods and broke out in a sweat dw burnett it doesn t help that a widebody challenger is frankly enormous it s styled like a ten pound salami sitting behind the wheel looking out over that pectoral twin nostril hood you feel like you re driving around in john cena here s the bad news this is not one of those cars that shrinks around you the only way to forget the super stock s sprawl is to park it in the middle of the great american prairie but you ll never want to park it you never want it to be anything but exactly what it is after a week of roaring around in the super stock i can t tell you if it s measurably faster than any of the other hellcats once dodge eclipsed 700 horses power was never the limiting factor those cheater slicks seem to help in the sense that when you floor it you actually get some forward momentum to go with your tire vapor i m certain that if you took a super stock to a real prepared drag strip and followed the whole rigamarole activate the power chiller warm the tires with a line locked burnout carefully reverse over your fresh rubber patches engage launch control to hold the engine at the ideal rpm don t mess up you d leave any lesser hellcat hopelessly spinning its tires or gingerly attempting not to here s what i can tell you the super stock is always ready to party red light freeway at 70 mph in top gear in n out uproarious noise riotous wheelspin and heroic acceleration in that exact order are never more than a toe tap away dw burnett there are of course downsides those big squishy tires love to follow a crease or crack in the road especially if it s heading toward the guardrail there s a booming exhaust resonance around 2500 rpm right where the engine sits in 8th gear on every freeway in america between the high trunk lid and the bulbous fenders reversing this thing into a tight parking spot is a dice roll setting your mirrors like you re backing up a trailer helps somehow the rear suspension is starved for down travel making it easy to pop the inside rear wheel in the air when navigating a steep driveway or canyon hairpin it s embarrassing to have all that grippy rubber spinning uselessly a quarter inch off the pavement these aren t really even complaints the challenger s single mindedness is the heart of its charm mostly that comes in the form of horsepower in 2022 the big dodge offers v 8s boasting 375 485 717 797 or 807 horsepower a candy shop of choices but it s also about how these hefty coupes present their power every v 8 challenger is loud all the time camaro and mustang offer switchable mufflers dodge can t hear you every challenger even the lowliest v 6 rental has big body swagger an unabashedness you can t help but find striking dw burnett the challenger is completely and unapologetically itself the mustang and camaro have tried almost since the beginning to distance themselves from the declasse status of the pony car or muscle car the challenger relishes it the super stock with its baloney tires and quarter mile doodads is the proudest brawler of the bunch as compromised as a 4500 pound coupe on wallowing 40 series rubber should be the super stock makes sense even when physics don t the steepest san francisco hill no match for the super stock s grunt every boot of the throttle comes with an unrestrained yawp from the supercharger belt a rising note like ol scratch warming up his fiddle to face off with charlie daniels crank it into a corner and you just have to trust that there s insane grip at the end of all that body roll and tire squish that s what you get good and bad from more than a foot of rubber under each wheel mostly uninterrupted save for two grooves that the dot assures us provide the legal minimum amount of water evacuation the electrically assisted steering has mushy faraway feel but it s precise as you d hope when placing a six foot four inch wide car without the mirrors in a gap between an oncoming car and a 5000 year old redwood dw burnett none of this is to be taken as criticism the super stock is an absolute joy to hustle the transmission the ubiquitous zf eight speed automatic is geared to take every advantage of the supercharged 6 2 liter s barrel chested midrange thrust left to itself it ll fire off downshifts and keep the engine boiling under heavy braking it holds a gear impeccably through curves the response from the paddle shifters is immediate with all that stuff churning around inside and on top of the big hemi there s a ton of engine braking great for mid corner speed adjustments the brakes downsized though they may be never put up a protest fade free through a day of steep mountain drops the modern dodge challenger has evolved like the fast and the furious film franchise it s always been there and it s always felt the same there s a unified theme drawn through each new installment and variant it s a family but park a 2022 challenger next to a 2008 and the two feel completely different like jumping from dom toretto s dvd player heists directly to f9 dw burnett it s hard to pull that off a decade and a half of evolution tucked comfortably beneath a familiar silhouette one presumes the challenger and charger are dying in 2024 in part because dodge ran out of new lumps scoops shakers and spoilers to tack on to these venerable bodies there are other more pragmatic reasons but let me have this i m sure there will be numerous new challenger variants between now and then decal kits commemorative editions a final last hurrah with some kind of outrageous drivetrain and tire combo we haven t yet heard of the details will be irrelevant the dodge challenger is forever

depending on where people live um there have been um severe stock outs um of baby formula now it s not widespread everywhere yet but with that one big plant being shut down and not producing baby formula we are producing weightless baby formula then babies are consuming and um our inventory has been um diminished severely it s important to remember that um for babies on formula this is the only food option um there there is no substitute and i think we have to probably reevaluate um what s critical um infrastructure really means so it s weird for example we re keeping strategic supply of crude oil and petroleum um but we have critical strategic supplies of food items maybe formula ii think this unfortunately shows that we were not necessarily expecting this to happen so i think it s it s it s important to consider issues like that advertisement homemade infant formula can be dangerous experts share how to feed your baby through the shortage share copy link copy misinformation about how families can get through the infant formula shortage is fueling concern among pediatricians like dr tanya altmann the california doctor has been getting phone calls emails and social media messages not just from her patients but from families all over the united states along with photos of empty store shelves that once held infant formula parents say they ve been to a dozen stores and looked on a hundred websites and can t find their baby s infant formula and they want to know what to do and whether some of the so called alternatives they re hearing about are legit it s scary for these moms and their babies and it s becoming a real issue altmann said supply chain issues and product recalls have sparked the nationwide shortage of infant formulas as of early april seven states reported that between 40 and 50 of baby formula products were out of stock manufacturers have said they are producing at full capacity to make as much as they can but this week 43 of baby formulas were out of stock according to a new report from datasembly the u s food and drug administration is working with abbott nutrition the company involved in the recent recall to safely resume production and find tools to support the supply of infant formula according to an fda spokesperson but its michigan facility is likely still about two weeks away from being back online pending sign off from the fda and it will probably be another six to eight weeks until products are back on the shelves according to a statement from the company some people are turning to online communities of caregivers to get some ideas about what to do if they can t get their baby s source of nutrients however pediatricians are worried about the health impacts of some of the ideas posted online said altmann and dr steven abrams a professor of pediatrics at the university of texas at austin and former chair of the american academy of pediatrics committee on nutrition the pediatricians said there are ways to get through the shortage for many people and it is important to work with your pediatrician to address your infant s particular needs here are answers to some of your questions about what s safe and what is not can i make formula at home no there is a lot of discussion about making your own formula at home and things of that sort and i really want to discourage that as much as possible abrams said formulas are complex and researchers spent years developing the right ratio to give babies the nutrients they need altmann said infant formulas must be dense with protein fat vitamins and minerals many of which you can t buy at the grocery store and the balance must be precise for babies health and development she added you can see how it would be really hard to duplicate in your own kitchen she said homemade formulas can result in a baby not getting the right nutrition or having the ratio of their electrolytes disrupted which can be dangerous altmann said there have also been cases of bacterial contamination which can make the infants sick can i stretch out my formula supply no adding in other food sources or adding more water to formula is tempting as you get close to the end of your last container of formula but pediatricians said it s not a good idea families can start introducing solids into an infant s diet when the baby is around 4 to 6 months old altmann said but these foods are not a nutritional substitute for formula at that age even when you start solids breast milk or infant formula is still the major source of nutrition for your baby altmann said and adding extra water to stretch the formula you have can dilute the essential nutrient profile and lead to serious health issues and interfere with proper growth and development she added we re not irrational if there is nothing you can put in the baby s mouth except cow s milk you re going to do that abrams said but that s not what we want people to do can i use toddler formula or cow s milk instead maybe it really depends on how old your baby is and what your pediatrician says for the first six months at least formula specified for infants is really important altmann said but the closer they are to a year there may be more flexibility you can actually choose a toddler formula at that point where normally you d want to wait until they re exactly a year of age altmann said talk to your pediatrician always first we discourage the use of cow s milk until a year of age but it s certainly true that as the baby is close to a year of age especially if it s simply no formula to be found that you could use either that or a toddler formula abrams said neither are ideal but the closer you are to the year especially for the short term those are alternatives can i buy international formulas online maybe altmann said there are some high quality products made in europe and australia she likes that are available online but it is important to make sure you are ordering from reputable retailers she recommended buying from trusted pharmacies of the country the formula is from and checking how the formula s nutrition compares to fda approved formula not all international formulas are created equally so you may want to make sure you know what you are getting and that it s a high quality product she said but abrams cautions against imports reminding families that imported formulas are not reviewed by the fda it s a less than ideal alternative but if that s what they have to do then that s what they have to do he said the fda recommends against importing formula online because it could potentially be counterfeit a spokesperson said can i switch formula brands yes what we want people to do if at all possible is to be as flexible as possible and make formula switches abrams said it may take your baby a few days to get used to a new formula brand but in most cases switching is fine altmann said you can find good formula choices for your baby here it gets more complicated however in cases where a child may be on a certain formula because of an allergy or sensitivity if your child has an allergy or sensitivity and has had previous reactions to formulas please consult with your pediatrician before switching off because not all formulas are the same altmann said but in most cases there are other options available we can help direct you to the fda is allowing abbott nutrition to release product on a case by case basis to some families in urgent need of specialty and metabolic formulas according to the agency can i restart my breast milk supply it s complicated there have been instances where parents can induce lactation for the first time or restart lactation after choosing not to breastfeed altmann said the process is complicated however and likely requires the help of a lactation specialist there are also banks where you can buy breast milk donated by other families you can find milk banks near you through the human milk bank association of north america
