state and local governments lost at least 117 billion of expected revenue early in the pandemic according to an associated press analysis but many are now awash in record amounts of money boosted partly by federal aid in response to the dramatic turnaround governors lawmakers and local officials have proposed a surge in spending as well as a new wave of tax cuts the ultimate effect of the pandemic was a net positive said stephen parker assistant city manager for the los angeles suburb of upland where sales tax revenues are soaring isn t that unbelievable it s just crazy to think of that upland a city of 79 000 was representative of many cities at the outset of the pandemic it reported an estimated loss of nearly 6 1 million in 2020 the result of a steep but short lived national recession and what parker describes as a generous treasury department method for calculating losses that figure was the median amount among more than 900 cities that reported their revenues to the department under the american rescue plan act upland s financial situation turned around even before the end of 2020 parker said federal covid 19 stimulus checks played a role so did a shift in consumer spending to goods instead of services that lifted city revenues parker said because services often are exempt from sales taxes while goods are not the pandemic relief law championed by democrats and signed by president joe biden last march included 350 billion in aid to states and local governments the treasury department required states counties and larger cities to file reports last year detailing their initial plans for the money those governments also were asked to estimate their losses for 2020 by comparing actual revenue to expected revenue under a treasury formula though revenue figures were left blank by nearly one quarter of the roughly 3 700 governments that filed reports the data nonetheless provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the financial strain on governments during the pandemic s first year more than two thirds of state and local governments reported at least some losses ranging from a few thousand dollars in some rural counties to more than 12 billion for the state of texas according to the ap s analysis the total was 117 5 billion the treasury department last october declined an ap request to release the revenue loss data under the federal freedom of information act saying it would be publicly available later it recently posted the data on its website the next reports are due monday for some governments and april 30 for others loading notes actual general revenue actual general revenue as of 12 months ended december 31 2020 base year revenue for the most recent fiscal year prior to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic for most governments that meant their base year was the 2019 fiscal year estimated loss estimated revenue loss due to covid 19 public health emergency as of december 31 2020 funds allocation explanation of how revenue replacement funds were allocated recovery funds for pension whether fiscal recovery funds used to make a deposit into a pension fund the report for north carolina lists its 2020 revenue as 26 6 trillion and its base year revenue as 24 8 trillion ap confirmed with the state that these figures were intended to be shown as billions not trillions and ap has updated the data accordingly there are 28 entities for which there appear to be data entry errors in the base year revenues these entities show base year revenues of 2 016 or 2 019 or 2 020 it appears likely that these were intended to be base years of 2016 2019 or 2020 but got entered into the wrong field the department used lost revenue to determine how much flexibility to give governments in spending the aid under guidelines issued last may governments that showed a loss were free to spend an equal amount on almost any government services including roads and other projects not otherwise allowed under the rules a final rule released earlier this month expanded that flexibility by allowing governments to claim up to 10 million of revenue losses even if actual losses were less upland which is getting 15 million plans to use part of its flexible spending to repave parking lots and repair hundreds of sections of sidewalks that might not otherwise have been eligible federal assistance was not the only factor that helped governments bounce back financial analysts also cite inflation which pushed up prices and bolstered sales tax collections many consumers also had more to spend because of the stimulus checks a strong stock market drove up capital gains taxes and an early pandemic rise in unemployment spared many higher earners who shifted to working from home while continuing to pay income taxes in many places the revenue rebound exceeded pre pandemic levels total state tax revenues from last april through november rose 20 compared to the same period in 2019 according to an urban institute report released earlier this month for governments that already were financially strained the pandemic deepened their losses but also resulted in a cash windfall the hudson river valley city of poughkeepsie was rated by the new york comptroller as the state s most financially stressed community in 2020 with a pre pandemic deficit around 7 million and no reserves the city quickly cut spending sold property froze hiring and instituted an early retirement program in a desperate effort to close the gap when the pandemic began city administrator marc nelson said the city reported a 2020 revenue loss of nearly 4 5 million under the treasury department s formula it s getting more than 20 million from the american rescue plan though the relief money cannot be used to wipe out the deficit the city plans to make major improvements to parks and swimming pools including a complete rebuild of a run down bathhouse that has been relying on portable toilets these are things that would not have been within the city s ability to take on were it not for the covid relief money nelson said though they re spending the federal aid some republican officials insist it was unnecessary in light of the rapidly rebounding tax revenues missouri reported an estimated 900 million loss for 2020 but ended its 2021 fiscal year with a record cash balance republican gov mike parson recently proposed a 47 billion budget that is up nearly one third over the current year because of surging federal and state revenues he wants to spend more on infrastructure and public employee salaries while also saving more when other states will be using federal dollars to fill spending gaps and budget shortfalls we will be making investments in the future he said in his state of the state address in some cases government losses weren t as severe as the treasury numbers might suggest greer county in rural southwest oklahoma reported a 2020 revenue loss of 363 630 around the national median for counties reporting their revenues that comprised 10 of the county s expected revenue under the treasury department formula but it didn t prompt budget cuts county clerk tiffany buchanan said the county didn t feel that much of a loss buchanan said explaining we live on a very tight strict budget as it is the county plans to use some of its 1 1 million from the american rescue plan to help fund the sheriff s office and pay emergency medical personnel some states including california and texas projected large revenue losses at the outset of the pandemic but have since posted big gains when it passed a budget early in the pandemic california had expected the recession to cause a 54 billion deficit that led officials to defer payments to schools and community colleges and to reduce state employee pay according to the state s treasury report now california is projecting a nearly 46 billion surplus spurred by record tax collections leaving officials searching for ways to use the money gov gavin newsom recently proposed a budget that would expand health coverage to all low income adults living in the state illegally while simultaneously cutting taxes the democratic governor also said a substantial tax rebate was likely in order i will be holding the governor s feet to the fire and keep him at his word to refund surplus dollars to the taxpayers gop state sen melissa

rally analysis unlike the prior week bulls put up a fight this past week a market rally attempt began monday with an impressive rebound from heavy losses but in the days that followed the market has shown a lot of volatility but no clear direction still the major indexes did snap weekly losing streaks after several ups and downs the s p 500 and nasdaq closed with strong price gains friday nasdaq volume fell slightly vs thursday so the tech heavy index did not stage a follow through day to confirm the new rally the s p 500 did rally above monday s high closing a hair below its 200 day line but nyse volume was a whisker below thursday s level a follow through day could still happen next week even if friday were a ftd there would have been plenty of caveats not all confirmed market rallies work a new uptrend heading into an aggressive rate hiking cycle might have higher odds of failure the s p 500 moving above the 200 day line and the nasdaq clearing the 14 000 level would seem to be minimum level to feel some confidence in the market rally from that perspective friday s market gains could be viewed as a setup day for a true ftd next week the lack of stocks to buy also raises concerns while some stocks might offer various entries soon after a market rally there are a lot of heavily damaged charts out there the whipsaw market action means that stocks that could look enticing could look terrible a few hours or days later was friday s action the sign of something real or did the market just have the good luck to close at a high point in a whipsaw trading range time

after my visit to new york s capital region earlier this month it s clear to me that the empire state is becoming an empire of clean energy with president biden s agenda to build a better america this empire will deliver good paying jobs cheaper energy bills cleaner air and greater resilience to new yorkers the world now recognizes that clean energy is not only the answer to climate change but this century s greatest economic opportunity as more countries plan their transition to clean energy the global market for clean energy technologies is skyrocketing by the end of the decade it ll reach 23 trillion and our economic competitors are racing to stake their claim new yorkers have long understood this that s why when washington pulled back from clean energy and climate action under the previous administration this state leapt forward the 2019 climate leadership and community protection act clcpa made new york a national climate leader by setting goals to reduce carbon pollution by 40 by 2030 and reach 100 clean electricity by 2040 the biden administration looked to new york s example in setting our own bold national clean energy agenda which calls for 100 clean electricity by 2035 and reaching net zero by 2050 in fact the clcpa s climate justice provisions inspired our own justice40 initiative which puts disadvantaged communities at the front of the line for federal climate and clean energy investments as i saw on my second visit to the state as secretary of energy clean energy is already helping new yorkers save money grow their local economies and make their communities healthier and more resilient in the face of climate change nearly 163 000 new yorkers work clean energy jobs and more will soon join them equinor is constructing new offshore wind manufacturing hubs at the port of albany and the south brooklyn marine terminal both of which will employ hundreds of new yorkers to assemble turbines for wind projects up and down the coast including in the waters off new york as u s sen gillibrand rep paul tonko and i saw firsthand students at hudson valley community college are training for jobs in offshore wind electric vehicle manufacturing and solar jobs with family sustaining wages and the opportunity to join a union and the new york independent system operator nyiso has a plan for building out wind and solar energy across the state that could save consumers nearly half a billion dollars a year this is only the beginning in her state of the state address three weeks ago gov kathy hochul outlined an impressive range of new clean energy plans including developing enough offshore wind capacity to power nearly three million new york households electrifying and decarbonizing two million homes and investing 1 billion in electric vehicle infrastructure she also announced efforts to increase climate resilience in communities across the state grow the state s clean hydrogen industry and build a battery research and manufacturing center at binghamton university outside of state government new york city is moving forward with all carbon pollution free new construction ithaca is pursuing a first of its kind plan to decarbonize its entire building stock and from the hudson valley to monroe county communities have made new york a leading state for community solar projects president biden is giving these efforts a massive boost the bipartisan infrastructure law is deepening research and development for wind energy it s allowed the department of energy to launch our new building a better grid initiative to speed transmission deployment so that we can get more clean energy sources like offshore wind online and keep the power on during natural disasters and cyber attacks there s 8 billion for clean hydrogen demonstration projects up for grabs the 3 5 billion investment in the weatherization assistance program which has improved energy efficiency in over 94 000 low income new york households will help us lower energy bills for thousands of new yorkers some of them may currently depend on the low income home energy assistance program which has more than 875 million available for new york households this winter and there s funding to support a national network of electric vehicle charging stations and shore up our domestic battery supply chains with the second piece of the president s agenda which is in sen chuck schumer s capable hands as majority leader the federal government will provide tax credits and incentives to make clean energy technologies like electric vehicles heat pumps and rooftop solar panels affordable for middle class families it ll boost domestic manufacturing of these technologies so we can build them use them and create jobs all here in america america saw a record 6 4 million new jobs added to the economy in 2021 the most under any u s president in one year there s more to come the president s full economic agenda will add 1 5 million jobs a year over the next decade and the vast majority won t require an advanced degree many of those jobs will be right here thanks to a flourishing clean energy empire that builds a healthier wealthier future for every new yorker

virginia democrats still wincing from their whipping by glenn youngkin howl that the rookie republican governor is undergoing a metamorphosis he is chucking unity and consensus for divide and conquer gambling that he prevails by splitting the opposition there s nothing malevolent about this for youngkin it is a clever necessity for steering his program through a divided legislature for now the republicans who control the house of delegates would play in traffic if told by youngkin in the democratic virginia senate he s eyeing the few free souls willing to break with the majority that s why democrats are wary of chap petersen of fairfax city and joe morrissey of richmond they re playing footsie with youngkin on education tax cuts and cabinet nominations it s not clear what petersen and morrissey might trade with youngkin for their votes it s probably something they didn t get from democrats when they ruled state government divide and conquer was youngkin s modus operandi long before he landed in richmond it will determine whether he can purge classrooms of masks and race teaching use the budget to punish localities for woke driven cuts in police spending create alternate schools to those he claims let down kids rather than raise them up and win confirmation of his choice for natural resources secretary a coal industry lobbyist who ran the environmental protection agency for donald trump as co ceo of the carlyle group youngkin made big bets that wresting control of this company or that one would yield fat dividends for himself his partners and after the private equity giant went public its shareholders it worked time and again though not without bursts of controversy some of it tied to carlyle s hiring of washington insiders when its subsidiaries were trolling for high dollar federal contracts what carlyle does best is peel from other companies divide if you will holdings euphemistically labeled underperforming buying them with borrowed money and paring their overhead in part through layoffs to promote profits then the hopped up acquisition conquered if you will is sold at a premium allowing for prompt repayment of any loans with the remaining proceeds tidily pocketed as profit a sweet deal for carlyle was its acquisition in 2005 from a french wine and spirits company of dunkin donuts purchased for 2 4 billion in 2005 by carlyle and two other private equity shops the coffee and doughnut chain was taken public six years later having significantly expanded its footprint and payroll stock sales generated a three fold profit of 1 8 billion divided equally among the three firms dunkin donuts now simply dunkin again went private in 2020 youngkin who presumably laughed all the way to the bank over a deal that was all about unhealthy foods must have still been chuckling over it as a candidate among the bumper stickers produced by his campaign was one that parodied the doughnut retailer s slogan signage and color scheme virginia runs on youngkin but divide and conquer may have contributed to youngkin s undoing at carlyle youngkin who had run the company s european operations from london and is credited with the 22 billion takeover of pipeline company kinder morgan ahead of the natural gas boom took command of carlyle in 2017 with kewsong lee it was an uneasy power sharing arrangement under which youngkin would supervise operations lee deals within three years youngkin would depart depending on your perspective he jumped or was shoved in language not easily interpreted as charitable the financial times put it this way several days before youngkin s narrow victory over terry mcauliffe who had tried to depict him as a let them eat cake plutocrat much as barack obama would another financier mitt romney during youngkin s tenure as co ceo carlyle failed to emerge from a stretch of under performance anchored by overly complex and costly global operations and poor investment performance particularly in hedge funds and the energy sector two areas where youngkin had responsibility it was in carlyle s best interest that youngkin have a soft landing were he represented as the casualty of a power struggle or as less than savvy on investments not only would his reputation have been dinged but market confidence in the company could diminish certainly the latter hasn t occurred carlyle shares have doubled in price since youngkin left to go long on politics underwriting his candidacy with 20 million from a personal fortune that exceeds 400 million according to forbes and then there s youngkin s religious faith from every indication a powerful force in his life one shaped by an enduring conservatism youngkin and his family attended a mainstream episcopal church in northern virginia a democratic trending region that in the early 2000s was ground zero in a legal fight between church leaders and several parishes that broke away to protest the denomination s support of gay rights that included the installation of a gay man as a bishop in the northeast as well as the blessing of same sex unions youngkin s spiritual views for example he opposes same sex marriage legalized by the u s supreme court in 2015 and largely sought to conceal his stance during the 2021 race spurred him and his wife suzanne to launch an independent anglican church in mclean holy trinity church it is supported by a foundation the couple started in 2016 and has an estimated 22 million in holdings in no small measure because of youngkin s financial generosity holy trinity church represents a conquest born of division a sense as with his political and investment strategies that if you can t join em beat em

apple inc shares gained the most since 2020 after quarterly results sailed past wall street estimates marking a victory against a supply chain crunch fueled by the pandemic and chip shortages sales climbed 11 per cent to a record us 123 9 billion in the fiscal first quarter the company said thursday analysts had predicted us 119 1 billion on average profit also beat projections and the company predicted that sales would grow by a double digit percentage in the march quarter the stock rallied 7 per cent to us 170 33 friday on the news marking the biggest one day increase since july 31 2020 which followed another blockbuster quarter the surprisingly strong results from apple suggest that fears of supply upheaval were overblown apple chief executive officer tim cook had warned late last year that shortages could cost the company more than us 6 billion in sales during the all important holiday period but the tech giant navigated the crisis and benefited from a flood of new products including the iphone 13 apple watch series 7 and updated macs however apple may be an early outlier in resolving supply chain issues thanks in part to its dominant position in obtaining parts from suppliers a resurgence of covid 19 skyrocketing shipping costs and labor shortages continue to strain the global supply chain stmicroelectronics nv which counts apple as a major customer said friday it doesn t see a letup in the chip shortage before 2023 the biden administration has also stated that the global semiconductor shortage will persist until at least the second half of this year wall street was broadly happy with apple s results and its ability to navigate the supply chain crisis while also introducing a flood of new products the earnings report highlights the strength and stickiness of apple s ecosystem morgan stanley s katy huberty said in a note to clients she reiterated apple as her top pick for 2022 before apple s results were released thursday afternoon its shares had fallen 10 per cent this year hurt by a broader downturn the stock gained 34 per cent in 2021 investors have been looking to apple for reassurance after a recent rout battered technology stocks concerns about a sales slowdown and looming interest rates hikes have made the sector less appealing in the past month with apple itself suffering from the retreat after topping a market value of us 3 trillion in early january apple is now worth less than us 2 8 trillion earnings for the cupertino california based company rose to us 2 10 a share in the first quarter which ended dec 25 well above the us 1 90 estimated by analysts on a conference call apple executives said supply chain constraints would ease further in the march quarter through its rate of growth would decelerate for both the overall business and the services segment apple didn t give a specific sales target beyond saying it would be a record for the period analysts are predicting that revenue will top us 90 billion gross margin will be 42 5 per cent to 43 5 per cent apple said the company also said there are now 1 8 billion apple devices currently in use up 300 million from two years ago and it has 785 million paid apple and third party subscriptions on its platform up from 745 million reported in the previous quarter the company generated us 71 6 billion in revenue from its flagship product the iphone beating wall street estimates of us 67 7 billion that s up 9 2 per cent from the year ago quarter the sales period represented the first full quarter of iphone 13 revenue on the company s earnings call cook said the entire iphone 13 line contributed to the strong growth and declined to specify if the pro models were stronger performers than the cheaper versions the phone went on sale in september several weeks earlier than the iphone 12 did in 2020 though the iphone 13 was considered to be a modest update users looking to upgrade to 5g service still clamored for the device the supply constraints hitting the iphone 13 line and other new products including the latest macs and apple watches resulted in shipment delays of several weeks in apple s previous earnings report the company said that the problems cost it us 6 billion in sales and warned that the holiday quarter would be even worse against that backdrop the results were a relief to investors but not everything was rosy sales of the ipad were lower than projected the company had said after its previous quarter that supply problems were hitting that product particularly hard japan also was a weak spot last quarter the ipad brought in us 7 25 billion in the first quarter compared with an estimate of us 8 1 billion the company launched the most significant ipad mini update in the product s history and a minor refresh to its cheapest tablet during the quarter but struggled to get enough supply to market chief financial officer luca maestri said that ipad shortages in the quarter were pronounced and cook said some of constraints were due to apple reallocating key components to the iphone this is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the pandemic cook said and while i can t say it gets any easier i can say i m incredibly proud of the way our teams have come together apple generated us 19 5 billion in services revenue in the first quarter topping wall street expectations of us 18 6 billion the category grew 24 per cent from a year earlier on strong app store apple music and icloud subscription sales apple said earlier this month that developers generated about us 60 billion from the app store during 2021 but it didn t share specific app store revenue for the company the wearables home and accessories division a unit that includes the apple watch apple tv airpods beats headphones the homepod and other items produced us 14 7 billion during the quarter that was up 13 per cent from a year earlier and above the average estimate of us 14 2 billion the category got a boost from new airpods earbuds launching near the end of 2021 after not getting a similar upgrade in 2020 the apple watch series 7 however faced a release delay and significant shortages the company also reported about us 10 9 billion in mac sales beating the estimate of us 9 5 billion that climbed 25 per cent from the year ago period apple launched a new macbook pro during the quarter that was well received by consumers and reviewers maestri said the majority of new macs sold now have apple designed chips rather than parts from intel corp the coming year could be even bigger in terms of new products apple is planning its widest array of launches ever including a new iphone se and an ipad air with 5g as early as this spring bloomberg has reported there also could be updated apple watches four new iphones and multiple macs coming in the fall on the call cook was asked his opinion of the so called metaverse a concept promoted by facebook owner meta platforms inc and other rivals cook responded that apple is investing heavily in augmented reality and noted that ar apps are already available on the iphone the company plans to launch a mixed augmented and virtual reality headset next year bloomberg has reported we see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly he said
the super sized sea creatures have been showing up off the yorkshire coast where they ve prompted feelings of both fear and joy among fishermen britain is being invaded by giant red king crabs from russia which can grow close to 6ft across and weigh up to 28lbs the super sized sea creatures have been showing up off the yorkshire coast where they ve prompted feelings of both fear and joy among fishermen the variety of crab has a hard upper shell and can measure a huge 11 inches across the body while the sweet fleshed species popularity with chefs means they are a lucrative catch for fishermen there are also fears the monsters might chomp up all of the scallops and brown crabs one fisherman told the sun online i m really excited but worried about our native seafood image alamy stock photo alamy stock photo giant red king crabs are native to north america though scientists introduced them to russia in the 1960s and they thrived in the arctic ocean they soon exploded in numbers with fishermen benefiting financially from their adundance the huge crabs then travelled to norway where they sparked another fishing boom most recently the crabs have been found in uk waters where aside from the odd one fished up in recent years they have never been seen in significant numbers fish supplier shaun henderson who sells to more than 80 restaurants said one of his fishermen pulled up 40st of king crabs off bridlington east yorks this week image alamy stock photo alamy stock photo it was the first time anyone in his family had caught a king crab he said despite them having fished in the area for two generations while he was excited about the new catch he was also wary he said due to how invasive the species seemed the giant crabs appeared to be eating both the scallops and the brown crabs which made mr henderson worry about seafood native to the uk he said king crabs had made fishermen a lot of money in norway but had simultaneously depleted the populations of other sea creatures while will murray head chef at fallow restaurant in st james s market central london has bought some of the crabs he said he has mixed feelings about their appearance in the uk while he described the giant crabs as a premium ingredient that accounted for some of the best seafood in the world he noted there were possibly negative implications of their appearance we re excited but a bit terrified as they are invaders and could kill our brown crabs he said he said the species could be the next grey squirrel but at least they were easy to cook and enjoyable to eat
western aerospace companies have increased stocks of titanium and are scrambling to shore up supply chains in case the metal used widely in planemaking is thrust into a potential trade war between russia and the west titanium much of it supplied by russia has been used in commercial jet engines and other parts for decades but its use has soared in recent years with the latest lightweight jets such as the boeing 787 and airbus a350 reaching 14 15 of an empty jetliner by weight neil mitchill chief financial officer of raytheon technologies the world s largest aerospace contractor said it was monitoring the developments and working to ensure its supply chain was secure for the coming 12 months the maker of pratt and whitney jet engines said it had two or more sources of titanium and other key raw materials but did not give further details boeing which relies heavily on russian titanium giant vsmpo avisma is protected for quite a while but not forever chief executive david calhoun said on wednesday industry sources said western aerospace firms have been increasing inventory or diversifying sources of supply since 2014 when russia was sanctioned for its annexation of crimea from ukraine even though titanium was not directly targeted their situation has been made easier by the fact that fewer jets are being assembled as a result of the pandemic giving them opportunities to stockpile reserves during the crimea crisis everybody created safety stocks and second sources of titanium but eventually nothing happened on sanctions a senior european industry source said once a cold war material used to build spy planes and submarines titanium is widely seen as a test case for economic interdependence in strategic sectors like civil aerospace at the dubai airshow in november boeing provisionally renewed a two decade partnership with vsmpo avisma agreeing to maintain it as its largest titanium supplier the world s biggest producer supplies 25 of global demand for titanium a light but strong and corrosion resistant metal also used in nuclear energy the same two companies also agreed to increase the use of a joint venture in russia s titanium valley in the urals airbus and brazil s embraer also have long term deals with vsmpo avisma airbus said it was following the situation closely vsmpo avisma and embraer said they had no immediate comment airbus has said it relies on russia for half its titanium needs while a us industry source said vsmpo avisma provided a third of boeing s requirements for its part vsmpo avisma makes around three quarters of its sales from aerospace despite efforts to diversify in 2018 a draft law in russia s parliament proposed restricting titanium exports in response to tightening western sanctions but the country s trade minister was reported saying the idea was blocked to prevent losing stable foreign buyers even so the outcome of a possible trade war if tensions boil over is difficult to predict with stakes increasing as the united states threatens to target a key russian gas pipeline s p said last year russia might limit exports of strategic materials due to tensions but this was not the likeliest case the west is also unlikely to halt trade as it takes years to certify alternative suppliers it said in a report the us commerce department imposed restrictions on vsmpo avisma in december 2020 only to reverse them three weeks later targeting vsmpo avisma would single out a strategic asset with close ties to russia s defence industry but quickly backfire on western aerospace companies industry sources said
file photo published sat 29 jan 2022 3 51 am a british judge found on friday that tech tycoon mike lynch had masterminded an elaborate fraud to inflate the value of his company autonomy before it was bought by hewlett packard for 11 billion in 2011 in one of the uk s biggest tech deals lynch received a further blow later on friday when britain s interior ministry ordered his extradition to the united states to face criminal charges over the deal that carry a maximum prison term of 20 years lynch intends to appeal both the judge s finding and the extradition order his lawyers said finding in hp s favour following a near decade long battle justice robert hildyard said the silicon valley company had won the majority of its civil case against lynch although the damages to be announced at a later date would be significantly smaller than the 5 billion demanded the claimants have substantially succeeded in their claims hildyard told the high court in a one hour summary of his much longer judgement following a nine month trial and a two year wait for his decision the judge said lynch was aware that practices autonomy engaged in were dishonest its revenue recognition was improper and its accounts were false the court s decision coincided with a friday deadline for britain to decide whether or not to extradite lynch britain s interior ministry said that it had to sign the extradition order if there were no grounds to prohibit the order being made the criminal charges in the united states include wire fraud and securities fraud on 28 january following consideration by the courts the extradition of dr michael lynch to the us was ordered a home office spokesperson said lynch s lawyers said that as he is a british citizen who ran a british company the case should not be resolved in the united states dr lynch firmly denies the charges brought against him in the us and will continue to fight to establish his innocence lawyer chris morvillo said this is not the end of the battle far from it dr lynch will now file an appeal to the high court in london it is a dramatic fall from grace for britain s most successful tech leader the 56 year old turned ground breaking research at cambridge university into the foundation of autonomy which became britain s biggest software company and a member of the blue chip ftse 100 index he was lauded by academics and scientists and asked to advise the government on technology and innovation autonomy s almost magical capability as it was once described by hp was to search and organise unstructured information for clients a killer application in a world of unlimited data and artificial intelligence it was bought by hp described by the judge as being in the doldrums at the time in a move that was designed to transform the computer and printer maker into a more profitable business focused on software the acquisition turned sour almost immediately hp wrote down the value of autonomy by 8 8 billion within a year and sought damages from lynch and his finance director sushovan hussain hussain was convicted of fraud in the united states and sentenced to five years in prison in 2019 lynch said hp did not know what it was doing and was out of its depth in understanding his technology he spent 20 days on the stand during the case giving his verdict on friday judge hildyard found that lynch and hussain had fraudulently concealed a fire sale of hardware and engaged in convoluted reselling schemes to mask a shortfall in sales of autonomy s software the business hp coveted that had enabled autonomy to meet quarterly financial forecasts and maintain its high share price before the acquisition hpe is pleased that the judge has held them accountable a spokesman for hewlett packard enterprise hpe said after the london court ruling lynch was also central to the creation of darktrace a cyber security firm that listed on the stock market last year with a current value around 3 6 billion lynch and his wife angela bacares own nearly 16 per cent of darktrace according to refinitiv data hp sold the remnants of autonomy along with other assets to british company micro focus in 2016
vol 46 no 4 friday january 28 2022 austin says putin now has full range of options in ukraine print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required washington ap defense secretary lloyd austin said friday the buildup of russian forces along ukraine s border has reached the point where president vladimir putin now has a complete range of military options including actions short of a full scale invasion while we don t believe that president putin has made a final decision to use these forces against ukraine he clearly now has the capability austin told a pentagon news conference in moscow the kremlin said putin told french president emmanuel macron that the west has failed to take russian security concerns into account and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov told a radio interviewer that russia doesn t want war but sees no room for compromise on its demands austin said putin could use any portion of his force of an estimated 100 000 troops to seize ukrainian cities and significant territories or to launch coercive acts or provocative political acts like the recognition of breakaway territories inside ukraine he urged putin to de escalate the tensions austin spoke alongside army gen mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who said russian forces near ukraine include not only ground troops and naval and air forces but also cyber and electronic warfare capabilities as well as special operations forces he urged putin to choose a diplomatic path over conflict if russia chooses to invade ukraine it will not be cost free in terms of casualties and other significant effects milley said he was referring to russian costs while also noting that ukraine s armed forces are more capable today than in 2014 when russia seized ukraine s crimean peninsula and intervened in support of pro russian separatists in the eastern industrial heartland the comments by austin and milley were their first extensive public statements about ukraine this year the news conference itself marked a subtle shift in the administration s approach to public communications about the months long ukraine crisis which until now has focused on the white house and secretary of state antony blinken who has spearheaded the administration s diplomatic efforts milley and austin have consulted regularly in recent weeks with their counterparts in allied countries and in ukraine but have revealed little about the content of those communications or about their views of the crisis earlier friday the kremlin said putin told french president emmanuel macron that the west has failed to consider russia s key conditions of halting further nato expansion stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near russian borders and rolling back its forces from eastern europe the u s and nato formally rejected those demands this week although washington outlined areas where discussions are possible offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war amid the troop buildup near ukraine despite that u s president joe biden on thursday warned ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy that there is a distinct possibility that russia could take military action against the former soviet state in february russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans zelenskyy however sought to play down the war fears saying western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country s financial markets to cash out we don t need this panic he said at a news conference it cost ukrainians dearly putin told macron that moscow will study the u s and nato response before deciding its next move according to a kremlin account of their call earlier in the day putin held a weekly meeting of his security council saying only that it would address foreign policy issues putin has made no public remarks about the western response but foreign minister sergey lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement while they say they won t change their positions we won t change ours lavrov told russian radio stations in a live interview i don t see any room for compromise here there won t be a war as far as it depends on the russian federation we don t want a war he added but we won t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored a senior biden administration official said the u s welcomed lavrov s comments that russia does not war but this needs to be backed up with action we need to see russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the ukrainian border and taking other de escalatory steps the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly lavrov said the u s suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate range missiles restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft he said that russia proposed discussing those issues years ago but washington and its allies never took them up on it until now while welcoming washington s offers on confidence building measures he argued they are secondary to russia s main concerns on nato he noted that international agreements say that the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others and that he would send letters to ask his western counterparts to explain their failure to respect that pledge it will be hard for them to wiggle out from answering why they aren t fulfilling the obligations sealed by their leaders not to strengthen their security at the expense of others he said referring to a document signed at a 1999 summit of the organization for security and cooperation in europe washington has warned moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades ukraine including penalties targeting top russian officials and key economic sectors asked about possible sanctions lavrov said moscow had warned washington that their introduction would amount to a complete severing of ties while moscow and the west are mulling their next steps nato said it was bolstering its deterrence in the baltic sea region and the u s ordered 8 500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to europe russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern russia warplanes in kaliningrad on the baltic sea and dozens of warships in the black sea and the arctic russian troops have also headed to belarus for sweeping joint drills raising western fears that moscow could stage an attack on ukraine from the north the ukrainian capital is just 75 kilometers 50 miles from the border with belarus belarusian president alexander lukashenko said there will be no war unless belarus or russia come under attack and accused the west of trying to drown our slavic brotherhood in blood the leaders of some countries have gone mad they think they can win that war he said but there will be no victory we will all lose despite the alarming rhetoric ukrainian officials have repeatedly tried to project calm zelenskyy said the decision by the u s britain australia germany and canada to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from kyiv was a mistake those were redundant steps that didn t help he said he argued that internal destabilization poses the greatest risk to the country he also bemoaned nato s failure to offer ukraine a roadmap to membership saying the alliance should state clearly if it doesn t plan to embrace ukraine and not offer vague promises you say openly that you will never accept us why talk about the future he said zelenskyy challenged the u s warnings of an imminent russian attack insisting we aren t seeing any escalation bigger than before and charging that the russian troop concentration could be part of moscow s attempts to exert psychological pressure and sow panic ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov told parliament the number of russian troops near ukraine about 130 000 is comparable to moscow s military buildup last spring when moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises we haven t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring with the exception of the deployment to belarus reznikov said ukraine already is beset by conflict following the 2014 ouster of a kremlin friendly president in kyiv moscow annexed ukraine s crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in the country s eastern industrial heartland fighting between ukrainian forces and russia backed rebels has killed over 14 000 people and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled ___

it was a summer holiday on borrowed time you ve gotta admit it s pretty remarkable we made it this far without omicron sweeping through new zealand enjoyed christmas without widespread community transmission despite dj dimension we made it through the new year and most of january but i think we can all see the end is nigh it s quite feasible that by this time next week our omicron daily case numbers will be in the thousands timing is everything in the covid 19 response in december opposition mps wanted the borders opened to people travelling from so called low risk countries including australia so long as they d had two vaccinations tested negative before travelling and were prepared to isolate at home you can only imagine how much faster the new variant would have been circling here all up the hesitance to relax border restrictions probably bought us six weeks time for summer holidays sure but time also for a lot of kiwis to receive their booster jabs unfortunately i m not one of them because i was in group 4 even though i got my first and second vaccines as soon as i possibly could i don t qualify for a booster until after waitangi day that means i won t benefit from the full effect of the booster shot until the last week of february again timing is everything if the original vaccine rollout had come just a little bit sooner me and hundreds of thousands of other new zealanders would have the chance to be much more protected against this variant before we hit thousands of daily cases i think the government deserves a serve for the rapid antigen test debacle i understand the theory behind wanting to control the limited stocks they want to make sure everyone has access regardless of where they are in the country theoretically they can control the supply to different regions depending on where the outbreak is flaring up all that stuff makes sense but a more prudent approach would have meant we could do both we d have enough public tests available for everyone who needed one and businesses that wanted to be extra cautious could use their own private supplies for maintenance testing their staff the government is effectively pushing in the queue and bullying out private orders what d i say timing it wouldn t have been necessary if the ministry of health had acquired more tests earlier in the long run though these are probably not the things that will stick in our minds or the things by which we will judge the omicron response in all likelihood tens or hundreds of thousands of new zealanders are about to contract the virus it ll be our biggest infection since start of the pandemic maybe our biggest ever the most important measure will be how new zealand manages the surge of cases can we keep the pot on a gentle simmer protecting our healthcare services or will it boil and bubble and overflow there s reason to be optimistic we re a highly vaccinated society the new york times reported this week that people who ve been double vaccinated and boosted face a greater risk by getting in a car than they do from omicron that doesn t mean everyone is protected but if we re able to manage omicron provided there are no new strains there can be few sensible arguments from stopping new zealanders abroad from finally coming home dare we cross our fingers and hope this might be the beginning of the end listen above
maryland s highest court on friday upheld a wealthy stock trader s conviction on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the fiery death of a man who was helping him dig tunnels for a nuclear bunker under a home the maryland court of appeals ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support daniel beckwitt s conviction in the september 2017 death of 21 year old askia khafra beckwitt s failure to provide khafra with a reasonably safe workplace in the tunnels constituted gross negligence the appeals court said beckwitt s conduct was likely to result in harm to khafra at any moment and an ordinarily prudent person under similar circumstances would have been conscious of the risk to khafra the court s 76 page opinion says beckwitt was sentenced in 2019 to nine years in prison after a jury convicted him of second degree depraved heart murder and involuntary manslaughter the court of special appeals ruled in january 2021 that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for involuntary manslaughter but a three judge panel overturned beckwitt s murder conviction the court of appeals said in its ruling that while his actions showed a wanton and reckless disregard for human life it wasn t the kind of conduct that was likely to have caused death and therefore didn t demonstrate an extreme indifference to the value of human life beckwitt will need to be resentenced now that the court of appeals has ruled he has been imprisoned since his april 2019 conviction khafra s father dia said the ruling by the state s high court is illustrative of a flawed judicial system he believes beckwitt s nine year prison sentence already was too lenient as a father who has lost his son at the tender age of 21 years in a most gruesome manner i m very very disappointed dia khafra added montgomery county state s attorney john mccarthy said beckwitt faces up to nine years in prison when he is resentenced mccarthy said his office will seek that maximum sentence to hold the defendant accountable for his blatant disregard for the life of khafra megan coleman one of beckwitt s lawyers said the sentencing guidelines are significantly lower for involuntary manslaughter than for a murder conviction both appellate courts have said that there was no malice in this case coleman said to us that would warrant a lower sentence khafra was burned beyond recognition in the fire at beckwitt s home in bethesda a maryland suburb of washington d c firefighters found khafra s naked charred body in the basement of the trash filled house prosecutors said the extreme hoarding conditions in the home prevented him from escaping at trial montgomery county prosecutor marybeth ayres said beckwitt sacrificed safety for secrecy and created the death trap conditions that prevented khafra from escaping the house defense attorney robert bonsib told jurors the fire was an accident not a crime the lawyer said beckwitt screamed for help from neighbors after the fire broke out and risked his own safety in a failed attempt to rescue his friend khafra met beckwitt online beckwitt had invested money in a company khafra was trying to launch as he helped beckwitt dig the network of tunnels a prosecutor described beckwitt as a skilled computer hacker who had a paranoid fixation on a possible nuclear attack by north korea beckwitt went to elaborate lengths to keep the project a secret prosecutors said he tried to trick khafra into thinking they were digging the tunnels in virginia instead of maryland by having him don blackout glasses before taking him on a long drive beckwitt also used internet spoofing to make it appear they were digging in virginia according to prosecutors khafra worked in the tunnels for days at a time eating and sleeping there and urinating and defecating into a bucket that beckwitt lowered down to him the tunnels had lights an air circulation system and a heater a hole in the concrete basement floor led to a shaft that dropped down 20 feet 6 meters into tunnels that branched out roughly 200 feet 60 meters in length investigators concluded the blaze was ignited by a defective electrical outlet in the basement beckwitt didn t testify at his trial copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
james cox the upcoming russian naval exercises off the irish coast are directly linked to the russian military build up on the ukrainian border according to a td and former head of the army ranger wing the artillery drills are due to take place at the start of february in international waters but within irish controlled airspace and the country s exclusive economic zone cathal berry who spent six years in the army ranger wing told breakingnews ie you might think it has nothing to do with it but it has everything to do with it they re pre positioning their pieces in preparation for the checkmate move that s what they re at and that s why they ve chosen this particular part of the world it s europe s back yard and they know that ireland is particularly exposed from a defence and security point of view so they ve exploited that the independent td added there are five domains when it comes to military operations land sea air cyber and space all domains are in play at the moment they re all connected the idea of a one dimensional land only incursion into another country that doesn t happen any more not in modern warfare all five domains are in play cyber security experts have warned that the disruption to undersea telecommunications cables by planned russian manoeuvres next week could be very significant mr berry said this is no coincidence these are very important underwater internet cables people think the cloud is in the sky but the cloud is actually at the bottom of the sea and they know that and it s like the umbilical cord between north american and europe if you severe that you re going to cause major issues for stock markets financial transactions the economy society everything basically that we take for granted while irish fishermen say they have been given a guarantee by the russian navy that their fishing will not be impacted taoiseach micheál martin said today that he would be worried about their safety mr berry echoed these sentiments even from the weather and the elements there can be issues if you put a large number of vessels into a small area even at nighttime any accidental collision can occur i won t say easily but anything is possible so they will need to be careful out there particularly if they re trawling their nets and there might be a submarine in the area they have to be very careful not to get it snagged mr berry said the defence forces have been under funded for decades leaving ireland vulnerable to situations like this one we ve become an exposed and vulnerable member of the european union and the russians have taken full advantage of that he said the commission on the defence forces is reporting this week the government will then for the next few weeks examine the findings come up with their own implementation plan and then we need to act and properly resource and fund our defence forces ireland is living in a house of straw and the wolf is knocking at the door while ireland is classed as a neutral country mr berry said that it does not currently have the necessary defence capabilities in place at the moment we re not a neutral country we re pretending to be a neutral country but we re not we don t meet the criteria we don t meet the obligations that a neutral country is meant to perform we need to recognise that being an independent sovereign country is a very important thing and we have to be prepared to protect it if you want to protect it you have to make sure you have the minimum credible deterrent when it comes to these types of activities off our coast and at the moment we don t have that and that s why we re suffering disproportionately because we ve under funded our defence capabilities so much over the last few decades he added we re all familiar with the story of the three little pigs ireland is living in a house of straw and the wolf is knocking at the door and we know what s happening next and we ve nobody but ourselves to blame we ve invited this onto us by being so ill prepared that they recognise this to be a blind spot and are taking full advantage mr berry compared the current situation to the hse cyberattack last summer which was believed to be the work of a russian hacker group known as wizard spider since the cyberattack the government has responded by committing more money to cyber security and appointing a new director for the national cyber security centre he said the uncertainty over the upcoming russian military exercises should prompt similar investment in the defence forces while the russian government claimed the february exercises were planned in advance mr berry believes this is unlikely if it was pre planned why didn t they inform us last year why did they only inform us last friday if you want to look at the evidence if it was pre planned months ago they could have informed us but they didn t and it wasn t mr berry said that there will be powerful war ships involved in the exercises and that other countries will be watching the activities closely it s about signalling and letting people know that russia can project power into europe s back yard
moscow russia said friday it will not start a war in ukraine but warned that the united states and nato have ignored its demands and left little room for compromise in the crisis president vladimir putin told french president emmanuel macron that the west has failed to consider russia s key conditions of halting further nato expansion stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near russian borders and rolling back its forces from eastern europe the kremlin said the us and nato formally rejected those demands this week although washington outlined areas where discussions are possible offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war amid the build up of more than 100 000 russian troops near ukraine despite that us president joe biden on thursday warned ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy that there is a distinct possibility that russia could take military action against the former soviet state in february russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans zelenskyy however sought to play down the war fears saying western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country s financial markets to cash out we don t need this panic he said at a news conference it cost ukrainians dearly putin told macron that moscow will study the us and nato response before deciding its next move according to a kremlin account of their call earlier in the day putin held a weekly meeting of his security council saying only that it would address foreign policy issues putin has made no public remarks about the western response but foreign minister sergey lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement while they say they won t change their positions we won t change ours lavrov told russian radio stations in a live interview i don t see any room for compromise here there won t be a war as far as it depends on the russian federation we don t want a war he added but we won t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored a senior biden administration official said the us welcomed lavrov s comments that russia does not war but this needs to be backed up with action we need to see russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the ukrainian border and taking other de escalatory steps the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly lavrov said the us suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate range missiles restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft he said that russia proposed discussing those issues years ago but washington and its allies never took them up on it until now while welcoming washington s offers on confidence building measures he argued they are secondary to russia s main concerns on nato he noted that international agreements say that the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others and that he would send letters to ask his western counterparts to explain their failure to respect that pledge it will be hard for them to wiggle out from answering why they aren t fulfilling the obligations sealed by their leaders not to strengthen their security at the expense of others he said referring to a document signed at a 1999 summit of the organization for security and cooperation in europe washington has warned moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades ukraine including penalties targeting top russian officials and key economic sectors asked about possible sanctions lavrov said moscow had warned washington that their introduction would amount to a complete severing of ties while moscow and the west are mulling their next steps nato said it was bolstering its deterrence in the baltic sea region and the us ordered 8 500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to europe russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern russia warplanes in kaliningrad on the baltic sea and dozens of warships in the black sea and the arctic russian troops have also headed to belarus for sweeping joint drills raising western fears that moscow could stage an attack on ukraine from the north the ukrainian capital is just 75 kilometers 50 miles from the border with belarus belarusian president alexander lukashenko said there will be no war unless belarus or russia come under attack and accused the west of trying to drown our slavic brotherhood in blood the leaders of some countries have gone mad they think they can win that war he said but there will be no victory we will all lose despite the alarming rhetoric ukrainian officials have repeatedly tried to project calm zelenskyy said the decision by the us britain australia germany and canada to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from kyiv was a mistake those were redundant steps that didn t help he said he argued that internal destabilization poses the greatest risk to the country he also bemoaned nato s failure to offer ukraine a roadmap to membership saying the alliance should state clearly if it doesn t plan to embrace ukraine and not offer vague promises you say openly that you will never accept us why talk about the future he said zelenskyy challenged the us warnings of an imminent russian attack insisting we aren t seeing any escalation bigger than before and charging that the russian troop concentration could be part of moscow s attempts to exert psychological pressure and sow panic ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov told parliament the number of russian troops near ukraine about 130 000 is comparable to moscow s military build up last spring when moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises we haven t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring with the exception of the deployment to belarus reznikov said ukraine already is beset by conflict following the 2014 ouster of a kremlin friendly president in kyiv moscow annexed ukraine s crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in the country s eastern industrial heartland fighting between ukrainian forces and russia backed rebels has killed over 14 000 people and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled during friday s call with macron putin spoke in favor of continuing talks about a stalled peace agreement for eastern ukraine among russia ukraine france and germany presidential envoys from the four countries met wednesday in paris and agreed to another meeting in berlin in two weeks a french official described the conversation between putin and macron as serious and respectful speaking about the necessity of de escalation the russian leader made no concessions according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the conversation

sir nicholas george winton who people affectionately called nicky was a stockbroker from the united kingdom he was a humble man who despite his financial success always had the heart to give to people that had been struck by difficulties in life for 50 years he never spoke of his heroism and the children never knew who saved them this is a story of a british banker who took a two week holiday to prague in 1938 in what was then czechoslovakia and left with over 669 jewish children saving them from inevitable death at the hands of the nazis in observation of the recent international holocaust remembrance day we bring to you an unsung holocaust hero that history books often leave out born to jewish parents he had always remembered where he came from as his parents were german jews who had moved to london the wintons originally the wertheims had changed their last name to fit in with british society in 1908 despite being a banker and a stockbroker he was known as an ardent socialist who did not support the appeasement strategies of former uk prime ministers ramsay macdonald stanley baldwin and neville chamberlain towards then nazi germany and fascist italy because of this he became close to prominent labor party members aneurin bevan jennie lee tom driberg and another socialist friend martin blake they would later be instrumental to the success of his rescue mission saving the jews from the holocaust later he would hear about jewish persecution in czechoslovakia which deeply concerned him refugee camps were reportedly ill supplied with people battling harsh winters and hunger in december 1938 he planned to go skiing in switzerland when his friend martin blake asked him to visit czechoslovakia where the instructional master had been working as part of the british committee for refugees from czechoslovakia this committee was created in response to the german prewar expansion where hitler had expanded germany by annexing austria and czechoslovakia this would later on be the cause of the start of world war ii he used his visit to the country in the most heroic way possible he tried to save the jewish children by forging documents from the british committee for refugees obtaining stationery from the committee and labeling the papers as the children s section of the committee later the committee was forced to integrate the made up section as winton s rescue plan was catching steam with martin blake trevor chadwick and beatrice wellington they set up the kindertransport rescue operation from the dining room table in a hotel situated in prague they then opened the applications from jewish parents in an attempt to get their children out before the war would eventually reach their country soon he returned to london to fix the legalities and logistics of the mission he wrote to both the british and american governments to help him with his rescue mission by taking in some of the jewish children sweden also agreed and took several children as refugees winton had written former us president franklin roosevelt to help and take in more jewish refugees the us embassy in london stated that they could not help in their current situation the british government supported the rescue only if he were to find families that were willing to take the jewish people in and find funding 50 pounds each for the children so that they could be returned to their country after the war while doing all these tasks he continued working at the stock exchange to fund the rescue mission while his mother helped him find homes for the children on the prague side chadwick and his team were working hard to evade detection by the nazis and arranged the transportation from prague to germany the netherlands and into the united kingdom dealing with secretly transporting jewish refugees through the heart of nazi germany was hard enough the dutch government was reportedly difficult as they officially closed their borders to jewish refugees and even searched for them within their borders and returned them to the nazis despite knowing what would eventually happen to them ultimately the children were transported out of the country through planes and trains where over 669 jewish children were saved he went on to serve in the red cross early in world war ii as a conscientious objector he would later reject his objector status and enlist in the royal air force raf where he was an aircraftman later he would be a sergeant and the end of the war would find him an acting pilot officer at the end of the war a holocaust hero in silence for over 50 years he would not tell about his heroic actions to anybody not even his wife in 1988 his wife grete found his personal scrapbook of all the jewish children he saved she then sent this scrapbook to a holocaust researcher elisabeth maxwell the wife of robert maxwell a czech born british media magnate who owned the daily mirror his story would then be publicized on an episode of the bbc program that s life in 1988 where the children he saved were members of the audience in 1983 he was made a member of the order of the british empire mbe for his work with the elderly in britain 2003 he was knighted by queen elizabeth recognizing his efforts from the kindertransport rescue operation he also received the pride of britain award for lifetime achievement during this time aside from these he was also awarded the british hero of the holocaust award by the british government in 2010 lastly he received the highest honor from the czech republic receiving the order of the white lion 1st class by czech president miloš zeman we know that sir nicholas winton is not the last holocaust hero we haven t heard of if you know of anyone share them with us and let s give them the thanks and honor they deserve
this canadian stock has analysts drooling over the next year after poor performance sent it in a downward spiral that is now starting to rise it might seem ridiculous these days to say a canadian stock will double but with so many companies down across the board the sales are endless yet today s market correction has motley fool investors nervous and they should be there has been a market correction in previously soaring industries so where should investors look one area would be good old fashion silver why not gold whereas gold has an arbitrary price attached to it silver has many uses it s used for solar power technology batteries 3d printing and even jet engines but there are many of these canadian stock companies to consider yet far fewer that bay street analysts believe will double this year here s one to consider if you re looking for a canadian stock to consider which of course you are then dig into fortuna silver mines tsx fvi nasdaq fsm fortuna explores extracts and processes base metals like silver in latin america the vacouver located company reported solid quarterly performance this month with production exceeding estimates fortuna stock reported 7 5 million ounces of silver produced for full year 2021 a 5 increase from 2020 as for gold production it was a 274 increase from the year before for next year the company believes it will still remain strong but decreased its 2022 projections to between 8 and 17 over 2021 furthermore the canadian stock has several exploration projects ongoing that could see more cash come in for the company what analysts say of last year s production 35 of silver produced came from the lindero mine which was impressive despite its strong year it has been a poor performing stock of course analysts weren t pleased that gold and silver produced would be below estimates for 2022 furthermore costs were above analyst estimates as well for the canadian stock fortuna stock is down 58 in the last year yet its near term growth profile coupled with strong free cash flow has analysts wondering why motley fool investors aren t picking up the stock part of this downward spiral came from the company s expensive acquisition in west africa which was then arbitraged before the deal was closed furthermore fortuna was denied environmental permits in san jose add on covid 19 and it certainly struggled this year so how will it double when it comes to a major downturn there s nothing like a solid rebound and that s exactly what analysts expect from this canadian stock performance reached record production in some cases during the last quarter and it s likely to continue with strong production during the next year even if below estimates now that fortuna has learned to work through covid 19 and not around it the next year we can look forward to solid production from lindero once more along with full production in yaramoko and construction in seguela that will equal even more growth in 2023 analysts say so yes the canadian stock fell far this year but with a strong year ahead analysts believe the stock could practically double in 2022 and if it gets back to 52 week highs the share price could more than triple as of writing
ambushed by a cake may not endure as long as marie antoinette s famous phrase but there was a similar let them eat cake tone deafness in the defense of british prime minister boris johnson from a member of parliament justifying johnson s attendance at his own birthday party in june 2020 right at the height of stringent lockdown rules johnson s government imposed had the bash been the prime minister s primary or only offense brits may have chalked it up to an awkward acceptance of a surprise party or just boris being boris but it wasn t a one off more like once a week like wine time fridays an example of recurring revelry requiring aides to traipse a suitcase to stock a 34 bottle wine refrigerator that was wheeled through the back door of no 10 downing street the prime minister s residence that s the iconic image of the british government in fact the festive infractions were so frequent they ve metastasized into a scandal now known as partygate fleet street tabloids have been quick to cover events like a christmas party at conservative party headquarters which reportedly included johnson seated by an aide draped in tinsel and another sporting a santa hat several other christmas cabinet staff and goodbye parties for departing staffers flouted lockdown rules most poignant and politically damaging was the news of two parties for departing colleagues on the eve of prince philip s funeral last year the next day a mourning queen elizabeth ii dressed in black right down to her mask sat alone observing the coronavirus crisis restrictions johnson had imposed the queen is symbolic but there are times when members of the royal family pick up themes somehow to epitomize what the country is going through said john roberts a nonresident senior fellow at the atlantic council speaking from the united kingdom roberts added that it s very rare but this was one of them and she epitomized what the country was going through and no 10 downing street did not what brits went through was much more restrictive than americans ordeal far more time away from work and sometimes something much more valuable time away from loved ones especially elders some of whom died without connecting with their friends and family at the end of their lives johnson s story has morphed from denial to defense that the illicit events were work related or that he was unsure of the very rules his government invoked whatever the events were they assault the spirit of the regulations said roberts and most he added would say he broke the regulations the second key component of the scandal is that it appears that johnson lied to parliament not shocking this is politics after all but roberts said that if proven it is an offense requiring resignation and proved it may be by an official inquiry led by sue gray a staid civil servant reflecting her name especially in contrast to the colorful johnson but in the most recent development there s also now a metropolitan police inquiry into whether any or many laws were broken and they ve requested minimal reference to events investigated to avoid any prejudice to our investigation which some critics believe may blunt the force of gray s findings and yet johnson just like the prime minister he replaced theresa may may still eventually face an intraparty vote of confidence from fellow tories he may not win or he may but like may in 2019 and margaret thatcher in 1990 he may survive but be weakened to the point of eventually resigning johnson s vote winning capacity was considerable roberts said but now there s the view that he might be a liability rather than an asset to the tory party the prime minister s diminution might be ascribed to hypocrisy in the u s but what bothers u k voters is less hypocrisy it s fairness said john watkins a professor of english at the university of minnesota watkins a former resident of frequent visitor to and keen expert on britain added that it is something so deep in british culture brits watkins said don t like people who don t play by the rules roberts concurred it s much more about fairness than it is about hypocrisy he said there was this tremendous sense at the beginning of the pandemic that we re all in this together countries continued roberts have their own opinion of what they stand for we have a belief in britain that we stand for fair play watkins said that there is a profound national cultural myth of shared sacrifice that goes back to the second world war that sense was revived during the pandemic including a radio revival of we ll meet again dame vera lynn s song about separation that became a wartime test of brits stiff upper lips and there were other wartime echoes like 100 year old veteran tom moore s inspirational daily walk to raise funds for the national health service for another example watkins recounted when germany s blitz targeted the grounds of buckingham palace neither king george vi nor queen elizabeth were hurt and later in a letter the queen wrote i am glad we have been bombed it makes me feel i can look the east end in the face which she did in tours of bombed out but not down and out london i keep coming back to that moment watkins said there is that sense that we re londoners too and we have that bond and think by the grace of god we re still alive and there was this sense that we are all in this together even the king and queen and suddenly you have boris sending out people to get more bottles of wine as he parties down in no 10 downing during lockdown and it just stinks however malodorous partygate probably won t bring disorder to the u s u k relationship which will remain special regardless of who lives at no 10 anyone who comes into office is going to continue to be a friend of the united states said roberts who added that this stands even if labor wins the next general election it s likely that britain s more forceful role in the russia ukraine crisis will continue too roberts credited key defense and foreign policy aides and not johnson for keeping their eye on the ball as the u k government differentiated itself from its previous partners in europe by its eagerness to send arms to ukraine as well as accuse the kremlin of plotting to install a puppet in kyiv the continental crisis regarding russia the unresolved brexit status with northern ireland chronic pandemic challenges and other issues make these serious times in the united kingdom to an increasing number of brits even those who backed the conservatives knowing its libertine leader would not be like the solid stolid john major or other more proper prime ministers boris johnson lacks the seriousness to match the challenges at minimum the partying is over whether the conservative party is over him remains to be seen john rash is a star tribune editorial writer and columnist the rash report can be heard at 8 10 a m fridays on wcco radio 830 am on twitter rashreport

continuous high inflation will put a damper on the world economy for the rest of 2022 according to a jan 28 reuters poll of 500 economists that covered 46 economies the analysts interviewed said they were trimming their global growth outlook due to worries of slowing demand and the risk that interest rates will rise too quickly many economists were blindsided by the surge in inflation along with the central banks and have downgraded their global growth forecasts due to the worsened outlook their previous assessments from three months ago assumed that inflation driven in part by the pandemic related supply crisis would be only transitory omicron has been hurting near term growth and putting persistent price pressures on consumers and businesses but economists remain optimistic that price pressures will ease by 2023 the global markets have been wildly fluctuating this week as central banks move their targets to try to manage inflation the federal reserve on jan 26 indicated that it is likely to hike interest rates in march and reaffirmed its plans to end its pandemic era bond purchases before massively reducing its asset holdings the federal funds rate which has been at a record low of 0 0 25 percent since the pandemic will be raised to moderate inflation the bank of england had already raised its interest rates on dec 16 and is expected to raise them again the bank of canada has said that it will maintain its policy rates for now but that it will likely be hiking them soon foreign investors are viewing communist china as a safe haven from inflation for 2022 as it sees robust foreign net inflows foreign investors are viewing communist china as a safe haven from inflation for 2022 as it sees robust foreign net inflows meanwhile central banks in smaller regional economies are depending on the fed to act while they combat the pandemic and their own economic problems in contrast it is expected that the european central bank and the bank of japan will not budge until the end of next year after they announced a more cautious change in policy the world economy is expected to slow to 4 3 percent in growth in 2022 after expanding 5 8 percent last year down from the previous 4 5 percent predicted in october the world economy is expected to slow to 4 3 percent in growth in 2022 after expanding 5 8 percent last year down from the previous 4 5 percent predicted in october growth is estimated to slow down further to 3 6 percent and 3 2 percent in 2023 and 2024 respectively mainly because of higher interest rates and costs of living while most countries foresee a reduction in growth for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant they expect it to rebound in the second quarter world markets dipped again friday as investors remain concerned about future signals from the central banks and amid rising tensions between nato and russia in one of the worst starts to a new year for stocks
court upholds man s conviction in fire above secret tunnels original publication date january 28 2022 2 36 pm maryland s highest court on friday upheld a wealthy stock trader s conviction on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the fiery death of a man who was helping him dig tunnels for a nuclear bunker under a home the maryland court of appeals ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support daniel beckwitt s conviction in the september 2017 death of 21 year old askia khafra beckwitt s failure to provide khafra with a reasonably safe workplace in the tunnels constituted gross negligence the appeals court said beckwitt s conduct was likely to result in harm to khafra at any moment and an ordinarily prudent person under similar circumstances would have been conscious of the risk to khafra the court s 76 page opinion says beckwitt was sentenced in 2019 to nine years in prison after a jury convicted him of second degree depraved heart murder and involuntary manslaughter the court of special appeals ruled in january 2021 that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for involuntary manslaughter but a three judge panel overturned beckwitt s murder conviction the court of appeals said in its ruling that while his actions showed a wanton and reckless disregard for human life it wasn t the kind of conduct that was likely to have caused death and therefore didn t demonstrate an extreme indifference to the value of human life beckwitt will need to be resentenced now that the court of appeals has ruled he has been imprisoned since his april 2019 conviction khafra s father dia said the ruling by the state s high court is illustrative of a flawed judicial system he believes beckwitt s nine year prison sentence already was too lenient as a father who has lost his son at the tender age of 21 years in a most gruesome manner i m very very disappointed dia khafra added montgomery county state s attorney john mccarthy said beckwitt faces up to nine years in prison when he is resentenced mccarthy said his office will seek that maximum sentence to hold the defendant accountable for his blatant disregard for the life of khafra megan coleman one of beckwitt s lawyers said the sentencing guidelines are significantly lower for involuntary manslaughter than for a murder conviction both appellate courts have said that there was no malice in this case coleman said to us that would warrant a lower sentence khafra was burned beyond recognition in the fire at beckwitt s home in bethesda a maryland suburb of washington d c firefighters found khafra s naked charred body in the basement of the trash filled house prosecutors said the extreme hoarding conditions in the home prevented him from escaping at trial montgomery county prosecutor marybeth ayres said beckwitt sacrificed safety for secrecy and created the death trap conditions that prevented khafra from escaping the house defense attorney robert bonsib told jurors the fire was an accident not a crime the lawyer said beckwitt screamed for help from neighbors after the fire broke out and risked his own safety in a failed attempt to rescue his friend khafra met beckwitt online beckwitt had invested money in a company khafra was trying to launch as he helped beckwitt dig the network of tunnels a prosecutor described beckwitt as a skilled computer hacker who had a paranoid fixation on a possible nuclear attack by north korea beckwitt went to elaborate lengths to keep the project a secret prosecutors said he tried to trick khafra into thinking they were digging the tunnels in virginia instead of maryland by having him don blackout glasses before taking him on a long drive beckwitt also used internet spoofing to make it appear they were digging in virginia according to prosecutors khafra worked in the tunnels for days at a time eating and sleeping there and urinating and defecating into a bucket that beckwitt lowered down to him the tunnels had lights an air circulation system and a heater a hole in the concrete basement floor led to a shaft that dropped down 20 feet 6 meters into tunnels that branched out roughly 200 feet 60 meters in length investigators concluded the blaze was ignited by a defective electrical outlet in the basement beckwitt didn t testify at his trial

those who acquired clarivate plc clarivate or the company nyse clvt clvt pa securities from february 26 2021 to december 27 2021 inclusive the class period investors have until march 25 2022 to apply to the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit clarivate is an information services and analytics company on october 1 2020 the company acquired 100 of the assets liabilities and equity interests of cpa global an intellectual property software and tech enabled services company before and after its acquisition of cpa global clarivate assured investors of the core effectiveness of its financial controls and procedures for example even after clarivate disclosed in april 2021 that it had a material weakness in its financial controls related to accounting for certain warrants issued in connection with a 2019 business combination the company specifically cabined the scope of that material weakness to its accounting for the warrants at issue while assuring investors that the remainder of its controls and procedures were effective on december 27 2021 clarivate disclosed in a filing with the u s securities and exchange commission sec that n december 22 2021 clarivate concluded that the financial statements previously issued as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 and the quarterly periods ended march 31 2021 june 30 2021 and september 30 2021 should no longer be relied upon because of an error in such financial statements specifically clarivate reported that he error relates to the treatment under u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap relating to an equity plan included in the cpa global business combination which was consummated on october 1 2020 the cpa global transaction and that n the affected financial statements certain awards made by cpa global under its equity plan were incorrectly included as part of the acquisition accounting for the cpa global transaction on this news clarivate s share price declined by 0 16 per share or approximately 0 65 from 24 74 per share on december 23 2021 to close at 24 58 per share on december 27 2021 later that same day an hour before market trading hours closed streetinsider com published an article on clarivate entitled clarivate plc clvt pt lowered to 29 at stifel on accounting error that article reported in relevant part that stifel analyst shlomo rosenbaum lowered the price target on clarivate to 29 00 from 32 00 following the company s disclosure that it discovered an accounting error related to equity awards that cpa global had issued under its equity plan that article quoted the stifel analyst who commented in relevant part that he timing of this discovery is poor less than a month after the prior cfo left though we are told that the items are not related and this error was discovered in the last week and that his error should not impact revenue adjusted ebitda or adjusted fcf but it is likely to impact the gaap ebitda and earnings and the reported fcf on this news clarivate s share price declined by 1 70 per share or approximately 6 92 from 24 58 per share to close at 22 88 per share on december 28 2021 a total decline of 1 86 per share or approximately 7 52 over two consecutive trading days the lawsuit alleges throughout the class period that made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that 1 clarivate maintained defective disclosure controls and procedures as a result of a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting 2 the foregoing material weakness was not limited to how the company accounted for warrants 3 as a result clarivate failed to properly account for an equity plan included in its acquisition of cpa global 4 accordingly the company was reasonably likely to restate one or more of its previously issued financial statements following its acquisition of cpa global and 5 as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times if you purchased or otherwise acquired clarivate

state and local governments lost at least 117 billion of expected revenue early in the pandemic according to an associated press analysis but many are now awash in record amounts of money boosted partly by federal aid in response to the dramatic turnaround governors lawmakers and local officials have proposed a surge in spending as well as a new wave of tax cuts the ultimate effect of the pandemic was a net positive said stephen parker assistant city manager for the los angeles suburb of upland where sales tax revenues are soaring isn t that unbelievable it s just crazy to think of that upland a city of 79 000 was representative of many cities at the outset of the pandemic it reported an estimated loss of nearly 6 1 million in 2020 the result of a steep but short lived national recession and what parker describes as a generous treasury department method for calculating losses that figure was the median amount among more than 900 cities that reported their revenues to the department under the american rescue plan act upland s financial situation turned around even before the end of 2020 parker said federal covid 19 stimulus checks played a role so did a shift in consumer spending to goods instead of services that lifted city revenues parker said because services often are exempt from sales taxes while goods are not the pandemic relief law championed by democrats and signed by president joe biden last march included 350 billion in aid to states and local governments the treasury department required states counties and larger cities to file reports last year detailing their initial plans for the money those governments also were asked to estimate their losses for 2020 by comparing actual revenue to expected revenue under a treasury formula though revenue figures were left blank by nearly one quarter of the roughly 3 700 governments that filed reports the data nonetheless provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the financial strain on governments during the pandemic s first year more than two thirds of state and local governments reported at least some losses ranging from a few thousand dollars in some rural counties to more than 12 billion for the state of texas according to the ap s analysis the total was 117 5 billion the treasury department last october declined an ap request to release the revenue loss data under the federal freedom of information act saying it would be publicly available later it recently posted the data on its website the next reports are due monday for some governments and april 30 for others loading notes actual general revenue actual general revenue as of 12 months ended december 31 2020 base year revenue for the most recent fiscal year prior to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic for most governments that meant their base year was the 2019 fiscal year estimated loss estimated revenue loss due to covid 19 public health emergency as of december 31 2020 funds allocation explanation of how revenue replacement funds were allocated recovery funds for pension whether fiscal recovery funds used to make a deposit into a pension fund the report for north carolina lists its 2020 revenue as 26 6 trillion and its base year revenue as 24 8 trillion ap confirmed with the state that these figures were intended to be shown as billions not trillions and ap has updated the data accordingly there are 28 entities for which there appear to be data entry errors in the base year revenues these entities show base year revenues of 2 016 or 2 019 or 2 020 it appears likely that these were intended to be base years of 2016 2019 or 2020 but got entered into the wrong field the department used lost revenue to determine how much flexibility to give governments in spending the aid under guidelines issued last may governments that showed a loss were free to spend an equal amount on almost any government services including roads and other projects not otherwise allowed under the rules a final rule released earlier this month expanded that flexibility by allowing governments to claim up to 10 million of revenue losses even if actual losses were less upland which is getting 15 million plans to use part of its flexible spending to repave parking lots and repair hundreds of sections of sidewalks that might not otherwise have been eligible federal assistance was not the only factor that helped governments bounce back financial analysts also cite inflation which pushed up prices and bolstered sales tax collections many consumers also had more to spend because of the stimulus checks a strong stock market drove up capital gains taxes and an early pandemic rise in unemployment spared many higher earners who shifted to working from home while continuing to pay income taxes in many places the revenue rebound exceeded pre pandemic levels total state tax revenues from last april through november rose 20 compared to the same period in 2019 according to an urban institute report released earlier this month for governments that already were financially strained the pandemic deepened their losses but also resulted in a cash windfall the hudson river valley city of poughkeepsie was rated by the new york comptroller as the state s most financially stressed community in 2020 with a pre pandemic deficit around 7 million and no reserves the city quickly cut spending sold property froze hiring and instituted an early retirement program in a desperate effort to close the gap when the pandemic began city administrator marc nelson said the city reported a 2020 revenue loss of nearly 4 5 million under the treasury department s formula it s getting more than 20 million from the american rescue plan though the relief money cannot be used to wipe out the deficit the city plans to make major improvements to parks and swimming pools including a complete rebuild of a run down bathhouse that has been relying on portable toilets these are things that would not have been within the city s ability to take on were it not for the covid relief money nelson said though they re spending the federal aid some republican officials insist it was unnecessary in light of the rapidly rebounding tax revenues missouri reported an estimated 900 million loss for 2020 but ended its 2021 fiscal year with a record cash balance republican gov mike parson recently proposed a 47 billion budget that is up nearly one third over the current year because of surging federal and state revenues he wants to spend more on infrastructure and public employee salaries while also saving more when other states will be using federal dollars to fill spending gaps and budget shortfalls we will be making investments in the future he said in his state of the state address in some cases government losses weren t as severe as the treasury numbers might suggest greer county in rural southwest oklahoma reported a 2020 revenue loss of 363 630 around the national median for counties reporting their revenues that comprised 10 of the county s expected revenue under the treasury department formula but it didn t prompt budget cuts county clerk tiffany buchanan said the county didn t feel that much of a loss buchanan said explaining we live on a very tight strict budget as it is the county plans to use some of its 1 1 million from the american rescue plan to help fund the sheriff s office and pay emergency medical personnel some states including california and texas projected large revenue losses at the outset of the pandemic but have since posted big gains when it passed a budget early in the pandemic california had expected the recession to cause a 54 billion deficit that led officials to defer payments to schools and community colleges and to reduce state employee pay according to the state s treasury report now california is projecting a nearly 46 billion surplus spurred by record tax collections leaving officials searching for ways to use the money gov gavin newsom recently proposed a budget that would expand health coverage to all low income adults living in the state illegally while simultaneously cutting taxes the democratic governor also said a substantial tax rebate was likely in order i will be holding the governor s feet to the fire and keep him at his word to refund surplus dollars to the taxpayers gop state sen melissa

tech tycoon mike lynch has lost the uk s biggest civil fraud claim in a battle with us giant hewlett packard over his former company autonomy the 3 7 billion defeat makes it more likely the scandal hit entrepreneur will now be extradited to the us where he faces more than a dozen charges a high court judge yesterday ruled that dr lynch masterminded an elaborate scheme to cook autonomy s books before it was sold to hp in 2011 for 8 3 billion hp was forced to write down the value of the company by 6 8 billion a few months later tech tycoon mike lynch has lost the uk s biggest civil fraud claim in a battle with us giant hewlett packard over his former company autonomy the judgment was delivered hours before priti patel was due to decide whether to extradite dr lynch the home secretary had until midnight to make a decision dr lynch 56 could spend up to 20 years in prison if he is found guilty in the us he denies all the charges against him and claims hp failed to do proper research when it bought autonomy dr lynch s team has called for the extradition to be blocked on grounds that the claims against him mostly concern actions in the uk and must be dealt with by the british justice system his team has also argued he could suffer inhumane conditions that would take a severe toll on his health if he was transferred but lawyers for the us government say he aimed dishonest activities at the us on a monumental scale and should not be immune from the american justice system if miss patel agrees to extradite dr lynch he would have 14 days to appeal which could lead to another lengthy court process it is a dramatic fall from grace for the uk s most successful tech entrepreneur who was previously dubbed britain s answer to bill gates hp now hewlett packard enterprise sued dr lynch and autonomy s former finance boss sushovan hussain for 3 7 billion hussain was convicted in the us in 2019 and jailed for five years he has subsequently lost an appeal against that conviction yesterday s ruling is the latest stage in a ten year legal wrangle over who was to blame for the disastrous takeover which cost hp s shareholders billions of pounds kelwin nicholls of law firm clifford chance representing dr lynch said he was already planning to appeal against the civil ruling mr nicholls said today s outcome is disappointing and dr lynch intends to appeal we will study the full judgment over the coming weeks we note the judge s concerns over the reliability of some of hp s witnesses the judge said hp had substantially succeeded in its various claims against the two men but added that the company was likely to receive substantially less than the 3 7 billion it claimed in damages justice robert hildyard said dr lynch was aware that autonomy was engaged in dishonest practices and its accounts were false the judgment was delivered hours before priti patel was due to decide whether to extradite dr lynch the married father of two turned ground breaking research made during his phd at cambridge university into the foundation of autonomy which became a ftse 100 listed company the civil judgment was not expected to be released yesterday its outcome is a particularly hard blow for dr lynch as he had been hoping it would exonerate him and increase his chances of miss patel ruling in his favour the home secretary was supposed to decide on dr lynch s fate last year but requested an extension until march specifically so she could consider the outcome of the case she was refused the extension but dr lynch launched his own appeal a judge ruled against the extension earlier this week but yesterday s surprise announcement meant miss patel could take it into account
state and local governments lost at least 117 billion of expected revenue early in the pandemic according to an associated press analysis but many are now awash in record amounts of money boosted partly by federal aid in response to the dramatic turnaround governors lawmakers and local officials have proposed a surge in spending as well as a new wave of tax cuts the ultimate effect of the pandemic was a net positive said stephen parker assistant city manager for the los angeles suburb of upland where sales tax revenues are soaring isn t that unbelievable it s just crazy to think of that upland a city of 79 000 was representative of many cities at the outset of the pandemic it reported an estimated loss of nearly 6 1 million in 2020 the result of a steep but short lived national recession and what parker describes as a generous treasury department method for calculating losses that figure was the median amount among more than 900 cities that reported their revenues to the department under the american rescue plan act upland s financial situation turned around even before the end of 2020 parker said federal covid 19 stimulus checks played a role so did a shift in consumer spending to goods instead of services that lifted city revenues parker said because services often are exempt from sales taxes while goods are not the pandemic relief law championed by democrats and signed by president joe biden last march included 350 billion in aid to states and local governments the treasury department required states counties and larger cities to file reports last year detailing their initial plans for the money those governments also were asked to estimate their losses for 2020 by comparing actual revenue to expected revenue under a treasury formula though revenue figures were left blank by nearly one quarter of the roughly 3 700 governments that filed reports the data nonetheless provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the financial strain on governments during the pandemic s first year more than two thirds of state and local governments reported at least some losses ranging from a few thousand dollars in some rural counties to more than 12 billion for the state of texas according to the ap s analysis the total was 117 5 billion the treasury department last october declined an ap request to release the revenue loss data under the federal freedom of information act saying it would be publicly available later it recently posted the data on its website the next reports are due monday for some governments and april 30 for others loading notes actual general revenue actual general revenue as of 12 months ended december 31 2020 base year revenue for the most recent fiscal year prior to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic for most governments that meant their base year was the 2019 fiscal year estimated loss estimated revenue loss due to covid 19 public health emergency as of december 31 2020 funds allocation explanation of how revenue replacement funds were allocated recovery funds for pension whether fiscal recovery funds used to make a deposit into a pension fund the report for north carolina lists its 2020 revenue as 26 6 trillion and its base year revenue as 24 8 trillion ap confirmed with the state that these figures were intended to be shown as billions not trillions and ap has updated the data accordingly there are 28 entities for which there appear to be data entry errors in the base year revenues these entities show base year revenues of 2 016 or 2 019 or 2 020 it appears likely that these were intended to be base years of 2016 2019 or 2020 but got entered into the wrong field the department used lost revenue to determine how much flexibility to give governments in spending the aid under guidelines issued last may governments that showed a loss were free to spend an equal amount on almost any government services including roads and other projects not otherwise allowed under the rules a final rule released earlier this month expanded that flexibility by allowing governments to claim up to 10 million of revenue losses even if actual losses were less upland which is getting 15 million plans to use part of its flexible spending to repave parking lots and repair hundreds of sections of sidewalks that might not otherwise have been eligible federal assistance was not the only factor that helped governments bounce back financial analysts also cite inflation which pushed up prices and bolstered sales tax collections many consumers also had more to spend because of the stimulus checks a strong stock market drove up capital gains taxes and an early pandemic rise in unemployment spared many higher earners who shifted to working from home while continuing to pay income taxes in many places the revenue rebound exceeded pre pandemic levels total state tax revenues from last april through november rose 20 compared to the same period in 2019 according to an urban institute report released earlier this month for governments that already were financially strained the pandemic deepened their losses but also resulted in a cash windfall the hudson river valley city of poughkeepsie was rated by the new york comptroller as the state s most financially stressed community in 2020 with a pre pandemic deficit around 7 million and no reserves the city quickly cut spending sold property froze hiring and instituted an early retirement program in a desperate effort to close the gap when the pandemic began city administrator marc nelson said the city reported a 2020 revenue loss of nearly 4 5 million under the treasury department s formula it s getting more than 20 million from the american rescue plan though the relief money cannot be used to wipe out the deficit the city plans to make major improvements to parks and swimming pools including a complete rebuild of a run down bathhouse that has been relying on portable toilets these are things that would not have been within the city s ability to take on were it not for the covid relief money nelson said though they re spending the federal aid some republican officials insist it was unnecessary in light of the rapidly rebounding tax revenues missouri reported an estimated 900 million loss for 2020 but ended its 2021 fiscal year with a record cash balance republican gov mike parson recently proposed a 47 billion budget that is up nearly one third over the current year because of surging federal and state revenues he wants to spend more on infrastructure and public employee salaries while also saving more when other states will be using federal dollars to fill spending gaps and budget shortfalls we will be making investments in the future he said in his state of the state address in some cases government losses weren t as severe as the treasury numbers might suggest greer county in rural southwest oklahoma reported a 2020 revenue loss of 363 630 around the national median for counties reporting their revenues that comprised 10 of the county s expected revenue under the treasury department formula but it didn t prompt budget cuts county clerk tiffany buchanan said the county didn t feel that much of a loss buchanan said explaining we live on a very tight strict budget as it is the county plans to use some of its 1 1 million from the american rescue plan to help fund the sheriff s office and pay emergency medical personnel some states including california and texas projected large revenue losses at the outset of the pandemic but have since posted big gains when it passed a budget early in the pandemic california had expected the recession to cause a 54 billion deficit that led officials to defer payments to schools and community colleges and to reduce state employee pay according to the state s treasury report now california is projecting a nearly 46 billion surplus spurred by record tax collections leaving officials searching for ways to use the money gov gavin newsom recently proposed a budget that would expand health coverage to all low income adults living in the state illegally while simultaneously cutting taxes the democratic governor also said a substantial tax rebate was likely in order i will be holding the governor s feet to the fire and keep him at his word to refund surplus dollars to the taxpayers gop state sen melissa

america is still a land of opportunity where conservative principles of faith and personal responsibility can help hispanic immigrants go from rags to riches according to a new autobiographical self help book by author david morales mr morales who grew up in a poor mountainous region of puerto rico before moving to massachusetts at age 11 argues in american familia a memoir of perseverance river grove books that the conservative principles of resilience perseverance and grit in hispanic culture are essential to immigrants succeeding in the u s if they want to move beyond the government dependent status quo of their countries of origins we have to understand that we ve come to the greatest country on the planet and we need to learn its history as a capitalist country that lets us keep what we earn mr morales said why would you want to replicate here what didn t work in the countries you re leaving the 46 year old political independent said he first encountered the democratic party s narrative about hispanics when his parents emigrated in 1986 to lynn a suburb three miles north of boston there s a certain narrative around hispanics that says we are genderless latinx poor victims who need government programs and all hispanics are the same mr morales said but we re not monolithic democrat or republican voters we need an opportunity to compete an understanding of how the system works and wisdom about how to spend our money but his parents ignored that narrative and taught him the value of hard work by working two to three jobs themselves his father as a machinist and his mother as an english as a second language esl teacher in addition to odd jobs he got his first job at 14 as the stock clerk in a local convenience store later he worked as a summer camp counselor it was all about contributing to the house because we all had to earn our keep mr morales said my father let me keep a small amount but most of it went to paying the bills in college he said his conservative principles were reinforced by meeting more white people from his income bracket a lot of the rhetoric in the public schools i attended was white people vs us but then in college i met low income white people who had more in common with me than wealthy black and hispanic kids mr morales said i learned that income trumps race and ethnicity he worked after college as an esl teacher and then as a budget analyst for the massachusetts house ways and means committee where he advised elected officials from both political parties on the state s medicaid budget in 2001 he married his high school sweetheart samanda an immigrant from the dominican republic then he started work as a health care executive mr morales a devout christian said he credits his success in america to three principles judeo christian values family and grit you have to want to do better for yourself mr morales said no matter what your color income or circumstances this is the only country in the world where you can go from zero to success in 2019 he co founded the nonprofit ahora inc to teach financial budgeting and investing to fellow hispanics hoping to pass along some of the lessons he d learned today he is chairman of the board the first half of my life was motivated by fear of poverty mr morales said i wanted to buy my parents a home buy a nice house for myself and get my kids to the right place in life during the second half of my life i want to give back now he strives to teach the same values to his teenage sons we hispanics are workers who thrive when we work mr morales said but we can either choose to listen to the narrative or we can have faith family grit and perseverance sean salai can be reached at ssalai washingtontimes com

editor s note this article was published first at illinois policy institute illinois economy was shaken by the covid 19 pandemic but 2021 was supposed to be a year of recovery unfortunately the policy climate continues to be the state s biggest liability despite high vaccination rates great natural endowments a talented workforce a large financial sector and a growing tech industry while illinois boasts a younger more highly skilled population with fewer early retirees than most states illinoisans have been sluggish to get back to work in fact most of the united states employment recovery was concentrated in a few states texas arizona utah and idaho are the only states to surpass pre pandemic job levels as of december 2021 with fewer regulations lower taxes and better overall governance the combination of sluggish job creation and the lack of urgency to re open schools for in person learning kept parents especially mothers out of the labor force on the demand side stricter than average covid 19 restrictions in illinois kept economic activity suppressed for longer and caused job openings to lag relative to the rest of the country the lack of opportunity and the decline in economic freedom pushed many residents out of illinois exacerbating years of population decline meanwhile some states less regulated states with lower taxes experienced rapid population growth which fueled housing demand job creation and rapid economic recovery now as more and more states are approaching a full recovery from the economic shock of the pandemic illinois is left to grapple with a very serious issue the state s economic potential is now lower in wake of the covid 19 downturn and accelerating population decline illinois economy is currently 31 4 billion smaller than where it would have been without population losses population decline was already contributing to lower economic growth for illinois but as covid 19 and government shutdowns wreaked havoc on the state s economy population loss has continued to accelerate the combination now likely means that the state s economic potential has declined population loss remains illinois biggest challenge 2021 marked the eighth consecutive year of population decline for illinois west virginia is the only state with a longer history of a shrinking population currently suffering nine consecutive years of population decline according to the u s census bureau between 2013 and 2018 illinois population fell by 1 33 or 34 219 fewer residents each year on average in the last three years population worsened with illinois shrinking by another 1 97 which amounts to roughly 83 644 fewer residents each year on average the state s precipitous population decline is due solely to domestic outmigration population losses restrained housing appreciation and hurt economic growth the opportunity to build wealth through homeownership often a family s largest asset is among the leading reasons why illinoisans have left the state while housing prices in illinois surged 11 4 in 2021 the state s experience was a far cry away from the 18 4 appreciation on average in most of the country across the country homes appreciated rapidly last year as a result of housing demand increasing during the pandemic policy stimulus ultra low interest rates and government checks helped to improve households balance sheets and stimulate housing demand the need for space and the shift to work from home due to government lockdowns resulted in higher appreciation for houses when compared to condos and apartments some states benefited more than others as population growth in those states fueled demand for housing job creation and economic growth in 2021 home prices were boosted even higher due to issues with the supply of housing new construction was sluggish before the pandemic and lagging demand the pandemic only exacerbated pre existing issues due to labor shortages and rising material costs while rising demand and short supply of new housing units contributed to higher prices across the country housing demand increased less in illinois mostly due to population losses resulting in lower appreciation in home prices the importance of housing market valuations cannot be overstated this is because changes in housing prices have a larger impact on consumer spending and thus on the economy at large than changes in stock market prices since housing is often a family s most valuable asset a decline in the value of housing causes individuals to feel less wealthy as a result they reduce their consumption this is what is referred to as the wealth effect in addition to the wealth effect a sudden and unexpected decline in housing values would reduce the incentive to build fewer construction projects would reduce employment in the construction and real estate industries lowering economic output because of how sensitive the broader economy is to housing valuations the real estate market is vital to a state s economic wellbeing the historically persistent lower housing appreciation in illinois means lower increases in consumer spending less new construction less job creation and lower wage growth population losses reduced illinois workforce population loss means aggregate employment will likely remain permanently lower than pre pandemic levels as of december 2021 illinois was still missing 4 0 of its pre pandemic employment level this is compared to 2 8 on average across the country in fact of all midwestern states only michigan and north dakota are missing more jobs than illinois meanwhile utah idaho texas and arizona have all surpassed pre pandemic employment levels and montana is missing a mere 100 jobs relative to february 2020 illinois results are unsurprising since relative to the size of its unemployed population illinois created fewer new job openings than most making finding a job harder in illinois than nearly every other state in the nation from january to october 2021 there were 0 8 vacant jobs per illinois job seeker on average each month according to the bureau of labor statistics job openings and labor turnover survey jolts when compared to 1 1 per job seeker across the country perhaps even worse for illinois labor market is that public policy wreaked havoc on the state s labor supply reducing both the quantity and quality of potential workers more generous extended unemployment benefits with no job search requirements for most of 2021 a sluggish return to in person learning and a growing skills gap among black workers those disproportionately hurt by covid 19 job loss all acted to reduce labor supply in most states younger americans who left the labor force during the pandemic are expected to return however population loss in illinois especially among working age illinoisans suggests that even if early retirees return to work aggregate employment will not return to its pre pandemic level illinois lackluster performance will also cause economic disparities to persist the effects of the covid 19 pandemic and state mandated lockdowns have served to widen pre existing racial gaps in illinois which were already more severe than the rest of the nation now relatively fewer labor market opportunities in illinois will make closing racial gaps in employment more difficult the end result illinois economy is smaller the decline in home price appreciation labor force and available jobs ultimately culminate in a massive loss for the state s economy the sum of these losses is an economy that is 31 4 billion smaller due to population loss economic growth is measured by changes in a state s gross domestic product gdp a measure of economic output which can be deconstructed into its population and economic elements expressed as percentage changes economic growth is equal to population growth plus growth in each worker s contributions toward gdp or economic productivity in other words without substantial increases in productivity declining population growth will lead to lower economic growth as a result illinoisans will continue to experience weaker improvements in living standards see fewer job opportunities and lower wage growth addressing the population challenge means stomping out corruption lowering costs and improving services in order to attract workers from other states illinois has model states that have historically been successful at attracting talent state and local government policies seem to be driving americans return to the workforce more affordable and business friendly states are near or above pre pandemic employment levels red tape kills job creation taxation and spending policies also play a factor as well support from the federal government meant most states finances recovered quickly eleven states including arizona iowa new hampshire missouri montana and wisconsin reformed their income tax systems to reduce residents overall tax burden they cut taxes to provide relief for residents and to jump start their economies but illinois was constrained by public employee retirement costs in fact despite 8 1 billion in federal aid in 2021 illinois raised taxes on the state s most vulnerable residents during the pandemic the latest state budget introduced 655 million worth of new taxes and fees and part of the tax increase included raises and higher office allowances for the lawmakers who voted to approve the governor s budget meanwhile during this same legislative session illinois lawmakers voted to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would permanently raise the cost of government services illinois already has some of the most unfair laws in the region when it comes to negotiating with government worker unions that in turn drives up the cost of government services senate joint resolution constitutional amendment 11 would make this unfair power dynamic permanent this because the amendment would permanently allow government unions to negotiate anything and everything into their collective bargaining agreements not just wages and workplace benefits giving most public sector workers the right to go on strike for just about any reason in the case of police unions it could also mean limits on the investigation of officers after alleged wrongdoing and the destruction of disciplinary records in the case of teachers unions although union bosses claim protecting students is their top priority unions can be a roadblock to investigating teachers accused of misconduct of course this should come as no surprise because 15 1 million flowed from unions to lawmakers who voted for the measure unfortunately this is yet another reason to expect that the quality of government services will continue to deteriorate history shows why enshrining government union power in the illinois constitution is dangerous in 1970 government unions succeeded at enshrining pension protections in the state s constitution the result the worst pension crisis in the nation the state has increased pension spending by more than 533 during the past 20 years adjusting for inflation health insurance spending has gone up 127 as pension debt continues to increase so do required pension contributions pension contributions now consume 26 5 of the state s general funds budget up from less than 4 during 1990 to 1997 as pension costs capture an increasing share of the state s budget the state raises taxes while forgoing desperately needed public investments the estimated total cost of pensions had soared to nearly 28 billion on average each year in forgone income and direct payments to the pension systems by 2017 at the local level property taxes go up and yet an increasing share of municipal budgets go to pensions instead of key services and new public investments from 1996 to 2016 illinois property taxpayers sent an additional 396 million to police departments but pensions consumed a vast majority of these funds statewide 81 cents of every additional property tax dollar for police departments more than 320 million went to pensions rather than police protection services the same held true for fire departments which levied an additional 260 million in property taxes from 1996 to 2016 most of that money went to pensions statewide 78 cents of every additional property tax dollar for municipal fire departments more than 200 million went to pensions rather than fire protection services unfortunately gov j b pritzker has proposed tax increases in every state budget during his tenure and has given in to government union leaders every demand as government unions demands increased the cost of government increased for illinoisans even as services decreased as a result population losses accelerated turning the state around will require the legislature to put a pension reform constitutional amendment on the ballot so future state and local expenditures can finally prioritize spending on education and social services for those in need pension reform will make government work for all illinoisans that s the first step toward reversing illinois population decline

state and local governments lost at least 117 billion of expected revenue early in the pandemic according to an associated press analysis but many are now awash in record amounts of money boosted partly by federal aid in response to the dramatic turnaround governors lawmakers and local officials have proposed a surge in spending as well as a new wave of tax cuts the ultimate effect of the pandemic was a net positive said stephen parker assistant city manager for the los angeles suburb of upland where sales tax revenues are soaring isn t that unbelievable it s just crazy to think of that upland a city of 79 000 was representative of many cities at the outset of the pandemic it reported an estimated loss of nearly 6 1 million in 2020 the result of a steep but short lived national recession and what parker describes as a generous treasury department method for calculating losses that figure was the median amount among more than 900 cities that reported their revenues to the department under the american rescue plan act upland s financial situation turned around even before the end of 2020 parker said federal covid 19 stimulus checks played a role so did a shift in consumer spending to goods instead of services that lifted city revenues parker said because services often are exempt from sales taxes while goods are not the pandemic relief law championed by democrats and signed by president joe biden last march included 350 billion in aid to states and local governments the treasury department required states counties and larger cities to file reports last year detailing their initial plans for the money those governments also were asked to estimate their losses for 2020 by comparing actual revenue to expected revenue under a treasury formula though revenue figures were left blank by nearly one quarter of the roughly 3 700 governments that filed reports the data nonetheless provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the financial strain on governments during the pandemic s first year more than two thirds of state and local governments reported at least some losses ranging from a few thousand dollars in some rural counties to more than 12 billion for the state of texas according to the ap s analysis the total was 117 5 billion the treasury department last october declined an ap request to release the revenue loss data under the federal freedom of information act saying it would be publicly available later it recently posted the data on its website the next reports are due monday for some governments and april 30 for others loading notes actual general revenue actual general revenue as of 12 months ended december 31 2020 base year revenue for the most recent fiscal year prior to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic for most governments that meant their base year was the 2019 fiscal year estimated loss estimated revenue loss due to covid 19 public health emergency as of december 31 2020 funds allocation explanation of how revenue replacement funds were allocated recovery funds for pension whether fiscal recovery funds used to make a deposit into a pension fund the report for north carolina lists its 2020 revenue as 26 6 trillion and its base year revenue as 24 8 trillion ap confirmed with the state that these figures were intended to be shown as billions not trillions and ap has updated the data accordingly there are 28 entities for which there appear to be data entry errors in the base year revenues these entities show base year revenues of 2 016 or 2 019 or 2 020 it appears likely that these were intended to be base years of 2016 2019 or 2020 but got entered into the wrong field the department used lost revenue to determine how much flexibility to give governments in spending the aid under guidelines issued last may governments that showed a loss were free to spend an equal amount on almost any government services including roads and other projects not otherwise allowed under the rules a final rule released earlier this month expanded that flexibility by allowing governments to claim up to 10 million of revenue losses even if actual losses were less upland which is getting 15 million plans to use part of its flexible spending to repave parking lots and repair hundreds of sections of sidewalks that might not otherwise have been eligible federal assistance was not the only factor that helped governments bounce back financial analysts also cite inflation which pushed up prices and bolstered sales tax collections many consumers also had more to spend because of the stimulus checks a strong stock market drove up capital gains taxes and an early pandemic rise in unemployment spared many higher earners who shifted to working from home while continuing to pay income taxes in many places the revenue rebound exceeded pre pandemic levels total state tax revenues from last april through november rose 20 compared to the same period in 2019 according to an urban institute report released earlier this month for governments that already were financially strained the pandemic deepened their losses but also resulted in a cash windfall the hudson river valley city of poughkeepsie was rated by the new york comptroller as the state s most financially stressed community in 2020 with a pre pandemic deficit around 7 million and no reserves the city quickly cut spending sold property froze hiring and instituted an early retirement program in a desperate effort to close the gap when the pandemic began city administrator marc nelson said the city reported a 2020 revenue loss of nearly 4 5 million under the treasury department s formula it s getting more than 20 million from the american rescue plan though the relief money cannot be used to wipe out the deficit the city plans to make major improvements to parks and swimming pools including a complete rebuild of a run down bathhouse that has been relying on portable toilets these are things that would not have been within the city s ability to take on were it not for the covid relief money nelson said though they re spending the federal aid some republican officials insist it was unnecessary in light of the rapidly rebounding tax revenues missouri reported an estimated 900 million loss for 2020 but ended its 2021 fiscal year with a record cash balance republican gov mike parson recently proposed a 47 billion budget that is up nearly one third over the current year because of surging federal and state revenues he wants to spend more on infrastructure and public employee salaries while also saving more when other states will be using federal dollars to fill spending gaps and budget shortfalls we will be making investments in the future he said in his state of the state address in some cases government losses weren t as severe as the treasury numbers might suggest greer county in rural southwest oklahoma reported a 2020 revenue loss of 363 630 around the national median for counties reporting their revenues that comprised 10 of the county s expected revenue under the treasury department formula but it didn t prompt budget cuts county clerk tiffany buchanan said the county didn t feel that much of a loss buchanan said explaining we live on a very tight strict budget as it is the county plans to use some of its 1 1 million from the american rescue plan to help fund the sheriff s office and pay emergency medical personnel some states including california and texas projected large revenue losses at the outset of the pandemic but have since posted big gains when it passed a budget early in the pandemic california had expected the recession to cause a 54 billion deficit that led officials to defer payments to schools and community colleges and to reduce state employee pay according to the state s treasury report now california is projecting a nearly 46 billion surplus spurred by record tax collections leaving officials searching for ways to use the money gov gavin newsom recently proposed a budget that would expand health coverage to all low income adults living in the state illegally while simultaneously cutting taxes the democratic governor also said a substantial tax rebate was likely in order i will be holding the governor s feet to the fire and keep him at his word to refund surplus dollars to the taxpayers gop state sen melissa

greg berry there s no doubt that the current economy has been really struggling due to all of the supply chain issues that have stemmed from covid 19 inflation is everywhere vehicles and groceries that consumers want and need are out of stock and a lot of businesses are having a really tough time sourcing the materials they need to create their products it s been a very difficult situation for many but there has been one saving grace amidst it all government auctions a municipality s unneeded item is another person s treasure cities public schools police and fire departments schools and other agencies are all currently auctioning off their surplus vehicles heavy equipment tech gadgets and more directly to the public they are using websites like the municibid online government auction marketplace to ensure they get the full value and more for their surplus items these auctions are also helping members of the public get fantastic deals on products they are struggling to find at the moment due to all of the supply chain issues plaguing society need a car or other vehicle police fire department auctions are key so many consumers and business owners are looking for used vehicles to purchase but right now there is a limited supply available at dealerships government auctions are here to save the day police departments use government auctions to sell their forfeitures or seized items which include cars suvs trucks and the occasional luxury vehicle a borough in new jersey recently auctioned off a 2015 maserati that was confiscated by their police department police and fire departments are also selling the used police cars and fire trucks that are taken out of service due to regular vehicle replacement upcycled buses ambulances the ultimate road trip vehicles for those struggling to find the perfect rv for road trips due to supply chain issues why not create one by upcycling a used city bus or ambulance that s right crafty travel enthusiasts are now buying used buses and ambulances in government auctions and refurbishing them into the travel vessels of their dreams for example one family purchased a used gillig bus from the central pennsylvania transportation authority which they converted into a disney themed rv these upcycled buses are perfect for digital nomads who want to road trip while working gillig city bus before upcycling gillig city bus after upcycling many businesses are benefiting from government auctions companies that are struggling to find the tech equipment they need for their operations because of supply chain issues can also turn to government auctions not only are public school districts auctioning off buses they no longer need but also they are selling surplus items like used ipads printers computer monitors

landscaping companies agricultural enterprises and more these auctions also offer fantastic tools for etsy sellers and automotive companies such as tire changing machines and welders the advantages of buying items in government auctions there are many benefits of buying used vehicles and equipment from government auctions rather than via online seller platforms like craigslist here are just a few of these advantages quality value when you purchase a vehicle or other item in a government auction you can expect quality and value this is because municipalities and government departments tend to take very good care of their equipment and vehicles oftentimes governmental bodies have regularly scheduled maintenance for their items or rotate items out of service at regular intervals some governments even have routine replacement schedules so the equipment has useful life remaining therefore purchasing an item in a government auction will provide great value no scammers online seller platforms like craigslist and offerup are rife with con artists looking to scam buyers out of their hard earned money luckily there is no need to worry about dealing with these conniving scammers when buying vehicles and other items in a government auction those who win these auctions will be purchasing items from municipalities with credibility not an unknown individual with no accountability to

auctions are giving consumers and businesses alike the opportunity to purchase cars buses for upcycling purposes tech essentials like laptops and other must have products without having to worry about dealing with scammers government auctions will continue being a godsend during the current supply chain crisis _____________________________________________________________________ greg berry is the ceo and founder of municibid the go to online marketplace for government auctions municibid is the top platform for municipalities public schools fire departments police departments and other

james cox the upcoming russian naval exercises off the irish coast are directly linked to the russian military build up on the ukrainian border according to a td and former head of the army ranger wing the artillery drills are due to take place at the start of february in international waters but within irish controlled airspace and the country s exclusive economic zone cathal berry who spent six years in the army ranger wing told breakingnews ie you might think it has nothing to do with it but it has everything to do with it they re pre positioning their pieces in preparation for the checkmate move that s what they re at and that s why they ve chosen this particular part of the world it s europe s back yard and they know that ireland is particularly exposed from a defence and security point of view so they ve exploited that the independent td added there are five domains when it comes to military operations land sea air cyber and space all domains are in play at the moment they re all connected the idea of a one dimensional land only incursion into another country that doesn t happen any more not in modern warfare all five domains are in play cyber security experts have warned that the disruption to undersea telecommunications cables by planned russian manoeuvres next week could be very significant mr berry said this is no coincidence these are very important underwater internet cables people think the cloud is in the sky but the cloud is actually at the bottom of the sea and they know that and it s like the umbilical cord between north american and europe if you severe that you re going to cause major issues for stock markets financial transactions the economy society everything basically that we take for granted while irish fishermen say they have been given a guarantee by the russian navy that their fishing will not be impacted taoiseach micheál martin said today that he would be worried about their safety mr berry echoed these sentiments even from the weather and the elements there can be issues if you put a large number of vessels into a small area even at nighttime any accidental collision can occur i won t say easily but anything is possible so they will need to be careful out there particularly if they re trawling their nets and there might be a submarine in the area they have to be very careful not to get it snagged mr berry said the defence forces have been under funded for decades leaving ireland vulnerable to situations like this one we ve become an exposed and vulnerable member of the european union and the russians have taken full advantage of that he said the commission on the defence forces is reporting this week the government will then for the next few weeks examine the findings come up with their own implementation plan and then we need to act and properly resource and fund our defence forces ireland is living in a house of straw and the wolf is knocking at the door while ireland is classed as a neutral country mr berry said that it does not currently have the necessary defence capabilities in place at the moment we re not a neutral country we re pretending to be a neutral country but we re not we don t meet the criteria we don t meet the obligations that a neutral country is meant to perform we need to recognise that being an independent sovereign country is a very important thing and we have to be prepared to protect it if you want to protect it you have to make sure you have the minimum credible deterrent when it comes to these types of activities off our coast and at the moment we don t have that and that s why we re suffering disproportionately because we ve under funded our defence capabilities so much over the last few decades he added we re all familiar with the story of the three little pigs ireland is living in a house of straw and the wolf is knocking at the door and we know what s happening next and we ve nobody but ourselves to blame we ve invited this onto us by being so ill prepared that they recognise this to be a blind spot and are taking full advantage mr berry compared the current situation to the hse cyberattack last summer which was believed to be the work of a russian hacker group known as wizard spider since the cyberattack the government has responded by committing more money to cyber security and appointing a new director for the national cyber security centre he said the uncertainty over the upcoming russian military exercises should prompt similar investment in the defence forces while the russian government claimed the february exercises were planned in advance mr berry believes this is unlikely if it was pre planned why didn t they inform us last year why did they only inform us last friday if you want to look at the evidence if it was pre planned months ago they could have informed us but they didn t and it wasn t mr berry said that there will be powerful war ships involved in the exercises and that other countries will be watching the activities closely it s about signalling and letting people know that russia can project power into europe s back yard
state and local governments lost at least 117 billion of expected revenue early in the pandemic according to an associated press analysis but many are now awash in record amounts of money boosted partly by federal aid in response to the dramatic turnaround governors lawmakers and local officials have proposed a surge in spending as well as a new wave of tax cuts the ultimate effect of the pandemic was a net positive said stephen parker assistant city manager for the los angeles suburb of upland where sales tax revenues are soaring isn t that unbelievable it s just crazy to think of that upland a city of 79 000 was representative of many cities at the outset of the pandemic it reported an estimated loss of nearly 6 1 million in 2020 the result of a steep but short lived national recession and what parker describes as a generous treasury department method for calculating losses that figure was the median amount among more than 900 cities that reported their revenues to the department under the american rescue plan act upland s financial situation turned around even before the end of 2020 parker said federal covid 19 stimulus checks played a role so did a shift in consumer spending to goods instead of services that lifted city revenues parker said because services often are exempt from sales taxes while goods are not the pandemic relief law championed by democrats and signed by president joe biden last march included 350 billion in aid to states and local governments the treasury department required states counties and larger cities to file reports last year detailing their initial plans for the money those governments also were asked to estimate their losses for 2020 by comparing actual revenue to expected revenue under a treasury formula though revenue figures were left blank by nearly one quarter of the roughly 3 700 governments that filed reports the data nonetheless provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the financial strain on governments during the pandemic s first year more than two thirds of state and local governments reported at least some losses ranging from a few thousand dollars in some rural counties to more than 12 billion for the state of texas according to the ap s analysis the total was 117 5 billion the treasury department last october declined an ap request to release the revenue loss data under the federal freedom of information act saying it would be publicly available later it recently posted the data on its website the next reports are due monday for some governments and april 30 for others loading notes actual general revenue actual general revenue as of 12 months ended december 31 2020 base year revenue for the most recent fiscal year prior to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic for most governments that meant their base year was the 2019 fiscal year estimated loss estimated revenue loss due to covid 19 public health emergency as of december 31 2020 funds allocation explanation of how revenue replacement funds were allocated recovery funds for pension whether fiscal recovery funds used to make a deposit into a pension fund the report for north carolina lists its 2020 revenue as 26 6 trillion and its base year revenue as 24 8 trillion ap confirmed with the state that these figures were intended to be shown as billions not trillions and ap has updated the data accordingly there are 28 entities for which there appear to be data entry errors in the base year revenues these entities show base year revenues of 2 016 or 2 019 or 2 020 it appears likely that these were intended to be base years of 2016 2019 or 2020 but got entered into the wrong field the department used lost revenue to determine how much flexibility to give governments in spending the aid under guidelines issued last may governments that showed a loss were free to spend an equal amount on almost any government services including roads and other projects not otherwise allowed under the rules a final rule released earlier this month expanded that flexibility by allowing governments to claim up to 10 million of revenue losses even if actual losses were less upland which is getting 15 million plans to use part of its flexible spending to repave parking lots and repair hundreds of sections of sidewalks that might not otherwise have been eligible federal assistance was not the only factor that helped governments bounce back financial analysts also cite inflation which pushed up prices and bolstered sales tax collections many consumers also had more to spend because of the stimulus checks a strong stock market drove up capital gains taxes and an early pandemic rise in unemployment spared many higher earners who shifted to working from home while continuing to pay income taxes in many places the revenue rebound exceeded pre pandemic levels total state tax revenues from last april through november rose 20 compared to the same period in 2019 according to an urban institute report released earlier this month for governments that already were financially strained the pandemic deepened their losses but also resulted in a cash windfall the hudson river valley city of poughkeepsie was rated by the new york comptroller as the state s most financially stressed community in 2020 with a pre pandemic deficit around 7 million and no reserves the city quickly cut spending sold property froze hiring and instituted an early retirement program in a desperate effort to close the gap when the pandemic began city administrator marc nelson said the city reported a 2020 revenue loss of nearly 4 5 million under the treasury department s formula it s getting more than 20 million from the american rescue plan though the relief money cannot be used to wipe out the deficit the city plans to make major improvements to parks and swimming pools including a complete rebuild of a run down bathhouse that has been relying on portable toilets these are things that would not have been within the city s ability to take on were it not for the covid relief money nelson said though they re spending the federal aid some republican officials insist it was unnecessary in light of the rapidly rebounding tax revenues missouri reported an estimated 900 million loss for 2020 but ended its 2021 fiscal year with a record cash balance republican gov mike parson recently proposed a 47 billion budget that is up nearly one third over the current year because of surging federal and state revenues he wants to spend more on infrastructure and public employee salaries while also saving more when other states will be using federal dollars to fill spending gaps and budget shortfalls we will be making investments in the future he said in his state of the state address in some cases government losses weren t as severe as the treasury numbers might suggest greer county in rural southwest oklahoma reported a 2020 revenue loss of 363 630 around the national median for counties reporting their revenues that comprised 10 of the county s expected revenue under the treasury department formula but it didn t prompt budget cuts county clerk tiffany buchanan said the county didn t feel that much of a loss buchanan said explaining we live on a very tight strict budget as it is the county plans to use some of its 1 1 million from the american rescue plan to help fund the sheriff s office and pay emergency medical personnel some states including california and texas projected large revenue losses at the outset of the pandemic but have since posted big gains when it passed a budget early in the pandemic california had expected the recession to cause a 54 billion deficit that led officials to defer payments to schools and community colleges and to reduce state employee pay according to the state s treasury report now california is projecting a nearly 46 billion surplus spurred by record tax collections leaving officials searching for ways to use the money gov gavin newsom recently proposed a budget that would expand health coverage to all low income adults living in the state illegally while simultaneously cutting taxes the democratic governor also said a substantial tax rebate was likely in order i will be holding the governor s feet to the fire and keep him at his word to refund surplus dollars to the taxpayers gop state sen melissa

susan tompor detroit free press their checks to the u s treasury were cashed nearly a year ago but taxpayers say they re now receiving letters from the internal revenue service asking them to immediately file their 2020 federal income tax returns yes copies of their 2020 returns yes the same paper returns they filed last spring please file today the letter begins send your signed return to the address shown above we ll assign the credit to the tax you owe and refund any over payment if you owe no other taxes or obligations some readers who contacted me wondered whether if this could be some sort of scam it wasn t a text message it wasn t an email it was a letter said anne hovell 72 who recently received the irs letter dated jan 24 according to the letter sent to the couple in gibraltar the credit on their account is 1 056 the irs letter warns that there can be more problems ahead if we don t hear from you if you don t file your return or contact us the form letter says you may lose this credit the internal revenue code sets strict time limits for refunding or transferring credits can you finally stop working this year with stock market taking a hit can you still afford to retire in 2022 rough stretch over for now stocks surge to salvage a volatile week on wall street hovell who keeps track of transactions in her checking account knows the money cleared a year ago and she recognized that the amount listed as a credit is what she paid in taxes if a check doesn t clear i follow up she said it did clear hovell who retired as a consultant for a tech company knows that scammers often use email or texts but she wondered if somehow the scammers were getting even more sophisticated and created actual letters to demand copies of tax returns the notion of a scam seemed to make even more sense than thinking that the irs could be sending letters to people who already paid their taxes and filed their returns why would the irs need another return if the federal government cashed their checks she and others wondered doesn t that mean the irs received their return in the mail since the return and check were mailed together why wouldn t the irs already have their tax returns it s a good question and frankly one that could leave you in shock when you re thinking about all the work that goes into filing your tax return in the first place it s very unsettling to get an irs notice when you think you did everything by the book filed the return on time sent the money that was due the less scary part here of course is that the irs wasn t trying to collect money from the couple the letters that readers sent to me are marked notice cp80 and the letters i saw were sent out of kansas city missouri the letter goes on to say if you have already filed this return please send a newly signed copy to the address shown above be sure to attach copies of all schedules and other documents you included with the original return unprocessed returns built up the pandemic has flipped a lot of things in life upside down the tax system has undergone sizable challenges since the two year long pandemic began in early 2020 as of dec 4 2021 the irs said it had a backlog of 6 7 million unprocessed individual returns and 2 6 million unprocessed amended individual returns mark luscombe principal analyst for wolters kluwer tax accounting said the irs is still processing millions of 2020 returns and these notices go out automatically when the irs believes it has not received a return while it might seem on the surface that delays have gone on so long that the irs is unable to find many of the paper returns many experts say that s not likely to be the case at all a glut of automated notices might have been sent to many people who likely should not have received them edward karl vice president of tax policy and advocacy for the american institute of cpas said the cp80 notice has an important place in the process the notice would normally be sent when a tax return for a given year wasn t received even though the filer might have paid a good deal of money already into the system such as through estimated taxes someone might have forgotten to file a return when they have a credit to their account money that could be owed to them in a refund when there s been a troubling event such as a trauma a divorce a death or natural disaster the cp80 notice lets the taxpayer know that when a return hasn t been filed and they can file one in time to claim any refund money owed in most cases an original return claiming a refund must be filed within three years of its due date for the irs to issue a refund the only issue is we re not in normal times karl said the irs like the rest of the country has faced more than its fair share of challenges since the covid 19 pandemic hit to stem outbreaks of the virus the irs had to shut down its centers earlier in the pandemic and irs employees had to be protected but piles of unprocessed returns built up they have such a backlog of processing karl said the pandemic has put them in a deep hole the irs backs off but not soon enough for some the notices sent out in january though seem to be adding to the paperwork on thursday the irs announced that it would suspend notices in situations where we have credited taxpayers for payments but have no record of the tax return being filed the idea behind stopping the notices is to avoid even more confusion the irs noted in its statement in many situations the tax return may be part of our current paper tax inventory and simply hasn t been processed stopping these letters which could have otherwise been sent to thousands of taxpayers will help avoid confusion unfortunately many taxpayers opened their mail already and read the notices before the irs announced that it was halting some of these mailings diana vollmayer of rochester hills said she and her husband already mailed the copy of their 2020 return certified with return receipt we are keeping records of all transactions she said noting that she too was told via her notice of a credit to the couple s account they made estimated tax payments but had filed their 2020 return by paper last spring and paid the rest of the money that they owed when they filed the return she said her friend received one of these letters too but hired a cpa to review her 2020 taxes and handle the situation for her the irs didn t offer a clear detail of what notices it is suspending in its statement as it doesn t even mention cp80 in its statement in an email response to the free press the irs said it has suspended issuing the cp80 and cp080 unfiled tax return credit on account notices the irs said the cp80 is a notice letter that informs a taxpayer that the agency has credited payments and or other credits to their tax account for a certain tax period but the agency hasn t received their tax return the irs has not disclosed how many of the notices went out this month but confirmed that the letters aren t a scam if a taxpayer has received a notice for a 2020 return they should not refile according to luis garcia a spokesperson for the irs in detroit for taxpayers who timely filed their 2019 tax return including extensions and have received a notice they should refile their return garcia said taxpayers also can establish and log into their tax account online at irs gov to view their tax status and any correspondence the irs has sent karl maintains that taxpayers who received a notice now regarding a 2020 return would not have to send a copy of the return if they already filed a 2020 return and know that their payment went through if you didn t file a return obviously you could have money that you might be owed based on the notice and would want to file to claim a refund if you received a notice regarding a 2019 return karl said you would need to send in another signed copy the aicpa is part of a group of stakeholders called the tax professionals united for taxpayer relief coalition which is seeking more relief for taxpayers in light of the pandemic related challenges the coalition s recommendations submitted to the irs include discontinuing automated compliance actions until the irs is prepared to devote the necessary resources for a timely resolution similar recommendation also included in the 2021 national taxpayer advocate report the automated system makes more sense in more normal times when the backlog isn t so great but bulk batches of notices now pose a great risk of alerting many taxpayers to problems that aren t real on their end according to professionals they re going to be wrong in many instances because of the backlog karl said he said the news thursday was welcome but more needed to be done the group also wants to see among other changes the irs providing taxpayers with targeted relief from the underpayment and the late payment penalty for the 2020 and 2021 tax year the irs maintains that making significant operational changes to our systems including stopping certain notices from being printed and mailed may require programming and other operational changes with an outdated technological ecosystem these are changes that cannot be made as efficiently as they should be and that is part of the reason why investing in irs it modernization is so important getting one of these letters of course raises other questions such as why would the irs have cashed the check if the return that was filed wasn t processed karl noted that cashing the check when it s its received is part of the normal process it s not a cause for alarm it s prudent karl said the u s treasury uses this money to cover a wide range of government expenditures you make your check payable to the united states treasury and include a payment voucher called form 1099 v that goes with the paper check the irs notes when we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment the returns are separated from the check and then returns are processed further down the line after the check has been cashed normally we re not thinking about the ins and outs of how the irs handles all that paperwork but again not much has been normal for the past two years contact susan tompor stompor freepress com follow her on twitter tompor

municipal yields rose double digits friday bringing levels to highs not seen since early april 2020 the short end of triple a scales has risen more than 30 basis points over the past five sessions on

volatility across all asset classes has shocked the majority of investors according to barclays plc municipals have already underperformed treasuries with current ratios surpassing barclays year end projections while they have adjusted from a historical perspective they are not overly cheap just closer to fair value barclays strategists mikhail foux clare pickering and mayur patel said the front end has been under the most pressure and we actually are starting to see more value in shorter dated bonds for more defensive investors if there is continued market volatility and fund outflows barclays said longer dated bonds might struggle we are especially cautious on longer dated lower coupons bonds which have already underperformed 5 bonds by 5 10 bp in the past month or so but there is probably more downside as rates move higher especially for long dated 3 bonds overall we feel that investors should be able to find some attractive opportunities in the near future we would not be rushing to buy but even at current levels some market participants should start slowly adding exposure they said bofa global research said rate volatility will certainly impair fund flows and the market s main saving grace is a lack of supply they said if issuance starts picking up we could see more market pressure they said however after a stretch of time that featured poor valuations we think we are starting to see some attractive opportunities in the coming weeks and months recent mutual fund withdrawals may have made portfolio managers wary bofa said mutual fund flows have historically been consistently negative when 10 year triple a rates reach 50 basis points and stay high for three months otherwise outflows were always transient they said if the fed s hawkish posture succeeds in limiting long term treasury rates they said muni market should follow suit for the time being we stay on muni curve flattening and emphasize the long end of the muni curve they said should

year and balance sheet reduction expect volatility but the municipal bond market should still do well the muni market has a history of outperforming treasuries when the fed hikes because the tax free interest that munis pay becomes more attractive as yields rise noted ann ferentino portfolio manager at federated hermes while we expect muni to treasury ratios to rise with the fed moves if the policy actions go at a measured pace munis still should be well positioned relative to treasuries the market is buoyed by robust credit quality with low default rates upgrades exceeding downgrades strong revenue growth significant federal support and recovering pension funds she said the proof is tight quality and sector spreads while there could be bumps along the way ferentino said we expect the asset class to deliver reliable income streams and diversification throughout 2022 and while recession isn t imminent said liz young head of investment strategy at sofi investors are not conditioned for this environment and i don t think the digestion process is over a treacherous bear market is not in the cards she said but when market relationships dislocate as they did last year she said i start to sense something ominous on the horizon the link between the 10 year treasury yield and inflation the relationship between growth and value in the face of tightening monetary policy value should have been a clearer winner and the relationship between valuations and fundamental durability was rarely found young said recently those relationships have started to make more sense she said that tells me this needs to happen to bring us closer to rationality and to set us up for the next phase of the economic cycle friday brought readings on inflation wages and consumer sentiment the employment cost index rose 1 0 in the fourth quarter down from a 1 3 rise in the third quarter it was up 4 0 from a year ago economists were expecting a 1 2 rise while still blistering the quarterly increase was more restrained than q3 s 1 3 gain said wells fargo securities senior economist sarah house that may tamp down fears of a wage price spiral amid signs businesses are not upping pay at such a frenzied pace with the gains slowing fed officials are likely breathing a bit of relief that labor costs did not accelerate further on a sequential basis she said but glad they have telegraphed a more hawkish path for policy given that the overall pace of employment costs continue to point to a very tight labor market but the improvement does not signal the worst is over when it comes to labor cost growth house warned amid an already tight labor market and the omicron wave dealing a setback for the labor supply outlook wage pressures are likely to remain firmly upward over the next few quarters olu sonola fitch ratings head of u s regional economics said labor shortages continue to pressure wages to the upside particularly in the pandemic sensitive leisure and hospitality sector while deceleration this quarter was broad based the construction trade and transport sectors were exceptions sonola said the report shows an economy grappling with high inflation and the emergence of the omicron variant of covid 19 said erik lundh principal economist at the conference board we expect these data to worsen in january due to the spike in omicron infections this month although as this latest wave of covid 19 passes we expect consumer spending growth to improve as spring approaches particularly for spending on in person services after the fed raises rates said grant thornton chief economist diane swonk one has to wonder how well those wage gains will hold up in the past 20 years information was the only sector that came close to those kinds of wage gains consumer spending declined 0 6 in december following a 0 4 increase in november as the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0 4 in the month and 5 8 for the year the annual gain up from 5 7 in november was the biggest jump since 1982 core pce gained 0 5 in the month and 4 9 year over year the largest annual gain since 1983 consumers pivoted back into services including travel tourism and health care over the month as they opted to see their loved ones instead of buying traditional holiday gifts said swonk spending on goods of all types contracted over the month omicron could tamp spending in january she noted inflation is beginning to bite and suppress spending and consumers assessments of the economy swonk added federal reserve chairman jay powell delivered a much more hawkish tone at the press conference following the fomc meeting it is past time panic within the fed s ranks has begun to set in the challenge now is to tamp down inflation without allowing the flame on the overall economy to go out there is no road map for doing this after inflation has surged consumer sentiment slipped in january with the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index falling

state and local governments lost at least 117 billion of expected revenue early in the pandemic according to an associated press analysis but many are now awash in record amounts of money boosted partly by federal aid in response to the dramatic turnaround governors lawmakers and local officials have proposed a surge in spending as well as a new wave of tax cuts the ultimate effect of the pandemic was a net positive said stephen parker assistant city manager for the los angeles suburb of upland where sales tax revenues are soaring isn t that unbelievable it s just crazy to think of that upland a city of 79 000 was representative of many cities at the outset of the pandemic it reported an estimated loss of nearly 6 1 million in 2020 the result of a steep but short lived national recession and what parker describes as a generous treasury department method for calculating losses that figure was the median amount among more than 900 cities that reported their revenues to the department under the american rescue plan act upland s financial situation turned around even before the end of 2020 parker said federal covid 19 stimulus checks played a role so did a shift in consumer spending to goods instead of services that lifted city revenues parker said because services often are exempt from sales taxes while goods are not the pandemic relief law championed by democrats and signed by president joe biden last march included 350 billion in aid to states and local governments the treasury department required states counties and larger cities to file reports last year detailing their initial plans for the money those governments also were asked to estimate their losses for 2020 by comparing actual revenue to expected revenue under a treasury formula though revenue figures were left blank by nearly one quarter of the roughly 3 700 governments that filed reports the data nonetheless provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the financial strain on governments during the pandemic s first year more than two thirds of state and local governments reported at least some losses ranging from a few thousand dollars in some rural counties to more than 12 billion for the state of texas according to the ap s analysis the total was 117 5 billion the treasury department last october declined an ap request to release the revenue loss data under the federal freedom of information act saying it would be publicly available later it recently posted the data on its website the next reports are due monday for some governments and april 30 for others loading notes actual general revenue actual general revenue as of 12 months ended december 31 2020 base year revenue for the most recent fiscal year prior to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic for most governments that meant their base year was the 2019 fiscal year estimated loss estimated revenue loss due to covid 19 public health emergency as of december 31 2020 funds allocation explanation of how revenue replacement funds were allocated recovery funds for pension whether fiscal recovery funds used to make a deposit into a pension fund the report for north carolina lists its 2020 revenue as 26 6 trillion and its base year revenue as 24 8 trillion ap confirmed with the state that these figures were intended to be shown as billions not trillions and ap has updated the data accordingly there are 28 entities for which there appear to be data entry errors in the base year revenues these entities show base year revenues of 2 016 or 2 019 or 2 020 it appears likely that these were intended to be base years of 2016 2019 or 2020 but got entered into the wrong field the department used lost revenue to determine how much flexibility to give governments in spending the aid under guidelines issued last may governments that showed a loss were free to spend an equal amount on almost any government services including roads and other projects not otherwise allowed under the rules a final rule released earlier this month expanded that flexibility by allowing governments to claim up to 10 million of revenue losses even if actual losses were less upland which is getting 15 million plans to use part of its flexible spending to repave parking lots and repair hundreds of sections of sidewalks that might not otherwise have been eligible federal assistance was not the only factor that helped governments bounce back financial analysts also cite inflation which pushed up prices and bolstered sales tax collections many consumers also had more to spend because of the stimulus checks a strong stock market drove up capital gains taxes and an early pandemic rise in unemployment spared many higher earners who shifted to working from home while continuing to pay income taxes in many places the revenue rebound exceeded pre pandemic levels total state tax revenues from last april through november rose 20 compared to the same period in 2019 according to an urban institute report released earlier this month for governments that already were financially strained the pandemic deepened their losses but also resulted in a cash windfall the hudson river valley city of poughkeepsie was rated by the new york comptroller as the state s most financially stressed community in 2020 with a pre pandemic deficit around 7 million and no reserves the city quickly cut spending sold property froze hiring and instituted an early retirement program in a desperate effort to close the gap when the pandemic began city administrator marc nelson said the city reported a 2020 revenue loss of nearly 4 5 million under the treasury department s formula it s getting more than 20 million from the american rescue plan though the relief money cannot be used to wipe out the deficit the city plans to make major improvements to parks and swimming pools including a complete rebuild of a run down bathhouse that has been relying on portable toilets these are things that would not have been within the city s ability to take on were it not for the covid relief money nelson said though they re spending the federal aid some republican officials insist it was unnecessary in light of the rapidly rebounding tax revenues missouri reported an estimated 900 million loss for 2020 but ended its 2021 fiscal year with a record cash balance republican gov mike parson recently proposed a 47 billion budget that is up nearly one third over the current year because of surging federal and state revenues he wants to spend more on infrastructure and public employee salaries while also saving more when other states will be using federal dollars to fill spending gaps and budget shortfalls we will be making investments in the future he said in his state of the state address in some cases government losses weren t as severe as the treasury numbers might suggest greer county in rural southwest oklahoma reported a 2020 revenue loss of 363 630 around the national median for counties reporting their revenues that comprised 10 of the county s expected revenue under the treasury department formula but it didn t prompt budget cuts county clerk tiffany buchanan said the county didn t feel that much of a loss buchanan said explaining we live on a very tight strict budget as it is the county plans to use some of its 1 1 million from the american rescue plan to help fund the sheriff s office and pay emergency medical personnel some states including california and texas projected large revenue losses at the outset of the pandemic but have since posted big gains when it passed a budget early in the pandemic california had expected the recession to cause a 54 billion deficit that led officials to defer payments to schools and community colleges and to reduce state employee pay according to the state s treasury report now california is projecting a nearly 46 billion surplus spurred by record tax collections leaving officials searching for ways to use the money gov gavin newsom recently proposed a budget that would expand health coverage to all low income adults living in the state illegally while simultaneously cutting taxes the democratic governor also said a substantial tax rebate was likely in order i will be holding the governor s feet to the fire and keep him at his word to refund surplus dollars to the taxpayers gop state sen melissa

washington defense secretary lloyd austin said friday the buildup of russian forces along ukraine s border has reached the point where president vladimir putin now has a complete range of military options including actions short of a full scale invasion while we don t believe that president putin has made a final decision to use these forces against ukraine he clearly now has the capability austin told a pentagon news conference in moscow the kremlin said putin told french president emmanuel macron that the west has failed to take russian security concerns into account and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov told a radio interviewer that russia doesn t want war but sees no room for compromise on its demands austin said putin could use any portion of his force of an estimated 100 000 troops to seize ukrainian cities and significant territories or to carry out coercive acts or provocative political acts like the recognition of breakaway territories inside ukraine he urged putin to de escalate tensions and appeared to warn moscow against what the white house recently said was russia s intent to paint ukraine as the aggressor using a false flag operation to justify an attack we remain focused on russian disinformation including the potential creation of pretext for further invasion or strikes on donbas said austin this is straight out of the russian playbook they re not fooling us austin spoke alongside army gen mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in what were their first extensive public comments about the crisis marking a subtle shift in the administration s approach to public communications about the escalating situation while both have consulted regularly with their nato and ukrainian counterparts the public discourse has focused on the diplomatic efforts milley painted a grim picture of russian military capabilities around ukraine saying there are not only ground troops and naval and air forces but also cyber and electronic warfare capabilities as well as special operations forces he said the buildup is the largest he s seen in recent memory and he urged putin to choose a diplomatic path over conflict if russia chooses to invade ukraine it will not be cost free in terms of casualties and other significant effects milley said he was referring to russian costs while also noting that ukraine s armed forces are more capable today than in 2014 when russia seized ukraine s crimean peninsula and intervened in support of pro russian separatists in the eastern industrial heartland earlier friday the kremlin said putin told macron that the west has failed to consider russia s key conditions of halting further nato expansion stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near russian borders and rolling back its forces from eastern europe the us and nato formally rejected those demands this week although washington outlined areas where discussions are possible offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war despite that us president joe biden on thursday warned ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy that there is a distinct possibility that russia could take military action against the former soviet state in february russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans zelenskyy sought to play down the war fears saying western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country s financial markets to cash out we don t need this panic he said at a news conference it cost ukrainians dearly putin told macron that moscow will study the us and nato response before deciding its next move according to a kremlin account of their call the russian president has made no public remarks about the western response but lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement while they say they won t change their positions we won t change ours lavrov told russian radio stations in a live interview i don t see any room for compromise here there won t be a war as far as it depends on the russian federation we don t want a war he added but we won t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored a senior biden administration official said the us welcomed lavrov s comments that russia does not want war but this needs to be backed up with action we need to see russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the ukrainian border and taking other de escalatory steps the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly lavrov said the us suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate range missiles restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft he said the russians proposed discussing those issues years ago but washington and its allies never took them up on it until now he also said those issues are secondary to russia s main concerns about nato he said international agreements say the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others and said he would send letters to ask his western counterparts to explain their failure to respect that pledge washington has warned moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades ukraine including penalties targeting top russian officials and key economic sectors lavrov said moscow had warned washington that sanctions would amount to a complete severing of ties nato meanwhile said it was bolstering its deterrence in the baltic sea region and the us has put 8 500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to support nato allies austin and milley said friday that no us forces have yet been deployed or moved around europe they said the us has taken into account the risk that any troop movements could inflame the situation but stressed the need for america to reassure its allies russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern russia warplanes in kaliningrad on the baltic sea and dozens of warships in the black sea and the arctic russian troops are also in belarus for joint drills raising western fears that moscow could stage an attack on ukraine from the north the ukrainian capital is just 75 kilometers 50 miles from the border with belarus belarusian president alexander lukashenko said there will be no war unless belarus or russia come under attack and he accused the west of trying to drown our slavic brotherhood in blood despite the alarming rhetoric ukrainian officials have repeatedly tried to project calm zelenskyy said the decision by the us britain australia germany and canada to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from kyiv was a mistake and said internal destabilization poses the greatest risk to his country he also bemoaned nato s failure to offer ukraine a roadmap to membership saying the alliance should state clearly if it doesn t plan to embrace ukraine and not offer vague promises zelenskyy also challenged us warnings of an imminent russian attack insisting we aren t seeing any escalation bigger than before he said the russian buildup could be part of moscow s attempts to exert psychological pressure and sow panic ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov told parliament the number of russian troops near ukraine about 130 000 is comparable to moscow s military buildup last spring when moscow eventually pulled its forces back after major exercises

the farm laborer wage board on friday voted 2 1 to recommend that state labor commissioner roberta reardon decrease the state s farm worker weekly overtime threshold to 40 hours per week from 60 hours over the course of the next 10 years beginning jan 1 2024 unions and other groups such as the new york civil liberties union applauded the board s recommendation as a measure that would promote equity and fairness to farm workers while some farmers and food producers chafed at the prospect having long claimed that decreasing the overtime threshold for farm laborers would destroy farm operations during busy harvest seasons prior to 2019 farm workers in new york state were required to work up to 80 hours during the harvest season that was before then gov andrew m cuomo signed a law that provided expansive new employment rights for farm workers giving them certain rights that have been long provided to employees in other sectors of the economy the law provided for a 60 hour work week for farm workers before overtime has to be paid an earlier version had put the level at 40 hours while critics balked cuomo called the new law a milestone in the crusade for social justice as a practical matter 100 000 farm workers will have better lives their families will have better lives they will finally finally have the same protections that other workers have had for 80 years cuomo said at the time the bill also allowed farm workers to join unions guaranteed them at least one day off a week allowed them to apply for unemployment benefits and made it easier for farm laborers to obtain workers compensation coverage a last minute change in the 2019 legislation also required that a three person board meet again by dec 15 to consider changing the threshold to as low as 40 hours a week the result of that meeting was the vote announced friday the board composed of the head of the state farm bureau a trade group for the farm industry a former afl cio president and brenda mcduffie the former president of the buffalo urban league made a nonbinding recommendation to the state labor commissioner who could reject or accept their ideas critics including state sen rob ortt r north tonawanda whose district includes several agricultural communities said if the state goes through with the overtime change it will put farms out of business and force workers to move to states with more favorable employment opportunities everyone agrees that family farmers and farmworkers deserve to be treated fairly with this new burdensome mandate they will be added to the exodus of people leaving our state ortt said the industry group grow ny farms released a statement predicting that the decision would force farmers to switch to growing less work intensive crops and would amount to a pay cut for workers already accustomed to a 60 hour week changing the overtime threshold to 40 hours a week for farmworkers in new york means that these workers will be limited to 40 hours due to simple farm economics the group said this is not a win for farmworkers that self proclaimed worker advocates will claim agricultural production diversification and job availability will suffer
