photo credit monkey business images shutterstock as the american population becomes more diverse so does the population of school aged children however teacher diversity is not keeping up and the diversity gap between students and teachers continues to widen according to 2020 data from the u s census bureau 51 of students are not white in comparison non white teachers account for less than 30 of teachers nationally the teacher diversity gap the percentage point difference between the share of students that are non white and the share of teachers that are non white is nearly 22 percentage points for example 12 5 of students in the u s are black but only 9 6 of teachers are the gap between hispanic students and teachers is even wider with the proportion of hispanic students 25 5 more than double that of hispanic teachers 12 0 minority teachers can benefit minority students in multiple ways research shows that minority students do better in school when they have at least one teacher of the same race minority teachers not only act as role models for minority students but they also have higher expectations for minority students additionally minority teachers are likely to have a better cultural understanding of minority students which experts argue can be beneficial in more effectively connecting and forming relationships with students according to research from the urban institute the diversity gap between students and teachers is not because people of color are less likely to choose to become teachers instead it stems from young minority adults being less likely to attend and graduate from college while a similar share of hispanics blacks and white college graduates go on to become teachers whites are over twice as likely to be college graduates as blacks or hispanics teacher diversity is restricted due to the still relatively small pool of diverse college graduates on a geographic basis the share of minority teachers and students varies depending on local demographics that said there is not a strong correlation between the share of non white teachers and the teacher diversity gap for example the southwest has the greatest share of non white teachers and also large diversity gaps the great plains midwest and new england states generally report lower proportions of non white teachers but diversity gaps vary widely at the state level hawaii boasts the highest share of non white teachers at nearly 75 the student population in hawaii is even more diverse with non white students accounting for 89 of all students on the other

a stock trader convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a case related to a secret network of tunnels built under a maryland home received a reduced sentence on tuesday montgomery county circuit court judge margaret schweitzer resentenced daniel beckwitt on the conviction after the september 2017 death of 21 year old askia khafra who died in a fire at beckwitt s home beckwitt had khafra dig tunnels for a nuclear bunker beneath the home he was sentenced in 2019 to nine years in prison after a jury convicted him of second degree depraved heart murder and involuntary manslaughter for khafra s death we re making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter the 4front sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox in january 2021 the state s court of appeals upheld an earlier ruling from the court of special appeals that the evidence wasn t sufficient to sustain beckwitt s murder conviction but it upheld his conviction for involuntary manslaughter under a theory of gross negligence on tuesday judge schweitzer sentenced beckwitt to 10 years in prison with all but five of those years suspended beckwitt will receive credit for the nearly three years he s served so far meaning he will only have to serve two more years in prison we always felt that this case was overcharged from the beginning said megan coleman one of beckwitt s attorneys schweitzer also ordered an additional five years of probation for beckwitt when he is released and he must do 250 hours of community service our thoughts remain with the khafra family who continues to grieve the loss of their son askia every day today judge schweitzer sentenced at the top of the maryland sentencing guidelines for a manslaughter charge the state s attorney s office said in a statement we respect the sentence and the legal process that brought us here as previously stated we are pleased that the maryland court of appeals the highest court in maryland affirmed the conviction on the critical charge of involuntary manslaughter in the case of state v daniel beckwitt firefighters found khafra s naked charred body in the basement of beckwitt s trash filled house only a few steps from an exit prosecutors said the extreme hoarding conditions in the bethesda home prevented khafra from escaping khafra met beckwitt online beckwitt had invested money in a company khafra was trying to launch as he helped beckwitt dig the network of tunnels a prosecutor described beckwitt as a skilled computer hacker who had a paranoid fixation on a possible nuclear attack by north korea beckwitt took elaborate steps to keep the project a secret he tried to trick khafra into thinking they were digging the tunnels in virginia instead of maryland by having him don blackout glasses before taking him on a long drive khafra had a cellphone with him in the tunnels but beckwitt used internet spoofing to make it appear they were digging in virginia khafra worked in the tunnels for days at a time eating and sleeping there and urinating and defecating into a bucket that beckwitt lowered down to him the tunnels had lights an air circulation system and a heater a hole in the concrete basement floor led to a shaft that dropped down 20 feet into tunnels that branched out roughly 200 feet in length investigators concluded the blaze was ignited by a defective electrical outlet in the basement prosecutors said beckwitt ignored obvious signs of danger and sacrificed safety for secrecy defense attorney robert bonsib told jurors the fire was an accident not a crime he described his client as an idiosyncratic but incredibly brilliant man who never intended any harm the appeals court panel s ruling says depraved heart murder requires an extreme indifference to the value of human life whereas gross negligence involuntary manslaughter requires only a wanton and reckless disregard for human life the panel said khafra wouldn t have died if beckwitt hadn t arranged for him to work in a dangerous environment but the judges noted that prosecutors did not present evidence that the tunnels themselves were structurally unsafe to be sure intentionally concealed the tunnels location from khafra and apathetically responded to electrical failures on the day of the fire but we cannot conclude that appellant realized or reasonably should have realized that his conduct was likely if not certain to cause death their ruling said schweitzer the circuit court judge told beckwitt last year that his intellectual arrogance led to the tragedy you thought that everything would be fine because you were very smart she said during beckwitt s sentencing hearing you thought you could fix everything

this handout photo released by the turkish presidential press service shows turkish president recep tayyip erdogan opening ukrainian russian talks in istanbul march 29 afp yonhap russia pledged to scale down fighting around kyiv and a second major city following peace talks on tuesday that ukraine s leader said showed positive signs but western allies made clear their doubts over moscow s intentions details filtering from the talks in istanbul raised hopes after more than a month of war that has left thousands dead and millions displaced kyiv s negotiator david arakhamia said there were sufficient conditions or president volodymyr zelenskyy and his russian counterpart vladimir putin to meet in a push to end europe s worst conflict in decades on the russian side chief negotiator vladimir medinsky called the talks meaningful while the country s deputy defense minister alexander fomin reported progress on the neutrality and non nuclear status of ukraine two central russian concerns russia fomin said had decided to radically by several times reduce the military activity around kyiv and the northern city of chernigiv zelenskyy himself sounded a note of cautious optimism following the day s talks though he said the positive signals do not drown out the explosions or russian shells and vowed in a video address late tuesday to keep up defense efforts but the united states cast clear doubt on moscow s words and vowed with fellow western powers to keep raising the costs on russia and by tuesday evening ukraine s general staff while confirming russian units were withdrawing from the kyiv and chernigiv regions said it was most likely a troop rotation intended to mislead ukraine s military on the ground in the capital air raid sirens could be heard ringing out

mykolaiv adding to a toll estimated by zelenskyy at 20 000 so far u s president joe biden listens to a reporter s question in the east room of the white house in washington march 29 ap yonhap offensive planned elsewhere reinforcing the ukrainian assessment u s officials said that while small numbers of russian forces were indeed stepping back from kyiv the vast majority remained we re not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal pentagon spokesman john kirby said warning a major offensive may yet be imminent in other areas of ukraine and that the threat to kyiv was not over a spokesman for british prime minister boris johnson echoed that message saying we will judge putin and his regime by his actions and not by his words russia hits areas near kyiv and another city despite vows to scale back russian gas flows to europe remain stable 12 dead 33 injured in russian airstrike in ukraine s mykolaiv u s president joe biden spoke with johnson and the leaders of france germany and italy together vowing no letup in the strong economic sanctions imposed on moscow we ll see if they follow through on what they re suggesting biden told reporters following the call when asked if he believed russia was simply trying to buy time the signals from tuesday s talks nonetheless sent european and u s stock markets up while oil prices fell by five percent as supply fears eased and the ruble surged 10 percent against the dollar a photograph shows an abandoned stroller on the road between irpin and kyiv march 29 ukrainian forces have liberated the kyiv suburb of irpin interior minister denys monastyrsky said march 28 afp yonhap a whoosh then a boom last weekend moscow already signaled it was dialing back its war goals focusing its military resources on capturing the eastern donbas region the pentagon assesses that russia badly underestimated ukrainian resistance and that its offensive has stalled near kyiv and other cities in recent days ukraine s fighters have notably recaptured the strategic kyiv suburb of irpin and pushed back russian forces from around mykolaiv but on tuesday a russian missile strike on a government building in the southern city left at least 12 dead and 33 wounded ukrainian officials said i was having breakfast in my apartment donald 69 a retired canadian postal worker with ukrainian residency told afp i heard a whoosh then a boom and my windows rattled another local resident viktor gaivonenko who was helping clean up the debris said putin is a bastard that s all there is to it crime against humanity while ukraine s

indiscriminate bombardment trapping an estimated 160 000 people with little food water or medicine at least 5 000 people there have already died and the full toll could be as high as 10 000 according to one senior ukrainian official france greece and turkey have been hoping to launch a mass evacuation of civilians from mariupol within days but french president emmanuel macron after speaking with putin tuesday said conditions for the operation were not yet met calling the mariupol siege a crime against humanity happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet in real time zelenskyy urged

conservation and development last year according to vernon based slt consulting senior planner karen martin the analysis is being done in conjunction with other towns as well as the regional plan so we understand how the housing markets in the city and surrounding towns interrelate and how we can all work together in various ways to not only increase affordable housing but also address the number of housing issues we have that are affecting our demographics gold said according to the presentation the rivercog work is data driven and considers a number of factors the geography of the housing

speaking in warsaw president biden declared we have to fight the corruption coming from the kremlin to give the russian people a fair chance the great battle for freedom no u s president has more clearly related pervasive corruption to what biden has rightly called the great battle for freedom a battle between democracy and autocracy between liberty and repression between a rules based order and one governed by brute force the sanctions on major russian industries and the banking system will do grave damage to the russian economy but will sanctions on scores of individual russians curb corruption one needs to be skeptical who is targeted the scale of u s and european sanctions that are now being enforced is unprecedented when it comes to directly attacking corrupt russians then the prime targets are the business billionaires who are closest to vladimir putin and senior kremlin officials plus more than 350 members of the russian duma no opportunity will be missed for western authorities to seize whatever assets from mansions and yachts to fine art that they can prove belong to sanctioned oligarchs and others their western bank accounts are being frozen at least the ones that can be easily traced finding the dirty cash but the real wealth the laundered dirty cash of these sanctioned russians is invested in western stocks and bonds this may amount to hundreds of billions of dollars compared to which the value of the yachts and mansions are peanuts secrecy is paramount russian oligarchs have employed the highest priced lawyers auditors bankers and financial consultants in london zurich new york and other financial centers these enablers have worked assiduously over many years to build complex systems to ensure that the russian cash is safely invested and secretly invested vast sums of cash have been moved from russia via cyprus luxembourg london zurich geneva vienna and other european locations to multitudes of banks this is done via offshore holding companies registered in jurisdictions that ask no questions about who the true beneficial owners are aiding and abetting russian oligarchs then portions of the funds from these shell companies go via law firms and consulting firms into the international wealth management departments of major international banks the banks do not press for beneficial ownership information these banks then allocate the incoming cash to numerous hedge funds and private equity firms mostly in the world s largest capital market the united states proving crimes it is good news that the u s justice department has now established a special task force to hunt for the klepto cash but even if they can locate a small fraction of the oligarchs wealth then they have an even larger challenge can they prove the cash is the product of crime are we defenseless in time the oligarchs will go into court and challenge the seizures of their homes and yachts in europe and the freezing of their bank accounts they will claim that all these assets were bought legitimately for example two prominent oligarchs petr aven and mikhail fridman co owners of russia s alfa bank have long been the lead shareholders in a luxembourg investment company called letter one and its british affiliate of the same name sanctioned aven and fridman have been forced to give up control of letter one but they will no doubt claim that its business has always been legitimate and that their personal european properties and art collections have been financed from profits from this corporation and perhaps others in europe it may be exceedingly difficult to prove that this is not the case especially when the oligarchs engage the highest paid lawyers to tie government prosecutors in knots inadequate enforcement despite president biden s bold anti corruption assertions and all the current high profile press coverage of some of the oligarchs the bitter fact is that the budgets of western anti corruption agencies are woefully inadequate right now there are no positive indications that a dramatic increase in funding for anti corruption enforcement is being contemplated the key u s treasury department s enforcement branch had just 300 employees this total may rise modestly as a result of a modest budget increase even so its resources are totally inadequate when hundreds of billions of dollars of dirty cash from oligarchs kleptocrats and organized crime flow into the u s each year tax evasion anyone so you might say if it is hard to prove corruption against some of the oligarchs then why not take a leaf out of the old al capone book and bring tax evasion charges against them perhaps there is some merit here but note and here the oligarchs are no doubt laughing a very recent white house budget request to give the internal revenue service irs 30 million to go after sanctioned individuals was blocked in the u s congress the irs has long claimed it lacks adequate funds to do its routine work let alone

the good news is that president joe biden seems to be retreating somewhat from his expensive build back better proposal in the 5 8 trillion budget proposal he unveiled this week the better news is that he seems to have reversed course on military spending proposing a 4 increase the bad news is that the overall effect of what he proposed would not keep washington from spending more than it collects nor would it come to terms with inflation and the devastating ramifications of interest rate hikes on the amount the federal government has to pay on the interest of the national debt alone the president s budget purports to reduce the nation s annual deficit by 1 trillion but the details are fuzzy at best and the worse news is that he is proposing a levy on wealth that would tax unrealized earnings from the investments wealthy people have not yet sold if enacted which is unlikely this wealth tax would create perverse market distorting incentives the wall street journal has noted it would likely push investors toward illiquid assets such as real estate to avoid regularly liquidating stock to pay taxes as utahns know too well the real estate market already is distorted by supply chain disruptions and an imbalance in the supply and demand equilibrium creating an investment demand on top of these problems even if it were focused mainly on commercial real estate would create further hardships for struggling individuals and businesses it also may be unconstitutional the 16th amendment allows congress to tax income from whatever source derived but interest earnings or appreciation that exist only on paper are not income overall biden s budget is a nod to the fiscal and political realities that have taken hold in recent months the war in ukraine has suddenly brought new emphasis to the need for military readiness and the need to shore up important alliances inflation hit a 7 9 annual rate in february and a new deseret news hinckley institute of politics poll shows people in utah tend to blame democrats for this more than any other factor other opinion polls continue to show voters favoring republicans in congressional races ahead of this november s elections and that more people disapprove than approve of the president s performance key democrats have kept the president from enacting his package of expensive social spending and inflation has soured many people on the idea of washington wanting to spend more all these things seem to have moderated the president s agenda but the truth is that this budget along with many previous ones proposed and enacted by republican and democratic majorities would not come close to solving the growing problem of deficit spending the federal reserve recently raised interest rates and has announced its intention to raise them more in coming months while this may be the fed s only tool to curb inflation the effect of higher rates on the nation s economy should not be minimized the nonprofit watchdog committee for a responsible federal budget has said every half percent rise in interest rates translates into 1 trillion more in budget deficits between now and 2031 with rates that are one or two percentage points higher deficits would be 2 1 trillion or 4 2 trillion larger respectively through fiscal year 2031 more specifically the committee said biden s proposed budget would take the national debt from 102 4 of gross domestic product in fiscal year 2022 to 106 7 by 2032 prior to the pandemic its analysis said debt was less than 80 of gdp if the pandemic and the war in ukraine have demonstrated anything it is that the united states needs the economic reserves to confront unforeseen problems both domestically and on a global scale america s place as a beacon of liberty to the world demands the fiscal strength necessary to exude influence and power we appreciate president biden s nod to the need for deficit reduction however the numbers demonstrate convincingly that both parties in washington need to get serious about the nation s fiscal health before inflation interest and overspending weaken the nation in significant ways

help enlighten your fellows be sure to pass this on survival depends on it imperialism is only the degenerate monopoly phase of capitalism by karl north this is a repost we are seeing a planet wide shift in geopolitical ascendency that is political economic and cultural and is unprecedented in the last five hundred years it is a slow process that one could best describe as tectonic in scale like a slanted table set with nations all sliding in one direction which gradually rights itself becomes flat then starts to incline in another direction as this change will affect all humanity to one degree or another it is important to be aware of the acceleration of the process that can be witnessed at the present time and to begin to adapt to its consequences this essay is an attempt to describe the driving forces a number of irreversible processes are in play to contract all industrial economies permanently planetary depletion of finite natural resources fossil energy and minerals is undermining all economies however in addition related irreversible trends are upsetting economies in the western nations causing them to collapse first for reasons i will explain the decline of the west has freed other nations from us imperial subservience to emerge as a counter force at the outset i want to at least raise the question of who or what is causing the tectonic tilt as keeping it in mind may assist a reading of the causes a number of those who study society from the perspective of political economy the concentration of power and wealth and the pattern of decision making that flows from it are seeing indications that the apparent step by step disintegration of the west may be a controlled demolition on the part of ruling elites or at least an attempt of it according to this hypothesis elites fabricate disasters like pandemics and conjure evil enemies to blame for deepening impoverishment and thus create a climate of fear as a way of building assent to a soft dictatorship others see the decline of the west as a system of private control of power and wealth that is increasingly spinning out of control and collapsing due to inherent contradictions that elites could not foresee or at least could not prevent my view encompasses a degree of both perspectives some elite factions anticipated the collapse and are trying various ploys to deflect the blame from themselves others prone to desperation as problems multiply are putting off the inevitable with make shift responses that cause more harm in the end whether controlled or not the factors contributing to the decline of the west and the rise of a constellation of powers led by china and russia can be outlined as follows the end of the dollar as the global reserve currency internal contradictions of the capitalist system the emergence of new superpowers repeated policy disasters in the western reaction to the shift i will discuss these as dynamic interdependent processes the end of the petrodollar supremacy for over a century many peoples of the earth have suffered an economic exploitation and political subjugation by the us anchored by the dollar as the world reserve currency an agreement in the early 1970s strengthened this scheme whereby saudi arabia followed by other similar oil producers would sell oil the key industrial energy source only in dollars and in return the us would protect their medieval monarchies from modernization or overthrow analysts have dubbed this state of affairs the petrodollar era because oil replaced gold as the standard underpinning the value of the dollar in recent years a number of non western nations have sought to escape from the dollar trading system and have collaborated to build an alternative leading the way russia and china have steadily increased bilateral trade over the last six years with a declining percentage of it in dollars then a long term chinese trade deal with iran removed a large chunk of iranian oil exports from the dollar trade zone more recently saudi arabia is finalizing a deal to sell oil in yuan with china their largest customer because such oil trades directly threaten to end the reign of the petrodollar system and the reserve currency status of the dollar previous oil producer attempts to avoid trading in dollars have triggered invasions iraq libya by the us and its nato vassals when the dollar is no longer the world reserve currency the us economy will suffer a major shock because it will no longer be able to print dollars to pay for imports that its deindustrialized economy no longer produces now in what may be the coup de grace for the petrodollar system russia in response to western sanctions has decided to take payment only in rubles for all exports to hostile mostly western countries the global economy relies on russian exports of essentials like energy oil gas enriched uranium and microchip raw materials europe relies on russia for nearly half of its energy consumption the us needs to import significant amounts of russian oil moreover after stealing the gold reserves of nations such as venezuela afghanistan libya iraq and ukraine and impounding dollar reserves of russia western banks have proven themselves unreliable depositories countries are dumping dollar reserves if all the above described actions hold they will accelerate de dollarization and the geopolitical tilt away from the west inherent contradictions of capitalism political economists have exposed the mechanisms of the capitalist system whereby over time wealth and power concentrate in a minority class using this accumulated wealth and power to serve its interests better the power elite captures the apparatus of state and achieves control of all federal agencies originally mandated to force business interests to serve the public freed from the last vestiges of regulatory control unfettered laissez faire capitalism inevitably distorts every sector of the economy to maximize private profit over the public good economic sectors claiming to serve the public interest the pharmaceutical industry the weapons industry industrial agribusiness communications scientific research etc fall under monopoly control becoming legalized rackets for shaking down the public so like the private public partnership known as japan inc the economic sectors under capitalism evolve into war inc healthcare inc agri food inc etc as it turns out spending in the medical industrial complex at 3 8 trillion is more than twice as much as the military at 1 7 trillion what the pandemic caper revealed when its lies were fully exposed was a gamut of corruption that showed just how powerful big pharma actually is the corruption encompassed a range of agencies from the world health organization to the food and drug administration the center for disease control the health and human services agency including its research arm and the national institute of health it showed that the corruption reached into the patent office university departments and scientific journals all in all it is astonishing that the us public has been persuaded to live with what can only be described as a political economy of legalized racketeering also perplexing is that the public has mentally normalized the deindustrialization of america after global trade and financial infrastructure and emergent economy growth created favorable conditions the export of the us industrial base to cheap labor regions primarily asian followed as a normal function of a capitalist system serving its primary goal to maximize profit whatever the social or ecological cost the offshoring of much of the us industrial base to countries like china was a most un american anti patriotic act of class warfare but the international banker elites who provided the investment capital sold the industrial decline to the us public as serving us interests just not saying whose class interests and china s oligarchs got us technology and intellectual property so both oligarchies benefited europe is suffering the same loss of industrial base but more slowly due to a stronger public sector in its economy the consumer base that furnishes the profits in the west has declined along with the industrial base but that matters little to international banker elites because 1 in recent decades they have delivered cheap credit to fuel the consumerism temporarily in the west while 2 the emergent economies the bankers invest in grow their consumer market replacement meanwhile elites continue to concentrate wealth in their hands by replacing the declining productive economy in the west with a speculative one kept alive for a time by government bailouts and money printing that drain wealth from the public via inflation the export of the industrial sector increasingly leaves the us as a warehouse economy distributing foreign made goods of the remaining economy the military industrial complex survives because it has a captive consumer the tax payer the medical industrial complex also relies on the tax payer in part and on the essential service the public so desperately needs however the inconvenient consequences of the above described workings of the capitalist system are reaching a critical mass the downsizing and resultant debt peonage left generations impoverished and angry relative to their parents generations civil unrest is rising fear campaigns like the pandemic and hate propaganda against russia and china are not fully succeeding in deflecting public attention from the core economic problems over time as the shock value wears off the desperation policy of an endless succession of emergencies is achieving the discredit of all major institutions western finance is painted into a corner raising interest rates is off the table because of all the debt that will be called in which would crash the stock market the likely alternative is to hold rates low which will make it impossible to control inflation so the goal will be to keep rigging the stats and the narrative to delay public perception of inflation as long as possible to put off a tipping point where awareness rips through the collective consciousness when that happens hoarding begins and shelves go bare quickly and hyperinflation occurs savings evaporate etc policy fiascos that accelerated the tilt over the last 30 years and especially since it orchestrated the overthrow of an elected government in 2014 the us has created a nazi police state in ukraine that has demonstrated genocidal intentions against the slavic mostly russian majority the goal has been to provoke a russian intervention to protect these russian populations with the ultimate objective to 1 use the political fallout to shore up us control of its european vassals and 2 hopefully weaken russia by dragging it into a quagmire in the ukraine conflict the us cannot militarily oppose russia so it resorts to sanctions however all the sanctions are hurting the western economies and ultimately strengthening the russian economy also the war in ukraine is driving china and russia closer together exposes the fault lines in the nato alliance as some nations refuse to support the war or the sanctions and is revealing the increasing vigor of the multipolar world as nations like india refuse to toe the us party line conclusion the west faces insurmountable problems internally as well as in external relations as the west declines china has become the largest economy in the world and is allied with a russia that has achieved military technological superiority and covers the largest land area in the world this alliance has become the basis of a multipolar counterweight to five centuries of western dominance like russia and china many of the economies that are attracted to the multi polar world have mixed economies and do not share the extreme laissez faire economic model of the us called neoliberalism asian cultural values will likely gain prominence as well the geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting as aware observers watch in fascination at this extraordinary process karl north the author in his own words i have been a student a farmer a business owner and a teacher as a student my strongest focus for over 50 years has been systems ecology and political economy the power relations in social systems in occasional posts i will explore and demonstrate the use of systems thinking learning and design tools for a sustainable future motivating this work is an underlying assumption that the end of the petroleum era will force fundamental changes in all major human institutions and that the changes will be most painful if we fail to plan and adapt to meet them the views expressed herein are solely those of the author and may or may not reflect those of the greanville post however we do think they are important enough to be transmitted to a wider

you pass it on to at least 2 other people requesting they do the same
since its earliest days npr has had women s voices on the air and women correspondents covering the tough beats although there were fewer women than men in leadership roles at npr in the early days now over half of npr s executive team is made up of women to close women s history month i d like to highlight some of the women in leadership at npr i wanted to understand how their experiences lead them where they are how npr s culture is with this dynamic and what advice they would reach back and give here are their answers what was crucial to your success selyn hong who was just promoted to chief people officer underlines the importance of believing in the mission of the company and the people you work with selyn hong selyn hong selyn hong chief people officer selyn hong i think doing work that aligns with my values for an organization whose mission i believe in has been crucial it s instilled in me a passion and drive to try to do my best work and to persevere even when the road has been bumpy and uncertain i ve been incredibly lucky in that npr is full of people who inspire me to keep trying my best and to not give up people who care deeply about others the world we live in the workplace we work in and our commitment to the public every time i ve met and gotten to know someone at npr it s turned out to be an opportunity to learn to laugh to be moved or to grow i also credit my support system both inside and outside of npr for any successes i ve had to date and any i may have in the future they re essential those people you inherently trust those people who believe in you who champion and mentor you those people full of integrity who model the behaviors you want to have those people who will tell you the truth when it s easier to avoid it because the truth will help you or others i don t think i could have succeeded without those people they make me better every day and i m so grateful for them edith chapin vp and executive editor speaks to the opportunities she was given at npr and how crucial it is to experience many roles to develop your skills edith chapin i was very fortunate to be able to alternate jobs that had me working in the office and in the field so i learned quickly to appreciate the needs of people in both roles i also made sure i was good at balancing out the skills of whatever team i worked with on a given job or assignment i said yes to most opportunities and made sure i was as well rounded as possible with assignments covering national stories living and reporting overseas and then in washington it is unusual to get all three of those experiences but i did and it has made me a much stronger journalist i also made sure to learn something from colleagues with more experience than me sometimes what to do and sometimes what not to do unfortunately you only get experience by getting it so you have to be moderately patient but learn a lot as you go along at npr our leaders are humble and modest so i wanted to provide an opportunity for these women to promote their work and toot their own horn only nancy barnes svp for news editorial director decided to respond to this question although in true npr fashion she tooted npr s horn instead of her own how do you feel about the impact of your contribution to npr stephen voss stephen voss stephen voss edith chapin vp and executive editor nancy barnes i am incredibly proud of all the tremendous journalism the newsroom has contributed to the world and to our audiences in these most recent years of a pandemic a renewed racial justice movement natural disasters an

the semi official united states government plus media lie machine knows that constructing a plausible reason to bomb the crap out of someone all depends on where you begin your narrative if you keep starting your accusations at a point where the target has done something bad all you have to do is repeat yourself over and over again to drown out any alternative backstory that surfaces and if you really want to demolish all contrary views all you have to do is liken the targeted foreign leader to adolph hitler and keep repeating that tactic was used with saddam hussein of iraq and is now being employed against vladimir putin of russia and it always works in the current context of ukraine versus russia the trick has been to tie everything to the invasion by putin s armed forces over four weeks ago an undoubted act of aggression aggression or legitimate self preservation eds once you establish that as your launching point preceding developments are rendered moot who cares about us promises not to expand the nato alliance eastwards after the soviet union broke up in 1991 and there is also washington s role in regime change in ukraine in 2014 or even the relentless demonization of russia linked to the 2016 us presidential election followed by any unwillingness by washington to negotiate even the most reasonable of putin s demands fuggedabout it and also forget about considering whether or not the us has any national interest in going to war over ukraine only tucker carlson and tulsi gabbard seem inclined to challenge the basic premise which is to raise the question since russia does not threaten us why are we doing this do we really want a possible nuclear war over ukraine just read the new york times and you will learn that it is not about what s good for america at all it is all about a big bully country attacking a democratic neighbor with the us and its brave allies standing up as the standard bearers of a washington imposed rules based international order and now the us is upping the ante by pushing ahead with its insistence that russia is committing war crimes but convincing the world on that point is a bit more difficult to accomplish if one were to ask the question which nation in the world commits the most war crimes the general international response might well be israel or the united states part of the problem would be working out an acceptable definition for a war crime while also developing a methodology for defining the most if israel attacks syria four times in a week is that four separate war crimes or only part of one continuous war crime as the united states has military bases in both syria and iraq that the respective governments have not authorized and have in fact asked the americans to leave is that a single war crime of illegal invasion and occupation or a continuous one punctuated only by the occasions when us troops kill a few of the natives in any event it is difficult to convict russia as neither israel nor the us has ever been held accountable for the war crimes they have committed to include shooting and bombing civilians hospitals schools at random and occasionally wedding parties and other social gatherings president george w bush even started a couple of wars in places like afghanistan and iraq based on fabricated intelligence and the greatly beloved barack obama did the same to libya and syria both are now regarded as venerable elder statesmen even though they should be in prison and there is lately some talk among democrats of seeing obama or his wife run again in 2024 for the highest office in the land and is that hillary waiting in the wings for a second try either way it will be a bad day for anyone trying to establish a modus vivendi for working with russia america s blood lust vis à vis russia is completely bipartisan with the few sensible voices in congress drowned out by the drumroll in high places accompanying the avalanche of propaganda pouring out of the mainstream media it has long been axiomatic that the first victim of war propaganda is truth but the united states only needs the stimulus of the possibility of war or conflict to begin its pattern of lying and as the current situation illustrates it is quite prepared to designate enemies that in reality do not threaten the country it did so to bring about a greatly enlarged us commitment in vietnam and also through the cold war by deliberate cia overestimates of the power and reach of the soviet union since 9 11 there has been a succession of presidents who have lied about nearly everything relating to national security and foreign policy leading to invasions assassinations other types of interventions and a sanctions prone government that has denied ordinary citizens of food and medicines while leaving the leadership of the targeted countries untouched one of the recent lies is a replay of the old let s get saddam hussein playbook remember those savage iraqi soldiers tearing kuwaiti babies out of their incubators and throwing them onto the floor of course it was all a lie concocted by the kuwaiti ruling family and us government largely neocon accomplices now we are learning that the vile russians bombed a maternity hospital except of course that it may have turned out to be completely untrue and the media is now exclaiming that russia is putting the planet on the brink of world war 3 while the new york times is indicting political conservatives as purveyors of russian propaganda actually it was the united states and nato that have opened the door to a possible nuclear holocaust but one hates to dispute what is an apparently a profitable and well received storyline but the best bit of lying has to be the ongoing propaganda war over twenty six biological laboratories in ukraine funded at least in part by the pentagon nothing to see here says the biden white house while russia is saying just a minute folks meanwhile the plot thickens as emails have now surfaced indicating that joe biden s son hunter was involved in obtaining and profited from the us government s funding of the labs the biolab controversy began when the united states government s state department number three victoria nuland recently admitted to a congressional panel that the labs exist and also added that ukraine possesses chemical and biological weapons she then realized her error and both backtracked and elaborated that uh ukraine has uh biological research facilities we are now in fact quite concerned that russian troops russian forces may be seeking to uh gain control of so we are working with the ukrainiahhhns on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of russian forces should they approach the statement is absurd as the russians undoubtedly already possess their own stocks of bioweapons the existence of the labs themselves may be linked to the legacy of the break up of the soviet union in 1991 when by one account the us provided assistance through its cooperative threat reduction program to manage the existing bio and chem labs lest their toxic chemicals and pathogens fall into the wrong hands but the us has actually done much more than that ron unz observes how over the decades america had spent over 100 billion dollars on biodefense the euphemistic term for biowarfare development and had the world s oldest and largest such program one of the few ever deployed in real life combat currently the us government claims blandly that the labs which are run by america s department of defense remain active for peaceful research and the development of vaccines the us embassy in kiev described the activity in greater detail as working to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern and to continue to ensure ukraine can detect and report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens before they pose security or stability threats some ukrainians have however been suspicious of their purpose particularly as their activities are secret and are managed by the pentagon rather than some civilian agency and if the original objective was to prevent the development of bioweapons why is the us still hanging around seventeen years later former ukrainian prime minister mykola azarov who held the post under president viktor yanukovych spoke about how the decision to start collaborating with the americans was taken by prime minister yulia tymoshenko s office and subsequently implemented under president viktor yushchenko in 2005 it was generally believed in the government that the agreement was focused on ukrainian biosecurity but all its related activities were and are classified and ukrainian citizens were not even allowed to work together with the americans there was some pushback on the labs to include a cursory inspection in 2010 2012 and by 2013 the ukrainian government sent an official letter demanding that the labs be closed the 2014 regime change intervened however and the decision was never implemented by the new regime it should be noted that if one is to protect against toxins and pathogens one must first create them in order to manipulate them or prevent them if one thinks back to the notorious anthrax scare in the united states in 2001 investigators determined that the lethal strain of the pathogen had actually been created in a us army biological weapons lab at fort detrick maryland one might also consider covid and the widely held belief that the wuhan institute of virology had been manipulating various coronavirus strains to make them more contagious and lethal nuland clearly admitted that there were us funded bioweapons in ukraine when she expressed concern that russia might occupy one of the labs and be tempted to acquire the material for its own use against kiev and the biden administration clearly embarrassed by the admission has attempted to turn the tables by rejecting russian suggestions that the labs might be seeking to design biological pathogens that target certain ethnic groups which is why the existing labs have been placed all around the world including ukraine as far back as 2017 russian president vladimir putin expressed his concerns about us collection of biological material from ethnic russians as unz puts it certainly a very suspicious project for our government to

starting some kind of hopefully manageable war to boost the president s sinking approval ratings now that joe biden is talking tough it is hard to imagine how he will get off of the horse that he is

human history

demand for workers remained strong in february as the u s economy faced growing headwinds from europe according to labor department data released tuesday job openings hires and quits held close to record highs set in december according to the february job openings and labor turnover report even as high inflation and the impending war in ukraine rattled markets and the economy employers had 11 3 million open jobs listed on the final business day for the second consecutive month since openings set a record at 11 4 million in december hires rose to 6 7 million in february a gain of 200 000 from january while separations stayed even at 6 1 million millions of americans start and leave jobs each month through the normal churn of the economy usually resulting in a net gain of hundreds of thousands of jobs but workers have enjoyed historic leverage over employers as businesses seek to fill millions of jobs from a much smaller labor force than before covid 19 emerged the hires and quits rates have been moving in the same general direction for months they both ticked up slightly in february workers continue to quit and get hired at fast rates in today s economy said elise gould senior economist at the economic policy institute in a tuesday analysis layoffs held even at 1 4 million and the quits rate the percentage of u s employees who voluntarily left their jobs ticked slightly higher to 2 9 percent a record first set in december a total of 4 4 million workers left their jobs voluntarily in february likely to take another job with better compensation or career opportunities at the end of february the labor market was very tight job openings remain elevated and workers are seizing those opportunities by quitting their jobs wrote nick bunker economic research director at indeed hiring lab in a tuesday analysis bunker said that while flatlining job openings and a plateau in the quits rate could be signs of a relative cooldown after months of steady advances the labor market still remains quite hot compared to pre pandemic norms the u s added 678 000 jobs in february despite concerns of a slowdown driven by the emergence of the omicron variant of the coronavirus the economy has added more than 1 million jobs since the start of 2022 but faces new risks driven by the war in ukraine the russian invasion and strict economic sanctions imposed on moscow have boosted pressure on food and energy prices rattled financial markets and increased the risk of an economic slowdown and while the u s labor market and consumer spending held strong amid rising tensions overseas in february it is unclear how a subsequent spike in gas prices may have affected march hiring the labor department is set to release the march jobs report friday which is calculated through two surveys conducted the week including the 12th day of the month one conducted to see how many new workers businesses added and a poll of households to see how they have fared in the labor market while the war in ukraine is unlikely to significantly impair u s job gains in march the disruption to global energy markets and surge in inflation does present a risk to the economic outlook moving forward daniel zhao senior economist at glassdoor said in a tuesday research note we re at an inflection point in the recovery where the fundamentals of the job market remain strong but risk factors continue to accumulate zhao like many economists still expects another solid jobs gain in march thanks in part to the historically strong demand for workers consensus estimates from economists project a gain of roughly 490 000 jobs in march and a decline in the unemployment rate to 3 7 percent just 0 2 percentage points above pre pandemic levels zhao also expects wage growth to have kept climbing after an increase of 5 1 percent over the 12 months ending in february the surge in quits we ve seen is mirrored by a surge in job openings and the two measures have tended to move hand in hand even during the last two years despite pandemic forces the dramatic increase in demand for workers is pushing employers to compete fiercely and that gives current workers more opportunities to find a better fitting or higher paying job he said

as russia promised to scale down military operations around two ukrainian cities including kyiv both ukrainian and us officials remain skeptical with joe biden stating we ll see if they follow through with what they re suggesting video reuters the russian economy is contracting at the fastest rate since 1998 a top washington official has said as he vowed to work with the european commission to close off loopholes to stop moscow evading the effect of sanctions imposed due to its invasion of ukraine it comes as russia fought back to bolster its economy against a punishing wave of sanctions imposed by the world s richest economies the fall in value of the rouble has stabilised as the regime of vladimir putin said it would demand payment in its currency for gas deliveries while a collapse in stock prices was avoided as the russian market reopened under highly controlled conditions for the first time in a month the eu has said it will focus on implementing existing sanctions rather than agreeing additional measures for now as momentum for additional steps falters due to opposition among some member states to the potential economic cost speaking in brussels as he met ireland s eu commissioner for financial services mairéad mcguinness for talks about co ordinating further on sanctions the us deputy secretary of the treasury wally adeyemo said the sanctions were removing russia s ability to wage war and that capital was fleeing the country read more it s important to note what s happening to the russian economy today because of those significant actions the russian economy is contracting at a faster pace than it has since 1998 when it defaulted on its debt he said anyone who has money in russia today is trying to get that money out as quickly as possible because of our actions and that s why the kremlin has put in place draconian capital controls ensuring that people who have money in russia are unable to take that money out he added these actions are being taken because the kremlin is seeing that its resources are dwindling the resources that it is using to pay for its unprovoked war in ukraine economic pain mr adeyemo and ms mcguinness said the us and eu would now co ordinate to prevent companies individuals or countries from evading the effect of sanctions and to ensure agreed measures are implemented across jurisdictions the key is to ensure effective and full implementation of sanctions across jurisdictions this is a priority ms mcguinness said sanctions are crucial for imposing economic pain on putin s regime and those who are complicit in this war the sanctions make it much harder for the kremlin to pursue its illegal attack at the expense of its neighbour she added we re in lockstep on sanctions and we ll continue to co ordinate our response with the strongest determination and unity no additional sanctions package was put forward to the eu 27 at a summit last week in the weeks ahead of the summit poland estonia latvia and lithuania had pushed for additional sanctions to be agreed in talks between the diplomats of eu member states but they met resistance from countries including germany italy hungary and bulgaria which were concerned about the economic price of going further and particularly of affecting energy imports from russia germany had previously also pushed for exemptions in transactions with state owned companies for aluminium copper palladium and iron ore while extending the time companies have to wind down trade from three to six months a diplomat said instead of agreeing to pursue additional sanctions the eu has now said it will focus on implementing the measures already agreed and closing any potential loopholes there is concern in brussels and washington that china or other global powers may help russia to lessen the effect of sanctions such as by doing trade on moscow s gold reserves the issue is expected to be in the background at a meeting of chinese and eu leaders later this week

by lucy bayly cnn business the bond market just flashed a warning sign that has correctly predicted almost every recession over the past 60 years an inversion of the us treasury note yield curve an inverted yield curve is often seen as a signal that investors are more nervous about the immediate future than the longer term spurring interest rates on short term bonds to move higher than those paid on long term bonds the curve inverted briefly tuesday for the first time since september 2019 that shouldn t be particularly surprising given how russia s invasion of ukraine and its economic ramifications continue to weigh heavily on the global economy treasury notes are essentially a loan to the us government and are generally seen as a safe bet for investors since there is little risk the loan won t be paid back these government bonds have seen a flood of interest in recent weeks amid geopolitical uncertainty and tightening financial conditions the federal reserve said at its policy meeting earlier this month that it is considering as many as six more rate hikes in 2022 alone that s making investors lose their appetite for stocks and other more volatile assets and turn to dependable investments like treasuries but as more people rush to buy bonds that causes the yield to fall which ends up making them a less attractive investment some investors are even starting to seek out assets like bitcoin and cash which traditionally offer less stability than bonds a 10 year treasury note typically delivers a higher rate of return than shorter term notes since an investor s money is committed for longer shorter duration treasury notes such as a 2 year or a 3 year bond generally offer lower yields because risks are more predictable than over a longer time horizon but when the return on a 10 year note is lower than the 2 year that indicates a pessimistic outlook on the part of investors and a reluctance to commit their money the 10 year yield fell to 2 383 on tuesday afternoon while the 2 year yield rose to 2 387 before the yield curve reverted once again barely a year ago the 10 year treasury yield was 1 50 higher than the 2 year a yield curve inversion has preceded every single recession since 1955 according to research from the federal reserve bank of san francisco an inversion doesn t mean stocks are about to go into meltdown while an inversion generally indicates a recession is coming within the following 12 months it can sometimes take years the curve inverted in 2005 but the great recession didn t start until 2007 the most recent inversion in 2019 prompted fears of a recession which materialized in 2020 but that was due to covid 19 this is a very healthy economy absent the inflation numbers patrick harker president of the federal reserve bank of philadelphia told cnbc tuesday after the inversion regardless some market participants are sounding the alarm bell i think there very well could be a recession or even worse activist investor carl icahn said last week in an interview with cnbc we have a strong hedge on against the long positions short term i don t even predict there is at least a one in three chance the us economy will have a recession over the next 12 months moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi told cnn business last week the harder the fed steps on the brakes the higher the probability the car seizes up and the economy goes into recession zandi said still tuesday s yield curve inversion was brief lasting for mere minutes the previous inversions lasted months at a time we ll have to see whether this was a blip or the beginning of a more prolonged warning sign the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

the onset of covid helped usher in anoticeable pivot toward build for rent purchases by single family rental providers at the same time overall existing home inventory has decreased in the past two years according to a new report build for rent properties constructed for the sole purpose of letting to tenants accounted for 26 of acquisitions by single family rental providers in the fourth quarter of 2021 the share was up from just 3 in the third quarter of 2019 according to the single family rental market index or sfrmi published by the national rental home council and john burns real estate consulting the surge in the share of bfr properties helped make up for the large drop of existing home acquisitions by single family rental providers which fell during the same period from 81 to 57 the index was determined using data from single family rental home providers across the united states who collectively manage more than 200 000 properties while the increase in acquisitions of build for rent homes could be seen as a business response in the current market characterized by a dramatic drop in existing for sale inventory overall rental growth is also fueling the trend said david howard executive director of the national rental home council current rental demand characteristics have given investors pretty good reason to support the asset class he said interest overall has surged for all types of rental housing including multifamily single family as well as build for rent much of it driven by the coronavirus pandemic we ve conducted surveys that have shown that last year for example 60 of new tenants in single family rental housing owned by our member companies came from urban multifamily high rise rental housing people are looking for more space howard said they have the option to perhaps relocate either to a new market or a new housing situation that offers them more space a front yard or garage and i think that s driving this demand across the single family rental home spectrum build for rent being a part of that landscape he added according to freddie mac the deficit in housing stock increased by 52 between 2018 and 2020 while at the same time harvard s joint center for housing studies also found 870 000 more renter households today compared to pre pandemic other research from earlier this year determined that new constructions were also making up a larger portion of the overall home sales market while construction and material costs of build for rent housing do not differ significantly from other new single family dwellings bfrs tend to have a smaller footprint keeping their overall prices down by comparison the size and amenities of build for rent housing also appeal to consumers not planning to stay for many years such as millennials who make up a large percentage of the sector s clientele according to the council s research these consumers tend to be younger professionals perhaps with children and are saving for a down payment or they re paying off student loan debt but the plan is definitely toward homeownership at some point howard said retired seniors and empty nesters no longer interested in homeownership also make up a segment of bfr tenants with a lot of build for rent community developments you have a managed professional management company who will provide landscaping services they ll take care of the home he added for a lot of seniors it s a very appealing lifestyle along with the changes in existing home and build to rent acquisitions the sfrmi also showed portfolio purchases made up just a 2 share of activity in the fourth quarter of last year down from 12 in the third quarter of 2019 purchases from ibuyers edged down to 2 from 3 in the same time frame meanwhile 13 of sfr investors made no new acquisitions in the final three months of last year

in a market where many asset classes from stocks and bonds to commodities and cryptocurrencies have been taking out record highs greed and fear of missing out fomo have become the main drivers while fundamentals have taken a back seat no one would mistake the bloodless run up in global stock markets credit and property over the past eight years for an echo of the dot com mania of the late 1990s or even a reprise of the roaring 20s yet only at the peak of those two bubbles has america s stock market been more expensive as a multiple of earnings measured over a ten year cycle but with ultra loose monetary policy coming to an end in the united states and other major world economies the experts are warning that it s best to tread carefully a point further driven home by a worrying pandemic the worst security crisis to face the world since wwii interspersed with nuclear braggadocio and trade tiffs here are three bearish indicators that suggest a recession could be knocking at the door 1 flattening yield curve the yield curve is the difference or spread between yields on short term and long term government bonds in a healthy bond market the longer the maturity the higher the yield on bonds with similar credit risk in other words short term yields are lower than long term yields because investors expect a bigger reward for lending their money for a longer time giving the yield curve an upward sloping shape and a blinking red warning sign has appeared on march 24 the yield on five year u s treasury notes was 2 40 and the yield on seven year notes was 2 43 both were higher than the 2 38 yield on 10 year treasury notes an inversion in the yield curve doesn t necessarily trigger a recession but suggests bond investors are worried about the economy s long term prospects still there s reason to be concerned because an inverted yield curve has correctly predicted every recession since 1955 with only one false signal in nearly 70 years 2 runaway inflation even assuming the yield curve is giving another false red flag meaning we are not on the brink of a recession the prognosis is not very encouraging either because the only time an inverted yield curve did not lead to a recession it beckoned something just as bad the great inflation which lasted all the way from the mid 1960s into the early 1980s u s inflation level has now hit 7 9 a level last seen in 1982 around the time the last great inflation ended but it could get worse still traders are now pricing in a u s inflation rate heading for 8 6 through march and april before federal reserve officials even get a chance to deliver a possible 50 basis point interest rate hike in may the fed last week delivered its first rate hike in four years raising the fed funds rate by 25 basis points unfortunately this might have been the time that the market and society needed a shock and awe showing the fed is still very focused on holding inflation down to hike rates by 25 basis points with no quantitative tightening has almost put fuel on the fire main street is saying we can raise prices however we want to without regard to competition so far it is right gang hu a tips trader with new york hedge fund winshore capital partners has told marketwatch 3 slowing house market so far nothing has done much to slow down the ongoing housing boom although not for lack of theories predicting how it s going to end but the red hot housing market is now facing its biggest nemesis yet soaring mortgage rates over the past three months mortgage rates have posted their largest jump since the 90s with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate currently standing at 4 42 up from 3 11 in december the enticement of record low mortgage rates has been the biggest driver in the housing boom encouraging more buyers to jump into the market as home prices soared low rates have been helping alleviate some of the burden for homebuyers but with mortgage rates now climbing sharply it s very likely to have the opposite effect by increasing buyers borrowing costs at a time when they re already stretched thin by record home price growth indeed experts are warning that the move up rapid move up in mortgage rates amounts to a major economic shock ian shepherdson of pantheon macroeconomics predicts a 25 decline in u s home sales from the annual pace of 6 02 million set in february to a rate of 4 5 million by the end of summer the counterargument against a recession that said several critical recession signals remain in the green first off industrial production a key indicator of economic strength rose 0 5 in february to a level that is 103 6 above the 2017 average and 7 5 above what it was at this time last year the us purchasing managers index pmi which tracks sentiment among buyers who work for manufacturing and construction firms came in at 57 3 last month more than 6 higher than the u s average over the last decade meanwhile the u s economic policy uncertainty index which measures policy related worries also fell to 139 in february down from over 200 in december 2021 indicating fears surrounding a policy mishap from the federal reserve or biden administration are rapidly fading maybe the outcome of the ukraine crisis will be the final straw that pushes the u s economy into a full blown recession or pulls it back into recovery mode

magic mushrooms shrooms and the ever famous liberty cap are all familiar terms for the same groovy fungus popularized in the western world in the late 50s psychedelic mushrooms have been used for centuries in a number of different cultures and religions psychedelic mushroom use can be traced back to over 6000 years ago to rock art found near villar del humo in spain selva pascuala is a rock cave in eastern spain that archaeologists have discovered contains several rock paintings of psychoactive mushrooms mushroom experts say that the paintings appear to illustrate a specific species of psychoactive mushroom psilocybe hispanica the only psilocybin mushroom native to spain an even more interesting mushroom in this family however is psilocybe aztecorum p aztecorum can be found across the western us as well as in central and south america their name stems from their assumed roots in aztec history which describes them as a key part of aztec religious and cultural rituals they called these varieties teotlnanáctl mushrooms which translates into god s flesh mushrooms however it was not always clear exactly what type the teotlnanáctl mushrooms were or if the god s flesh mushroom still exists so what s so special about these mushrooms and why was their discovery so important to understanding aztec spiritual perspectives illustrated card with psychedelic mushrooms stellar bones adobe stock the magic of teotlnanáctl mushrooms lies in psilocybin all forms of psychedelic mushrooms are a part of the psilocybe family a family of mushrooms known for their high psilocybin content psilocybin is a psychedelic compound that turns into psilocin once ingested by an individual psilocin is ultimately the substance that then causes the variety of hallucinogenic symptoms and effects seen in those brave enough to consume a psilocybin mushroom it is thought that psilocin is able to cause these psychedelic effects due to its structural similarity to serotonin when psilocin is present in the body it is physically capable of latching onto serotonin receptors in the prefrontal cortex the part of the brain responsible for cognitive behavior and executive function the binding of psilocin to a specific type of serotonin receptor there called 5 ht2a ultimately causes the psychedelic symptoms experienced by those who have taken psilocybin mushrooms those who have tried psilocybin mushrooms have reported physical symptoms including drowsiness muscle weakness euphoria nausea and vomiting other experiences include changes in visual auditory and tactile senses individuals may experience heightened senses or incorrect perceptions of their surroundings including changing colors moving surfaces and the warping or melting of objects psilocybin mushrooms can also heighten an individual s emotions at the time of taking them if an individual takes them while anxious they may find themselves more anxious than before this also applies to happiness relaxation and paranoia panic may set in in individuals who have ingested too much of the mushroom s at one time these heightened emotions may be the cause of so many cultures using them in religious or spiritual rituals a study from johns hopkins university revealed that when combined with positive behaviors such as meditation and spiritual practice a small dose of psilocybin caused long term changes in the traits and behaviors of those in the study participants reported feeling more altruistic grateful and forgiving after their experiences using psilocybin they also reported feeling closer interpersonal connections and a greater ability to cope with everyday stress interestingly research also suggests that psilocybin or psilocin are not known to cause dependency addiction like other recreational drugs xochipilli aztec god of flowers from book hallucinogenic plants by richard evans schultes with teotlnanáctl mushrooms motifs on his knees and ears u s forest service the aztec culture used lots of hallucinogenic substances the aztecs were a mesoamerican culture that formed in mid mexico around the year 1300 ad the aztecs are considered the ancestors of modern day nahuas mexico s largest recognized indigenous group the aztec culture was highly interwoven with their religion which focused on the worship of multiple deities including tlaloc quetzalcoatl tezcatlipoca xochipilli and several more and they are especially well known for their extensive usage of hallucinogenic substances such as teotlnanáctl mushrooms the aztecs believed that these deities were responsible for creating the universe and keeping it functioning if the gods were not pleased they may cease to keep the sun burning or prevent the earth from receiving resources to placate the gods they frequently engaged in blood sacrifices of both animals and their own people a sacrifice would ultimately thank the earth for her fruitfulness and encourage the gods to continually revive the sun their religious life also revolved around calendars a ritual calendar that was 260 days long and a solar calendar that was 365 days long the use of entheogens is a common theme amongst aztec artifacts recovered from mesoamerica entheogens are psychoactive substances that induce alterations in perception mood consciousness cognition or behavior in sacred contexts sculptures statues paintings writings and even fossilized remains of various entheogens such as the bufo toad all point to the regular consumption of hallucinogenic substances within aztec civilization the florentine codex a research study performed by bernardino de sahahun in the 16th century actually identifies at least five specific entheogens used by the aztecs research suggests that outside of regular use by citizens during festivals and times of celebration these hallucinogenic plants were predominantly used by officials including priests and nobility they would also be shared with visiting dignitaries as a form of welcome priests traditionally used the plants to engage in religious activities including divination prophecy healing and dream interpretation xōchipilli as depicted in the borgia codex public domain xochipilli the aztec god of fun another major piece of evidence pointing towards the aztec use of hallucinogens is their major deity xochipilli xochipilli was known to the aztecs as the god of summer flowers painting dancing love and creativity combined he was the god of fun further nicknamed the prince of flowers at festivals statues of xochipilli would be given offerings including corn and pulque an alcoholic beverage made from the maguey plant also known as agave at times pulque would also be mixed or taken with other entheogens to cause stronger physical effects of the recovered artifacts from aztec civilization a statue of xochipilli from the late post classical period 1450 1500 ad provides further insight into the use of teotlnanácatl mushrooms in aztec culture xochipilli sits upon a platform adorned with flowers butterflies and dots representing the sun on xochipilli himself are animal skins psychotropic flowers and teotlnanácatl mushrooms these psilocybin mushrooms were termed teotlnanácatl mushrooms a nahuatl term that can be translated into sacred mushroom or god s flesh mushroom specifically the term breaks down into teotl which translates into god and nanácatl which translates into fungus the teotlnanácatl mushrooms can be seen specifically adorning his ears and knees this suggests that hallucinogenic mushrooms would have been used by aztecs seeking pleasure creativity or emotional warmth outside of religious use further proof of this usage comes from francisco hernandez de toledo who was a physician to the king of spain in 1656 hernandez was a naturalist and spent much of his time and effort finding and researching natural plants that had medicinal uses and purposes as part of his work he wrote a guide to the new world to prepare missionaries to enter the mission field and be more aware of local resources and cultural differences in this guide he describes the frequent use of hallucinogenic mushrooms by mesoamerican natives specifically he states that the mushrooms caused madness in the natives claiming they caused them to see all kinds of things such as wars and the likeness of demons psilocybe aztecorum and psilocybe mexicana are the two primary candidates for the teotlnanácatl mushrooms used by the aztecs alan rockefeller cc by nc sa the great discovery of p aztecorum researchers observing these artifacts then had to consider what were these teotlnanácatl mushrooms and are they still around these questions went unanswered until 1956 when french mycologist roger heim discovered what he believed to be a cluster of psilocybe mexicana p mexicana was originally discovered by roger heim that same year and was originally thought to be the only species that could have been the teotlnanácatl described within aztec history as he researched the p aztecorum more thoroughly he decided to designate it as its own species due to differing physical characteristics from p mexicana specifically p aztecorum has a slightly different cap shape than p mexicana p aztecorum is normally identified by its convex or campanulate ball shaped cap shape while p mexicana has a conical or umbonate umbrella shaped cap shape in addition the spores of p aztecorum are purple while the spores of p mexicana are more purple brown p aztecorum also has smaller spores and is found at lower elevations compared to p mexicana these may sound like slight differences but they are quite noticeable to professional mycophiles and other mushroom experts heim named the species after the aztecs when he noticed their proximity specifically to aztec regions and also discovered their continued use amongst nahua communities p aztecorum was also one of the species mentioned in the 1957 life magazine article that brought the knowledge of magic mushrooms to the western world in the article r gordon wasson an american ethnomycologist describes the experiences he had using various psychedelic mushrooms during religious rituals performed by the mazatec people the mazatec are another indigenous mexican group which while different from the aztecs do share similar religious rituals and entheogen usage tendencies because of the location and description of p aztecorum some believe that this is the true teotlnanáctl mushroom described in aztec history however we cannot be certain that it was it is possible that the teotlnanáctl was simply p mexicana or perhaps the aztecs used both species in their ceremonies it is also possible that the aztecs did not differentiate between the two due to their similarity and therefore recognized both species as the sacred god s flesh mushroom used so often in their religious rituals since both mushrooms are part of the psilocybe family and therefore produce the same physical effects it would have been difficult to perceive a significant difference between them at the time regardless it is clear that the teotlnanáctl mushroom whether p aztecorum p mexicana or both still lives on and is used to this day mexican magic mushrooms alexander_volkov adobe stock shrooms still going strong though the use of psychoactive mushrooms in religious and cultural rituals is becoming less common as time progresses they are still used heavily in some areas of the world in particular central mexico still has high psilocybin mushroom usage amongst the nahua mazatec and zapotec groups they are also still heavily used in some native medical treatments especially those originally practiced by maría sabina a famous mexican healer known as the priestess of mushrooms throughout the 1900s because of human nature the use of psilocybin mushrooms as teotlnanácatl mushrooms were never not in use by the aztecs will likely never fully stop some cultures and religions will continue to use them in sacred passed down rituals others may continue to try them as recreational drugs an activity that has only grown in popularity in the western world since the 1950s regardless the full history of the use of these mushrooms is still being uncovered and we may never know the full extent to which they have been used in the past with more research and expert analysis perhaps someday we will learn even more about the teotlnanácatl mushroom and its uses within aztec culture and religion top image the mexican magic mushroom or teotlnanácatl mushroom is believed to be one or a mixture of these two psilocybin mushrooms of mexico psilocybe aztecorum and or psilocybe mexicana source alexander_volkov adobe stock by lex leigh

the summit demonstrates that the 2020 abraham accords pave a clear path to the end of the decades long arab israeli conflict it also represents a shift in the global balance of power and further cements israel as an emerging superpower not only in the region but on the world stage the late addition of egypt to the summit also represents a major step forward in the relations between israel and its immediate southern neighbor israel and egypt have maintained a cold peace since signing their original historic agreement in 1979 that peace agreement however was nearly in tatters when longtime egyptian president hosni mubarak was replaced by mohamed morsi of the muslim brotherhood and several of its clauses were quickly violated it wasn t until the takeover by current president abdel fattah el sisi that the cold peace was restabilized advertisement egypt s addition to the summit demonstrates its willingness to join in the warm spirit of normalization and economic opportunities with israel that the abraham accords have ushered in yet these dramatic steps forward are potentially being accompanied by subtle diplomatic missteps while israel s global position is growing by leaps and bounds as evidenced by the summit israel has yet to fully comprehend and embrace its emerging superpower status analyzing the accords it is important to note that the abraham accords were brokered and signed by different administrations in both the united states and israel both current administrations are more progressive in their foreign policy outlooks than their immediate predecessors the abraham accords came about for several reasons the first was the sudden and unfortunate lack of reliability by the united states to maintain stability in the region and support moderate actors the obama administration reversed decades long american policies in the middle east including ratcheting up diplomatic pressure on israel abandoning support for longtime allies saudi arabia and egypt and ignoring its own red lines such as syrian president bashar assad s use of chemical weapons at the same time former president barack obama turned america s favor towards some of the region s most malign actors throwing his support behind egypt s muslim brotherhood calling turkey s recep tayyip erdoğan a trusted friend and emboldening iran to the tune of 150 billion including airlifting 1 7 billion in cash following its entry into the ill fated joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa commonly known as the 2015 iran nuclear deal the iran nuclear deal gave the islamic republic the financial wherewithal to continue uranium enrichment and ballistic missile development and fund its regional hegemonic interests as the largest state sponsor of terror worldwide iran used large portions of the funds received following the signing of the jcpoa to bolster terror its islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc in addition to proxies hezbollah hamas and houthi rebels to destabilize nations and provinces throughout the region including iraq syria lebanon yemen and gaza iran s nuclear ambitions and reign of terror pose a threat to comparatively moderate forces throughout the region seeing as how their most powerful ally the united states had enriched iran and abandoned stable actors a new power broker in the region is needed enter the jewish state israel s rise to power former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu demonstrated significant strength over his 12 years in office under his leadership israel blossomed into the startup nation and became an emerging economic engine a surging gdp allowed netanyahu to invest heavily in strengthening israel s military with israel s technological prowess and superior intelligence capabilities the military quickly became the best in the region and one of the best in the world netanyahu also boldly stood up to obama by lobbying fiercely against the iran nuclear deal in a historic speech to a joint session of congress in 2015 the speech angered obama but dramatically raised israel s stock within the region as a nation that would fight diplomatically for its strategic interests once the deal was signed israel proved it would stand up for those same interests militarily that came in the form of frequent attacks on iranian installations and weapons movements in syria and covert operations in iran alleged cyber attacks on iranian nuclear facilities the assassination of nuclear scientists and the confiscation and removal of iran s secret nuclear archives a treasure trove of information in iranian nuclear capabilities and secret facilities the trump doctrine with the transition from the obama administration to the trump administration came a new formula to relations in the middle east strengthen and incentivize moderates and penalize malign actors former president donald trump pulled out of the jcpoa in may 2018 and installed harsh sanctions on iran over its nuclear violations and terror sponsorship he strengthened israel by officially recognizing jerusalem as the eternal united capital of the jewish state and israeli sovereignty over the strategic golan heights and by reversing policies that inherently viewed suburban settlement housing as illegal trump also penalized and defunded the palestinian authority over its lack of financial transparency incitement to terror and a scheme of pay to slay monthly stipends to terrorists in israeli prisons as well as the families of those killed in the act of first degree murder that account for 7 of the palestinian authority s total budget trump similarly shuttered a consulate to the p a in jerusalem now israel s sovereign capital and expelled the plo mission from washington d c more importantly he sought to reverse the famous four no s of obama s then secretary of state john kerry who insisted that peace between israel and its neighbors in the region was impossible without a negotiated solution to the israel palestinian conflict the trump administration found creative ways to incentivize moderate arab states to normalize relations with israel and in 2020 the historic abraham accords were signed israel now had normalization agreements with four countries in the region the uae bahrain morocco and sudan followed by subsequent agreements with kosovo and serbia obama 2 0 jcpoa 2 0 shortly after the accords were signed trump was replaced by the administration of joe biden many members of the biden team are holdovers from the obama administration members of kerry s state department and negotiators of the original jcpoa in the past year the new administration has managed to stall the progress of the abraham accords no additional agreements have been signed since the biden administration has taken office despite claims by the outgoing trump administration that several countries were prepared to do so part of the reason that the momentum of normalization agreement signings has stalled is that the biden administration is no longer incentivizing nations to make peace with israel rather than providing incentives to moderates the biden administration is following in the obama administration s footsteps pledging to remove sanctions and re enter the iran nuclear deal the current administration has slapped pressure on israel not to oppose the jcpoa 2 0 and is working to ensure israel does not take overt actions to strike at iranian nuclear infrastructure within israel the biden administration has pressured jerusalem to curb settlement building and to make financial gestures to the p a which the united states has undertaken to refund as well following four years of relative quiet during the short tenure of the trump administration israel had been forced to respond to a barrage of more than 4 000 rockets fired from gaza into civilian centers last may coupled with riots in israeli arab cities terror attacks like the one in hadera on the eve of the negev summit have dramatically increased with experts suggesting israel may find itself on the edge of a renewed intifada the administration has further destabilized the region through its hasty withdrawal from afghanistan which turned the country and billions in u s weaponry over to the taliban and to remove iranian backed houthi rebels in yemen from its lists of foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists just this week houthi rebels have attacked civilian energy infrastructure in saudi arabia as america races forward to sign a new nuclear deal with iran this one even weaker than the original the biden administration is considering an iranian demand to remove the irgc from its terror lists as well and ironically the united states and the european union are negotiating together with both russia and china to re enter the nuclear deal each of the parties negotiating with iran is struggling to assert or redefine its own superpower status this shaking of the global order is causing immense instability around the world opposition to the jcpoa meanwhile the only outright opponents of the deal are israel and the gulf states which are likely to be targets of further iranian aggression it is on the cusp of signing a new iran nuclear deal that this negev summit takes place although iran was mentioned briefly in most of the foreign minister s remarks to the press it was certainly at the top of the summit s agenda behind closed doors all of the summit s participants with the exclusion of the united states want the nuclear deal canceled had blinken not been among the participants the foreign ministers of each of country would most likely have come out much stronger in their public statements against the iran nuclear deal that would have increased the possibility for international recognition of the aligned regional view furthermore the strongest party in the room would have been israel by deferring to the united states the parties sent out a much weaker message that opposition to the iran nuclear deal is subservient to the foreign policy agenda of the biden administration at least from the optics of the negev summit press briefing blinken has demonstrated that he can keep israeli and arab opposition to the deal in check as world powers race to sign a deal of course statements told to the press and messages delivered behind closed doors are usually not the same allowing blinken to control the agenda makes lapid look like a junior partner in israel s own backyard the state of israeli politics the new israeli administration is significantly weaker than its predecessors current prime minister naftali bennett is backed by merely 6 knesset members in a government of 120 the mandate to form the government belonged to current foreign minister and alternate prime minister yair lapid who is scheduled to rotate into the premiership in august of next year the coalition lapid and bennett formed is made of ideologically opposed parties including an arab party that is linked to the muslim brotherhood the coalition has a narrow one member majority in parliament and struggles to pass votes netanyahu looms just outside the coalition as head of the opposition bennett has little discipline over the ministers in his cabinet he lapid defense minister benny gantz and president isaac herzog have advanced their own diplomatic initiatives it s not clear if each individual s initiatives fit into a well coordinated strategy steering israel towards negotiations after years without direct israeli contact gantz has held two separate meetings with p a leader mahmoud abbas monday on the same day as the negev summit took place just 70 miles to the north jordan s king abdullah ii met with abbas in ramallah a not so subtle protest of the negev summit amazingly gantz is reported to have sought to make it a trilateral ramallah meeting with bennett reportedly and thankfully vetoing gantz s participation both gantz and lapid have made it a diplomatic priority to steer israel back towards the track of a negotiated two state solution even without the backing of bennett and other right wing members of the coalition gantz and lapid are re elevating possible negotiations with a corrupt p a led by an 86 year old autocrat in year 17 of what was originally a four year term this comes despite the fact that the p a continues to incite its citizens to violence and has not canceled its pay to slay terror financing scheme gantz and lapid s moves have been made in concert with blinken who seeks to reverse the direction of peace in the middle east while the netanyahu and trump administrations understood that arab israeli peace could come from the outside in the biden administration wants pressure towards a two state solution to be at the center of any diplomatic initiatives in line with the previous policy of kerry this is the reason that blinken and subsequently the four arab foreign ministers all referenced a two state solution in their remarks it represents a diplomatic disaster for israel not because a two state solution still remains the primary accepted solution to the israeli palestinian conflict internationally but because the abraham accords have nothing to do with the palestinians and were signed despite decades of palestinian intransigence a model for coexistence and enforcement the abraham accords represent peace in exchange for peace normalization for the sake of cooperation in numerous fields including security and economic opportunities for lapid and blinken to turn the agreements into diplomatic levers to steer israelis and palestinians to the negotiating table when neither side is ready ultimately weakens the accords and israel rather the abraham accords should serve as a model for normalization that palestinians will ultimately have no choice but to follow such normalization between israelis and palestinians only remains possible if international actors including the united states will disincentivize the malign activity and corruption of the p a and incentivize peaceful co existence with israel through moderate actors who seek meaningful commercial and economic prospects each of the foreign ministers also took significant time in their short addresses to condemn the terror attack that killed two israelis and injured several others on the eve of the summit and to stand with the victims many of the statements intimated that the parties will never let terrorists defeat them what should have been stated clearly is that the new alignment of israel working together with arab partners not only provides a model for normalization but a security alliance that will root out terrorism and ensure that peace prevails through strength the regional alliance created by the abraham accords provides a model of strength and a model of opportunities the potential they bring to the region and the world is immense and has only just been unlocked the optics communicated by having the foreign ministers of former enemy nations standing together speaks volumes and offers tremendous hope for the months and years ahead it will be up to israel and the parties involved to build on the historic signings and this historic summit with all the challenges facing israel and its neighbors including an unstable structure of once reliable global superpowers and the growing likelihood of a rogue nuclear regime in iran this regional alliance is becoming more important by the day

into its operations overseas the united states has also thrown trillions of dollars at the research and development of new generation weapon systems washington march 28 xinhua amidst the ukraine crisis and surging domestic inflation the white house unveiled on monday a budget plan for the fiscal year 2023 calling for a boost in military spending though it is a mere wish as lawmakers make the final decisions on u s budget this attempt of the u s administration continued a dangerous trend of america s relentless drive to boost its military capabilities and presence around the globe which is likely to add more risks and uncertainties to the world s geopolitical tensions photo taken on march 28 2022 shows the capitol building in washington d c the united states xinhua liu jie excessive spending the comprehensive budget plan totaling 5 8 trillion u s dollars includes 813 3 billion dollars for national defense of which 773 billion is allocated for the u s department of defense the number is an increase of 30 7 billion dollars or 4 1 percent for the pentagon from what has been enacted for the previous fiscal year i m calling for one of the largest investments in our national security in history with the funds needed to ensure that our military remains the best prepared best trained best equipped military in the world u s president joe biden said in a statement his budget also includes 6 9 billion dollars for the north atlantic treaty organization nato and aid to ukraine among other things the hawks in washington want to jack up the military budget and use ukraine as an excuse and the proposed military spending was more than what was spent at the height of the korean or vietnam wars as well as that of the cold war commented william hartung a senior research fellow at the washington d c based think tank quincy institute for responsible statecraft as the world s largest military spender the united states accounted for 39 percent of global military expenditure in 2020 according to data published by the stockholm international peace research institute in 2021 it also spent more on defense than the next 11 countries combined in 2020 up from outspending the next 10 countries combined in 2019 this level of spending has long been excessive but after a pandemic that has claimed the lives of more americans than any war we fought continuing to throw money at the military is an act of willful disregard for the most urgent threats we face farhad manjoo an opinion columnist for the new york times wrote in a piece earlier this year while the united states has

constant wars a large amount of u s military funding has been poured into its operations overseas according to the congressional research service a public policy research institute of the u s congress and other sources u s armed forces military has waged war engaged in combat or otherwise invaded foreign territories in all but 11 years of its existence depending on one s definitions the years at peace may be even fewer some assume as i did that it s unusual that most new u s military recruits and most new u s college students have no memory of a time when their country wasn t at war david vine wrote in his book the united states of war a global history of america s endless conflicts from columbus to the islamic state to the contrary this state of war is the norm in u s history vine observed besides the united states has intervened in a series of conflicts by supporting a proxy with weapons funding and training leading to tremendous casualties as well as humanitarian tragedies and disasters some countries still at war consequently are struggling to find a path to peace and stability let alone reconstruction and revival america s obsession with warfare and high military spending has been largely driven by the nation s military industrial complex a powerful union of the military private defense contractors and politicians certain think tanks and journalists have often collaborated with them to spread and shape pro war narratives kovalik said he believes the military industrial complex is eager to see the conflicts between russia and ukraine go on because that s great for the defense industry whose stocks have recently gone through the roof that s why the u s is not engaged in the peace discussions because they just want to continue the war and that will mean more armaments to ukraine more armaments to countries like poland more armaments to nato again many of which will be blown up and that will require even more armaments and more profits kovalik explained hartung added the proposed budget boost by the white house is only going to benefit weapons contractors and members of congress who receive campaign contributions from them who use the arguments to get themselves elected a u s military vehicle runs past the tal tamr area in the countryside of hasakah province northeastern syria nov 14 2019 sustaining hegemony for the past several decades the united states has also been beefing up its global military presence to sustain its hegemony there is no enemy we defined new enemies and we created them observed peter kuznick director of the nuclear studies institute at american university this was just part of the u s global agenda the u s doesn t win these wars they allow the u s to maintain hegemony to that end the united states has set up approximately 750 military base sites in 80 foreign countries and territories according to a study published by the quincy institute for responsible statecraft in 2021 those u s bases cost an estimated 55 billion dollars annually u s bases in foreign lands often raise geopolitical tensions support undemocratic regimes and serve as a recruiting tool for militant groups opposed to the u s presence and the governments its presence bolsters said vine and two other researchers in a summary of the study in other cases foreign bases are being used and have made it easier for the united states to launch and execute disastrous wars including those in afghanistan iraq yemen somalia and libya they said the united states has also thrown trillions of dollars at the research and development of new generation weapon systems for example an official pentagon estimate showed that the f 35 program tasked with delivering the next generation combat aircraft is expected to cost a total of 1 7 trillion dollars across the fleet s lifecycle it costs up to 36 000 dollars per hour to fly the stealth jet u s congressman and chairman of the house armed services committee adam smith

crypto was big at yc this batch y combinator demo days returned yet again with another ballooning heap of startups in the old days a gaggle of techcrunch reporters would go to the demo day in person write up the presentations of each startup and hobnob with vcs during the breaks but in a post pandemic bloat yc has gotten just so massive that one comprehensive list of startups is neither feasible nor particularly useful to readers that said this was a massive year for crypto and i wanted to make sure that we profiled each and every crypto startup that publicly launched at demo days this batch the list of 25 26 companies unsurprisingly spans nfts defi web3 services and crypto investing a couple of notes on these descriptions these are listed in the seemingly random order in which they appeared on the yc demo days site the what it says it does sections are also taken from that site while the founders section is largely based on info from the linkedin profiles of the co founders of each startup i have not personally fact checked any of the information that was self reported by the founders themselves the quick thoughts section is made up entirely of my own insightful thoughts though i also cannot guarantee that they are always all that insightful now onto the startups but wait while i have you please do me a favor and subscribe to techcrunch s new crypto focused podcast

wallets are too geeky for mainstream users we are building a multi chain crypto wallet simplifying user experience for the mainstream users along with a crypto card founders kuberan marimuthu was previously a senior engineering manager at coinbase muthukrishnan ramabadran was a senior software engineer at lyft dheeban s g was a senior engineer at blockchain startup magic quick thoughts there are some major unknowns around what the future of consumer web3 look like but most investors are assuming that wallet apps will play a pretty central role in that future giving users a central place to host their coins and nfts cypherd is looking to make wallets a hub for usd assets as well giving users a mastercard debit card that they can use after converting crypto into usd inside the wallet what it says it does courtyard stores physical collectibles trading cards sneakers watches etc in secured vaults creates a 3d representation of the asset and mints it as an nft on the blockchain we ve partnered with one of the largest security companies in the world to store collectibles founders paulin andurand was previously a senior software engineer at apple nicolas le jeune was previously a manager at youtube quick thoughts nfts are great at creating liquid markets for digital assets but there s been a lot of chatter about using them to make transacting physical collectibles easier vertical specific marketplaces have already had some success aiming to do this though there have also been legal challenges associated with selling digital assets that use the likenesses of physical product as a token what it says it does we build the tools and infrastructure that make it easier faster and cheaper for anyone in africa easy fast and cheap access to crypto and web3 founders bashir aminu was previously head of africa for binance p2p hakeem adeyemi orewole was previously a software engineer at andela john anisere previously was a senior software engineer at intersection ventures quick thoughts crypto advocates are quick to highlight how blockchain based payments can do wonders for unbanked users in developing countries but precious little venture funding seems to have been given to teams aiming to do just that what it says it does argo is on a mission to empower film and tv makers worldwide it s the easiest way to upload and monetize your content argo provides the technology and the ecosystem for the filmmakers to monetize their film and tv work through advertising subscription and nft sales founders arcadiy golubovich previously led entertainment production company primeridian quick thoughts argo seems to be a media startup focused on short films first and foremost offering a platform for filmmakers to showcase their work while also tapping nft sales as a way of helping them monetize their work and build buzz what it says it does finnt is the first defi app for families we provide multi user high yield saving accounts which make it easy to save with crypto for your children or family members founders anji ismail led product at welcome faozi el yagoubi was previously director of engineering at ovavi quick thoughts defi for families is an awfully specific pitch which seems mainly focused on allowing users to link sub accounts to a central investment account high profile exploits of defi protocols are undoubtedly going to leave some families skeptical of putting their nest egg here but much higher yield rates are likely going to make it a risk some are happy to take image credits tradezi what it says it does tradezi is the robinhood for southeast asia we aim to help everyone invest in stocks crypto and other alternative assets all in one place founders phi dang and jasmine huynh were both previously senior software engineers at google quick thoughts robinhood has obviously done a lot to expose american retail traders to crypto by showcasing the coins alongside publicly traded stocks this is a model tradezi seems to be interested in tackling in sea what it says it does botin a mobile app where people in latin america can invest in us stocks crypto and more founders robert baron was previously a developer at bitgo james jara was previously a software engineer at avantica quick thoughts the costa rica startup is also taking the robinhood approach towards stock and crypto to latin american users and hoping to find a broader audience for retail trading what it says it does earnjarvis is a crypto investment platform that helps retail investors i e you and businesses intelligently invest across the crypto economy founders atyab bhatti was previously a manager at mckinsey kush maheshwari was previously a software engineer at rubrik quick thoughts robo advisors have been big business for entry retail investors but crypto trading has largely been a diy affair at the same levels there s likely going to be a crop of platforms popping up that promise to automate the process of diversifying across crypto assets while exposing users to elements of the defi world what it says it does we re bring universally needed tools to crypto companies to help them manage their token distributions tokenholder onboarding offboarding and other critical tools founders bruno faviero previously was a product manager at palantir arun kirubarajan is a graduate researcher at penn quick thoughts cap tables have gotten hilariously convoluted in an era where crypto startups are granting both equity and tokens to investors and employees the cleverly named magna is looking to add some much needed streamlining to managing token grants in the same way carta rethought cap table management for web2 startups what it says it does with soon you can invest without the stress of speculating our fully automated sweep

thoughts just because new platforms are bringing users access to new asset classes doesn t mean consumers all want to turn into part time investors soon is building a platform that automatically invests idle money in a user s bank account across crypto and more traditional assets what it says it does liquifi carta for crypto helps companies and daos automate their token vesting management and distribution to employees investors partners and community members secure audited smart contracts guarantee timely distribution of vesting tokens and save significant time and resources spent building your own solution founders robin ji previously was a product lead at eco oliver tang was an engineering manager at amazon quick thoughts it s unsurprising that yc is backing a pair of startups approaching the same opportunity token management is a clear web3 startup growing pain and yc has always been particularly successful in helping scale startup for startup products what it says it does a single api for fintechs to embed defi products on their platform this allows them to acquire more customers retain these customers and increase revenue engagement all in a custodial secure compliant way founders pranay shetty was an early employee at cloudkitchens ramkumar venkataraman was the founding engineer of moneyworld quick thoughts while trading stocks and crypto inside the same app has grown to be an expected feature of traditional trading apps that same relationship hasn t come to defi and traditional fintech services which live separate lives in separate apps and platforms what it says it does onscale is business bank for high earning creators that automates income budgeting cash flow management tax write offs and invoicing we help creators automate financial tasks save money and time founders tonjé bakang tonje is the founder of afrostream german saprykin was a senior engineering manager at grab quick thoughts while plenty of creator focused web3 products have taken particular aim at nft creators onscale is looking to help a broader swath of creators access traditional financial products while building in crypto rails to help users easily convert income into crypto inside the platform what it says it does we make crypto investing safe and easy for consumer and businesses through defi yielding our product is plain simple people can deposit and withdraw in 3 clicks right after deposit they might earn competitive interest with no hidden fees the interest is obtained from defi protocols founders fransiskus raymond was a sales manager at gojek ghuniyu fattah rozaq was a developer at ritase quick thoughts an awful lot has been said about defi yield farming which offers high percentage rates for depositing funds into investment pools sometimes these seemingly too good to be true rates have proven to be just that but other times they highlight how much upside there is when users cut banks and their associated protections from the investing saving process image credits bloom what it says it does bloom offers students and young professionals in east africa us dollar banking by saving in usd or digital dollars and spending as they go in local currencies they won t be subject to inflation founders ahmed ismail previously worked at barclays khalid keenan was an engineer at finbourne youcef oudjidane was a managing partner at class 5 global abdigani diriye was a research manager at amazon quick thoughts the sudan startup is looking to tap stablecoins to help young professionals in east africa avoid the hyperinflation common to many currencies in the region there are clearly large opportunities in helping users in developing nations build wealth but the risks associated with crypto means that these startups have a big burden of responsibility as well what it says it does every web3 community is unique yet every discord looks the same we help web3 communities bring unique and engaging experiences typically reserved for websites right into the discussion founders samraaj bath previously founded chaa club kartik sathappan has been angel investing at 25kchecks quick thoughts discord sits at the center of the web3 universe but isn t a web3 startup they ve flirted with deeper nft based functionality but it s grown clear that their broader user base doesn t want their gaming chat app turning into a web3 chat app something that has left many to wonder whether there s a more native solution out there take a look at some more of our y combinator demo day coverage read more about yc demo day on techcrunch
editor s note this story has been updated to reflect opposition by sen joe manchin a west virginia democrat to biden s billionaire minimum income tax proposal manchin s lack of support first reported by bloomberg news means that the proposal to tax unrealized gains is almost certainly no longer an option given that support from all 50 senate democrats is needed for the budget to pass it s déjà vu all over again and a new bout of uncertainty for financial advisors in the white house s latest proposal to increase taxes on the wealthiest americans president joe biden s federal budget released on march 28 revives earlier plans to end tax free wealth transfers to heirs and to collect tax on investors paper profits currently capital gains are taxed only when stocks or other assets are realized or sold the budget for the government s 2023 year also calls for ending a longstanding loophole in which people who inherit stocks property or businesses don t owe tax on the paper profits piled up since the original owner acquired the assets one key element omitted in the document a prior proposal to impose severe curbs on tax free roth retirement accounts it s possible that other parts of the budget would accomplish that the biden administration s suggested 2 5 trillion in tax hikes is on top of 1 5 trillion in tax increases embedded in a stalled version of the build back better bill both face a battle in congress and exasperation from advisors they couldn t pass anything last year how are they going to get it through this year with so much more on their plate like inflation and russia ukraine asked martin shenkman an estate planning lawyer in fort lee new jersey we re all oh golly it s all proposed all over again but clients don t want to hear the chicken little routine anymore shenkman added that clients have planning fatigue it s like the movie series friday the 13th how many sequels were there still he said that planners have to let clients know what s happening here s what affluent investors and financial advisors need to know a 20 tax on centi millionaires and billionaires on all of their income the billionaire minimum income tax would require ultra rich people to pay at least 20 in taxes on their income and crucially unrealized gains it would hit the richest 20 000 american households according to the wall street journal and raise 361 billion over 10 years according to the treasury department s latest green book which lays out the administration s proposed spending and tax increases the mega tax is a misnomer as it would hit people earning at least 100 million top earners who pay less would owe the difference up to 20 boston consulting group defines those earning at least 100 million as ultra high net worth and said their assets rose nearly 16 percent in 2020 to 5 3 trillion compared to the prior year the idea of taxing profits that exist on paper not as cash in a bank account first appeared last year in various proposals from biden and lawmakers in both chambers the calls failed the green book said that reformed taxation of capital income would even the tax treatment of labor and capital income and eliminate a loophole that lets some capital gains income escape income taxation forever under current step up in basis rules someone who inherits an asset that swelled in value in prior years doesn t have to pay income tax on the increase that s unfair according to treasury why because less wealthy people who have to spend their savings during retirement pay income tax on their realized capital gains this dynamic increases the inequity of the tax treatment of capital gains the green book said a new top ordinary income tax rate of 39 6 up from 37 the top rate would start in 2023 and apply to married couples earning more than 450 000 and single filers making more than 400 000 for 2022 the current top 37 rate is paid by married couples making more than 647 850 and individuals making more than 539 900 the increase would raise nearly 187 billion over a decade capital gains long term capital gains and qualified dividends for people earning more than 1 million would be taxed at the proposed top ordinary rate of 39 3 plus 3 8 for the affordable care act currently capital gains are taxed at 23 8 including the obamacare levy unrealized gains would be taxed when an owner dies estate and gift taxes and trusts last fall grantor trusts the engine of wealth transfers to heirs were on the chopping block that s in part because an early version of the climate and social spending bill known as build back better treated future sales between trusts and their owners a common planning technique as a taxable sale estate planning gets a big makeover under biden s fy 2023 budget proposal pixabay now trusts are facing another hatchet biden s budget proposes to modify income estate and gift tax rules for certain grantor trusts the changes would raise nearly 42 billion under the budget donors would recognize a capital gain when transferring an asset to an heir the paper profit would consist of the amount of appreciation in the asset since it was originally acquired a donor could exclude or not owe tax on 5 million of unrealized capital gains on property transferred by gift or owned at death portions of the 5 million exclusion that aren t used during a donor s lifetime would carry over to a surviving spouse the 5 million exclusion is in addition to the lifetime exclusion now just over 12 million twice that for couples the rule would go into effect in 2023 the rule would affect certain property owned by trusts partnerships and other non corporate entities taxpayers could choose not to recognize unrealized appreciation of a family owned and operated business until the business is sold or passes out of the family s hands they d have 15 years to pay tax on appreciated assets transferred at death with a deferral taxpayers would have to put up security to the irs if asked if a trust partnership or other non corporate entity hasn t recognized gain on its assets since 1939 it would be forced to do so come 2030 the rules for grantor retained annuity trusts or grats get tighter they d be required to have a minimum value for gift tax purposes of at least 25 percent of the value of the assets transferred to the grat or 500 000 whichever is bigger a trust would be banned from swapping assets without recognizing gain or loss the trusts would last a minimum 10 years and a maximum of 10 years plus the owner s life expectancy private equity and hedge funds so called carried interest profits would be taxed at ordinary rates not lower capital gains rates steve wittenberg the director of legacy planning at sei private wealth management in oaks pennsylvania said in an email that there s fatigue from taxpayers coming out of the frequent rollercoaster of potential proposals to change tax laws the proposals he added more often than not do not come to fruition

strength but the kicker came when it was revealed josh planned to announce a 420 tax offset for low middle income earners in fy22 returns in last night s budget the index closed up 51 after peaking at

last night the futures are up 56 points this morning or 0 8 but with the s p500 up 1 2 last night on glimmers of hope for ukraine it s hard to judge what extra budget reaction we might get today after yesterday it was clearly a budget of all give and no take and you d be forgiven for thinking an election was looming josh was at pains to highlight the coalition s superior economic management as usual while never once mentioning budget saving revenues due from iron ore coal lng wheat the bombshell was nonetheless a full 22c per litre cut to the fuel excise or 50 when 5c was being touted that again will put more money in consumer pockets and possibly stave off some demand destruction for the fuel industry all inflationary of course here we go last night the us two year yield fell 4 points to 2 37 and the ten year fell 8 points to 2 40 for a mere 3 point spread down from 12 the night before it appears inevitable now that the us yield curve will invert bovvered clearly not judging by the stock market s reaction but aside from the average 16 month lag to recession from inversion and average stock market gains over that period last night was all about a glimmer of hope for ukraine russia said it would fundamentally cut back operations near kyiv and now states its goal is the liberation of donbas rather than the earlier denazification of ukraine evacuation corridors would also be opened for some cities russia announced a shift in focus to just donbas in the east last week and then bombed lviv in the west ukraine has in turn offered a referendum on neutrality everyone is understandably taking whatever russia says with a grain of salt and as yet there is no sign of an actual ceasefire being agreed upon but it s a possible step if russia can withdraw and claim victory the news fired up wall street with all s p500 sectors closing in the green bar energy 0 4 wti crude fell below us 100 bbl early in the session but has since rebounded even the materials sector managed a 0 8 gain despite commodity prices particularly aluminium and wheat slipping back as a result the conference board s monthly consumer confidence index has risen to 107 2 in march which is surprising compared to the similar michigan uni index showing the high 50s of late both are 100 neutral indices but clearly the surveys ask different questions however the rise to 107 2 came only after the february result was revised down to 105 7 from an original 100 5 so make up your own mind but economists do suggest a strong jobs market in the face of the inflation shock is providing relief

service members of pro russian troops are seen atop of a tank during ukraine russia conflict on the outskirts of the besieged southern port city of mariupol file photo reuters alexander ermochenko russia pledged to scale down fighting around kyiv and a second major city following peace talks on tuesday that ukraine s leader said showed positive signs but western allies made clear their doubts over moscow s intentions details filtering from the talks in istanbul raised hopes after more than a month of war that has left thousands dead and millions displaced kyiv s negotiator david arakhamia said there were sufficient conditions for president volodymyr zelensky and his russian counterpart vladimir putin to meet in a push to end europe s worst conflict in decades on the russian side chief negotiator vladimir medinsky called the talks meaningful while the country s deputy defence minister alexander fomin reported progress on the neutrality and non nuclear status of ukraine two central russian concerns russia fomin said had decided to radically by several times reduce the military activity around kyiv and the northern city of chernigiv zelensky himself sounded a note of cautious optimism following the day s talks though he said the positive signals do not drown out the explosions or russian shells and vowed in a video address late tuesday to keep up defense efforts but the united states cast clear doubt on moscow s words and vowed with fellow western powers to keep raising the costs on russia and by tuesday evening ukraine s general staff while confirming russian units were withdrawing from the kyiv and chernigiv regions said it was most likely a troop rotation intended to mislead ukraine s military on the ground in the capital air raid sirens could be heard ringing out late into the night with residents ordered to proceed to shelters elsewhere in the country meanwhile the toll continued to climb with at least 12 people killed by a russian missile in southern mykolaiv adding to a toll estimated by zelensky at 20 000 so far offensive planned elsewhere reinforcing the ukrainian assessment us officials said that while small numbers of russian forces were indeed stepping back from kyiv the vast majority remained we re not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal pentagon spokesman john kirby said warning a major offensive may yet be imminent in other areas of ukraine and that the threat to kyiv was not over a spokesman for british prime minister boris johnson echoed that message saying we will judge putin and his regime by his actions and not by his words us president joe biden spoke with johnson and the leaders of france germany and italy together vowing no let up in the strong economic sanctions imposed on moscow we ll see if they follow through on what they re suggesting biden told reporters following the call when asked if he believed russia was simply trying to buy time the signals from tuesday s talks nonetheless sent european and us stock markets up while oil prices fell by five percent as supply fears eased and the ruble surged 10 percent against the dollar a whoosh then a boom last weekend moscow already signalled it was dialing back its war goals focusing its military resources on capturing the eastern donbas region the pentagon assesses that russia badly underestimated ukrainian resistance and that its offensive has stalled near kyiv and other cities in recent days ukraine s fighters have notably recaptured the strategic kyiv suburb of irpin and pushed back russian forces from around mykolaiv but on tuesday a russian missile strike on a government building in the southern city left at least 12 dead and 33 wounded ukrainian officials said i was having breakfast in my apartment donald 69 a retired canadian postal worker with ukrainian residency told afp i heard a whoosh then a boom and my windows rattled another local resident viktor gaivonenko who was helping clean up the debris said putin is a bastard that s all there is to it crime against humanity while ukraine s forces are counterattacking in the north they are struggling to retain control of the devastated southern port city of mariupol russian forces have encircled the city and are conducting steady and indiscriminate bombardment trapping an estimated 160 000 people with little food water or medicine at least 5 000 people there have already died and the full toll could be as high as 10 000 according to one senior ukrainian official france greece and turkey have been hoping to launch a mass evacuation of civilians from mariupol within days but french president emmanuel macron after speaking with putin tuesday said conditions for the operation were not yet met calling the mariupol siege a crime against humanity happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet in real time zelensky urged allies to keep the sanctions pressure on moscow until this war is over in the latest round of diplomatic expulsions belgium ireland and the netherlands tuesday announced a total of 42 diplomats would be told to leave responding tit for tat moscow said it was expelling 10 diplomats from estonia latvia and lithuania and it reiterated that it will only be accepting payment in rubles for gas deliveries to the european union after g7 ministers called this arrangement unacceptable agence

that last point is worth teasing out in its updated forecasts treasury now thinks there will be about 140 000 more people in jobs than it estimated in the last official budget update released just 3½ months ago and it thinks those extra jobs are here to stay by the way those 140 000 extra people in work aren t average australians they re people who struggled to get jobs in years past because they were considered too old or too lacking in skills those factors are now less of a liability in a nation that can run its economy consistently hotter than we had previously been trying to do it turned out that it was australia s robust reaction to covid 19 that unlocked today s recovery take a moment to revel in that the social dividend of a more inclusive australia is magnificent advertisement even better still more jobs means a tighter job market and that tighter job market means higher wages that says the benefit from running the economy hotter than we used to isn t confined just to those who get the extra jobs it spreads out across the workforce more generally so the improvement in the economy that treasury announced in the budget wasn t only due to the speed of the recovery from covid 19 and the sky high coal and iron ore prices as important as those are the lingering revelation from the budget is that the reserve bank was right in 2019 the reserve bank said unemployment needed to go lower in australia if it was going to achieve its inflation target treasury was more cautious because the reserve was also saying that treasury needed to break open the budget piggy bank to do that that looked like stalemate but then came covid 19 you wouldn t wish a pandemic on anyone yet it turned out that it was australia s robust reaction to covid 19 that unlocked today s recovery we threw the kitchen sink at covid 19 the reserve bank dropped interest rates to nothing and started printing money and the government stepped up with jobkeeper and other programs advertisement in combination that stomp on the policy accelerator meant that once we could open up after covid 19 the australian economy took off like a labrador chasing a pigeon but wait there s more treasury s conversion to the reserve bank view of the world the realisation that we could sustainably run the australian economy hotter than previously thought has another huge implication it s that financial markets desperately need to switch to decaf right now markets are pricing in a view that sees the reserve bank as starring in a remake of the texas chainsaw massacre with its cash rate seen hurtling up towards 3 per cent from today s 0 1 per cent in less than 18 months from now err why would the rba do that if rates hurtled up at that speed it would drive a wrecking ball through australia s economy driving unemployment rapidly up even though the rba keeps saying that it wants to lock in low unemployment advertisement there s a huge benefit to the country of having people in jobs so while ever we can we ll keep interest rates very stimulatory to get people back into jobs and how long can we do that for i m not sure but that s a priority at the moment so here s a second happy thought for you it isn t just the job and wage dividend that treasury now expects to see it s also that interest rates may be on a much more gentle trajectory than the market expects yes the fistful of dollars waved in the face of the punters ahead of the election will boost pricing pressures and bring forward the day when the reserve raises rates yes they re a waste of taxpayers money yet even so the first rate rise in australia may be rather further off than markets expect and the eventual increase in rates may be much less than many fear
