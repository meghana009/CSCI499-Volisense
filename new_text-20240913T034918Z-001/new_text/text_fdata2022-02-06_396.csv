yuri george m yankovsky and a number of boars he killed in the early 1930s sten bergman in korean wilds and villages by robert neff in the early 1900s the northern part of the korean peninsula was the domain of the majestic tigers sleek leopards insatiable wolves and unpredictable giant boars they prowled the darkness and lonely places preying upon the weak and unwary they also attracted the attention of foreign hunters who came to korea to hunt them as souvenirs to display in their trophy rooms there was even a russian family yankovsky that established a famous hunting lodge on the east coast but this region was also blessed with great numbers of fur bearing animals they too attracted foreign hunters who came not so much for the sport but rather the profit korea was no stranger to the fur industry some of the earlier trade reports list tiger leopard and bear pelts exported from wonsan most likely to japan sable and otter pelts were especially prized and were readily purchased by chinese merchants in 1897 a pair of korean fur dealers claimed they exported 30 000 worth of furs annually to china so many furs were being harvested that in 1897 trappers and traders began complaining that fur bearing animals were becoming scarcer and scarcer as more people sought to profit from them an unidentified western resident in jemulpo modern incheon called for the korean government to take measures to protect its natural resources yankovsky and two leopards sten bergman in korean wilds and villages the unnamed petitioner would have probably been horrified to discover that some hunters were using unconventional means to get their pelts in 1904 one korean hunter in gangwon province allegedly used dynamite cartridges to obtain fox pelts he smeared the dynamite cartridges with grease and then placed them where foxes congregated when the foxes bit down on the cartridges they exploded killing the foxes by literally blowing their heads off in the early 1900s korea was a concessionaire s dream it was rich with natural resources but still relatively undeveloped when clare hess the subject of our previous article sailed to korea in early 1901 to work as a gold miner at the oriental consolidated mining company ocmc one of his fellow passengers advised him that a fortune could be made by buying furs and exporting them to america as the had no conception of the monetary value of such costly skins as sable silver fox otter sea otter etc also that the territory had never been opened and that the chance of a lifetime lay before some adventurous and enterprising american hess was determined to be that man when he returned to columbia city indiana in the summer or fall of 1903 he established the asiatic american importing company which was primarily to sell furs purchased in the far east columbia city was no stranger to korea leigh s j hunt started the ocmc nearly seven years earlier and many of the miners at the concession were from indiana mainly columbia city and so it probably isn t stretching the imagination to say that many there viewed korea as a land of opportunity especially when they learned that hess had brought several pelts from korea and sold them at an extraordinary profit hess told his friends and neighbors what they wanted to hear even if the narrative wasn t supported by facts and they believed it one of the gold mining camps on the oriental consolidated mining company s concession in northern korea circa 1900s courtesy of the diane nars collection he claimed that after completing a two year contract with the ocmc he resigned from his position and then spent six months exploring korea we know this claim wasn t true because his contract ended in late january 1903 and he was in jail on feb 5 according to a hometown newspaper he korean chinese and japanese languages thoroughly and gained passports all over asia which of inestimable value they say that in every good lie there is a grain of truth and there are a few in that statement the ocmc employed koreans chinese and japanese and most of the western miners knew some words and phrases in each of those languages but very few understood any of the languages thoroughly let alone all three of them in just two years as for the passports his only passports that i know of are one issued in korea in december 1902 and one issued in indiana in october 1904 hess did manage to establish his company with a capital stock of 100 000 and departed the united states on nov 9 1904 he and his companion william socwell a 49 year old real estate broker had provisions to last four months and would engage in any kind of business a couple of hundred miles from the coast deep in the mountains they and the newspaper had great hopes the furs will be shipped all at one time to columbia city where buyers from all parts of the world will come when a big sale is held columbia city indiana in the early 1900s the library on the second floor was established through a donation from leigh s j hunt courtesy of the whitley county historical museum they arrived at kanggye in present day north korea on jan 5 1905 their trip from jemulpo first by steamship a two day trip and then 500 kilometers on korean ponies was quite an accomplishment considering it was winter and during the russo japanese war hess described the city as being surrounded by an ancient wall and with a garrison of 400 korean soldiers according to him the city had a population of 30 000 inhabitants who were quite startled with the appearance of the two americans in a letter to his parents hess wrote our entrance into the city caused quite a commotion and the narrow streets were fairly filled with a conglomerate crowd and we could hear the questions asked many times are they russians and i don t wonder at it as we had been fifteen days traveling continuously it wasn t so much their filth that startled the residents but the fact that two days earlier a patrol of 16 russian cossacks had entered the city and were then subsequently driven out by the korean soldiers the two americans found lodging at a small inn and were soon visited by a servant sent by the local magistrate who demanded to know who they were and why they were in kanggye after the passports were presented through their interpreter a note was received from the magistrate expressing his appreciation for their arrival along with a couple of chickens later that day three high officials visited them and also expressed pleasure with their meeting but regretted that there were no good accommodations for the americans and instead promised that they would see if they could find a vacant house the officials kept their promise the next day a policeman called and asked us to go and look at a house which had been found and we are now located quite comfortably in it guests of the magistrate a winter scene from the ocmc circa 1910 1920 courtesy of the joseph lower family the americans soon paid a visit to the magistrate s office were ushered through a large court yard into the audience hall where he came forward to meet us we found him to be a perfect gentleman and it seemed that he could not do enough for us after a short conversation he asked our business and when we informed him that we were here to buy furs he told us that there were two hundred hunters in his district and they were at our disposal he also sent the chief of that department to us later to let us know that they had been sent for and also that a very learned man in the art of tracking wild beasts who lives one hundred miles from here had been sent for we are now waiting for them to come several of the high officials call on us every day and seem to enjoy their visits on jan 11 hess left his companion in kanggye and traveled to the korean chinese border he spent nearly three weeks traveling along the yalu river and in a letter to his mother he bragged during the trip i was the guest of a magistrate and while i have seen a good deal of korea my previous trips and thought i knew their customs pretty well i saw the inside working power of korea on this trip and many things which i had never dreamed of before a bridge near kanggye in the 1920s robert neff collection he returned to kanggye on feb 19 and reunited with his companion during his time away hess ate nothing but korean food and seemed quite proud of himself for this accomplishment he proclaimed to his mother i would have staid longer in the interior but we were out of food and complained that socwell couldn t or wouldn t eat any korean or japanese food denigrating his older companion even further he added that another reason was because socwell was getting pretty homesick with such a burdensome companion hess had no choice but to return to the united states by march 11 they were in nagasaki and had arranged to travel to new york via the suez canal and london and arrived on may 19 we know that they were in columbia city by june 13 because hess gave an interview in which he claimed to have just returned from korea where his company has prosperous headquarters and that the are much disliked by american traders in the orient and chinese are liked it is interesting to note that his company s name had changed from asiatic american importing company to american asiatic fur importing company hess wasn t the only one talking in july socwell who was described as an interesting talker gave a presentation at his church on the needs and conditions as he saw them harvesting ice on the yalu river circa 1900 1910s robert neff collection despite these men s willingness to talk and their prosperous headquarters in korea i couldn t find any information to indicate whether or not they succeeded in obtaining pelts to resell in indiana perhaps they did but the auction did not warrant any mention in the local newspapers apparently the company was not as prosperous as he boasted and by 1910 he was living in spokane washington with his wife and young son and working as a chemist i don t believe he ever returned to korea but according to at least one account up until the 1930s he was still writing to americans residing in korea in the hopes of establishing a company columbia city has a long history with korea over 120 years photographs postcards letters newspapers articles and even home movies provide tantalizing glimpses of their lives stories that need to be told so that they are never lost and forgotten i would like to express my appreciation to diane nars and jan downing for their invaluable assistance as well as to the whitley county historical museum and its staff a korean hut near the yalu river in the 1930s sten bergman in korean wilds and villages

since the beginnings of history humans believed in religions of a polytheist type worshipping a plurality of gods and spirits by proposing a monotheist religious system christianity intended to change from the ground up this old state of affairs which had endured for centuries however the old traditions had deep roots in people s hearts and minds a fact which made the church feel threatened this clash between old traditions and the christian cult resulted a long history of the persecution of witches the evolving history of witchcraft the persecution of witches evolved over time even though the conversion to christianity had increased on the european continent there were still those who believed respected and continued to take into account the old ways these talked about the mother goddess of the world who had given birth to the divine child he later became her husband master of harvests and the great hunter who sacrificed himself every autumn only to be reborn stronger in the following spring even the nobles of the 12th and 13th centuries continued to respect the old traditions troubadours composing songs in the honor of the mother goddess masked in the form of poems for courtesans in those turbulent times peasants and simple folk practiced witchcraft in the hope of ensuring a better future for themselves thinking that it could help them to improve daily life as christianity extended its power and influence clerics wanted to take measures against the old ways and so the church began the merciless war against that which it named the devil s cult the measures imposed by the representatives of the so called religion of mercy christianity led to the violent death of over 200 000 people in time this persecution became worse and worse with the number of deaths surpassing eight million people convicted and executed under the accusation of practicing witchcraft the fanaticism of the church reached its peak in the period of the 12th and 18th centuries then also being exported to the american territory naked young women being brutally tortured by spanish inquisition a common occurrence within the history of witchcraft public domain persecution in the history of witchcraft in general one can delimit three main waves in the persecution of witches each associated with moments in time when new ideas were seen by representatives of the church as a threat to the supremacy and power of the christian institution the first wave took place at the end of the crusades from the 13th century when christians and muslims were fighting in the east the church then regarded as a threat the influence of muslim traditions and ideas as european modernism was also making its presence felt the church no longer waited to see how these threats progressed and it instituted the inquisition dominicans had to fight against heresy at a time when its primary manifestation was declared to be witchcraft a social ill deemed to corrupt people and get them to defy god and the vatican among the first witch trials which took place in the year 1324 alice kyteler from kilkenny in ireland was accused of worshipping the old gods and condemned to death as luck would have it she enjoyed a noble position and managed to escape her fate but her acquaintances were executed and burnt at the stake the second stage of witchcraft persecutions began at the beginning of the 15th century until then the great plague from europe nicknamed the black death had resulted in the death of over 25 million people and the hundred years war had ended the most well known episode within this second wave of persecutions is without doubt the execution of joan of arc the execution of joan of arc by françois chifflart public domain the persecution of joan of arc after a revelation joan led the french offensive against the english occupation but in the end she was condemned by the church and burned at the stake as a witch later on the same institution which had executed her chose to sanctify her in addition to the motives of a political order which was responsible for her execution joan of arc has also been associated with a cult dedicated to the goddess diana the forest near domremy village where the young joan had her revelation and heard the voices suggesting she attack the english was rumored to have been the meeting place of peasants who practiced ceremonies in the name of the goddess diana during these rituals the peasants danced around a sacred tree to obtain the favors of the goddess some sources even suggest that joan of arc had taken part in these ceremonies details from the trial include reports that the young woman refused to say the prayer our father during the trial and that she spoke of my lord rather that god joan of arc was also an acquaintance of the french nobleman gilles de rais who was also executed for purportedly practicing satanic rituals involving human sacrifices the accusations claimed that he had killed children from the neighboring villages gilles de rais has gone down in history as an alchemist and member of the secret societies of the time the last wave of witchcraft persecutions came with the year 1484 when a new papal bull condemned the belief in witchcraft the belief was that appealing to witchcraft in order to find solutions to everyday problems involved losing one s soul to the devil as a condemnable act all those who are suspected were to be investigated by specially prepared inquisitors 14th century depiction of burning witches and holding others in the stocks public domain malleus maleficarum and the witch hunt out of the high ranking dominicans jakob sprenger and heinrich kramer also known as henricus institor had to supervise the activity of the inquisition and they decided to create a scientific context for dealing with the problem of witchcraft in this way in 1486 the two published the work known under the title malleus maleficarum which translates to the witches hammer which set rules for the interpretation of witchcraft activity this bizarre treatise includes modes of protection against spells torture methods proposed by the inquisition ways of recognizing persons involved in witchcraft and interrogation techniques the text passed at that time through 35 editions with versions in english german french and italian the inquisition had its most powerful center in spain and it did not diminish in power until the 16th century when under the impulse of freemasonry the reform hit the vatican the first masonic lodges had appeared as a result of the works of the order of the templars which had been persecuted by the church the evils of witchcraft or evils of the catholic church in the year 1509 henry viii had been excommunicated by the pope and was now leading the anglican church martin luther was excommunicated in the year 1521 after attacking the vatican protestantism had begun to have influence and in the year 1536 john calvin set the bases of calvinism in this period pope paul the third introduced the inquisition in rome and the peak of the third wave of persecutions against witches but also against protestants began with regards to the cases of witchcraft women represented about 80 of those convicted because it was believed that they were weaker in spirit and they gave in easier to the demonic influences the convicted were stripped naked in public their bodies were shaved against a backdrop of laughter as the crowd gathered in the public square they were then tortured to confess through a variety of methods as evidenced by numerous handbooks on torture published during that era these included physical humiliations with sexual connotations whipping ripping off their nails or being submerged underwater in the case of water torture and underwater submersions if the person accused of witchcraft drowned they were considered innocent but if they survived they were considered guilty and burned at the stake the luckiest convicts were burned at the stake in an unconscious state induced by the uninterrupted period of torture to which they had been submitted the witch hunter occupation ended up being considered a respectable profession and history has recorded the case one witch hunter who hunted down 220 victims only women another witch hunter named peter binsfeld is said to have executed around 6 500 women and children under the accusation of witchcraft in the year 1834 the inquisition was disbanded but burning at the stake continued in europe until the year 1793 the last witches being condemned and executed in poland satanic witchcraft included the practice of black mass public domain witchcraft in north america in north america there were two primary ways magic and witchcraft was practiced one had its origins in a german community in pennsylvania where a brotherhood from philadelphia used witchcraft to communicate with nature in particular from 1670 to 1700 they conducted ceremonies to celebrate the summer solstice giving offerings to fertility gods they later incorporated additional elements into their belief systems which resulted in a religion which centered on the worship of divine power in the guise of the mother goddess their practices included trances astral travels and the use of charms the second form of magic practices which took place in north america did not constitute such a well structured system focusing more on the the practical side of things in this sense witchdoctors performed healing rituals and spells with diverse purposes varying from love or luck or even detecting precious metals among these witchdoctors known for practicing a type of magic inspired by shamanic rituals and the beliefs of native americans there were also some preoccupied with black magic to whom one could make appeal to send curses disease or even death upon one s enemies when it came to satanic magic this was practiced by witches who had made a pact with the devil offering their souls as part of the bargain these witches sneaked around at night visiting churches where they held black masses these profanations of the churches took place quite often in the 18th century as a result of the black masses organized by witches who reversed christian rituals and their symbols in order to provoke destruction for example the eucharist in the context of a satanic mass was performed with the blood of sacrificed animals or with the period blood of the witches involved it was said that a way of recognizing this type of witch was through the presence of a witches mark which supposedly appeared on the body as a result of the pact made with the devil however many innocent people were condemned to death just because they had large moles scars or birth marks on their bodies inquisitors believed that if these marks did not bleed when pierced with a needle then they were in fact witches marks lithograph depicting the salem witch trials public domain the famed salem witch trials probably the most well known witch hunt from history took place in the winter of the year 1692 in salem massachusetts betty the nine year old daughter of priest samuel parris and abigail williams her cousin had been taught by the family s indian slave named tituba about magical beliefs transmitted from the ancestors many people from the village appealed to tituba known for practicing a divination technique which implied pouring egg whites in a glass of water over time she taught witchcraft practices to several young girls from salem betty and abigail began to enter trances having seizures and running around the courtyard howling like wolves other girls who had entered into contact with tituba began to act as if they were absent and when they came to they would say that they had seen apparitions a 12 year old child named ann putnam came to from such a state and declared that she had been chased by a demon medics consulted the girl and they did not find anything wrong with her from a physical point of view this is how the investigations began to study the strange happenings from salem and at the village tribunal betty parris accused tituba of practicing witchcraft she wasn t the only one they accused they also pointed the finger at a sarah osborne an unmarried woman who lived with a man from the village a scandalous thing at that time there was also sarah good an alcoholic beggar known for smoking a pipe an eccentric passion for her time during the trial tituba recognized that she had used her astral body to attack ann putnam as a result of her confession the priest parris did not condemn her to death preferring to sell her meanwhile sarah osborne sarah good and another 17 women were condemned and executed for practicing witchcraft the salem witch trials created the legal precedent for future witch trials from this moment on even accounts related to spectral presences were considered acceptable evidence in court in this way someone could very easily get rid of a person whom he or she disliked all they had to do was to declare that they had been attacked by the spectral double of the individual and that individual would be executed for practicing witchcraft there was no escaping such an accusation since it was believed that a spectral double could act while the material body led its daily activity elsewhere aleister crowley was an english occultist and magician who has been remembered for his sexual magic public domain the history of witchcraft in the 20th century despite such a long history of witchcraft persecution witchcraft has not disappeared on the contrary it has evolved and diversified with a range of practices ranging from white to black magic in fact the most well known representatives of black magic from history include aleister crowley and anton szandor lavey aleister crowley was part of the secret society known as the hermetic order of the golden dawn after his failed attempt to control the society for his own interests he was excluded from it he has gone down in history as the worst man from history or the great beast as he liked to be called his reputation as a magician was centered around sexual magic crowley organized animal and human sacrifices as well as orgies in which the victims were animals and drugged children he also organized public ceremonies he considered to be a symbolical repetition of the seven rituals from eleusis and for which those who wanted to participate had to pay enormous sums of money another adept of black and sexual magic anton szandor lavey founded the universal church of satan in which he promoted the idea that unleashing sexual energy can result in a special occult energy charge white magic is situated at the opposite extreme of witchcraft in an attempt to reconnect with nature and with the powers it can offer based upon the old celtic traditions of the druids the rituals of white magic celebrate the power of nature s regeneration often taking place in its midst such as in forests where practitioners meditate organize sabbaths during the full moon dance around a sacred tree as an axis mundi type symbol or even bathe in spring waters this perspective rejects the idea of the original sin since white magic holds that humans are sacred beings who contain divinity within themselves top image the persecution of witches is a common theme within the

what we are seeing is that the totalitarian system cannot solve the very problems which it has itself created indeed in some cases it can only intensify them london the regime that rules china is not an authoritarian regime as is usually said it is totalitarian that difference is crucial historian robert conquest defined a totalitarian state as one that recognises no limits to its authority in any sphere of public or private life and extends that authority to whatever length feasible china s regime fits that definition china s constitution puts the communist party above the law and recognises no limits to its authority the party acts as the supreme arbiter of truth and falsehood right and wrong it tolerates no dissent or difference by disregarding international law in the south china sea tearing up an international treaty in order to extinguish political freedom in hong kong and committing cultural genocide in xinjiang the regime has demonstrated beyond a shred of doubt that it extends its authority to whatever length feasible the regime excels at projecting an image of itself as all powerful omniscient and supremely competent but the truth is very different i will look this in more detail later but consider this story of just one man in 2018 he was head of one of four companies set up in 1999 to help clean up bad debt that was choking china s banking system the company later expanded into investment loan and property businesses he had joined the company fifteen years earlier before that he had worked in senior positions for china s central bank and its banking regulator so throughout his whole career he had served in positions of trust at the heart of china s huge financial system which has the largest banking sector in the world in 2018 when he was arrested this man lai xiaomin was not only chairman of china huarong asset management company but also a senior banking regulator the major crime of which he was found guilty was that of soliciting bribes equivalent to a total of us 280 million over a period of ten years in one apartment he owned were a hoard of bank notes weighing three metric tonnes presumably some of the bribes he had received he was executed in january 2021 this story tells us much about the regime that rules china but the point i wish to stress here is that despite his very prominent position in the party state hierarchy and his positions of responsibility in the financial system he saw no need to be discreet at the time of his arrest he owned 100 houses and apartments in which he had installed 100 mistresses moreover the court judgement pointed out that most of his bribery had taken place after xi jinping launched the most energetic anti corruption campaign in the nation s history in 2012 this tells us that the authority of the party leader is far from complete and that highly placed insiders like lai believe they can defy it a five part series now being broadcast nationwide by china central television shows that corruption is a continuing problem despite the exposure and execution of lai the party is not all powerful omniscient or supremely competent the regime has some great achievements to its credit the economic reforms begun in 1978 have liberated the energies and enterprise of the chinese people resulting in the emergence of a dynamic private sector a large class of property owners and spectacular economic growth but the strategy of the reform era has been based on a contradiction economic reform has not been accompanied by political reform the party has always been determined to retain its monopoly of political power for the party economic reform has never been more than a stratagem for prolonging its grip on power it has made an unspoken deal with the chinese people we let you make money and you let us rule you can build a business with a market capitalisation of hundreds of billions of us dollars but you may not vote to elect or dismiss your rulers this system is based on control not on trust the rulers are more powerful than their subjects but their power is naked power and is not legitimised in any way this totalitarian regime makes prisoners of everyone not even the highest leaders have freedom of expression or association or religion any more than their subjects do at no level do even party officials have the right to vote freely for the election or dismissal of their leaders any more than those outside the party do in a totalitarian state everyone is a political slave it worked well for a long time and in some ways it still does the regime is very skilled at organising and applying power and its capacity for mobilising administrative forces on a huge scale is breath taking as we have seen during the covid 19 pandemic it produced the wealth and skills needed to buy tolerance for the party s rule to develop the most sophisticated systems of internal control the world has ever seen to modernise china s armed forces and to project its power abroad through economic diplomacy is it not absurd to suppose that this regime is heading for a crisis but there is much evidence that the contradiction inherent in the deal struck with the chinese people economic reform without political reform has resulted in a whole range of deep seated and long term problems and now some of those problems are making themselves felt chickens are coming home to roost this regime is outwardly strong but inwardly weak what we are seeing is that the totalitarian system cannot solve the very problems which it has itself created indeed in some cases it can only intensify them what are these problems first the debt mountain for the past decade the impressively high rate of economic growth has increasingly depended on pumping credit into the economy until corporate debt has reached a level that is dangerous to china and a risk to the world economy more and more of the credit has gone to finance activities that are financially unprofitable such as building bridges that lead nowhere and residential housing that stands empty no nation with such a debt mountain has ever substantially reduced it without either inflation or recession the regime shrinks from a deliberate time limited recession because it fears the widespread defaults and large scale unemployment that would occur lacking the legitimacy conferred by democratic elections it is afraid of the political consequences of the action it knows is essential to renew the health of the economy this is a direct result of the totalitarian system the public sector is sclerotic and loss making but the regime will not allow the dynamic and profitable private sector to take over loss making state owned enterprises because it fears that would undermine its political monopoly to protect unprofitable state owned enterprises the state retains ownership of the major banks so that it can force them to prop up those enterprises largely deprived of finance from state owned banks private companies have recourse to shadow banking which lacks transparency and creates risks hidden from regulators the vulnerabilities in the financial system are a second consequence of the totalitarian system faced with these problems xi jinping has not resumed the transition to the market economy instead to protect the party s political monopoly he has doubled down on the totalitarian system and reasserted the authority of the party over the private sector indeed he is back tracking on the strategy of economic reform and opening to the world which brought great benefits to china he is giving greater preference to the state sector imposing arbitrary restrictions on the private sector and in some ways cutting china off from the world but the consequences of the totalitarian system go far beyond the economy for instance there is an officially recognised moral crisis which can be summed up in four words no trust no truth that is a simplistic summary but it conveys the essential truth at its heart lies corruption but this is not the accidental by product of bad government it is a deliberate political strategy in 1989 when the regime faced the biggest democracy movement in history it chose to reject the calls for democracy and the rule of law and lost whatever moral authority it had by crushing the movement through military force thereafter to win the loyalty of those who rule in its name who enforce the will of an unelected regime it chose to allow party officials and their friends in business to grow rich through corruption mr xi s anti corruption drive has tackled the symptoms not the causes because the causes are systemic and can only be rooted out by systemic reform such as establishing an independent judiciary and a free press which are incompatible with a totalitarian system the regime itself bemoans the widespread hedonism and materialism that prevail in today s china it cannot impose a new morality but we observe that since 1978 there has been a great spontaneous explosion of religious faith and practice people testify that material prosperity is not satisfying them they are looking for true meaning in life and many are seeking it in religion all the major religions officially recognised in china have shared in this until scholars reckon that 350 million are practising some form of religion the political significance of this growth of religion is fundamental the party asserts itself as the ultimate authority in every sphere of human life but those with a religious faith insist there is a higher authority who rules god or the party very few of the religiously active give political expression to their beliefs but they constitute a large and deep reservoir of dissent another intractable problem for the government of china is the ecological catastrophe which is well documented the regime recognises the gravity of the problem but the political system prevents the regime from solving the problem why is that first its very survival depends on maintaining a high level of economic growth so it gives economic growth higher priority than controlling pollution second corrupt officials tolerate pollution by the companies controlled by their cronies in business third for political reasons the regime will not allow environmental ngos to play the essential role they play in democracies of holding governments and industry to account the result is not only that china emits more co2 than any other nation and accounts for two thirds of global emissions but is actually increasing its emissions each year by more than the advanced economies are reducing theirs because of this we are on course to global ecological disaster with no prospect of avoiding it unless there is a change of political system in china the problems generated by the totalitarian system are not all domestic the cover up of covid 19 in the early stages and the blocking of an independent international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus have greatly damaged china s international standing as measured by respected public opinion surveys cyber theft of intellectual property on an industrial scale rampant espionage and those actions i mentioned above in the south china sea hong kong and xinjiang have also contributed to a sea change in international attitudes towards the communist regime in china this sea change is being expressed in actions by governments led by the us i will cite just two first sanctions imposed on huawei by the us and its allies have inflicted very severe damage on one of china s greatest hi tech national champions second in december 2020 the united states enacted a law which stipulates that if the chinese government does not permit chinese companies listed on us stock exchanges to make the full financial disclosure required by us law all of those companies some 248 of them then valued at 2 trillion dollars will all be suspended from listing and trading on us exchanges that will come into effect in 2024 that prospect has already knocked 30 off their market value i began this litany of problems by describing the debt mountain the consequences of unrestrained reliance on debt are now wreaking damage on the property sector which accounts for 30 of the chinese economy the damage is very severe it will affect every sector of the chinese economy and will be long lasting one chinese property developer evergrande is the most indebted property developer in the world it is now facing collapse and others are going into default it is in property rather than bank deposits or stock markets that china s middle class has been investing most of its savings the sale of land to developers has been a major source of revenue for local governments now property prices and sales and land sales are all declining with especially damaging consequences for savers local governments financial institutions suppliers to the building trade and for employment in the property development sector it is not just foreign observers who see these and other problems chinese leaders know them better than we do and many of them see the connection with china s political system the most high level defector from china to the us since 1949 who taught political ideology to senior party officials for fifteen years says that 60 to 70 of those senior officials consider constitutional democracy to be superior to the system china now has these senior officials are alarmed at the direction in which china is heading at home and abroad they are alarmed at the damage it is now doing to the national interests and they see growing risks to their own wealth and power a combination of internal and external dynamics is developing which could provoke a crisis that goes beyond economics because the body politic of china is terminally ill and only systemic change can save it historically liberal democracy has come into being due to the combined pressure of intellectuals property owners and private businesses for the freedoms and protection afforded by the rule of law an independent judiciary and other institutions of constitutional democracy as soon as xi jinping came to power the communist party issued a directive prohibiting any mention of such ideas even before that as long ago as 2008 the party had stopped the transition to the market economy because it feared that a strong private sector would pose a political threat to its monopoly of power recent actions by xi jinping show that he fears that private sector has nonetheless grown too strong he has taken steps to reassert the authority of the party over it to curb its freedom of action and increase the role of the state sector he is also moving to selectively decouple china s economy from the outside world all these moves are prompted by a political objective to reassert the party s authority disregarding the damage they will do to china s economy this is the greatest reversal of strategy since the launch of the reform era in 1978 by these and other actions the party has shown that it recognises that its dictatorship is threatened by the same forces that gave birth to liberal democracy the question now is how and when will the situation in china give those forces a chance to act to bring systemic change for this regime fear of internal unrest is nothing new every year since 2011 the regime s budget for internal security has exceeded that for the military apparently the regime fears domestic opposition more than its foreign enemies but that fear is now being exacerbated by the property crisis the regime has proclaimed stability its top priority for the coming year precisely because it fears unrest at the grassroots given the relative inefficiency of domestically produced vaccines against covid 19 and the party s refusal to import foreign ones the zero covid strategy has driven china into a position of near isolation with no exit this is a political time bomb the suspension from listing and trading of chinese companies in the us due to take effect in 2024 will be the biggest reversal in opening of the chinese economy to the world since 1978 it will damage the interests of and cause resentment among the most dynamic forces in china s economy this sino american confrontation may cause problems on china s own financial markets xi jinping having centralised authority in his own hands to a degree not seen since mao will own the crisis a financial crisis could then become a political crisis some combination of these circumstances will convince the members of power elite who understand the gravity of the problems china faces who are alarmed by the direction in which china is heading and who recognise the need for systemic change that the moment has come to strike what strategy should the us and its friends and allies adopt towards the china first we must always make very clear our opponent is not the chinese people but the communist party secondly we have no wish to see authority in china collapse and the country descend into chaos thirdly we cannot dictate how china is governed but we can and must use our power which is still very great to help those chinese who want a free china to achieve it the continued growth of the chinese economy depends crucially upon continued access to the world s reserve currencies the international banking system its deepest capital markets its biggest pools of capital and the greatest centres of scientific and technological discovery all of which are controlled by the liberal democracies we must exploit this power in a graduated way that incentivizes change and imposes a price on the present course if we do so successfully the benefits of a free china to itself and to the world will far surpass anything we can now imagine roger garside is a china expert and an associate fellow of the henry jackson society as a british diplomat he studied mandarin chinese and served twice in beijing his latest book is china coup the great leap to freedom

should you expand your stock picking horizons from ford to disney and lvmh how to buy shares in overseas profit powerhouse companies some of us are old enough to remember when remington shaver company owner victor kiam advertised his wares on television with the catchphrase i liked the product so much i bought the company it was an advertising sensation in 1979 but kiam s strategy remains an attractive one for investors today buying shares allows investors to own a slice of the businesses they use every day and being a customer gives investors an advantage as they have personal experience of the company and a window into what it is getting right and wrong but what can investors do when so many of the brands we know and use daily from disney to apple and samsung are listed on overseas stock markets the good news is that it is possible to buy shares listed abroad if you re based in the uk the less good news is that you pay more in charges and may have extra administration to contend with from ford to disney lvmh the powerhouse names the uk stock market is packed full of world class energy companies and banks but to gain access to a wider range of sectors investors have to look further afield for example european exchanges are home to some of the best luxury goods firms including lvmh maker of louis vuitton bags while japan has strengths in electronics and robotics the us hosts most of the world s big tech firms we asked investment experts for their top picks of companies that are household names in the uk but that are not listed here businesses they believe will continue to thrive on the back of a powerful brand keith bowman analyst at investment platform interactive investor is excited about the future of us motor business ford which is competing with tesla for market share of electric cars i think ford will emerge as the clear number two electric vehicle maker in north america he says ford is investing more than 30billion 22billion in electric car production its shares are up 82 per cent in the past year but still look cheap when compared with tesla up 6 per cent in the past year bowman also likes disney and believes investors currently have a good opportunity to buy as shares are down 13 per cent this year after it missed its earnings forecasts investors in disney own a slice of superhero franchise marvel animated films giant pixar and the star wars movies and merchandise all of which now fall under the disney company umbrella it has also reopened its theme parks and relaunched its cruise ships after closures during the pandemic subscriber growth and a broader recovery are likely to continue longer term says bowman russ mould investment director at platform aj bell says investors should look towards western europe for global leaders some of the high quality names investors should be looking at just roll off the tongue he says france s lvmh is a leader in luxury goods and switzerland s nestlé in consumer brands he adds that the continent is also a good source of dividends for income seekers jason hollands managing director at investment platform bestinvest likes us listed trainers brand nike due to its loyal customer base nike has the power to pass on costs when it needs to and to cut the number of retailers that sell its products to refocus instead on selling through its own website and stores where profits are higher darius mcdermott managing director of investment platform chelsea financial services says that investors need to look to the us for the big tech companies we use every day alphabet which owns google and delivery giant amazon are both us listed picks neither are cheap options alphabet s share price is up 39 per cent in the past year while amazon s is down 16 per cent over the same period having fallen 17 per cent in the last month alone the best ways to buy stocks listed abroad most investment platforms and stockbrokers allow you to buy stocks abroad but there may be extra charges these come in two forms a charge from the platform for buying the shares themselves and a foreign exchange margin rate which is a percentage added on to the exchange rate between the currency you are using and the one that the stock is listed in to make profit for the company doing the trade if you frequently trade in stocks listed abroad these charges can add up for example although interactive investor charges the same for investors to buy us shares as it does for uk shares up to 7 99 a trade it charges investors on two of its subscription plans 19 99 to buy shares listed outside of the uk share dealing apps can offer a cheaper route a new breed of share dealing apps is challenging the traditional diy investing platforms and can offer a lower cost route to buying some overseas shares freetrade trading 212 and etoro both offer the chance to buy overseas shares without any share dealing fees although investors may have to pay a currency conversion commission not every platform charges extra to buy overseas shares aj bell charges 9 95 to trade international shares online and 29 95 to buy them by phone which is the same as uk listed shares hargreaves lansdown also charges the same amount 11 95 online or one per cent if you deal over the telephone however the extra costs associated with foreign exchange conversion can still weigh on investment performance the foreign exchange margin rate means you lose money every time you convert currency with your broker to buy overseas shares generally the more currency you can convert at once the lower the margin rate you are charged which means that you may want to buy large amounts of overseas shares at one time interactive investor has a margin rate of 1 5 per cent which means you ll be charged 1 5 per cent more than the interbank rate which is what large institutions charge among themselves this rate tapers down if you buy big amounts of shares you can also hold cash in an overseas account and use it later meaning that you can avoid the higher charges by converting large amounts at once hargreaves only allows you to hold sterling cash balances and when you buy overseas shares you will be charged up to 1 5 per cent above the interbank rate depending on how big your deal is you should also watch out for costs when you receive dividends in a foreign currency which have to be converted back into sterling before being paid to you in the bag luxury brand lvmh s stable includes louis vuitton handbags investors may also have to pay withholding tax which is levied by some countries on overseas shareholders who receive dividend income it may be possible to reclaim this tax from some countries where the uk has an agreement known as a double tax treaty in place the us government charges non us residents a withholding tax of 30 per cent on any income received from us investments uk investors can claim a rebate so the most they pay is 15 per cent germany also has a 25 per cent to 30 per cent withholding tax charge but you can also reclaim some of this so that you pay 15 per cent you use different forms to reclaim for each country for example a w 8ben form in the us hollands reassures the good news is that the w 8ben isn t onerous and covers you for three years investors in overseas shares also need to be aware of what the experts call currency risk if a share is traded in a different currency the movement of that currency against the pound can erode or magnify your returns for example if you invested in a fund that tracked the s p 500 the us s major stock index the returns you receive will differ depending on whether you look at them in pounds or dollars in pounds total returns for the last five years are 103 per cent but in dollars they add up to 120 per cent funds and trust can provide an easier option if the thought of extra charges and currency fears put you off buying overseas household names directly you might want to consider investment funds that hold them these still carry currency risk but some use a strategy known as hedging to keep it in check the principle of hedging is simple it is a way of managing risk by taking an opposite position in something related to the risk you are holding in order to offset it life insurance is a way we hedge the risk of a major earner in our family being unable to provide for us a fund manager might use a financial instrument known as an option so they can mitigate the risk of any currency movement having an adverse impact on the portfolio they manage james carthew head of investment companies at quoteddata

contributor kelsie nabben one month into 2022 and the debate on cryptocurrency is already heating up with calls for regulation causing a rift between jurisdictions that are crypto friendly and those that aren t which will determine the future of the market russian deputy prime minister dmitry chernyshenko has reportedly signed a roadmap to regulate crypto operations in russia the news comes after russia s central bank published a consultation paper that proposed a blanket ban on crypto related activity in the country the paper titled cryptocurrencies trends risks and regulation states a wider adoption of cryptocurrencies creates significant risks for the russian financial market it says non state based currencies pose a threat to citizens well being through loss of investments as a result of market volatility scams and cyber attacks jurisdictions have grappled with the idea decentralised digital currencies provide an alternative to sovereign currency and thus pose a threat to central banks power over monetary policy although russia has stopped short of completely stifling operations inside its borders the latest events follow a broader trend of nations struggling to embrace cryptocurrency future bans or regulations will determine the future of the industry crypto ban or crypto friendly china has banned cryptocurrency trading multiple times an outright ban on crypto mining last year was a massive loss to the industry as most crypto mining happened in china mining involves running software on computer servers to solve cryptographic algorithms this process validates transactions and maintains a shared record of transactions across the blockchain network people who participate the miners are automatically rewarded in cryptocurrency mining is an international industry and large capital outlay goes towards the land power and infrastructure needed to set up mining warehouses the mining ban in china drove miners to sell or ship their equipment overseas and invest capital in friendlier jurisdictions particularly the united states one consequence was the strengthening of the network as mining operations were diversified as such future bans may have less of an effect on the market currently most bitcoin mining occurs in the us kazakhstan russia canada malaysia and iran some networks face great challenges in kazakhstan for instance power has reportedly been rationed away from miners to conserve energy during electricity shortages forcing miners to leave the country reports estimate this will cost kazakhstan s economy us 1 5 billion or a 2 14 billion over the next five years including us 300 million in tax revenue crypto isn t entirely anonymous crypto has come a long way since bitcoin s anonymous launch in 2009 there are now thousands of cryptocurrencies with an estimated total market cap of us 1 66 trillion about a 2 36 trillion it s often stated including in the recent report from russia s central bank that the anonymity of cryptocurrencies enables illegal activity such as money laundering terrorism financing and drug trade this isn t entirely true in fact transaction history on public blockchains such as bitcoin and ethereum the largest by market capitalisation is public many governments including those of australia and the us collaborate with large private blockchain analytics firms to monitor citizens crypto wallet addresses and transactions they do this to mitigate risks of money laundering and tax evasion contrary to popular belief most cryptocurrencies aren t anonymous they are pseudonymous if a person s identity is linked to their wallet address via a central touch point such as a cryptocurrency exchange or an email that wallet is traceable to the individual research commissioned by zcash but carried out by the rand corporation found there isn t widespread illicit use of privacy coins preserving users anonymity policy will determine future directions cryptocurrency continues to become increasingly mainstream as an investment asset class technological infrastructure and a social experiment in non state based infrastructure with this crypto communities hold growing influence in public policy debates for example crypto advocates were able to slow down a major federal government infrastructure bill in the us last year yet jurisdictions are choosing different pathways regarding policy and regulation some such as china and russia view it as a fiscal and ideological challenge to sovereign monies others view it as an opportunity for innovation investment and economic growth as different approaches emerge 2022 may be a defining year for both the crypto industry and those competing to either ban or welcome it past examples suggest countries that welcome crypto networks reap economic benefits through innovation investment jobs and taxes business benefits of adopting crypto as a digital asset include access to new demographics and technological efficiencies in treasury management at the same time the effects of policy and regulation on the industry demonstrates cryptocurrency isn t a completely decentralised thing that exists only on the blockchain australia s position in the competition to limit but benefit from cryptocurrency australia has emerged as a potential destination of crypto friendliness a report published in october by the senate select committee on australia as a technology and financial centre looks favourably on cryptocurrencies it proposes market licensing for crypto exchanges streamlined taxation arrangements and a regulatory structure for decentralised autonomous organisations or daos these function using the same philosophy of self governance as decentralised cryptocurrency networks using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency tokens to manage participation and enforce rules australia s choice is to capture the enormous economic potential of decentralised digital assets how this will impact the national economy remains to be seen but if history is a lesson to be learned from we can expect policy to shape outcomes kelsie nabben researcher phd candidate rmit blockchain

forward expectations for the used car market and the broad market sell off hurt carvana stock last month what happened shares of carvana cvna 6 88 plummeted 30 1 in january according to data provided by s p global market intelligence the e commerce platform for buying and selling used cars was downgraded due to forward expectations for its end market and was hurt by the sharp decline in high growth stocks last month so what there was no material financial news released by carvana last month although it did just announce it was doing a super bowl advertisement with earnings coming out on feb 24 however with so much news around the used car industry investors have gotten skittish about the company s prospects used car prices have soared since the start of the pandemic creating a good portion of the inflation we are currently seeing in the united states this has been good for carvana s gross margins but the lack of used car inventory across the nation has the potential to hurt carvana s overall sales this is likely why the stock is down 50 in the last six months as investors believe that revenue growth may slow in the coming quarters unless used car inventories revert to normal it should be noted while this does seem to be the speculation among the investment community so far it hasn t materialized in carvana s business last quarter carvana did 3 48 billion in sales growing 125 year over year on top of the used car market carvana sold off along with the declines in high growth stocks last month the ishares russell 1000 growth etf was down around 10 in january this broad based decline added more fuel to the decline in carvana s stock price now what with carvana s stock down 50 in the last six months to 150 a share the stock now has a market cap of 26 billion over the last 12 months the company has generated 10 9 billion in revenue and 1 66 billion in gross profit it is not generating positive net income that gives the stock a price to sales ratio p s of 2 4 and a price to gross profit ratio p gp of 15 7 the low p s might make you think carvana stock is inexpensive right now but with such low gross margins that may be inflated along with used car prices the stock is still not cheap even after this 50 drawdown this doesn t mean you should avoid buying carvana stock because if it can keep growing its top line in the triple digits this high p gp will likely come down quickly over the next few years but the stock is not cheap no matter where its share price was six months ago

politics in nigeria and the imperatives of prophecy adeboye nigeria is a religious country and is it believed that it is one of the most active countries with stock of prophets who frequently reel out god s revelation on personal affairs social issues and often predict what could happen in the future many of nigeria s prophets both dead and alive have emerged in the last century such as joseph ayo babalola enoch adeboye joshua selman t b joshua and several others and they have left an indelible imprint in the reconstruction of nigeria s prophetic politics prophets according to max weber the founder of sociology are bearers of charisma who by virtue of their mission proclaim a religious doctrine of divine commandment they are viewed as social activists revolutionists and those who have the panacea to societal malaise this is even more define given the roles played in the religious books as critics of maladministration advisors to kings and the task of nation building jesus jeremiah amos isaiah john the baptist and even prophet muhammed played significantly the roles of a prophet while at the same time providing the necessary background for the manifestation of their predictions nevertheless some philosophers see politics and prophecy as mutually exclusive one of the prominent among them fredrick nietzsche a nihilist for example tries to separate hermetically the place of a supreme being and the tendencies of what life has to offer to mankind to him good or bad things are natural and cannot be tied to whatever belief consciously or subconsciously he believes that man can embrace changes or attain any feat on basis of self development although nietzschean s teachings were radical inflammatory and schismatic it however speaks to the fact that instead of sitting and expecting miracles to occur one must position him or herself for greater goals through rediscovering and re evaluation of oneself aside from his anti religious tendencies he tells the truth to power in a daring manner over a century after the death of this radical philosopher there is still a deep rooted belief that politics and prophecy are siamese twins in our contemporary world today because of our belief that is deeply entrenched in a supreme being which gives hope and aspiration for the beneficiaries of such prophecy whereas many of the prophecies have misled people because of the emerging population of the prophets of doom while several other prophecies have manifested which thus raises the question of who the unsuspecting public should listen to the narratives of politics in nigeria cannot be completed without recourse to prophecy because it serves as an imaginary template for victory for instance in the build up to the 2015 general election several clerics have prophesized the emergence of president muhamadu buhari one of them was rev fr ejike mbaka who during his message from good luck to bad luck in 2015 predicted that the katsina born soldier would defeat president goodluck jonathan however nigerians especially the political class still hold a strong belief in prophecy and its prediction stories of how some key politicians in the country have continued to patronize prophet magician and marabout could not have been more professed than this especially when the former presidential candidate of the people s democratic party atiku abubakar was accused to have been promised of winning the 2019 election by a marabout in femi adesina s article entitled atiku they gave him a false sense of hope in recent times the revered pastor enoch adeboye of the redeem christian church of god went down memory lane when he stirs the hornet nest on what transpired in the 1993 election adeboye recalled how god revealed to him how none of the presidential candidates would emerge as against the principle and ethos of an election where a winner must be declared it turned out that the election of late mko abiola was annulled by the military despot despite scoring the highest number of the votes cast the place of prophecy cannot be underestimated as seen in the prediction of one of the most celebrated social leaders and theologists in the united states martin luther king had at a point predicted the emergence of a black president in the country many years ago in his popular speech i have a dream where he said but i do think that the day will come in the not too distant future when the negro vote itself and will be powerful enough to be a coalition with liberals and the white community and thereby elect a negro president of the united states little did martin luther know that his prediction would come to pass when barrack obama a negro was elected the president of the united states while we have those prophets who have predicted in clear terms there are several ones whose prophecies have tend towards duplicity locally and in the international space many political prophecies have been null and void in nigeria for example many prophets predicted arrogantly that they would succeed president buhari in the aso villa and that they have been ordained to take the country to utopia in fact some even prophesized that the president would die and would not have the opportunity to finish his term it can also be said that many prophets in the united states predicted that president donald trump would win for the second term amidst centrifugal tensions and hatred towards the former us president for daring to be vociferous and blunt trump lost and not only that but he was also disgraced and us democracy went into the state of physical confrontation for the first time in decades some of the prophets who predicted wrongly his second term winning apologized but can god lie this therefore becomes retrospective to state that the late fredrick nietzsche might be right to have professed that god is dead and that through our dealings we have killed god we have killed god because the emergence of prophets of doom have denudated the tenets of the real prophecy of god which is beyond guesswork we have killed god because our political system and its governance system have continued to breed people of questionable characters that have not only their interests but have continued to make societies vulnerable to various forms of social vices such as the ongoing terrorist pestilence kidnapping unemployment inflation and numerous vices ahead of the 2023 election the revered prophet enoch adeboye has revealed that god has not spoken to him on who will be crowned as the next president of the most populous black nation on earth adeboye emphasized that prophecy is beyond conjectures and hypotheses but must be strictly guided by god for it to make sense conversely another prophet has predicted that a certain politician who has been incarcerated at a point would succeed buhari in the 2023 election even though buhari had recently said he would not reveal his favorite candidate to avert sinister occurrence aside from this political permutations have kicked started with a strong indication that people like the governor of ekiti state dr kayode fayemi and other southern politicians would throw their hat into the presidential race based on their sterling performance and track record as a politician in ekiti another prophet has predicted the emergence of the all progressive congress candidate in the 2022 gubernatorial poll even has it remains glaring that the opposition party stands no chance prophecies like this would therefore serve as an impetus for political gladiators to remain focused so that such prediction can come to pass for example biodun oyebanji s ambition has been described as ordained by god by his lovers and foot soldiers what we need especially in nigeria are visionary leaders that can transform nigeria s society into an eldorado visionary leaders are an impetus to societal growth and they are corps of individuals who see the future plan it make peace declare war and ultimately unite the nation prophecy without action or proper positioning might take an eternity to work israel the small middle east nation after all is not great because its leaders rely solely on god s prophecy they labored protected built reconstructed and positioned themselves for greater opportunities israel is the only nation in the world to have enjoyed god s prophecy mercy guidance and manifestation prophecies are appurtenances of god s clemency nigeria can stand a chance to be great if visionary leaders are given a premium beyond mediocrity ineptitude and incompetence prophecy requires that the best brain should handle the education power energy and security sector despite many shortcomings of prophecies in our societies it is never enough to say that god has ceased to speak to his chosen ones in fact during the numerous trying times of late africa s sage obafemi awolowo predicted that lekki would flourish prosper and be great but can it prosper without putting efforts sweats and labor

remote work and pandemic tailwinds have helped drive the company s growth tractor supply tsco 1 19 is a unique retailer and one that has successfully resisted the rise of amazon amzn 1 35 and e commerce in this episode of beat and raise recorded on jan 27 fool contributors will healy and brian withers discuss tractor supply s fourth quarter earnings report and why the retail stock has such a strong track record 10 stocks we like better than tractor supply when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and tractor supply wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 10 2022 brian withers will is back this time with tractor supply yes one of my favorite retailers will healy yes i think this one s a little bit more familiar with everyone in the audience they have operated about 2 000 stores and are into rural lifestyle they also operate about 175 petsense stores too as well anyway they brought in 3 3 billion in revenue for q4 that was up 15 that beat estimates and they also beat estimates for their earnings earnings per share came in at 1 93 up 68 very nice bump there the outlook for fiscal 2022 13 7 billion in revenue up 8 not quite as high as 2021 where it was up 20 but it s a beat in estimates nonetheless like i said for the fiscal year revenues up 20 income 35 pretty solid numbers a few years ago this was a slower growth company but with all the changing trends people are becoming more interested in agriculture in general a lot of people don t know this but the average age of the american farmer is almost 58 years old so in addition to all the inflation pressures we ve had recently there s really concerning demographic trends and we all need to eat i think we all want the average age of the farmer to come down but nonetheless that trend is helping tractor supply greater than 10 same store sales for the seventh consecutive quarter dividends 77 higher it s now 3 68 cents per share annually which is a yield of about 1 7 that s a massive increase excuse me this is another indication of how well the company has been doing recently and they also authorized 2 billion in share buybacks moving onto concerns one concern that stuck out with me was inflation contributed about 700 basis points or 7 comparable store sales so when you factor that in the comparable store sales aren t quite 10 but it s still a fairly solid number when it comes to that as you can see on the chart the stock is up about 41 over the last year and that handily beat the s p 500 there s so many tailwinds with this industry there s the inflation and i think there s just more interest in farming in general now that you have wine and you have cannabis but i think from what i ve seen a lot of people just care more about where their food comes from i think this has kind of sparked a greater interest in agriculture especially with the pandemic you have people moving out to the ex suburbs the area beyond the suburbs where they can buy a few acres and participate in this rural lifestyle tractor supply fits these customers like a glove i think it fits in perfectly with their needs withers yeah there may be a megatrend there of people moving out of cities and certainly for many jobs now you can remote work from anywhere is why not get some land and have some horses and grow some corn and become a local tractor supply company customer healy yes get some chickens have your own organic eggs it solves several problems all at one time withers yeah for members not familiar with this company this trend here of beating the market over the past year this is what the company does every single year you look over the last five years and it s up about 180 versus the s p up 100 if you look at the last decade it s up 425 versus 300 with the s p i think these guys have done a tremendous job of fending off amazon for one and then just through retail malaise and retail stocks with brick and mortar have taken a tremendous hit but these guys are really focused on their customer the out there customer and they ve done a ton of things during the coronavirus to make it easier for them to shop whether it s curbside pickup or expanding their online presence and hal lawton the new ceo came on just before the coronavirus in late 2019 and he s been a breath of fresh air for the company and has really committed to employees raising their pay and he immediately came in and said we re going to hire another 6 000 employees across our employee base as people are out sick or you need more people to wipe down things or carry product out to cars for customers it s just done a tremendous job i just can t say enough about as a retail brick and mortar company these guys are just stellar healy you have to remember too that they have 2 000 stores or almost 2 000 stores across the country these are mainly in ex suburbs or small towns i m not

the nation s food supply chain is showing signs of strain as increasing numbers of workers are falling ill with the coronavirus in meat processing plants warehouses and grocery stores the spread of the virus through the food and grocery industry is expected to cause disruptions in production and distribution of certain products like pork industry executives labor unions and analysts have warned in recent days the issues follow nearly a month of stockpiling of food and other essentials by panicked shoppers that have tested supply networks as never before industry leaders and observers acknowledge the shortages could increase but they insist it is more of an inconvenience than a major problem people will have enough to eat they just may not have the usual variety the food supply remains robust they say with hundreds of millions of pounds of meat in cold storage there is no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through food or its packaging according to the department of agriculture still the illnesses have the potential to cause shortages lasting weeks for a few products creating further anxiety for americans already shaken by how difficult it can be to find high demand staples like flour and eggs you might not get what you want when you want it said christine mccracken a meat industry analyst at rabobank in new york consumers like to have a lot of different choices and the reality is in the short term we just don t have the labor to make that happen advertisement in one of the most significant signs of pressure since the pandemic began smithfield foods became the latest company to announce a shutdown announcing sunday that it would close its processing plant in sioux falls south dakota after 230 workers became ill with the virus the plant produces more than 5 of the nation s pork the closure of this facility combined with a growing list of other protein plants that have shuttered across our industry is pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply smithfield s chief executive kenneth m sullivan said in a statement as of saturday the plant s covid 19 cases were more than half south dakota s active total gov kristi noem said she called the outbreak an alarming statistic and asked smithfield to shut down the facility for two weeks the problems at the sioux falls pork plant show the food processing industry s vulnerability to an outbreak employees often work shoulder to shoulder and some companies have granted sick leave only to employees who test positive for the coronavirus that potentially leaves on the job thousands of other infected workers who haven t been tested hastening the infection s spread other major processors have had to shut down plants jbs usa the world s largest meat processor closed a plant in pennsylvania for two weeks last week cargill closed a facility in pennsylvania where it produces steaks ground beef and ground pork and tyson halted operations at a pork plant in iowa after more than two dozen workers tested positive labor is going to be the biggest thing that can break said karan girotra a supply chain expert at cornell university if large numbers of people start getting sick in rural america all bets are off at the other end of the supply chain grocery stores are also dealing with increasing illnesses among workers as well as absences by those afraid to go in to work even as company officials called them essential for their role in feeding the country grocery store workers went weeks without being provided with face masks and other protective gear advertisement some food companies have been slow to provide the gear while others tried but found that their orders were rerouted to the health care industry where there is also a dire need a few grocery workers say they are still waiting to be supplied with masks despite federal health guidelines that recommend everybody wear one in public the workers also face a threat from their exposure to customers who continue to stock up on food some the workers say don t wear masks and fail to keep an adequate level of social distancing there are no government agencies tracking illnesses among food industry workers nationwide the united food and commercial workers international union which represents 1 3 million grocery store food processing and meat packing employees said monday that at least 1 500 of its members had been infected with the virus and that 30 of them have died the covid 19 pandemic represents a clear and present danger to our workers and our nation s food supply ufcw international s president marc perrone said even before the illnesses began to spread through the industry the supply chain had been tested intensely truck drivers who were already scarce before the pandemic couldn t make deliveries fast enough hot dog factories and dairy farmers ramped up production in response to waves of panic buying those surges continue to take a toll on a system that had been built largely for customers seeking speed and convenience not stockpiling on sunday amazon said it was getting new customers seeking online grocery delivery from whole foods and amazon fresh to effectively sign up for a waitlist it s an unusual concession for an internet giant that is used to unimpeded growth on some days shoppers still cannot find flour eggs or other staples that are in high demand retailers and manufacturers have offered reassurances that these shortages are temporary and merely reflect a distribution and production network that cannot work fast enough the parts of the food system that will suffer the worst disruptions are the ones dependent on heavily consolidated supply chains that employ large numbers of people girotra of cornell said advertisement the smithfield plant in south dakota is a stark example of a vulnerable link in the chain on its own it produces 130 million servings of food per week it employs 3 700 people many of whom work closely together deboning and cutting up meat last week south dakota officials watched the number of cases there increase at an alarming rate smithfield said it would shut down the building for three days to sanitize the facility but as the number of covid 19 cases surpassed more than half of all cases in sioux falls and the surrounding county state officials asked the plant to close for 14 days to protect the employees the families the sioux falls community and the people of south dakota noem said saturday the next day smithfield said it would shut down until further notice and pay its workers for the next two weeks the state has not reported outbreaks at any other meat processing plants south dakota officials said smithfield had ramped up testing of its employees suggesting that this could have resulted in rates that were higher than in other populations in the state some big food producers are coming up with contingency plans absences have risen at some plants run by mississippi based chicken processor sanderson farms though not at a level that would significantly disrupt production said mike cockrell the company s chief financial officer the company has explored alternatives in case large numbers of its workers become sick much of the labor at a processing plant involves deboning chicken and dividing it into cuts like breasts thighs and wings a reduced staff could continue packaging chicken but skip the labor intensive process of dividing up the birds you could change your mix and produce a less consumer friendly product with fewer people cockrell said that s not a disaster at the grocery store he said you would see a whole chicken and you could take that chicken home advertisement shopping solutions in the grocery industry many of the solutions to keeping the supply chain functioning are also simple workers say the ufcw for instance is urging states to mandate that shoppers wear masks and appealing to customers to shop smart by refraining from touching products using a shopping list and making fewer trips to the store aaron squeo who works in the meat department at a kroger supermarket in madison heights michigan said customers needed to practice better social distancing i have seen whole families out like it s an outing squeo said this can t continue like this we need to truly change how we shop our lives are at stake

menafn ians by nikhila natarajan new york feb 5 ians fang or faang if you prefer adding another a into the colourful double meaning big tech acronym needs renaming anyway not merely because the f in facebook is m eta now or that mark zuckerberg faltered so spectacularly this quarter the case for revisitation involves fundamental premises on which big tech godzillas hold the keys to our digital futures so even as meta saw 230 billion of market cap melt away three of the big techs microsoft alphabet and amazon buoyed investors with stellar results each one bested analyst numbers in essence tech companies that control key gateways to e commerce and hybrid work and in some cases streaming entertainment have not seen a dip microsoft and alphabet rode on the back of cloud services at microsoft azure and other cloud services was the fastest growing division raking in 46 per cent more revenues in the december quarter compared to the year before at alphabet too the cloud product generated 45 per cent more sales in the fourth quarter compared with last year at n5 5 billion this beat street estimates of 5 4 billion the division s operating loss narrowed by 45 per cent to 3 1 billion in 2021 cloud services are leases of processing power to third party businesses so they do not have to run their own servers a factset consensus stated that microsoft and alphabet are taking the market away from their biggest competitor to be fair however rival amazon s aws which counts peloton and netflix as customers is growing too countering fears that apple too would be hit by the same supply chain issues that have dented e retailers like amazon iphone revenues increased 9 per cent to 71 6 billion analysts had forecasted 70 billion overall apple s net profit was up 20 per cent thanks partly to the 24 per cent growth in its high margin service units like app store and apple music the pincer of margins fads and analyst expectation spilled over to mid size tech too peloton and robinhood both poster children for lockdown shares in the us seem emblematic peloton an at home fitness business went public in september 2019 and saw takers zoom from 100 000 in 2017 to 2 77 million in the most recent quarter but even this figure came in below low end guidance of 2 8 million due to this slowing demand peloton has temporarily halted production of its connected fitness products cnbc reported and share prices slumped more than four fifths in the past year analysts have turned the screws further for the months ahead likewise robinhood even as americans took to commission free trading and the company s revenues almost doubled to 1 82 billion via 17 3 million active monthly users 48 per cent more than in december 2020 maus fell 1 6 million from the quarter before on their part analysts had expected an increase of 1 million robinhood expects a 35 per cent annual drop in revenue in the next quarter netflix seemed closer to real cash flows than either peloton or robinhood but subscriptions suffered signs of fatigue in the last quarter of 2021 additions were 8 3 million below expectations of 8 5 million and the just 2 5 million net subs added for the first quarter of 2022 this is nearly 40 per cent closer that the 4 million the company added in the first quarter of 2021 rivals amazon prime disney and hbo kept hammering more content and growing their subscriber base on top of this with covid 19 restrictions lifting core audiences seemed to be spending more leisure time away from small screens the only option therefore was burning cash on fresh content result an erosion of operating margins netflix s long term growth potential has far from ended though hedge fund pershing square capital management purchased 1 1 billion worth of shares just last month it justified this saying that netflix was a primary beneficiary of the growth in streaming and the decline in linear tv driven by its superior customer experience such optimism aside netflix s comparators are proving to be tougher than most in contrast for apple alphabet and microsoft it seems business as usual google parent alphabet posted quarterly sales topping expectations tuesday its advertising business surged on consumers using search as they shopped online and clients consequently upping their marketing budgets alphabet s sales were up 32 per cent to 75 3 billion in the fourth quarter for a third straight quarterly sales record and topped the average estimate of 72 billion among financial analysts tracked by refinitiv shares jumped more than 8 per cent synched in part to the announcement that the company would undertake a 20 to one stock split there is a split in the jury though naysayers feel the benefits of split tactics diminish value the share price reinforced the global trend that a more digital economy has made big tech companies meta being an exception resistant to small market shocks why consumers had dived into google to search for apparel and hobbyist items while retail finance entertainment and travel advertisers had raised marketing budgets the consensus among analysts is that google which generates more revenue from internet ads than any other company on the planet is unstoppable for the foreseeable future across 2021 and 2020 google s advertising business including youtube accounted for 81 per cent of alphabet s revenues amazon com inc and bytedance s tiktok have been been nibbling away small pieces of google s share of the global advertising market but market forecasters do not expect major slippage in google s base the secondary businesses including cloud also have been lifting overall sales alphabet also reported a quarterly sales record during the holiday season for its google pixel smartphones despite what ceo sundar pichai called extremely challenging supply constraints pichai also said cloud is exploring how to support clients that want to use blockchain one of several emerging technologies that proponents view as crucial to kickstarting a new era of online innovations multiple lawsuits pushing back on google s anticompetitive conduct in the advertising and mobile app store markets continue to be his biggest challenges google already has said that efforts to lower play app store fees might assuage some of these concerns but will dent revenues this hasn t stopped the cash hoard from growing by nearly 3 billion in 2021 to 139 6 billion with another 50 billion going to buying back shares like zuckerberg and the metaverse not all of pichai s bets are working out just as yet the operating loss for other bets a unit that includes self driving technology company waymo and other non google ventures was 5 3 billion in 2021 widening from 4 5 billion in 2020 shares in the social media platform splash plunged 23 per cent thursday as investors fretted that a weak revenue forecast from meta would spill over into the wider digital advertising sector the end result of all the stock market drama was that snap s shares settled back to the level they were trading at just three weeks ago on the macro front volatility has stalked tech stocks sparked by the prospect of rising interest rates and a slowdown in digital demand but after the blizzard of fourth quarter earnings announcements the mood elsewhere in big tech was far more sanguine the big tech growth story is far from broken a continuation of the buoyant demand for the underlying technologies that support the digital economy cloud computing services along with pcs and smartphones means that the 2022 growth runway looks pretty good for most of these companies things are slowing down but it isn t falling off a cliff said jefferies the curtain on the earnings season for the biggest tech companies came down late on thursday as news of amazon s earnings sent a wave of relief across wall street the company s shares surged 15 per cent in after hours trading even though it missed revenue expectations resilience was not universally on display particularly among some companies that benefited most from pandemic restrictions privacy changes introduced by apple in the middle of last year have complicated the picture

this article is more than 2 years old university of michigan the financial markets were stunned by the huge rise in net new jobs in both the establishment payroll survey 467k consensus forecast 125k a monthly survey of businesses and the household survey 1 2 million a similar survey of individual households this was especially surprising given the weakening economic data that has shown up since thanksgiving the fact that adp the nation s largest payroll processor reported two days earlier that it estimated 301k fewer payrolls in january than in december and the absenteeism spike to 9 of the workforce in january due to omicron revisionism the january data contain bls s annual benchmark revisions these are one time and permanent revisions to the employment data for 2021 and they significantly upwardly revised the population and labor force levels as a result because those two series were estimated to be higher then voila employment must have been higher too bls uses a concurrent seasonal adjustment process which re estimates seasonal adjustment factors each month as the year progresses while the seasonally adjusted numbers are changed for each month bls only reports updated revised data for the prior month it isn t until the benchmark revisions are issued in february that the public sees the entire story how forthcoming is that universal value advisors the table shows the differences between what was originally reported and revised the following month and the revised and permanent data looking at the last column in the table three of the months in 2021 were revised by more than 120 and four others by more than 27 thus relying on this data when first published might be hazardous to one s view of the strength of the economy this appears to be the case for january s sa headline employment data one should note that these estimates of employment in and of themselves do not add a single dollar to the gdp they are only meant as a measure of the health of the labor market we do recognize that seasonality exists but as we have said in many of our past blogs over the last two years the pandemic isn t seasonal and events caused by the pandemic distort the seasonal factors which result solely from a statistical process the absentee spike in january for example isn t likely to reoccur next january thus the resulting seasonally adjusted sa data may be misleading the bottom line bls does publish their raw data not seasonally adjusted nsa but most of the time the financial media ignores it looking at that nsa data for january 2022 we find that the actual change nsa in the establishment payroll survey between december and january was 2 824 million you read that right this data comes from table b 1 of bls s the employment situation january 2022 compare that to the 467k sa number that the markets locked in on a difference of 3 29 million we didn t see a single mention of this in the media bls s table a 1 shows nsa data from the household survey as indicated above the sa number was 1 2 million 1 199 million to the 3rd decimal the nsa number was 114k again a difference of over 1 3 million ah the magic of seasonal adjustment it amazes us that with the data continuing to show a weakening economy the markets could do such an about face based on data so dependent on a statistical process as indicated above we believe that the pandemic has caused significant changes in behavior which are temporary transitory and that the statistical process of seasonal adjustment considers these temporary behavior patterns as permanent thus distorting the seasonally adjusted data for example the omicron variant sidelined 9 of the workforce in january i e absenteeism 2 is normal we along with many economic commentators believed that this would negatively impact january s employment surveys the largely negative nsa data discussed above appears to attest to that furthermore in the january data release we also find that the workweek declined from 34 8 hours in november to 34 7 in december and to 34 5 hours in january i e apparently the result of people being absent from work see chart rosenberg research estimates that accounting for the shortened workweek would change the sa 467k headline number to 400k universal value advisors emerging data let s start with adp this is america s largest payroll processor since they actually deal with payrolls as opposed to bls which conducts surveys and applies statistical techniques one would think that their data would accurately reflect reality the adp chart below coincides with and reinforces other economic data showing economic slowing since last summer which we have chronicled in this blog over the last few months universal value advisors the atlanta fed whose gdpnow model is normally optimistic regarding real gdp growth shows february 1 release an estimated 0 1 real q1 gdp growth rate initial unemployment claims ics have recently spiked indicating labor market issues see right hand side of the chart below note that ics are still well above normal shown on the chart s left side much of the inventory build up which was responsible for more than 70 of q4 s gdp growth appears to be unwanted it is likely that inventory won t add to q1 gdp as it did in q4 this and the ballooning trade deficit appear to be huge headwinds for q1 s gdp as noted above hours worked have been falling the result is that take home pay only advanced 4 2 y y well under inflation s 7 rise this bodes ill for consumer spending as shown in the university of michigan s consumer sentiment survey which has now fallen to levels normally only seen in recessions as shown in the chart at the top of this blog the index is now below its 2021 recession low universal value advisors home and auto buying intentions continue at 40 year lows with buying intentions for large household goods at their lowest point in nearly 50 years see chart university of michigan we also note that the labor force participation rate rose 0 3 percentage points to 62 2 pre pandemic level was 63 4 the first significant rise in several months apparently with helicopter free money now in the rear view mirror and with the savings rate below pre pandemic levels there has been a need to produce income we suggested in past blogs that this would happen and think we will see a continuation of this trend over the next few months the good news here is that as people re enter the workforce the upward pressure on wages will begin to abate the fed given the headline employment data the fed will surely raise the fed funds rate at its march meeting markets are still calling for a 25 basis point 0 25 pct points but some see the possibility of a 50 bps hike we along with a few other market economists think it would be better policy to first run off the excess mortgage backed and treasury securities from the balance sheet that would begin to deflate the housing and equity market bubbles and impact wall street and wealthier citizens as the liquidity provided by the fed s growing balance sheet feeds those markets on the other hand raising interest rates disproportionately impacts lower income households cost of credit and rising mortgage rates despite the headline employment data we still see weakening economic growth and believe that the ultimate number of 25 basis point increases in the fed funds rate will be far fewer than the 4 to 5 such moves markets have priced in for 2022 and 3 to 4 for 2023 parting thoughts recent economic data continue to show slower economic growth these are headwinds for q1 gdp the headline employment data upon closer scrutiny only appears strong because of data revisions and the magic of seasonal adjustment joshua barone contributed to this blog

equivalent of 112 750 today and settled into the vibrant neighborhood with his wife evelyn and their children his sons joey and willie quickly bonded with the other kids who lived on the block after walking home from grace school the children played football and foursquare in the street frequently drawing the ire of an elderly neighbor mr holloway who didn t want the boys running through his immaculate yard they bought penny candies from harry s corner store and rode their bikes the short trip to the custard stand at edgewood and euclid avenues where they feasted on hot dogs hamburgers and frozen custard and where teenagers gathered after basketball games to catch glimpses of their crushes akron innerbelt project destroyed black owned businesses in its path willie johnson stands in front of what used to be his family s home at 533 douglas st in akron the johnson family blames the construction of the akron innerbelt for its depreciation in value when they owned the house there were painful memories too one year a baby died when the house across the street caught fire the father of another household struggled with alcoholism but the community on douglas street was tight knit neighbors supported and looked out for each other through the ups and downs of life then one by one people began to leave the neighborhood in the late 1960s rumors circulated that a highway was coming through and the city was taking people s homes to make way for it city leaders had big plans for the akron innerbelt a highway connecting downtown akron to the suburbs instead it became a highway to nowhere a never completed road that tore apart a neighborhood and pushed hundreds of black families out of their homes and off the path to generational wealth black families that had worked hard to buy houses long the standard for accruing and passing on generational wealth lost them overnight many became renters and entered public housing developments some were able to purchase homes in other parts of the city though white flight followed them those who kept their homes also lost as declining property values prevented them from being able to build equity incomplete records mean that we do not know the exact number of houses razed or individuals displaced by the akron innerbelt a 1975 document compiled by the akron department of planning and urban renewal notes that at least 737 households were displaced during the highway s first two phases of construction but that figure does not account for two later phases lasting until 1987 and former city employees displaced residents advocates and local historians believe the number is higher in 2017 the ohio department of transportation began to decommission a portion of the highway which the city acquired in september now the mistakes of the past are guiding discussions about the future of a 30 acre decommissioned stretch of the highway in the heart of akron this is my house akron officials seized property to make way for innerbelt to make way for the innerbelt in the late 1960s city officials had been seizing property through eminent domain and offering a small amount of cash to homeowners for relocation purposes the payouts which frequently were contested by homeowners were often not enough to purchase new homes in the late 1960s and early 1970s the city was offering about 5 000 to each homeowner though on rare occasions payments were as high as 15 000 when the city did not approach johnson to buy his house he was devastated johnson knew that if he stayed in the neighborhood his house would end up being worth next to nothing a sanborn map from the 1930s shows some of the homes and businesses that were affected decades later by the akron innerbelt construction from west cedar street to the northeast to wooster avenue to the south all of the homes to the south of his were razed to make way for the highway the innerbelt cut through the middle of douglas bell berry and other nearby residential streets turning them into dead ends a comparison of akron street directories from 1968 and 1988 offers a glimpse into the extent of the destruction on douglas street which lost about 150 buildings bell street lost 160 buildings and berry avenue lost about 30 property values on douglas street and the surrounding areas impacted by the highway construction began to plummet with so many families leaving the neighborhood school enrollment also declined which led to school closures further depreciating home values by 1996 40 years after flanvis johnson purchased it the johnson home was worth only 11 940 meanwhile average property values in akron stood at 45 931 still the johnsons tried to maintain their home after flanvis died in 2002 an aging evelyn lived alone at 533 douglas st bishop joey johnson pastor of the house of the lord holds a photograph of his family s home on douglas street that his father purchased in the late 1950s the family blames the akron innerbelt construction for the home s depreciation joey who is now the senior pastor at the house of the lord paid off the rest of the mortgage but the home had also fallen into disrepair and insurance companies refused to insure it unless costly renovations were made joey faced a dilemma he could continue pouring money into the property money that the family would never recover to make it safe and habitable for his mother or he could move her into a senior living facility that was a very difficult proposition she wanted to stay joey said when the day came to move evelyn into the assisted living facility she was in tears i don t want to move this is my house she cried to her son after evelyn left the home her son willie who had been renting another property at the time moved into the home on douglas street but he inherited unpaid bills and fell behind on taxes and eventually lost the house in 2008 the home went into foreclosure and was sold to a private company in 2017 for 2 500 this is a photograph of the home purchased by flanvis j johnson on douglas street in the late 1950s it was not one of the homes purchased by the city to make way for the akron innerbelt but the family blames the home s depreciation on the highway construction occupied by another owner today 533 douglas st is appraised at 18 500 the home lies in a census tract where in 2020 average property values hovered at 18 948 a fraction of the citywide average of 66 184 flanvis johnson was never able to pass on the fruits of his labor to future generations of his family in the african american community rarely does anybody leave anybody anything you end up paying to have them buried i was left nothing i was left with bills joey johnson said every time i got ready to buy a house buy a car go to school there is no wealth accumulated so you have to do all of that on your own he said reflecting on how the loss of property value on his family s home after the innerbelt s construction decimated his family s wealth after marrying joey and his wife moved into the spring hill subsidized housing development he was not able to purchase a home until later in life and even then he was limited in the kind of home he could buy at age 69 joey continues to work because he is unable to afford retirement aerial photograph of construction of the innerbelt in akron taken in 1978 today the median u s black household possesses less than 15 of the net wealth of median white households homeownership and home equity account for two thirds of a family s net wealth according to ladale winling a professor of urban history at virginia tech in 1960 53 of nonwhite families in akron owned their homes according to the u s census bureau though homeownership rates in akron have since fallen for both white and black families in 2019 only 34 of black families in the city lived in owner occupied homes compared to 59 of white families equity is the key to social mobility and generational wealth accumulation and for african americans and other racial groups the odds have been stacked against homeownership because of racial discrimination racial segregation said eric avila an urban planning professor at ucla when folks were able to buy a home in segregated neighborhoods that was an achievement but it was undermined highway construction devalued property among homeowners who lived in the vicinity of highway building projects that story is repeated on the national level and i think partly helps to explain the racial wealth gap the racial biases inherent within the federal highway building program disproportionately affected african american homeowners and prevented an entire generation of black homeowners from realizing generational wealth he said why akron innerbelt was built first proposed in 1960 the akron innerbelt was conceived as part of a 15 mile long expressway that would run from u s route 224 in barberton through downtown akron to state route 8 and then through to kent the rationale behind the akron innerbelt which began to be built under mayor john ballard in 1970 was linked to a larger trend in urban planning and highway projects throughout the country with the rise of the automobile and the proliferation of suburban housing developments after world war ii many americans flocked to the suburbs retail businesses and newly constructed malls followed them there while downtowns began to decline in akron good paying rubber factory jobs began disappearing in the 1960s this architectural drawing circa 1968 shows the original plan to hook up the north end of the akron innerbelt to state route 8 the project would have involved a bridge running from near howard street all the way to the current route 8 bridge a full interchange would have been constructed above the little cuyahoga valley estimated cost today more than 1 billion with support from the federal aid highway act of 1956 planners looked to the interstate highway system as a way of reversing urban decline by making it easier for suburbanites to drive to and from downtowns where they would shop or work the akron innerbelt would provide the much needed stimulation for further economic growth in the akron metropolitan area concluded a 1963 report from the akron department of planning and urban renewal at the time 23 000 or 18 3 of jobs in the city were located downtown but the proposed location of the innerbelt points to the structurally racist underpinnings of urban renewal and housing policies of the era nationwide experts say it also ran counter to a federally funded effort to invest in that neighborhood through the model cities program a 1939 map of akron shows that the areas slated for demolition to make way for the innerbelt had been redlined the term was used to denote neighborhoods usually predominantly black that the federal government had labeled undesirable or hazardous and therefore risky for lenders consequently banks often refused to lend to black homeowners living in redlined areas whether to buy homes or repair the ones they owned the area designated for the innerbelt construction contained enough blighted housing and substandard conditions to warrant either total clearance or almost total clearance according to the 1963 akron report to enact their vision for urban renewal planners and developers across the country followed paths of least financial and political resistance winling said after decades of discriminatory lending the new highways would run through neighborhoods where communities of color lived which were deemed less valuable and therefore cheapest to bulldoze these same communities also often lacked political representatives that would have stood up to the interests of the planners and builders crews work on a portion of what is now a 54 inch storm drain bed under the akron innerbelt bell street used to run through the area before the construction of the innerbelt akron completed three major urban renewal projects around downtown grant washington lane wooster and opportunity park which displaced significant portions of the city s black population by 1975 urban renewal projects including the innerbelt had relocated 3 197 households according to municipal records meanwhile in the mid 1960s residents in the nearby affluent and white suburb of fairlawn successfully protested and prevented the state from running interstate 77 through their community white affluent or white middle class communities had the wherewithal to block highway construction avila said they had the political clout they had connections in city hall they had resources and access to forms of mobilization that african american and other minority communities did not have so the existing pattern of highway construction today what was built and what wasn t built conforms to a racially and economically skewed pattern of political resistance that was successful largely in white affluent communities and not successful in poor and or minority communities as historian richard rothstein notes in his book the color of law a forgotten history of how our government segregated america by the 1950s and 1960s terms like slums and blight were tossed around euphemistically to refer to black neighborhoods city officials tried to control the movement of black people away from downtowns so that white suburban commuters would not have to interact with them rothstein wrote and they did so through slum clearance one slum clearance tool was the construction of the federal interstate highway system rothstein wrote road to nowhere backers of the innerbelt project could have changed course in 1970 the american institute of architects met with akron urban planners and proposed alternative routes to the east or west of the eventual path but akron planners maintained the route which would also cut through the center of black commerce on wooster avenue and shutter more than 100 businesses would be most efficient best accommodate traffic and would greatly reduce costs city officials said that adopting one of the alternative routes would have increased costs by 300 000 and delayed construction for up to two years akron s current urban planner jason segedy explained that because the wealth in akron and its suburbs like fairlawn parts of copley and bath lie to the northwest planners prioritized ramps to the west onto interstate 76 the rev greg harrison stands on the spot where his family used to rent on 636 douglas st the family had to move because of the akron innerbelt construction the home was destroyed along with hundreds of other surrounding houses and businesses the rev greg harrison whose family was displaced from their home at 636 douglas st in the 1960s said the lack of ramps enabled white people from the suburbs to travel to downtown akron without having to enter any black neighborhoods at the same time it severed access for the people living in the neighborhoods it was a bypass of the black neighborhoods at the cost of black neighborhoods harrison said segedy too views the innerbelt more as a blight removal tool and urban renewal project than a well thought out transportation project it was literally a road to nowhere he said construction on the highway lasted until 1987 despite its 300 million price tag a combination of state and federal funds the akron innerbelt ultimately never connected to route 8 because the money had dried up jason segedy director of planning and urban development for akron says the akron innerbelt was literally a road to nowhere the highway did not actually bring more traffic or wealth from the suburbs to downtown on the contrary segedy believes the road made it easier for people and wealth to continue moving outward and away from the city designed to accommodate 120 000 cars daily by the early 2000s the innerbelt saw only about 18 000 cars per day a 1977 paper by frank j kendrick a political science professor at the university of akron details how the innerbelt further segregated the city and carried with it a host of other negative socioeconomic and environmental consequences in exchange for saving suburban drivers 1 25 minutes of driving time a tremendous loss segedy said most people who were displaced by the innerbelt ended up in worse housing situations willie johnson watched many neighbors including homeowners move into public housing which municipal records show the city pushed aggressively during relocation efforts i believe that a lot of people ended up in section 8 because it was probably the quickest fix not a real fix but to solve an immediate problem of where do we go from here and i think many of them got trapped into section 8 he said tom fuller is the former executive director of alpha phi alpha homes in the 1970s he worked as a social worker in the city s relocation office helping displaced families find new homes while the akron innerbelt was being constructed tom fuller former executive director of alpha phi alpha homes inc a nonprofit that provides housing for low income seniors in akron many of whom are black was a social worker in the city s relocation office in the 1970s when the innerbelt was being constructed he went door to door helping to implement the city s policy of relocation and supporting families that were being displaced to find new housing at the time fuller was unaware of how the innerbelt project fit into larger systems of economic segregation and harm toward black communities i was interested in helping people get a leg up and that s what we were trying to do he said though he was able to help some renters transition to first time homeownership or otherwise improved conditions he estimates that only about 25 of people ended up in better situations today fuller sees the ongoing reverberations of the injuries inflicted by the innerbelt and urban renewal more generally the innerbelt relocation program offered displaced renters the opportunity to purchase homes with up to 4 000 in state funds toward a down payment renters had to match anything over 2 000 beacon journal reports from 1972 show the ohio department of transportation dragged its feet on advancing down payment assistance to people experiencing hardship in violation of state law without money for a down payment many renters remained in limbo and unable to move as a result nearly a year after the city began to purchase homes in the path of the highway s second phase of construction only 30 of the 487 affected families many of whom were renters were relocated in a 1972 beacon journal article roland a nesslinger who was then deputy director of the state highway department s right of way division justified the state s deferral of payments by claiming renters might spend relocation funds on color television sets or cars instead of the more important responsibility of using the money for adequate housing fuller recalls how entire neighborhoods were declared dilapidated in spite of the quality of some of the homes in them in order to secure federal funding for urban renewal and highway projects cities had to deem entire neighborhoods as being unfit for living it would appear based upon my other reading that it was intentionally targeting african american communities he said once the damage was done any good housing stock that remained in those neighborhoods became impossible to maintain homeowners would never see the return on their investment lovie moore s father purchased her family s home on rhodes avenue near the future site of the innerbelt in 1957 for 14 450 or 143 370 today sixty five years later the 2 269 square foot home is appraised at a mere 35 740 lovie moore takes a portrait in the home that has been owned by her family since she was a child she blames the depreciation of the home on the construction of the nearby akron innerbelt moore who is 73 and inherited the home with her siblings has lived on the street since she was a little girl if it was white people that lived there the value wouldn t be that low and they would have had more access to loans to renovate than we do it would be easier for them to get a loan to renovate their property and beautify the neighborhood than we do what s left of it moore said moore has worked hard to maintain her home her front lawn is perfectly manicured and the home was recently painted a bright white and green but the neighborhood looks different now there are few homeowners left and many people rent pockets of vacant land dot the landscape it s just nothing like it used to be you know with the tearing down with the innerbelt and all of that everything is missing she said a lot of those homes were good homes she added neighborhoods destroyed by urban renewal projects like the innerbelt were socioeconomically diverse and thriving avila said he pointed to examples in other parts of the country where thriving middle class neighborhoods and even wealthy black neighborhoods like the sugar hill neighborhood of los angeles which was cleared for the santa monica freeway were destroyed for highway construction the idea that highways destroyed slums is a gross generalization that calls into question who was defining what slums were in the mid 20th century it was an overwhelmingly white male planning profession he said segregated housing policies of the early 20th century had forced black families to live together regardless of income then urban renewal and highway projects destroyed this model of urban black community and fueled a kind of class segregation of african americans avila said malcolm costa ceo of community action akron summit stands in his office next to a photograph of the rev martin luther king jr speaking at the march on washington for jobs and freedom on aug 28 1963 costa s father used to own a barbershop on wooster avenue malcolm costa whose father used to own a barbershop on wooster avenue now vernon odom boulevard remembers black professionals skilled workers and low income families living together in his neighborhood doctors and attorneys because of the housing policies they lived in the same type of community as other blacks and i mean i know personally because our doctor lived two streets from where we lived you had the professionals as well as the skilled laborer plumbers electricians those types of households that were doing really well he said it was by no means dilapidated he said of the neighborhood costa now serves as ceo of community action akron summit a nonprofit group that provides support to akron s low income communities the organization was established in 1964 as the community action council as a response to the growing problem of urban poverty and housing insecurity that intensified during and after urban renewal many of the families displaced by the grant washington urban renewal project of the early 1960s ended up moving to west akron costa said unaware that they would be displaced again by opportunity park several years later eventually the innerbelt also came through west akron causing another round of displacement gordon keaton sits in his akron home he grew up on damon place with his mother and siblings before they were forced to move to make way for construction of the akron innerbelt in many cases people moved two or three times costa said from a child s perspective relocation happened suddenly seemingly without warning when gordon keaton and his family were displaced from their damon place rental when he was a teenager in the late 1960s he didn t understand all the changes happening around him adults focused on surviving and often didn t talk about these things where would his friends go keaton wondered and where would his family end up when they were forced to vacate their apartment his family did not own a car keaton worried whether he would be able to walk to his friends new homes and maintain the relationships that were so crucial to him losing my friends my relationships that i had developed there how do i grieve that nobody we didn t know anything about the grieving process or grieving itself the loss we re all being displaced the 72 year old recalled that was a tremendous loss for me he said equitable redevelopment for joey johnson the ill fated innerbelt destroyed akron s black cultural heritage erasing hope and identity if you don t have land i m not sure you can have an identity he said it s very difficult to develop an identity with no stable land foundation community those kinds of things and areas where develop those things white folks went in and burned them down because they recognized the power of what was going on he said drawing a connection between the ways officials used the law to destroy black neighborhoods through highway projects and other stains in america s history like the violent erasure of black business districts in tulsa and elsewhere johnson who chairs the mayor appointed racial equity and social justice task force urged city officials to keep an eye toward equity as they engage in conversations about how to redevelop the stretch of former highway north of exchange street as co chair of the task force s housing subcommittee one of johnson s chief concerns is the lack of safe and affordable housing in a city where 85 of the housing stock is over 100 years old in addition to increasing homeownership rates among the city s black residents the subcommittee recommends new affordable housing or rehabilitation near the innerbelt and in other socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods the people who are left down there they are at a dead end and we have to think about giving them opportunities help them build wealth he said diners gather around a 500 foot table on a stretch of the akron innerbelt during 500 plates a shared community meal on oct 4 2015 current residents and people whose families were displaced by the innerbelt told the beacon journal they want to see more investment in their neighborhoods from affordable housing and increased opportunities for homeownership to workforce development recreational and enrichment programs for children and support for small businesses they also pointed out that the area is a food desert with dollar stores and gas stations but few full service grocery stores past redevelopment proposals for the innerbelt have included a public space such as a park segedy said in 2015 the knight foundation awarded a 96 200 grant to san francisco based artist hunter franks to host a 500 person dinner on the site of the now vacated stretch of highway the city closed the road for one day to accommodate the event participants were encouraged to share how they would like to see the space redeveloped following the input of diners in 2017 franks organization the league of creative interventionists received another 214 420 knight grant to transform the space into a temporary urban forest visitors to the forest could enjoy concerts goat yoga and other programs despite the largely positive press these interventions received some of those closely involved hold a more skeptical view community organizer beth vild who worked on the 500 plates event expressed concern about the lack of meaningful sustained outreach to black communities that had been impacted by the highway among other issues it was just a tokenizing event to show that things could be happening on route 59 and that things should be reimagined and that we need a white savior from out of town to do it she said nevertheless vild is hopeful that liz ogbu a bay area based urban designer who is committed to engaging and transforming unjust urban environments could help steer the city in a better direction liz ogbu a san francisco bay area based urban designer who the city of akron has hired to lead the informal advisory committee tasked with discussing the future redevelopment of the innerbelt i hope it s a different age that we are walking into with her i want to have the best hopes for where that is going because we need it vild said including impacted communities in the redevelopment process is a priority for ogbu whom the city hired last spring to lead the informal advisory committee tasked with discussing the future redevelopment of the innerbelt launched by former deputy mayor james hardy the innerbelt advisory committee consists of 13 diverse community members including former displaced residents elected officials downtown business people artists and community advocates the project comes at an opportune time president joe biden s 1 2 trillion infrastructure plan signed last fall includes a 1 billion initiative aimed at reconnecting communities that have been divided by local highway projects akron can apply for a share of that money depending on what it decides to do with the land the city could apply for additional grants segedy said the city also is open to exploring philanthropic support at the core of ogbu s mission is to use urban design as a vehicle to positively transform and heal communities the way in which i work is often about what does a reparative process look like ogbu told the beacon journal it s really easy to do an envisioning process that is like what are all the cool things we can bring here what are the beautiful spaces that we can create a lot of times we re actually building on a foundation of broken promises and crushed dreams and when we build without a regard to also having an ability to hold space for that and acknowledge it and reckon with that then often times you don t engage people in the way that they need to be engaged and you create something that actually usually has a limited potential for success and also doesn t meet the needs of a lot of people she said the committee has dedicated some of its monthly meetings which have so far been closed to the media and the public to learning and sharing the history of the innerbelt and how it set back black residents for generations in march the city plans to launch a public engagement process to hear residents input on redevelopment details of what that public engagement process will look like remain unclear but ogbu and segedy said they anticipate a combination of in person and virtual meetings the city has launched a website www akroninnerbelt com where people can register with an email address to receive updates about the process exploring the possibilities what could equitable redevelopment of the innerbelt and its surrounding neighborhoods look like in january santa monica launched the right to return program which seeks to offer affordable housing to descendants of more than 100 black and latinx families who were displaced by the santa monica freeway in the 1960s in st paul minnesota home to the historically black community of rondo which was demolished in the 1950s and 1960s for interstate 94 residents and advocates teamed up with the state legislature and state department of transportation to devise a plan to reconnect the community while keeping the road intact the proposal is to build a community land bridge which would cap the freeway and allow for the construction of affordable housing and businesses on top of it ogbu said she is interested in implementing a community support program in akron similar to the 11th street bridge park in washington d c initiated in 2016 the 11th street bridge park will be an elevated park over the anacostia river to the east of the river are the predominantly black communities of wards 7 and 8 which have long experienced disinvestment vaughn perry director of equity at building bridges across the river at thearc the nonprofit that spearheaded the park project explained that when redevelopment projects come in residents often rightfully fear their neighborhoods will be gentrified and that they will be displaced to counteract this the 11th street bridge park with the input of the community and extensive collaborations with other nonprofits and the local government launched a series of programs to aid residents in workforce development job training homeownership and cultural preservation perry said his organization raised 75 million almost as much as the construction cost of the park itself to reinvest in wards 7 and 8 the homebuyers club is one of the support programs of the 11th street bridge park in washington d c that provides potential homebuyers with the knowledge and tools to invest in their community the 11th street bridge park launched a series of programs to aid residents in workforce development job training homeownership and cultural preservation the nonprofit collaborated with other area organizations to host tenant rights workshops and launched the ward 8 homebuyers program now in its fifth year the homebuyers program has seen almost 1 400 participants and enabled about 100 people to purchase homes in the neighborhood the nonprofit also established a community land trust as another avenue for affordable housing and wealth creation these are people who have come from generations of renters who are now being able to shift the potential for wealth in their family by being able to purchase a home perry said technical assistance loans and workshops also are available to small business owners many small businesses had to transition to e commerce because of the ongoing covid 19 pandemic perry said so his organization offers services like web support the nonprofit sees the construction of the bridge itself as an employment opportunity for ward 7 and 8 residents we wanted to make sure that when the bridge was being built it can be built by a majority of people that live in this community so we have been providing training for the last four years around construction training perry said additional workforce development programs geared toward the hospitality and retail industries will launch before the park breaks ground the national park service and the 11th street bridge park present the anacostia river festival on april 9 2017 at anacostia park in washington d c perry said the 11th street bridge park also has been working to preserve the traditions culture and voices of residents through the anacostia river festival which highlights local artists and its community leadership empowerment workshops though perry s organization is nonprofit he said that this model of equitable redevelopment can be replicated by any organization including local governments because it requires deep collaboration among residents elected officials and community organizations relationship building and involving residents in every step of the envisioning planning and execution process is key he said community engagement should eliminate as many barriers as possible whether that means going directly into neighborhoods to knock on doors and attend their community meetings or carefully timing town halls so that working families can attend them offering child care and food during meetings also can increase participation he said at the crux of this is relationship building perry said all of the strategies came from our community we re not going in and trying to give solutions but we believe that the solutions are always in the community we believe the community can identify their own problems and they also can identify their own solutions and so for us it s how do we bring additional resources to these solutions that the community says will help become more resilient a wall separates the akron innerbelt from what remains of douglas street whatever plan akron adopts it must take into account the unique challenges posed by the site itself including accessibility segedy said the highway is sunken and filling it would be cost prohibitive he said though he and other city officials did not offer a figure for how much filling the land would cost because the city owns the land the city has a lot of power to steer how the land is developed if they so choose said ben crowther program manager for the congress for the new urbanism s highways to boulevards and freeways without futures initiatives you can easily leverage that land s value to create reparative programs one that restitches and heals community wounds he added crowther encouraged meaningful public engagement efforts including transparency in the request for proposals stage of the process he also pushed back on akron s position that filling the sunken stretch of highway would be too expensive rochester recently filled a 0 6 mile sunken stretch at the eastern end of the inner loop highway erik frisch former manager of special projects at the city of rochester said filling 150 000 cubic yards of the highway cost about 3 million for a total of 24 25 million the city was able to develop six acres of that land into townhouse apartments retail green space and bike lanes federal funding covered the majority of the cost other than healing the physical scar of a highway it was not about healing the wounds of the neighborhood frisch said rochester s plans to redevelop the next section of the inner loop highway seeks to incorporate the input of the communities who had been displaced by the highway as well as those who still live in the highway s vicinity in akron ogbu said it will take years to undertake such an ambitious redevelopment project and encouraged people to remain patient she also emphasized the need for the city to build trust with residents those wounds are so deep that anytime you say you re going to do a big project people go back to that story the onus is on us to build that relationship of trust and to show that we are completely clear on what has happened before ogbu said segedy said that the lessons of the past will continue to guide the city s approach to redevelopment akron was doing what a lot of cities had done to put these urban freeways in with little or no consultation of the people whose homes and livelihoods were affected and so i think one goal here is to engage the public in efforts to try to reimagine what could happen there he said the rev greg harrison stands on douglas street where he grew up and attended an elementary school at the end of the street with his neighbors and friends the home his family rented was torn down to make way for the innerbelt those who were adults when the city took the homes and dreams they had worked hard to build are no longer alive but their surviving children who are seniors now continue to feel the economic and emotional shocks of dispossession one of them greg harrison is cautiously optimistic about the redevelopment of the akron innerbelt he believes the city has a moral obligation to build trust with and engage the families whose communities land and wealth were stolen by the highway s construction you can t repair all of the damage but you can repair some of it he said if you really want to do what s right talk to the children of the innerbelt and let s find a way to rebuild what you destroyed african american community this story was published with the support of a

in 1978 jim sutton surmised that rapid city south dakota would be an ideal home for a winter rodeo a big time event capable of attracting the best cowboys and cowgirls in the world and letting them strut their stuff before large enthusiastic crowds and while the rodeo rapid city formerly known as the black hills stock show has been of consistently high quality year after year as evidenced by four selections as the prca s large indoor rodeo of the year this year s 45th edition may be the very best of all an inaugural appearance at the spacious summit arena has added to the excitement as has provided the record crowds in each performance a cavalcade of top prca professional cowboys and cowgirls have delighted the large crowds winning efforts saturday two performances checked all of those boxes and for south dakota rodeo fans it added a little extra as eagle butte s shorty garrett fashioned an 85 5 point ride in the evening to share the win with iowa bronc rider riggin smith who turned in his winning ride in the saturday matinee i knew nothing about that horse i knew his name and his number garrett said of his ride aboard sutton rodeo s spark plug i ve been having some tough luck with the draws not lining up for a guy we were patient and just waited and i though heck it can t be any worse than what i ve been getting on and it wasn t it worked out great you go long enough and you ll get a good one and i did tonight riggin smith s effort earlier in the day was equally impressive the winterset iowa saddle bronc rider got to the front end quickly and settled into a comfortable spurring lick aboard burch rodeo s pip squeak i ve been on that horse before smith a past prca rookie of the year said i was actually the first guy to get on that horse in saddle bronc riding since he d been a bareback horse and man we got a long a lot better today than we did the last time that time was a 77 he was the same then i wasn t very good tim bingham an idaho bull rider working his way back into form after a series of injuries fed off that afternoon energy to grab the lead in his event with an 85 point trip his dance partner a new frontier rodeo bull spun left out of the chute quickly faded back to the right before straightening out at the end the shifty moves didn t phase the 30 year old 3 time nfr qualifier in fact it played right into his wheelhouse the bull wasn t really solid on a pattern but he kept the same style of bucking throughout which to me is more important bingham said he was really up and down and came off the ground on the front end and went every which way but he kept that same bucking style so it didn t really matter to me whether he was switching up or not since i could keep the same timing throughout the whole ride matinee rodeo fans witnessed another quality rough stock effort as caleb bennett 33 year old veteran with 9 trips to the nfr on his resume spurred sutton rodeo s wes texas to 86 points to move into second on the leaderboard after seeing his draw for rodeo rapid city bennett drove up from texas overnight for a hard ride on a horse with a lot of tricky moves i thought that s a really good draw so i better go try that bennett said he was kind of all over the place and had some sneaky moves and was getting in the air and that s icing on the cake when they are doing that it s a little bit of work but fun at the same time as long as you are doing your job the evening performance produced an even better bareback performance as 30 year old orin larson another veteran with a distinguished record seven nfr appearances exceeded bennett s score and nearly overtook event winner garrett shadbolt 89 with an 88 5 effort i ve been on that horse a number of times i was eighty eight on him last fall and the year before and won both rodeos larson said of his ride muddy creek rodeo s pejuta we have some pretty good chemistry and it was pretty awesome to have him again to get on a special horse like that at an awesome venue is pretty awesome the timed event end of summit arena also produced a rodeo winner on saturday night as ari anna flynn roland oklahoma executed the cloverleaf in a blazing 13 05 seconds to cop rodeo top money in barrel racing rodeo rapid city gave the saturday night sold out crowd a fitting finale to rodeo rapid city 2022 as a couple of young bull riders closed out the rodeo with matching 87 point rides to share top money jr stratford byers kansas followed up an arena record performance 93 5 to win last year s rodeo going back to back in bull riding with the luck of the draw and pens of rank bulls in the same venue is a seldom occurrence i really enjoy coming to this rodeo it s a great crowd and a great feeling here there s nothing like rapid city stratford said i had a really good bull from suttons that s been to the finals i ve been thinking about him all week and the adrenalin was pumping tonight and it finally came together and i got it done tristan o neal came into rapid city as a virtual unknow in bull riding circles his 87 point ride will change that i never seen the bull and i got online and looked at a few stats and thought he looked kind of average nothing too crazy o neal said but tonight he had a really good trip normally i don t like bulls that spin away from my hand but tonight it worked out and i stayed in it with him bucking and kicking the whole time this is hands down the biggest rodeo i ve ever won my dad michael o neal is from rapid city he was born and raised here so that makes it even more special
the prospect of a company losing more than a quarter of its share value overnight would be the stuff of nightmares for any board but meta the new corporate entity formerly widely known as facebook that owns the social media platform of that name along with instagram and the messaging app whatsapp did indeed lose more than 230 billion dh845 billion in one day indeed the individual personal worth of facebook founder mark zuckerberg took a 30 billion hit during the bloodbath on wall street part of a sell off that has hit a broad range of technology stocks since the start of january but the sell off of meta stock is not just negatively affected by the downward sentiment hitting the market as the us fed takes action to counter inflationary measures there is another far reaching factor at play when it comes to meta one that seems to suggest that many users and investors are reassessing the impact of the conglomerate s platforms and their effect on the way we communicate with each other and share news and opinions while traditional media companies that publish news are held to a very high legal threshold with strict regulatory oversight and severe punitive consequences for wilfully misleading debasing libeling or slandering persons or legal entities those same high standards simply do not apply when it comes to social media this lack of oversight and absence of legal remedy has meant that since their growth social media platforms have profited by the proliferation and promulgation of half truths half baked theories hate and error social media companies with their multinational structures use loopholes to shun their moral responsibilities spotify while not part of the metaverse has taken little action over anti vaccine misinformation being spread on some of its podcasts with artists such as neil young and joan baez being forced to take their music off the site as a result anti vax misinformation is still abound on social media putting lives at risk in political terms the alternative truth that suggests that the us presidential election was stolen is undermining american institutions and is being propagated in the unregulated field of social media
new york the end of easy money is upon us two years after the pandemic sent the global economy into a deep but short recession central bankers are withdrawing their emergency support and they re moving faster than they or most investors had foreseen the us federal reserve is preparing to raise interest rates in march and last friday s jobs report fueled speculation it may need to move aggressively the bank of england just delivered back to back hikes and some of its officials wanted to act even more forcefully the bank of canada is set for liftoff next month even the european central bank may get in on the action later this year rates are rising because policy makers judge that the global inflation shock now poses a bigger threat than further damage to growth from covid 19 some say it took them far too long to reach that conclusion others worry that the hawkish turn could slow recoveries without offering much relief from high prices given that some of the surge is related to supply problems beyond the reach of monetary policy there are a couple of outliers among the biggest economies the people s bank of china appears headed in the opposite direction it s likely to make credit cheaper as new virus outbreaks and a property slump cloud prospects for the world s second largest economy and the bank of japan is expected to keep policy unchanged this year though traders are starting to wonder if it can hold the line in the emerging markets many central banks started raising rates last year and they re not done yet just last week brazil delivered a third consecutive 150 point hike while the czech republic lifted its benchmark to the highest in the european union mexico and peru are expected to extend tightening campaigns this week though some think the latin american cycle may be peaking economists at jpmorgan chase co estimate that by april rates will have gone up in countries that together produce about half of the world s gross domestic product versus 5 per cent now they expect a global average interest rate of about 2 per cent at the end of this year roughly the pre pandemic level biggest tightening since 1990s all of this suggests the biggest tightening of monetary policy since the 1990s and the shift isn t confined to rates central banks are also dialing back the bond buying programs they ve used to restrain long term borrowing costs bloomberg economics calculates the combined balance sheet of the group of seven nations will peak by mid year the tables have turned bank of america corp economist aditya bhave wrote in a report on friday the surge in global inflation has pulled forward central bank hiking cycles and balance sheet shrinkage across the board in the process the pivot may end up having ended a pandemic boom in financial markets that was amplified by loose money the msci world index of stocks is down about 5 per cent this year bonds have plunged all over the world sending yields higher what has forced the central bank rethink is a wave of inflation it s driven by a disconnect between surging demand in post lockdown economies and shortages in the supply of some key commodities materials and goods as well as workers this week the us is expected to report a 7 3 per cent inflation rate for january the highest since the early 1980s euro area inflation just hit a record as recently as a few months ago most officials didn t anticipate the situation they re now in they spent much of 2021 arguing that price pressures would prove transitory they welcomed the rapid rebound in employment and dismissed the inflation alarms that some commentators were already sounding now policy makers have decided that inflation has staying power and that tolerating it risks setting off an upward spiral of prices and wages which could prove impossible to halt without provoking a recession targeting soft landing by acting now to cool things off a bit they hope to deliver a fabled soft landing instead of a crash there are risks in both directions inflation will likely continue to be fanned by declining unemployment and renewed demand for services as economies prove resilient to the omicron variant according to jpmorgan economists led by bruce kasman it is hard for us to accept a juxtaposition of sustained low inflation with limited central bank action they also said in a report some big name economists and investors warn that central banks are still behind the curve and not fully grasping the scale of measures they ll have to take but rapid hikes now could be counterproductive if inflation does start fading as supply chains heal and commodity markets cool that could leave policy settings suddenly looking too tight something that happened to the ecb a decade ago and if inflation does stick around it might not be the kind that can be managed with monetary policy strategists at blackrock inc argue that prices are rising faster because of supply problems and central bankers should learn to live with that bloomberg economics calculates that if the boe did want to bring inflation down to its 2 target this year it would have to raise rates by enough to throw 1 2 million people out of work for now the only way is up for global rates but beyond that the details are cloudy forecasts diverge widely on how many fed hikes are coming this year while barclays plc reckons just on three increases for example bank of america expects seven also unclear is how big the moves will be when they ll be executed and where the benchmark rate will eventually end up
six months in the saddle as the chief executive officer of airtel africa segun ogunsanya is using his extraordinary leadership skills to make the organisation not only the largest but the most profitable and reliable mobile telecommunications network in the continent writes ugo aliogo the last week has witnessed an outbreak of good news for the telecommunications company with indian

was listed on the exchange in 2019 would be joining the exclusive list of the largest companies by market capitalisation on january 31 2022 ftse 100 airtel africa thus became the largest african

while this was on news came from the global headquarters in new delhi that the tech behemoth google would invest 1b in the bharti airtel the parent company for a 1 28 stake what an extremely proud moment this would be for the investors founders management and employees of the company perhaps what is most remarkable about these good tidings is that they are coming amid an extremely rough business year due to the covid 19 pandemic airtel africa is succeeding despite the coronavirus induced global economic meltdown credit should go to the management and staff of the company led by nigerian born and bred obafemi awolowo university trained electrical electronics engineer turned chartered accountant segun ogunsanya ogunsanya was last year appointed to replace mr raghunath mandava as ceo for airtel africa after nine years as the managing director and chief executive officer of airtel nigeria having run the business for only about six months it could safely be said that ogunsanya does have the midas touch and everything he touches turns to gold this is no surprise to industry watchers because he performed a similar feat in airtel nigeria which became pat profit after tax positive only one year after he joined the company from the coca cola hellenic s bottling company nigeria segun is a veteran having been a ceo for 23 years he turned 55 last july an engineer and chartered accountant as earlier promised he has over 30 years cognate experience firmly under his belt garnered across multiple geographies organizations and diverse sectors such as telecoms

making aside from supervising the divestment of the government of ghana from the business apart from manufacturing and banking mr ogunsanya has consulting experience having worked with arthur anderson

to recording firsts he is also the first black african chief executive officer of coca cola bottling of ghana first black african chief executive officer of coca cola sabco s bottling operations in kenya and first african chief executive officer of coca cola hellenic s bottling operations in nigeria in 2012 he was appointed a member of the implementation and technical committee of strategic

him dr segun ogunsanya if his track record is anything to go by ogunsanya with his extraordinary leadership skills and his revolutionary management team is well positioned to make airtel africa the largest most profitable and most reliable mobile telecommunications network in the continent airtel africa s publicly avowed commitment to expanding financial inclusion sustainably bridging the digital divide meeting the evolving needs of customers and supporting host communities seems strong enough pillars to make the above dream a reality with the recent approval of mobile money and super agent licenses for airtel in nigeria the coast is clear for greater earnings and the reality will be sooner rather than later little wonder upon the news of his elevation president muhammadu buhari congratulated him saying the flag of nigeria has been hoisted proudly across the african skyline once again buhari added that the appointment has once again proven that nigeria has a surfeit of quality professionals who can hold their own in any part of the continent and even beyond president buhari said with the cognate experience of the new md ceo for africa which spans consulting banking fast moving consumer goods and telecommunications he would acquit himself creditably in his new role and repeat the strides that made him position airtel nigeria as the second largest telecommunications company by revenue serving over 50 million customers he urged younger nigerians to draw inspiration from ogunsanya saying with focus dint of hard work and resourcefulness they would reach the peak of whatever careers they have chosen for themselves the reward for hard work is more work says president buhari as he wished ogunsanya greater successes ahead
i swore this would never happen to me is what a young friend prefaced to me before she announced that she was buying a house in montville i ve had similar conversations like this i ll ask would you ever move back to montville an instantaneous look of are you kidding me smacks onto their faces as they tell me they could never do it they won t ever do it young people have a problem with montville and montville has a problem without young people in montville the population aged between 25 and 34 has been declining according to our 2021 town plan between the years 1990 and 2010 this age group declined by 47 during that same period the number of people aged 75 84 more than doubled while the number of people aged 85 and above nearly quadrupled meanwhile montville s school population has declined significantly a trend that continues today these demographic shifts should be troubling montville should be welcoming to people of all ages including the elderly but it should make a more concerted effort to attract young people young adults bring economic opportunity local businesses and their children s school enrollment numbers if we don t seek to attract this population we ultimately limit the town s prosperity so what s turning young people off it s the lack of a town center my friends tell me or the fact that we don t have a walkable shopping district we ll talk about the littering of route 32 with multiple versions of the same unhealthy fast food chains but the point that we always come back to is the lack of affordable housing the state department of housing reports that only 5 48 of montville s housing stock is affordable without affordable housing young people will never be able to afford to live in montville last week the planning and zoning commission had a chance to address these concerns at that meeting the commission addressed a provision in public act 21 29 a new law requiring towns to advance equity in their zoning laws and permit accessory dwelling units the bill was put forth by desegregatect a coalition advocating for more equitable affordable and sustainable land use policies in connecticut one of the things the state law did was legalize accessory dwelling units or adus adus are independent living spaces within or detached from single family homes adus are significantly relevant to montville because the vast majority of occupied housing stock is comprised of single family housing and 81 of all housing is owner occupied adus can help homeowners increase their real estate value at the same time they can broaden the town s tax base while providing more housing opportunities in space already occupied instead of embracing the spirit and purpose of the law the commission voted to opt out of the law promoting accessory dwelling units at the same time town planner liz burdick accused a young pro homes advocate of trolling the commission a comment she has since walked back i reached out to town planner burdick about the decision and she relayed to me the decision was made due to a recommendation from the town attorney who found the provision too vague that reasoning seemed strange since montville s adu law is nearly identical to the state law according to the connecticut zoning atlas she also told me that her office is working diligently to advance the cause of affordable housing a fact that is evident by montville s adoption of policies designed to increase the supply of affordable and workforce housing but i was really disappointed in the disdain towards the advocate and the fact that the commission took their vote without having a single member of the public speak if montville seeks to attain a younger population it needs to continue its focus on zoning reform and attracting an array of developers to the area that will build homes and developments that young people want to live in and around it should increase its public outreach and projects devoted towards attracting young people like creating more walkable spaces or providing incentives to local business owners instead of permitting corporations from cluttering route 32 i d also like to see an increase in transparency by communicating through social media the development and decisions montville has been making we shouldn t have to hear about important decisions affecting the future of the town after the fact however the onus is not all on the town younger people who seek to live here must take on a stronger role in advocating for their future as it relates to affordable housing and creating a desirable living community an abysmal 28 22 of registered voters in montville voted in last year s municipal election and i bet only a few of them were under age 50 if young people do not vocalize their opinions and get more politically involved montville will remain stagnant we have to be louder than those who don t care that they re driving us away becca carroll is a 25 year old resident of montville

russian president vladimir putin attends a ceremony to present the highest state awards in the kremlin in moscow russia wednesday feb 2 2022 at the core of the ukraine crisis is a puzzle why would putin push europe to the brink of war to demand the west not do something that it has no plan to do anyway russia says nato the american led alliance that has on its hands the biggest european crisis in decades must never offer membership to ukraine which gained independence as the soviet union broke apart about 30 years ago sergei karpukhin sputnik kremlin pool photo via ap u s president joe biden says planned sanctions if russia invades ukraine would have a devastating impact on its economy but after the kremlin spent the last eight years preparing for more penalties economists say the pain may not be as bad as some fear the measures under consideration which include limits on big banks ability to use dollars and euros as well as restrictions on government debt and access to u s technology would be the most severe since the first wave of limits slapped on russia in 2014 following the annexation of crimea according to u s and european officials back then russia spiraled into a financial crisis the ruble lost half its value as the central bank saw its reserves plunge by 130 billion and the economy swung into a recession this time around economists say the moves under discussion by the u s and its allies would hit the currency fuel inflation and send investors fleeing but might not be enough to trigger the same kind of turmoil in addition to kremlin preparations a big difference is that prices for oil russia s main export are rising now not plunging as they did in 2014 russia is much better prepared for sanctions than it was in 2014 at least on its macro indicators said natalia lavrova chief economist at bcs financial group in moscow the state sector is ready and the financial cushion is big she said in all but the most extreme of scenarios the economy would continue growing though at a slower rate and with higher inflation she said russian officials say they have no plan to invade but moscow has rejected western demands that it reverse a buildup of more than 130 000 troops on the border with ukraine with president vladimir putin expressing hope this week of a diplomatic solution investors have started cautiously moving back into russian assets publicly the kremlin says it s concerned about the risk of sanctions and has taken steps to limit their possible impact putin has repeatedly vowed that the threat of new restrictions won t change his foreign policy for the moment the kremlin seems confident that limits hitting russia s energy sector or other key exports would be too disruptive to global markets to be a realistic threat still western officials say the risk of sanctions remains just what the response would look like if russia moved on ukraine in a less dramatic way than an all out invasion isn t clear at 634 billion central bank reserves are close to a record thanks to policies that saved much of the oil windfall in a rainy day fund the budget ran a surplus of 0 4 of gdp last year and government debt at 18 of gdp is among the lowest of major economies moscow has reduced dependence on the dollar for trade and transactions and is building up its own alternatives to u s dominated payment systems thanks in part to those defenses economists say that the likely sanctions would knock the ruble as much as 20 lower against the dollar fuel already high inflation and thus require more interest rate increases by the bank of russia as well as possibly intervention to support financial markets and sanctioned banks assuming there isn t an outright ban on exports an increase in sanctions pressure will have an indirect effect on the economy since significant financial restrictions have been in place since 2014 said sova capital economist artem zaigrin that could shave a bit more off annual growth than the roughly 0 2 percentage points he estimates the 2014 sanctions did in a mild scenario with sanctions hitting just kremlin insiders and some state entities the ruble would drop about 6 inflation would tick up slightly and the economy would grow 2 4 this year down 0 2 percentage points from the baseline forecast according to bcs s lavrova broader limits would hit the ruble harder and cut growth to 1 4 she said only in her most extreme scenario which would include strict limits on debt and banks as well as exclusion of russia from the swift financial communications system would the economy swing to recession this year she said short of that imposing the strictest sanctions on all 12 of russia s biggest commercial banks could cause a repeat of the 2014 crisis with more difficult and long term consequences according to rosbank economist evgeny koshelev over time the limits on access to finance and technology would further hobble russia s already depressed growth prospects according to economists the medium to long term impact that will be driving russia into financial and economic autarky and the cost for the economy and for each individual is enormous said elina ribakova deputy chief economist at the international institute of finance in washington potential growth will be much lower without interaction with the world here are some of the major types of sanctions under consideration and their likely impact government debt the mildest version would ban investors from buying bonds in the secondary market the u s imposed primary market restrictions in 2021 while more drastic ones could require them to dump existing holdings as well while the moves would shake markets they wouldn t be too much of a burden to russia s finances since the government runs a budget surplus and doesn t rely on borrowing to pay its bills dmitry dolgin of ing eurasia said a ban on new purchases would cost russia as much as 10 billion in capital inflows a year and push the ruble down by a few percentage points a forced sale of existing bonds as well would likely require the central bank to step in to steady markets as the ruble dropped more steeply longer term russia s budget could come under more stress if it had to sustain a prolonged military operation or substantially increase financial support for ukraine in the event it engineered a takeover in kyiv by a pro moscow government banks financial sector hitting state owned and other big banks with limits on their ability to use correspondent accounts in u s institutions would cut them off from the dollar system said ivan timofeyev a sanctions specialist at the russian international affairs council that s a more serious threat in terms of possible harm than debt putting individual institutions on the most restrictive sdn list would be even more painful he said noting that non u s banks might also follow suit and freeze the affected entities out entirely russia has developed alternatives to the dollar based financial system including its own network for handling transaction information along the lines of swift and direct links with banks in places like china but it still relies on the dollar for 55 of its exports and the euro for another 29 according to the central bank technology russia already faces limits on access to much u s technology that could be of use to the military wider limits on the consumer sphere could force russians to shift to chinese and other phones banning chips and sensitive technology would thrill some people in power said karen kazaryan general director of the internet research institute such a move would force russia to speed up import substitution programs and mean more state money for noncompetitive industries bloomberg s ilya arkhipov

paris afp in the extravagant world of the french luxury industry brands used to prefer destroying their unsold goods rather than offering their high priced products at a discount advertising read more but gone are the days of binning the coats handbags and shoes pooh poohed by shoppers after a new anti waste law came into force at the start of the year now luxury houses are managing their stocks more carefully offering deals to staff making donations and recycling goods it s a subject that has become important today said julie el ghouzzi a luxury goods expert at the cultz consulting agency she pointed to the scandal that engulfed burberry in 2018 after the british luxury brand disclosed that it had destroyed 28 million pounds 38 million 34 million euros at current exchange rates of unsold goods in 2017 the equivalent of 20 000 of its trench coats following the firestorm the revelation triggered burberry announced it would halt the practice from the following year markdowns to move goods are not an option in the luxury business as lower prices can undermine the attractiveness of their labels which thrive on their elite status in the luxury sector if the price tag is lower so is the desire to buy it said el ghouzzi mentalities have changed luxury houses are paying more attention to the subject now said arnaud cadart a portfolio manager at paris based asset manager flornoy mentalities have changed we re no longer in an economy that values unbridled creation above all else he said also gone is the mentality that if it doesn t work we ll destroy it said cadart now luxury houses strive to fine tune their stocks the kering group which owns the gucci saint laurent and balenciaga labels among others has invested in artificial intelligence in order to better manage its stock associations like fabscrap in new york help the fashion industry recycle unused materials as some countries like france adopt anti waste laws that prohibit destroying and throwing out unsold goods don emmert afp file at its competitor lvmh the world s largest luxury group that includes louis vuitton dior and celine among many others environmental development director helene valade said the luxury business model is closely adjusted to demand with low levels of stock being held by the firms nevertheless she acknowledged that the new law will push luxury houses to learn even more about their clients to better anticipate their purchases and thus reduce stocks to a minimum el ghouzzi said louis vuitton is already quite good at keeping track of its stock they know exactly what they have in stock and are capable of managing it down to the millimeter she said adding that s not the case in many other houses when there are nevertheless unsold goods selling them to staff at advantageous prices is one option these large fashion groups have large staffs with more than 150 000 employees at lvmh 38 000 at kering and 16 600 at hermes gifts to associations is another option lvmh has a partnership with cravate solidaire an association that collects donations of professional clothing and provides it to people with disadvantaged backgrounds trying to land jobs upcycling designers have also begun to make use of discarded or leftover materials a practice often called upcycling previously a designer with a brilliant idea would go search for materials to realise their idea lvmh s valade told afp today the process is sometimes the reverse there are certain designers who start with the materials at hand old collections unused fabric hanging about leftover bits of leather and it inspires them she said this was the case for late american designer virgil abloh who was the artistic director of louis vuitton s menswear collection from 2018 until his death in 2021 marc jacobs in new york works with fabscrap which recycles unused fabric to create insulation or products like furniture lining or donates it to students and artists to use for their creations lvmh also has a partnership with weturn which collects unsold clothing and material to recycle it into new thread and fabric hermes said that in 2020 it sold 39 000 upcycled products the activities which destroy the most are fashion leather goods and cosmetics said portfolio manager cadart given the efforts undertaken and the current economic conditions items are more often out of stock than lying about unsold since 2014 hermes has thrown out almost nothing everything flies off the shelves cadart added at lvmh valade said leather goods are at the moment in more of a situation of being out of stock than not being sold she pointed to an upcycled loewe bag made from scrap leather cuttings that sells for 1 700 euros and which is currently out of stock 2022 afp
all questions introduction for many years the netherlands has been considered the gateway to europe for non european companies and investors the certainty provided by advance tax rulings atrs and advance pricing agreements apas the country s extensive participation exemption regime the excellent dutch network of tax treaties and bilateral investment treaties flexible corporate law and the country s business friendly infrastructure are all key elements in this respect common forms of business organisation and their tax treatment i corporate dutch holding companies are generally organised as limited liability companies or as cooperatives limited liability companies limited liability companies come in two forms private limited liability companies bvs and public limited liability companies nvs both types of companies have legal personality and capital that is divided into shares as the nv and bv both have limited liability their shareholders are not liable for the company s debts while nvs are typically used for companies going public i e listed on a stock exchange bvs are generally used for smaller businesses or as a holding or finance vehicle nvs and bvs in principle pay dutch corporate income tax cit on their worldwide profits with a branch exemption and participation exemption regime to eliminate international double taxation both types of companies are considered to be dutch tax residents by virtue of being incorporated under dutch law dividend distributions by nvs and bvs are subject to dutch dividend withholding tax with reductions and exemptions pursuant to domestic law and the application of a tax treaty cooperatives the dutch cooperative is a special form of association by and large the general dutch cit rules governing associations also apply to cooperatives however in addition to these general rules certain specific rules apply to cooperatives only like all associations under dutch law a cooperative must have a board of directors and members and if the articles of association allow a supervisory board moreover the cooperative regime is quite flexible no minimum capital requirements apply only two members at least are required and dividends may be distributed freely in accordance with dutch law a cooperative s objective as formalised in its articles of association must state that it provides for specific material needs of its members pursuant to agreements that are not insurance contracts and that have been concluded with those members as part of the cooperative s business or causes that benefit the members cooperatives of which the main 70 per cent activities consist of holding participations or intercompany financing are in principle subject to dutch dividend withholding tax ii non corporate pursuant to dutch law partnerships are formed by means of a partnership agreement that governs the long term cooperation between two or more partners a partnership is not a separate legal entity however dutch partnerships can sue and be sued and can enter into contracts in their own name dutch partnerships come in the form of a general partnership vof a limited partnership cv or a professional partnership the most important differences between these forms are expressed in how they interact with third parties including representation liability and the right of recourse whereas general and limited partnerships are considered to be subcategories of professional partnerships the statutory provisions for a professional partnership essentially apply by analogy to general and limited partnerships an important consideration is that the liability of general partners in a vof and general partners in a cv is unlimited while the liability of limited partners in a cv is limited to the amount of their respective capital contributions dutch domestic tax rules distinguish between closed and open cvs an open cv is regarded as non transparent opaque for the limited partner interest and is therefore partly a taxpayer for dutch tax purposes conversely closed partnerships are transparent a look through approach applies to these closed cvs meaning that only the partners in the cv may be subject to tax the consent requirement is a crucial factor in determining whether a cv is regarded as an open or closed partnership a cv qualifies as open if limited partners can join and exit the partnership except by bequest or inheritance without unanimous consent from all other partners i e both general and limited partners the dutch government is currently considering changing the dutch domestic tax rules that distinguish between closed and open cvs by abolishing the open cv this would at the earliest happen as of 1 january 2023 direct taxation of businesses i tax on profits dutch cit is levied on dutch and non dutch tax residents dutch tax residents are in principle subject to dutch cit on their worldwide income non residents are subject to cit only insofar as they enjoy dutch source income which falls into two categories taxable profits derived from a business that is conducted through a permanent establishment pe or a permanent representative in the netherlands see section iv ii or taxable income derived from a substantial interest in a company that is a resident of the netherlands provided that the main purpose or one of the main purposes for holding the interest is to avoid dutch personal income tax in the hands of another person subjective test and an arrangement or a series of arrangements is in place that is not genuine objective test for the purposes of condition b an arrangement or a series of arrangements is considered not genuine if and to the extent that it is not based on valid commercial reasons that reflect the economic reality whether an arrangement has been put into place for valid commercial reasons may depend on the substance at shareholder level valid commercial reasons may be present if inter alia the shareholder conducts a material business enterprise and the shareholding is part of the business enterprise s assets the shareholder is a top holding company that performs material management policy and financial functions for the group or the shareholder functions as an intermediate holding company within the group structure under the substance rules as amended as of 1 january 2020 if an intermediate holding company satisfies the dutch minimum substance requirements the wage sum criterion generally a wage sum of 100 000 and the office space criterion office space for at least 24 months the burden of proof with respect to purpose for holding the interest and the absence of valid commercial reasons that reflect the economic reality shifts to the tax inspector if the aforementioned substance requirements are not met the taxpayer has to prove that the interest is not held with the main purpose or one of the main purposes to avoid dutch personal income tax in the hands of another person or that the structure is based on valid commercial reasons that reflect the economic reality determination of taxable profit dutch cit is levied on a taxpayer s taxable profit being the net income earned and capital gains less deductible losses as determined annually in accordance with the principles of sound business practice under this general principle which has been widely developed under dutch case law profits and losses are attributed to the years based on principles of realisation matching reality prudence and simplicity in principle all business expenses may be deducted from the taxable profit including interest on loans subject to interest deduction limitation rules and annual amortisation and depreciation on assets used for the taxpayer s business losses in general tax losses can be carried back to be offset against the previous year s taxable profits and can be carried forward for six years for losses made in fiscal years starting on or after 1 january 2019 loss carry backs and carry forwards are applied in the order in which the losses arose meaning that a loss will first be offset against the previous year s profits and then against future profits these rules will change in 2022 with the carry forward period being extended from six years to indefinite but the amount of loss that can be set off against taxable profits decreased to 50 per cent of the taxable profits in excess of 1 million the first 1 million of taxable profits can be fully set off with losses special rules for loss relief may apply to the trade in loss making companies a company s losses may not be offset against future profits if 30 per cent or more of the ultimate interest in that company changes among the ultimate beneficial owners or is transferred to a new shareholder this rule offers a number of exceptions however the going concern exception for example in view of the dutch participation exemption regime see section v i taxpayers may not deduct losses on the disposal of a qualifying participation from their taxable profit in addition a write off of the cost price of a participation is not deductible however liquidation losses whether foreign or domestic may be deducted from the taxable profits provided that certain requirements are met the liquidation loss amount is determined on the basis of the difference between the liquidation proceeds and the cost price of the participation as of 2021 the liquidation and discontinuation loss regimes have a more limited scope i e certain geographical substantive and temporal restrictions rates the standard cit rate is 25 per cent expected to become 25 8 per cent in 2022 the first 245 000 of annual taxable profit is taxed at a step up rate of 15 per cent the threshold for the lower bracket cit rate will be increased to 395 000 in 2022 administration taxpayers must file annual cit returns with the dutch tax authorities within five months of the end of their financial year it is possible to apply for an extension of this filing deadline dutch taxpayers are allowed to file their returns in a functional currency i e a foreign currency other than the euro if their annual reports are drawn up in the same foreign currency as such a dutch taxpayer can ensure that fluctuations between the euro and the functional currency do not lead to taxable profits e g foreign exchange results on outstanding debt or receivables tax grouping the dutch consolidation regime fiscal unity offers the possibility for taxpayers to opt for treatment as a single taxable entity for dutch cit purposes a dutch resident parent company and its dutch resident subsidiaries may form a fiscal unity if certain requirements are satisfied the most important being that the parent company directly or indirectly through other fiscal unity members must hold at least 95 per cent of the legal and economic title to the shares issued by the subsidiaries as a result the assets and liabilities of the entities included in the fiscal unity are consolidated meaning that intercompany transactions are eliminated and that the business income of the fiscal unity members is balanced for cit calculation purposes although each member of the fiscal unity remains jointly and individually liable for the cit due by the entire fiscal unity the cit assessments are only imposed on the parent company a fiscal unity for dutch cit purposes is optional i e it is not formed by operation of law and therefore requires a prior request to that effect following the judgment of the court of justice of the european union cjeu in x bv of 25 october 2017 in which the cjeu declared that the dutch fiscal unity regime partially breaches the freedom of establishment emergency reparatory legislation to bring the fiscal unity regime in line with the eu freedom of establishment was adopted the emergency reparatory legislation proposal has retroactive effect up to 1 january 2018 the legislation decreases the scope of the consolidation of the dutch fiscal unity regime for a number of dutch cit rules that affect non dutch resident companies which could not be included in the dutch fiscal unity because of not being a dutch tax resident where these rules would not affect dutch resident companies that are a part of a dutch fiscal unity given the foregoing the dutch fiscal unity regime is currently under review and may be replaced by a group relief or group contribution regime the dutch government is currently still reviewing the options with respect to the future of the dutch fiscal unity regime ii other relevant taxesvalue added tax value added tax vat is charged on supplies of goods and services in the netherlands and is based on the various eu vat directives the standard vat rate is 21 per cent a reduced rate of 9 per cent is charged on designated supplies while a zero per cent rate applies to supplies related to international trade in addition various vat exemptions exist in the netherlands pursuant to which no vat is charged although it is important to bear in mind that in some cases the corresponding input vat cannot be deducted the dutch vat act provides for a deferment system for vat under which taxpayers must declare import vat in their periodic tax returns but simultaneously deduct it meaning that on balance no vat is actually paid excise and import duties excise duties being a consumption tax are levied on alcoholic products tobacco and mineral oil products import or customs duties are levied on various products that are imported into the netherlands from outside the european union the netherlands does not impose export duties real estate transfer tax the acquisition of the legal or economic ownership of real estate or rights relating thereto located in the netherlands is subject to real estate transfer tax rett at a rate of 8 per cent various exemptions may apply in situations involving mergers or reorganisations moreover the acquisition of shares in a real estate company being a company where real estate assets make up more than 50 per cent of the assets of which at least 30 per cent consists of real estate located in the netherlands is also subject to dutch rett wage tax and social security contributions in principle individuals in employment are subject to wage tax which the employer withholds from their wages and remits to the tax authorities this applies not only to wage tax on salary payments but also to social security contributions dutch wage tax is considered to be an advance levy meaning that individuals may credit it against their dutch personal income tax due highly skilled expatriates may claim a special tax facility known as the 30 per cent ruling the 30 per cent ruling is a tax free reimbursement of 30 per cent of an employee s gross salary which may be applied if the employee has been recruited or assigned from abroad and has specific expertise that is difficult to find in the dutch labour market other the netherlands does not levy any stamp or capital duties tax residence and fiscal domicile i corporate residence pursuant to dutch tax law the place of residence of a corporate entity is determined on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances in particular taking into account the place of effective management however the corporate income tax act 1969 cita provides an important exception to this principle by applying the incorporation fiction pursuant to this fiction entities such as nvs and bvs are deemed to be tax residents of the netherlands by virtue of being incorporated under dutch law accordingly an entity incorporated under dutch law is in principle fully liable to dutch cit regardless of its taxable place of residency except limited by a bilateral tax treaty ii branch or permanent establishment taxable profits from a business that is conducted through a pe or a permanent representative referred to as a dutch business in the netherlands are in principle subject to dutch cit as of 1 january 2020 dutch domestic law refers to the relevant tax treaty for the definition of a pe the cita explicitly states that a dutch business is deemed to include income and gains derived from real estate located in the netherlands including direct and indirect rights in dutch real estate and rights to explore and commercially operate dutch natural resources profit sharing rights in or entitlements to the net value of a business that is effectively managed in the netherlands except insofar as those rights or entitlements are not derived from securities receivables on companies that are residents of the netherlands provided that the lender holds a substantial interest in the company concerned and activities performed by a member of the management or supervisory board of an entity that is a resident of the netherlands even if the authority is restricted to those parts of the business that are located outside the netherlands in determining the profits attributable to a pe the netherlands follows the authorised organisation for economic co operation and development oecd approach which was largely incorporated into the dutch pe profit allocation decree of 2011 tax incentives special regimes and relief that may encourage inward investment i holding company regimesparticipation exemption regime under the dutch participation exemption regime all benefits i e dividends and capital gains derived by a dutch company from a qualifying participation in another entity are exempt from dutch cit the dutch participation exemption generally applies if the following conditions are both met the dutch company holds 5 per cent or more of the nominal paid up share capital of a company which is divided into shares the 5 per cent ownership condition and the entity in which the dutch company participates is not held as a portfolio investment the motive test or non portfolio investment condition the non portfolio investment condition means that the participation exemption does not extend to subsidiaries that are held as portfolio investments the motive test a subsidiary is considered to be held as a portfolio investment if the dutch resident shareholder company s only object is to obtain returns that may be expected from normal active asset management if the taxpayer has a mixed motive the predominant motive is decisive according to parliamentary proceedings a subsidiary that is engaged in a business and that is owned by an intermediate dutch holding company linking the subsidiary s activities and those of the larger group is not considered to be a portfolio investment however the motive test is deemed not to be met if more than 50 per cent of the subsidiary s consolidated assets consist of a shareholding or shareholdings of less than 5 per cent or the subsidiary s predominant function together with the functions of its lower tier subsidiaries is to act as a passive group finance licensing or leasing company ii ip regimes

lower cit rate of 9 per cent instead of 25 per cent to the extent that the r d profits exceed a threshold equal to the sum of the costs incurred to develop the ip since 1 january 2017 the dutch innovation box regime is aligned with the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting beps action 5 countering harmful tax practices more effectively taking into account transparency and substance pursuant to action 5 states are required to modify their ip regimes in terms of accessibility and their economic substance consequently the netherlands incorporated the modified nexus approach into the cita pursuant to which only intangible assets developed by the taxpayer itself will qualify for the application of the amended innovation box regime a nexus formula will determine what portion of the r d income will qualify for the innovation box regime in addition the netherlands offers an r d wage tax credit which in fact functions as an entry ticket to the innovation box regime iii state aid following the publication of the non confidential version of the decision in the starbucks case on 27 june 2016 by the european commission in which it held that an apa between the state and starbucks manufacturing bv smbv constituted illegal state aid the general court ruled that the netherlands has not granted fiscal state aid to starbucks on 24 september 2019 the general court ruled that the european commission has not been able to establish that the apa concluded between the state and smbv conferred an advantage to smbv if the european commission appeals the general court decision the decision may be overturned by the cjeu on 18 december 2017 the european commission announced it had opened an in depth investigation into the netherlands tax treatment of inter ikea the case revolves around two apas concluded between inter ikea systems and the dutch tax authorities withholding and taxation of non local source income streams i withholding on outward bound payments domestic law dividend withholding tax is levied at a rate of 15 per cent from those persons whether resident or non resident who are entitled either directly or through depositary receipts to proceeds from shares or profit sharing certificates in a dutch resident entity the actual amount of dividend withholding tax due is calculated on the basis of the proceeds of such shares or profit sharing certificates cooperatives are subject to dividend withholding tax if they can be classified as a holding cooperative this is the case in all situations where the activities of the cooperative consist in short subject to all relevant facts and circumstances of more than 70 per cent of holding and finance activities only less than 5 per cent membership rights continue to benefit from an unconditional exemption from dividend withholding tax the netherlands does not impose any withholding tax on outgoing interest or royalty payments except for interest on certain hybrid loans as of 1 january 2021 the netherlands imposes a conditional withholding tax on interest and royalty payments the withholding tax only applies to interest and royalty payments made to low tax jurisdictions the dutch list of low tax jurisdictions is published in december of the year preceding the year of application of the list the list for 2021 contains the following jurisdictions american samoa american virgin islands anguilla bahamas bahrain barbados bermuda british virgin islands cayman islands fiji guam guernsey isle of man jersey oman palau panama samoa seychelles trinidad and tobago turkmenistan turks and caicos islands united arab emirates and vanuatu the list for 2022 is yet to be published ii domestic law exclusions or exemptions from withholding on outward bound payments dutch tax law provides for various statutory exemptions from dividend withholding tax on dividend distributions such as the dutch participation exemption regime see section v i and the fiscal unity regime see section iii i generally dutch dividend withholding tax is an advance levy that may be credited against the dutch cit due to the level of the shareholder in addition several special tax regimes are adopted into the dutch dividend withholding tax act pursuant to which no owing to an exemption or less owing to a refund or reduction dutch dividend withholding tax is levied for example an exemption may apply if the beneficiary of the dividends is an eu resident and its shareholding in the distributing company would have qualified as a participation under the dutch participation regime if it had been a dutch resident company under certain conditions it is also possible for non european companies with investments in dutch companies such as pension funds to claim back the tax withheld as of 1 january 2018 the netherlands unilaterally applies a zero per cent rate for all distributions to qualifying 5 per cent corporate shareholders in the european union or european economic area eea and entities that are tax resident in a country that has concluded with the netherlands a double taxation treaty with a dividend clause irrespective of whether the treaty itself provides for a zero per cent rate an anti abuse rule also applies denying the exemption if the shareholding is both held with the principal purpose or one of the principal purposes of avoiding the levy of dividend withholding tax and the shareholding is part of an artificial non genuine structure or transaction or series of transactions as of 1 january 2020 the division of the burden of proof with respect to the anti abuse rule is similar to the division of the burden of proof as described in the non resident taxpayer rule described in section iii i iii double tax treaties the netherlands has one of the most extensive treaty networks in the world currently standing at almost 100 bilateral tax treaties providing for inter alia beneficial allocation of the taxing rights on capital gains and reduced withholding tax rates moreover the tax treaties concluded by the netherlands typically protect against discriminatory taxation by any state other than the resident state of the taxpayer most bilateral tax treaties concluded by the netherlands provide for a reduction of dividend withholding tax down to 5 or even zero per cent as an oecd member state the netherlands has ratified the multilateral convention to implement treaty related measures to prevent beps mli as of 1 january 2020 most of the dutch bilateral treaties have been changed by the mli subject to reciprocity to include the mostly anti abuse measures introduced by the mli the netherlands endorsed many mli features including mandatory and binding arbitration if the contracting jurisdictions do not reach a mutual agreement the main anti treaty abuse rule elected by the netherlands is the principal purposes test iv taxation on receipt dividends interest and royalties received by resident companies are generally included in the taxpayer s tax base with the exception of dividend distributions that qualify under the participation exemption regime see section v i moreover given the extensive tax treaty network dutch resident companies can generally avoid double taxation on foreign sourced income by claiming relief in respect of incoming dividends interest and royalties if no tax treaty is available relief from double taxation is usually provided under the dutch unilateral rules for the avoidance of double taxation taxation of funding structures i thin capitalisation the netherlands does not have debt to equity rules or similar anti interest stripping provisions ii deduction of finance costs pursuant to settled case law of the dutch supreme court the characterisation of a financing arrangement as debt for dutch tax purposes in principle follows the characterisation of such arrangement for civil law purposes in this respect a repayment obligation is considered to be an essential element for the financing arrangement to qualify as debt for civil law purposes however there are three exceptions applicable to this general rule pursuant to which the debt is reclassified as equity for dutch tax purposes namely in cases of a sham loan where the parties only created the appearance of a loan while in fact intending to realise an equity contribution a loss financing loan where it is immediately clear from the terms of the loan that the claim resulting from the loan is in part worthless because the loan cannot be repaid and as result of which the funds have permanently left the taxpayer s capital and a hybrid financing or participating loan where based on the terms of the loan the lender in fact is participating in the borrower s capital in this scenario debt is reclassified as equity if the duration of the loan is perpetual i e more than 50 years or the loan is repayable only in the event of the debtor s bankruptcy or liquidation the consideration payable on the debt is entirely or almost entirely contingent on profits and the loan is subordinate to all other creditors as a consequence interest payments on a reclassified loan qualify as dividend distributions for dutch tax purposes and are treated accordingly i e subject to dutch dividend withholding tax and for qualifying participations exempt under the participation exemption regime if none of these exceptions apply the arm s length interest expense should be deductible for dutch cit purposes subject to any interest deduction limitation rules in this regard the dutch supreme court has developed the concept of non businesslike loans a loan between related parties is considered to be non businesslike if the loan is granted under terms and conditions that would not have been agreed upon by independent unrelated parties in similar circumstances however if it is not possible to determine a businesslike interest by doing so the loan in essence would become profit sharing or deviate from the parties original intentions the loan is considered to carry a non businesslike risk of default these loans generally lack a loan agreement a repayment schedule or any security as a result write down losses on these loans are non deductible using the suretyship analogy method as developed by the dutch supreme court the interest rate can be determined by considering the rate that a third party i e a bank would charge if the parent company or if the parent company is not the lender the lender put itself forward as guarantor a final factor in establishing whether the interest expense on a financing arrangement is deductible for dutch cit purposes is the existence of various specific interest deduction limitation rules anti base erosion dutch tax law provides for an anti abuse provision that specifically targets situations that can be described as base erosion the common feature of such structures is that group equity is converted into debt using transactions that have a somewhat artificial character and are not based on valid business reasons interest on and fluctuations in the value in respect of loans that are legally or de facto directly or indirectly owed to related entities are not deductible to the extent these loans relate legally or de facto effectively directly or indirectly to one of the following transactions 1 distributions of profit or repayments of capital by the taxpayer or an affiliated entity or individual to a affiliated entity 2 capital contributions by the taxpayer or an affiliated entity or individual in a affiliated entity or 3 acquisitions or increases by the taxpayer or an affiliated entity or individual of an interest in an entity that becomes an affiliated entity as a result of the acquisition or increase however this anti abuse provision does not apply if the taxpayer can demonstrate that the debt and tainted transaction are predominantly motivated by business reasons business motive exception or the interest is taxed at the level of the recipient at a rate of at least 10 per cent subject to tax exception unless the tax inspector can establish that the debt and tainted transactions are not predominantly motivated by business reasons earnings stripping under the earnings stripping rule that the netherlands had to implement pursuant to the eu anti tax avoidance directive atad net interest expenses is fully deductible up to the higher of 30 per cent likely to be 20 per cent in 2022 of the earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation and 1 million any interest that was non deductible owing to the application of the earnings stripping rule can be carried forward indefinitely iii restrictions on payments pursuant to the dutch civil code a company limited by shares may make distributions to its shareholders and other entitled persons only to the extent its net assets exceed the sum of its called up and paid up capital and the reserves as required by law or the company s articles of association moreover a distribution test applies to bvs pursuant to which the company may only distribute profits to its shareholders and other entitled parties to the extent that this does not interfere with the company s ability to pay its exigible and current debt iv return of capital a repayment of capital has no adverse tax consequences from a dutch cit perspective however a repayment of capital recognised as paid up capital for dutch dividend withholding tax purposes will trigger dividend withholding tax if and to the extent the taxpayer has net profits unless the general meeting of shareholders has resolved in advance to make the repayment and the articles of association have been amended to reduce the nominal value of the ordinary shares by an equal amount the capital recognised as paid up capital for dividend withholding tax purposes may consist of formal capital informal capital and share premium hence to repay capital recognised as paid up capital for dutch dividend withholding tax purposes without triggering dutch dividend withholding tax the nominal value of the ordinary shares must first be reduced by amending the articles of association acquisition structures restructuring and exit charges i acquisitionshare deal a share deal in which the shares in a dutch entity are acquired may be conducted either directly by a foreign entity or indirectly through a dutch acquisition entity in this respect cooperatives are frequently used as shareholders for dutch acquisition entities given that dutch cooperatives are in principle not subject to dutch dividend withholding tax provided that they comply with the anti abuse rules see section i i if the shares are purchased indirectly i e through a wholly owned dutch acquisition entity a fiscal unity may be formed between the acquiring entity and the dutch target company subject to certain requirements accordingly interest expense on the acquisition debt at the level of the dutch acquisition entity may be offset against the profits of the target entity subject to the limitations on interest deduction for acquisition debt see section vii ii if the shares are acquired directly i e by a foreign company the foreign shareholder may become liable to dutch cit pursuant to the non resident taxation rules for foreign substantial shareholders if it does not satisfy the anti abuse rules see section iii i asset deal an asset deal can be executed either directly by a foreign entity or indirectly through a dutch entity that acquires the dutch business or assets in principle the gains realised upon the sale of the assets are subject to dutch cit however provided that certain requirements are met it is possible to defer the cit due by applying a reinvestment reserve that provides for a rollover mechanism for dutch cit due in respect of the gains realised ii reorganisation dutch civil law offers various possibilities for mergers and demergers a stock merger business enterprise merger a legal merger or demerger and a legal spin off the cita provides for several facilities subject to certain conditions by allowing a rollover of book values for the assets and shares transferred in these cases the transfer is effected on a non recognition basis iii exit dutch tax residents relocating their businesses to outside the netherlands are in principle subject to dutch cit in respect of their realised and unrealised profits i e hidden reserves and goodwill similarly for entities migrating into the netherlands a step up of all assets and liabilities applies if certain conditions are satisfied the cit due may be deferred if the taxpayer s new place of residence is an eu or eea member state anti avoidance and other relevant legislation i general anti avoidance in principle dutch tax law allows taxpayers to arrange their affairs so as to minimise the amount of tax payable however they may not initiate actions intended predominantly to reduce the amount of tax that they would otherwise pay although no statutory anti abuse provisions exist under the cita various different doctrines can be seen in dutch case law which are sometimes used interchangeably however these doctrines are not panaceas and they may only be applied by the dutch tax inspector as a final resort the doctrine of independent determination or reclassification of the facts for tax purposes describes the process in which the court labels a fact or set of facts from a dutch tax perspective the court may go beyond the formal paperwork and evaluate the substance of a transaction e g the proper classification of debt versus equity sale versus lease and compensation versus disguised dividend the non statutory concept of fraus legis abuse of law gives the tax authorities the possibility to challenge the validity of a transaction if the decisive motive for entering into the transaction is to avoid taxes subjective element and the transaction is in breach of the purpose and intent objective element the transaction will then be considered abusive and will be treated differently from its legal form ii controlled foreign corporations the cita does not provide for any specific controlled foreign corporations cfc rules however subsidiaries are subject to an annual mark to market requirement if the taxpayer together with its affiliates holds at least 25 per cent of the shares in a subsidiary that is held as a portfolio investment and moreover is subject to a low tax regime where the indicative threshold is a rate of 10 per cent and 90 per cent of the subsidiary s assets including its lower tiered subsidiaries consist of low taxed passive assets if a subsidiary fulfils these criteria its profits are taxed at the level of the dutch shareholder however a credit system is in place to prevent double taxation on these profits as of 1 january 2019 the netherlands has had in place the eu atad model a cfc rules which have an income based approach for cfcs in low tax jurisdictions jurisdictions that are listed on the eu list of non cooperative jurisdictions or that have a cit rate of less than 9 per cent in other situations the netherlands takes the position that the netherlands already has cfc rules in the form of the arm s length principle see section ix iii iii transfer pricing the netherlands has incorporated the arm s length principle into the cita it forms the legal basis for the dutch tax authorities to adjust intercompany transfer prices in cases where related parties have entered into a transaction for a price or conditions that would not have been agreed upon between independent parties this provision defines the term related parties and describes the transfer pricing documentation requirements moreover the provision includes specific rules for financial services companies e g substance and real risk requirements generally the netherlands follows the oecd transfer pricing guidelines and has largely incorporated these guidelines into a transfer pricing decree it has also incorporated the country by country reporting rules into the cita as of 1 january 2016 these rules correspond to oecd beps action 13 i e applying the three tiered documentation approach using a country by country report master file and local file as of 1 january 2022 the netherlands will likely no longer allow unilateral downward adjustments if the taxpayer cannot show that there was a corresponding upward adjustment in addition where a different lower value is taken into account for exit tax purposes upon a for example capital contribution to the netherlands this lower value is the value that will be taken into account for dutch tax purposes again not granting a unilateral downward adjustment iv tax clearances and rulings the netherlands is well known for the cooperative and constructive attitude of the tax authorities and the possibility to discuss the tax treatment of particular operations or transactions in advance upfront certainty in an atr or apa an atr provides the taxpayer with certainty regarding the tax treatment of international structures e g the applicability of the dutch participation exemption an apa provides upfront certainty in respect of the transfer prices for intra group transactions both types of settlement agreements are concluded by the dutch ruling team working in close liaison with the central point for potential foreign investors this department provides foreign investors advance certainty on the tax treatment of their prospective investments in the netherlands an atr or apa is typically valid for four years as of july 2019 the netherlands has renewed its ruling practice to obtain a ruling there must be enough substance in the netherlands at the group level the economic nexus requirement and the requesting entity must have enough substance for the items to be covered by the ruling rulings are not granted if the request covers direct transactions with low tax jurisdictions see section vi i v anti hybrid rules the netherlands has introduced the anti hybrid rules prescribed by the eu atad effective as of 1 january 2020 under the anti hybrid rules deduction or non inclusion and double deduction outcomes resulting from hybrid mismatches hybrid financial instruments hybrid entities or hybrid permanent establishments are neutralised by a denial of deduction or an inclusion of the income the reverse hybrid taxpayer rule enters into effect on 1 january 2022 year in review the 2022 dutch tax plan proposed on budget day 2021 did not contain many significant unexpected changes to the tax code this is because the government that put forward the 2022 dutch tax plan is currently defunct and the formation of a new government is still in progress following parliamentary elections in march 2021 outlook and conclusions both the oecd and european anti beps projects continue to be key topics in the netherlands because of pressure from the european union the netherlands has taken stricter measures against tax avoidance however the netherlands keeps the business climate in mind when designing the measures against tax avoidance structures restructuring and exit charges

do you know why we have the drug laws that we have today in ireland and around the globe to be blunt excuse the pun the reasons are racism and marijuana as far back as the 1930s in the us the infamous champion of severe punishment for drug users harry anslinger was arguing for total drug prohibition even when people s attitudes towards drugs were less critical on reflection it is evident that american society did not shape the world s attitudes to drug use instead powerful men in the united states shaped those views the anslinger effect anslinger headed up the united states federal bureau of narcotics for over three decades from 1930 to 1962 in this space of time he succeeded in exporting his anti drugs mission to the world us president kennedy at a presentation of an outstanding record citation to harry j anslinger former commissioner of narcotics 1962 alamy stock photo alamy stock photo he once stated american youth is jeopardised by weed those who are lured into the use of marijuana are destined to be transformed into moral and mental degenerates some riveting maniacs others violent criminals it s almost as if anslinger s ghost lives on in some of our policymakers today however anslinger s efforts to demonise drugs in the us was also a racist campaign he once claimed that black people and latinos were the primary users of marijuana he made a concerted effort over decades to conflate violence drug use and race advertisement it is well documented that he cherry picked evidence to present on drugs ignoring the advice of the majority of medical professionals to convince legislators that marijuana was linked to violent crime i think of the enchanting sounds of billie holiday who used heroin and who was hounded on her deathbed by anslinger anslinger asserted that jazz musicians created satanic music due to smoking marijuana johann hari has written about the racial claims by the politician whereby anslinger stated that cannabis promoted interracial relationships global agenda anslinger took his anti drugs mission to the united nations along with his unintelligent arguments and won several conventions such as the 1931 narcotics limitations and the 1936 convention for suppression of illicit traffic have anslinger s fingerprints all over them such conventions aimed to encourage other states to introduce criminal prosecution for the consumption of drugs anslinger managed to take personal bias and vendetta and impose it on a global scale he ensured that the us was the authority on drugs at the un between the 1930s and 1960s using his high level position to lead many of the negotiations on the international stage he did so without the us ever joining the league of nations after a decade of drafting these efforts resulted in the 1961 un single convention on narcotic drugs over 60 years on in 2022 we are still handcuffed to this piece of legislation although amended over the years the treaty remains the dominant law of many nations it can be understood as a global policy on drugs prohibition the body count under this failed regime is immeasurable the global scale of the treaty s influence makes the suffering hard to capture in numbers but the evidence is overwhelming and undeniable that this regime has failed at no point in the last 61 years of its existence has global drug use ever declined a study in the british medical journal in 2013 found that since the 1990s the supply of drugs across europe and the us has increased prices have fallen and purity has increased continuing anslinger s racist legacy the war on drugs has targeted black americans black people comprise 13 of the us population but 40 of those incarcerated for drug offences in the us by adopting the 1961 convention in ireland we have also achieved nothing the addiction continued drug markets exploded generations of families have been wiped out and to what end failure of prohibition prohibition had no evidence base in america and it s not grounded in any evidence in our drugs act in ireland either in the 1970s in ireland minister brendan corish said that the state was fulfilling its united nations obligations when debating the misuse of drugs act read next related reads lynn ruane prohibition has never worked anywhere and it never will opinion supervised drug injecting in ireland 10 years of advocacy legislation and delays people in ireland have the most regret over being drunk globally new study shows but these united nations obligations were never founded on evidence even corish expressed serious doubts when introducing the legislation tracking our drug laws back in time illuminates that it has always been ideology over the evidence specifically the personal ideology of a small handful of powerful racist conservative american men what we have witnessed under this treaty is death debt and misery what was once coined the war on drugs by president nixon in 1971 following decades of anslinger s lead is now seen for what it really is a war on people on culture and the poor a 2011 report by the global commission on drug policy unequivocally concluded that the war on drugs was a failure indeed the war on drugs has failed is a global consensus among health experts drug policy advocates and health authorities despite this last year the international narcotics control board published a paper called celebrating 60 years of the single convention on narcotic drugs of 1961 it isn t easy to comprehend that its authors are experiencing the exact times as the rest of us reading the document the paper says that an underpinning principle of the 1961 convention is the health and welfare of humankind yet this completely ignores the realities of people s lives under its existence the paper states the convention has proved its value yet globally around 150 000 people still die every year from drug overdoses the 1961 convention essentially created global prohibition prohibition brings violence poor quality drugs and criminalisation all of which fly in the face of integration and health to say that the convention is based on health and welfare is a complete contradiction references to treatment education and rehabilitation are paternalistic and tokenistic without real drug policy reform even the world health organization has called for the decriminalisation of drug use they are quoted as saying bold policies can deliver bold results when will ireland be bold and brave the time is now for ireland to have a citizens assembly on drugs and rid ourselves of the cold chains of the misuse of drugs act which is in reality a product of america s racist and ideological war on drugs it is clear to see how america s anti drugs politicians influenced international conventions which in turn influenced ireland s drugs policy never being led by any evidence our drug laws in ireland have their roots in a war on people our citizen s assembly must not only end that war but it must remedy some of the damage that this war has done to countless lives lynn ruane is an independent senator
ford motor co is planning a reorganization to prepare for the electric future using tesla inc s success as a road map and accelerating electric vehicle spending by as much 20 billion the effort led by a former apple inc and tesla executive calls for ford to spend an additional 10 billion to 20 billion over the next five to 10 years converting factories worldwide to electric vehicle production from making gasoline powered cars according to people familiar with the plan that would be on top of the 30 billion ford already has committed to electric vehicles through 2025 the move is part of chief executive officer jim farley s initiative to challenge tesla s dominance in electric vehicles even as he takes pages from the playbook of the electric vehicle pioneer now the world s most valuable automaker investors have bought into farley s vision for ford briefly lifting the company s market value above 100 billion in january the new plan also envisions a reworked ford organizational chart including the hiring of an unspecified number of engineers specializing in disciplines relatively new to the company such as battery chemistry artificial intelligence and electric vehicle software as part of the reorganization the company has evaluated spinning off a small portion of its electric vehicle business to capture some of the value investors are giving electric startups said one of the people who asked not to be identified because the deliberations aren t public the potential move would involve lower volume models allowing the company to focus its efforts on mass market electric vehicles the person said ford declined to comment on the planned reorganization and potential spinoff we are executing our ford plus plan to transform the company and thrive in this new era of electric and connected vehicles we would not comment on speculation mark truby the company s chief communications officer said in an emailed statement doug field the former head of apple s car project is leading ford s overhaul the people said field was also a top executive at tesla where he engineered the model 3 ford s electric vehicle plans have accelerated since farley 59 became ceo 16 months ago it has tripled output of the electric mustang mach e model and doubled production of the f 150 lightning plug in pickup coming this spring the company also is spending 11 4 billion with south korea s sk innovation to build three battery factories and an electric vehicle truck plant in tennessee and kentucky poaches from apple ford poached field from apple in september to disrupt the 118 year old company he s working closely with farley to make the legacy automaker more nimble like tesla by adjusting ford s operational and manufacturing structure the people said the restructuring is a work in progress and some elements may be changed or dropped including the electric vehicle spinoff idea the people said the ford family which controls the automaker through a special class of supervoting stock would have to be convinced that a spinoff is worthwhile farley has expressed admiration for tesla ceo elon musk and acknowledged ford is rethinking its mission as the company prepares to manufacture 600 000 electric vehicles a year by 2024 the dearborn mich based automaker wants to generate as much as half of its global sales from electric vehicles by the end of the decade to drive home his desire to emulate tesla farley has taken to sharing news articles about the electric vehicle maker with others internally according to one person farley who did not comment for this article has said he s learned a lot from watching musk transform his company from a struggling startup to a high profit global electric vehicle leader that investors value at more than 1 trillion i really admire frankly the difficulties they had and the way they managed those difficulties into the success they had ford s ceo said in an interview last month with bloomberg tv s emily chang they are now making more than 10 000 a vehicle because of their scale i like that kind of business it s unclear which tesla practices farley plans to adopt as ford builds out its own electric vehicle manufacturing capacity and accelerates its shift from a mechanical engineer led workforce to one that increasingly is made up of software engineers keeping business unlike tesla ford also must manage the slow decline of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines which now generate all of the profit necessary to fund the company s electric vehicle aspirations that s an area ford also is intensely focused on as it reinvents itself farley sees gasoline fueled vehicles as a core part of the company for many years to come and still intends to invest enough to keep it competitive with rivals he said in a separate interview last week one way is to boost the services ford sells to car owners a business that could generate 20 billion a year in revenue that could include selling drivers software to upgrade their car s performance or enhance dashboard touchscreens or it may involve getting more business in the service bays at ford s dealers which see 90 of owners go elsewhere for maintenance after their warranties expire farley said ultimately farley wants even more of ford s customers driving electric vehicles and that s the future he and field are preparing for ford hopes to eventually overtake tesla but for now is trying to solidify its standing as america s no 2 seller of electric vehicles what it takes to succeed in this digital connected electric product are

chunky casual comfortable let s talk chowder while it s often clammy and most times creamy at least north of rhode island a homemade chowder simply must contain bite sized chunks of protein and or vegetables get served casually from the cast iron pot it was made in and be comforting to your soul the word chowder is a corruption of the french chaudière loosely translated in english as cauldron food historians say chowder the hearty meal that is more satisfying for an eater than soup and less time consuming for a cook than a stew likely originated among breton fishermen who brought the custom of making it to newfoundland from where it migrated south to supper tables in nova scotia new brunswick and new england for me a chowder separates itself from other soups by its mouthfeel says saco based chef food photographer and cookbook author derek bissonnette several bite sized ingredients sitting on your soupspoon simultaneously enveloped in a viscous broth makes a chowder in bissonnette s book literally his 2018 book published by kennebunkport s cider mill press is called soup the ultimate book of soups and stews bissonette says that if a cook understands how the basic elements of chowder the broth the hero ingredient the well diced vegetables and the thickening agent are prepared and get added to the cauldron they can likely make a good one from whatever is on hand at home the broth advertisement a flavorful broth is key to any chowder s success as an example bissonnette points to his method for clam chowder he steams 5 pounds of soft shelled clams in 2 cups of wine and 1 cup of chopped onions he removes the opened clams strains the liquid and uses it as the broth for the chowder starting with something flavorful and building more flavor into it makes a big difference in the final dish he says maine seaweed dashi deepens the seafood flavor in a fish chowder or adds umami to a vegetarian one simmer corn cobs with thyme for 20 minutes and the strained liquid will add sweetness to a lobster chowder and depth to a corn one canned chicken stock steeped with the peels of frozen shrimp makes a broth well suited for a seafood or chicken chowder canned vegetable broth is more interesting if it s spent a little time getting to know a dried chipotle pepper before being introduced to sweet potatoes in a chowder regardless of how you flavor your broth count on 1 cup per chowder eater the star choose an ingredient in your cupboard fridge or freezer that can carry the show the strong flavor and unique texture of clams whether canned or whole or chopped fresh set a strong example for what you re looking for in a star anchor your chowder with a can of smoked mussels a chopped roasted head of cauliflower a spicy cured chorizo sausage sliced into bite sized rounds a batch of previously cooked chickpeas tossed in curry spices or a bag of corn kernels shaved from last summer s cobs and put up in the freezer to name just a few options it s best to cook star ingredients ahead as cooking them in the pot with the ensemble for a long period of time can cause them to lose their distinctive look feel and taste cut canned cured steamed and roasted main ingredients into bite sized pieces and add them to the pot at the tail end of the cooking process to warm through an exception to this rule of thumb is fresh seafood like flaky white fish scallops and shrimp cut these while still raw into bite sized pieces and lower them into the pot of hot chowder to gently cook until they are opaque in the residual heat in the covered pot just after you ve taken it off the heat advertisement figure on 1 4 cup of your star ingredient per person the chunk a small dice will do for any aromatic vegetable in your chowder carrots or parsnips onions or shallots celery or fennel classically defined as being 1 4 inch squares these little nuggets are chopped finer than other vegetables in the pot so they won t be crunchy when the chowder is fully cooked to help ensure the aromatics are very tender before adding any broth to the pot sweat them gently in a bit of fat bacon grease olive oil and butter are all good options for at least five minutes over low heat dice aromatics at a rate of 1 4 cup per person you plan to serve potatoes which most but not all chowder have in common need to be cut into a medium dice classically defined as 1 2 inch squares the potatoes don t have to be peeled the skins add texture color nutrients and a bit of protection against whole chunks dissolving into the broth but they do need to a consistent size to ensure even cooking all types of potatoes will work in a chowder waxy ones like red bliss or all purpose ones like yukon golds hold their shape better drier ones like russets tend to dissolve into the broth a bit more and sweet ones add color and it goes without saying sweetness dice potatoes at a rate of 1 2 cup per person you plan to serve advertisement the thickener there are two primary ways to thicken a chowder the first takes patience and a bit of cream and the second calls for flour bissonnette is a patient man and reduces his broth before adding it to the chowder pot if you want to run with this thickening method for every person you want to serve the finished chowder to add 2 cups of flavored broth to a saucepan and simmer it down to 1 cup before adding it to the sweated aromatics in the pot you then cook the potatoes in this reduced broth a process that leaches starch into the liquid and finish the chowder with heavy cream if you are not patient after sweating the vegetables in fat you can sprinkle flour over them and stir the flour combines with the fat to make a roux that will then thicken any liquid you stir into the pot how much flour depends both on the amount of fat you ve used to sweat the vegetables and how much liquid you are adding the fat and flour amounts should be equal by weight that s easy to measure if you have a kitchen scale if you don t a general rule of thumb is that for every 2 tablespoons of fat sprinkle in a scant 1 4 cup of flour that amount will thicken 4 cups of liquid the potatoes get cooked in the thickened broth for a gluten free thickener add cornstarch to the chowder at the very end of the cooking process whisk 4 tablespoons of cornstarch with 1 cup of room temperature broth to form a slurry this amount of slurry will thicken 4 cups of broth or 8 cups of fully loaded chowder stir the combination into the chowder once the other ingredients are cooked bring the chowder to a boil and cook it for about a minute to thicken if you do not have patience flour or cornstarch soak old bread or saltines in broth puree the mixture and stir it into the chowder with your star ingredients advertisement the process in a clam shell making chowder presents all manner of choice based on your taste and larder but if you follow the general flow outlined here slowly sweat aromatics in fat choose a thickening agent add flavorful broth cook uniformly diced potatoes in the broth advertisement add well prepped hero ingredients you should land on a custom made chowder that fills your bowls fits your budget and suits your taste the extras with a little extra something there are myriad ways to make basic chowder sing including chopped fresh parsley or thyme crispy bacon bits or sausage crumble or smoky dulse flakes liven up the white landscape of a clam chowder diced roasted red peppers or a bit of tomato paste will sweeten a spicy chowder advertisement adding huitlacoche a fungus that grows on corn and is considered a delicacy in mexico adds a little funk to corn chowder you can find it frozen or in cans in most mexican grocery stores a squeeze of lemon juice will brighten up flat tasting manhattan

president reagan was born in tampico illinois on this day in 1911 he died in 2004 over the years i ve caught many of the ronald reagan movies it s impossible to watch an old reagan movie without thinking of the 40th president of the u s nevertheless i found this one rather interesting storm rising was released in 1951 reagan played district attorney burt rainey it is intense and here is the plot marsha mitchell a traveling dress model stops in a southern town to see her sister who has married a ku klux klansman marsha sees the kkk commit a murder and helps district attorney burt rainey in bringing the criminals to justice the critics were a bit disappointed with the movie as we see in this review in the new york times the consequence is a smoothly flowing mechanically melodramatic film superficially forceful but lacking real substance or depth and the same goes for the performances which ronald reagan and ginger rogers give as the brave young prosecutor and the key witness respectively mr reagan is as pat and pedestrian as any well drilled stock company d a and miss rogers plays in one grim mood a young lady who just happens to witness a murder in passing by doris day plays her younger sister living blissfully in town with a local mugg a street car named desire seems to have passed here with a great deal of musical comedy bounce hugh sanders lloyd gough and raymond greenleaf are nasty as rulers of the klan the new york times critical of a reagan performance where have we seen that before first i am not a movie critic my goal is to watch an interesting story and to be entertained for a bit on that basis this is a good 90 minute movie as he was when he was president reagan was always super credible on the screen it s amazing how you can quickly relate to the facial expressions that we saw later from the white house second it must have been difficult for a movie to expose the kkk in 1951 it was a different time finally ronald reagan turned out to be a better president than actor the country is grateful for that overall a fun movie to watch but a better presidency thirty years later for the nation happy 111 to the gipper ps you can listen to my show canto talk image gage skidmore via flickr cc by sa 2 0
there s a spike in crime right now in the united states and the only thing that surprises me about that is that nobody expected it the right says there s not enough support for law enforcement the left claims it s because of systematic racism tucker carlson says it s due to left wing policies in democrat run cities i agree with almost everything tucker says but not this one every news anchor or newspaper journalist has a different reason for the rise in crime but i haven t heard one that makes sense yet this won t be solved by throwing more money at or defunding the police systematic racism isn t why crime is getting worse when i was a teenager i watched as bill clinton lied to congress in front of the entire nation when he was questioned about his relationship with monica lewinsky he knowingly committed felony perjury and adultery when he was a sitting president of the united states and there were absolutely zero consequences for his actions the entire time he was in office there was scandal after scandal and he was never held accountable for any of it the bush and obama administrations were no better you can look back over the years at whitewater vince foster wmds benghazi atf gun walking the russia hoax and so many more blatant crimes by people sitting in the district of columbia the scandals were and are never ending and there is never any accountability for any of them and these same scandalous men nominate our supreme court justices let that sink in for a minute or two we ve had only one honorable man serve as president of the united states in this century this honorable quality so offended the washington swamp people that they ginned up a hoax accusing him of treason impeached him twice and allowed him to be cheated out of his second term in office because he wasn t one of them image u s capitol by martin falbisoner cc by sa 3 0 white house by daniel schwen cc by sa 3 0 joe biden is a known liar and plagiarist the only reason that i m not calling him a criminal is because he hasn t been convicted for the crimes that we all know he s committed people need to wake up and smell the swamp you can t steal right in front of your kids and then expect them to be law abiding citizens when they grow up it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure that out how did nancy pelosi get as wealthy as she is on a public servant s salary we re not stupid if the people that run this country cannot manage to follow the law then why should anyone else we work 40 or more hours a week just to have our paychecks snatched by the government for taxes sometimes we rob peter to pay paul just to keep the electricity on and then when we turn on the television we hear nancy pelosi claim that we re a nation of laws right after she made a fortune in tesla stock come on man crime is spiking because the american people are becoming as morally bankrupt as the politicians in our government harsher sentences won t help stop crime because the jails and prisons are already packed full more police won t solve anything for the same reason if you want to fix the problem with crime you need to start by clearing out the swamp in washington our leaders need to be held accountable like everyone else nobody is supposed to be above the law here but you could have fooled me our own olympic athletes are choosing to represent other countries now and the media blames it on greed eileen gu doesn t have enough pride in her country to represent it that s why she isn t representing the united states she shouldn t be blamed for that when american s are proud to be american s again our problems will start to go away too we need to make america great again

ai generated fashion models could bring more diversity to the industry or leave it with less a model presents a creation by gefferson vila nova during the sao paulo fashion week 2024 spfw at the iguatemi shopping mall in sao paulo brazil 13 april 2024 spfw continues through 14 april with a total of 27 shows epa london based model alexsandrah has a twin but not in the way you d expect her counterpart is made of pixels instead of flesh and blood the virtual twin was generated by artificial intelligence and has already appeared as a stand in for the real life alexsandrah in a photo shoot alexsandrah who goes by her first name professionally in turn receives credit and compensation whenever the ai version of herself gets used just like a human model alexsandrah says she and her alter ego mirror each other even down to the baby hairs and it is yet another example of how ai is transforming creative industries and the way humans may or may not be compensated proponents say the growing use of ai in fashion modeling showcases diversity in all shapes and sizes allowing consumers to make more tailored purchase decisions that in turn reduces fashion waste from product returns and digital modeling saves money for companies and creates opportunities for people who want to work with the technology but critics raise concerns that digital models may push human models and other professionals like makeup artists and photographers out of a job unsuspecting consumers could also be fooled into thinking ai models are real and companies could claim credit for fulfilling diversity commitments without employing actual humans fashion is exclusive with limited opportunities for people of color to break in said sara ziff a former fashion model and founder of the model alliance a nonprofit aiming to advance workers rights in the fashion industry i think the use of ai to distort racial representation and marginalize actual models of color reveals this troubling gap between the industry s declared intentions and their real actions women of color in particular have long faced higher barriers to entry in modeling and ai could upend some of the gains they ve made data suggests that women are more likely to work in occupations in which the technology could be applied and are more at risk of displacement than men in march 2023 iconic denim brand levi strauss co announced that it would be testing ai generated models produced by amsterdam based company lalaland ai to add a wider range of body types and underrepresented demographics on its website but after receiving widespread backlash levi clarified that it was not pulling back on its plans for live photo shoots the use of live models or its commitment to working with diverse models we do not see this ai pilot as a means to advance diversity or as a substitute for the real action that must be taken to deliver on our diversity equity and inclusion goals and it should not have been portrayed as such levi said in its statement at the time the company last month said that it has no plans to scale the ai program the associated press reached out to several other retailers to ask whether they use ai fashion models target kohl s and fast fashion giant shein declined to comment temu did not respond to a request for comment meanwhile spokespeople for nieman marcus h m walmart and macy s said their respective companies do not use ai models although walmart clarified that suppliers may have a different approach to photography they provide for their products but we don t have that information nonetheless companies that generate ai models are finding a demand for the technology including lalaland ai which was co founded by michael musandu after he was feeling frustrated by the absence of clothing models who looked like him one model does not represent everyone that s actually shopping and buying a product he said as a person of color i felt this painfully myself musandu says his product is meant to supplement traditional photo shoots not replace them instead of seeing one model shoppers could see nine to 12 models using different size filters which would enrich their shopping experience and help reduce product returns and fashion waste the technology is actually creating new jobs since lalaland ai pays humans to train its algorithms musandu said and if brands are serious about inclusion efforts they will continue to hire these models of color he added london based model alexsandrah who is black says her digital counterpart has helped her distinguish herself in the fashion industry in fact the real life alexsandrah has even stood in for a black computer generated model named shudu created by cameron wilson a former fashion photographer turned ceo of the diigitals a uk based digital modeling agency wilson who is white designed shudu in 2017 described on instagram as the the world s first digital supermodel but critics at the time accused wilson of cultural appropriation and digital blackface wilson took the experience as a lesson and transformed the diigitals to make sure shudu who has been booked by louis vuitton and bmw didn t take away opportunities but instead opened possibilities for women of color alexsandrah for instance has modeled in person as shudu for vogue australia and writer ama badu came up with shudu s backstory and portrays her voice for interviews alexsandrah said she is extremely proud of her work with the diigitals which created her own ai twin it s something that even when we are no longer here the future generations can look back at and be like these are the pioneers but for yve edmond a new york city area based model who works with major retailers to check the fit of clothing before it s sold to consumers the rise of ai in fashion modeling feels more insidious edmond worries modeling agencies and companies are taking advantage of models who are generally independent contractors afforded few labor protections in the us by using their photos to train ai systems without their consent or compensation she described one incident in which a client asked to photograph edmond moving her arms squatting and walking for research purposes edmond refused and later felt swindled her modeling agency had told her she was being booked for a fitting not to build an avatar this is a complete violation she said it was really disappointing for me but absent ai regulations it s up to companies to be transparent and ethical about deploying ai technology and ziff the founder of the model alliance likens the current lack of legal protections for fashion workers to the wild west that s why the model alliance is pushing for legislation like the one being considered in new york state in which a provision of the fashion workers act would require management companies and brands to obtain models clear written consent to create or use a model s digital replica specify the amount and duration of compensation and prohibit altering or manipulating models digital replica without consent alexsandrah says that with ethical use and the right legal regulations ai might open up doors for more models of color like herself she has let her clients know that she has an ai replica and she funnels any inquires for its use through wilson who she describes as somebody that i know love trust and is my friend wilson says they make sure any compensation for alexsandrah s ai is comparable to what she would make in person edmond however is more of a purist we have this amazing earth that we re living on and you have a person of every shade every height every size why not find that person and compensate that person
as a result more people have jobs and inflation is closer to the target at its meeting last tuesday the reserve bank board decided that given the strength of australia s economic recovery it was now time to end the bond buying program quantitative tightening but it delayed any decision on what the rba should do with all the bonds that it hoovered up during the pandemic one option is to allow the bonds to mature without replacing them which would progressively shrink the size of the reserve bank s balance sheet this process known as quantitative tightening or qt is the opposite of qe advertisement it s likely to have some dampening effect on economic activity by nudging bond yields higher which puts some downward pressure on asset prices the other option is for the reserve bank to reinvest the proceeds of maturing bonds which would keep its balance sheet steady at about 650 billion after the reserve bank s board meeting on tuesday lowe played a straight bat saying the board will consider the issue of the reinvestment of the proceeds of future bond maturities at its meeting in may but he was more expansive in his speech to the national press club the following day he explained that one of the reasons the reserve bank had taken the historic decision to buy bonds was that other central banks were buying them if we hadn t also done this our bond yields and exchange rate would have been higher than they have been and this would have impeded the recovery from the pandemic advertisement the strong rebound in the australian economy he noted meant that it no longer needed the additional monetary stimulus from the bond buying program the unemployment rate now stands at 4 2 per cent and underlying inflation is at 2 6 per cent for the first time in some years the achievement of our goals is within sight economic support still he emphasised that ending the bond purchase program did not mean the reserve bank was tightening monetary policy the accumulated international evidence is that it is the stock of bonds purchased not the flow of purchases that provides the economic support in other words the australian economy will continue to receive substantial monetary succour from the reserve bank s bond purchases advertisement but lowe also hinted that the reserve bank could decide to wind back some of this monetary support in may if the australian economy continued to perform strongly the reserve bank he said had yet to decide whether it would reinvest the proceeds of maturing bonds and unlike other central banks it has a few months in which to make its decision the large gaps in the maturity profile mean that we have more time to make a decision the next maturity of an australian government bond is in july 2022 ahead of this the board will consider its approach to investment at its meeting in may with the key considerations being the state of the economy and the outlook for inflation and unemployment but the reserve bank will also be keeping a close eye on the decisions of other central banks and particularly the fed before deciding to shrink its balance sheet after all taking such a step would put australia s central bank out of step with other major ones that are looking to get a rate increase or two under their belts before paring their balance sheets advertisement in its latest statement on monetary policy released on friday the reserve bank noted that even though central banks are tapering or have concluded their pandemic related asset purchases their large holdings of assets will continue to contribute to accommodative financial conditions the statement also pointed out that several central banks have announced plans to keep the total size of their asset holdings steady for a time by reinvesting proceeds from maturing bonds stable level of bond holdings for example both the bank of canada and the bank of england will maintain a roughly stable level of bond holdings until they increase their policy rate to a certain threshold and while the powerful us federal reserve is beginning to debate strategies to shrink the size of its balance sheet which now stands at an eye watering us9 trillion it still wants to make at least one rate rise before paring its balance sheet this suggests the fed could begin reducing the size of its balance sheet from the middle of this year the statement notes advertisement of course this raises the tantalising possibility that the reserve bank could be deciding whether or not to shrink its balance sheet at roughly the same time as the fed certainly at their meeting last month fed officials appeared keen to get started on the task of significantly reducing its balance sheet which has more than doubled since march 2020 this means its reduction is likely to be much swifter than it was back in 2017 after buying huge quantities of bonds following the financial crisis the fed waited about two years after its first post crisis rate increase before it stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing us government bonds and mortgage backed securities still the fed appears determined to follow its past practice of allowing only a certain quantity of bonds to run off the portfolio each month to make sure the shrinkage of its balance sheet is predictable all the same there are considerable uncertainties for financial markets when central banks start winding down their massive balance sheets in 2019 two years after it started shrinking its balance sheet the fed was forced to flood financial markets with liquidity after us short term borrowing costs spiked unexpectedly advertisement and the gigantic size of central bank balance sheets post pandemic means there is a heightened risk of financial market disruption this time around the fed s balance sheet is now more than double the us4 5 trillion peak it reached after the financial crisis and its large holdings of us government bonds means it is a big participant in the us22 trillion american bond market which is the foundation of the global financial system as the fed shrinks its balance sheet yields on assets such as government bonds and mortgage backed securities will push higher but there is little consensus in financial circles about how much higher bond yields will climb as the fed reduces its bond holdings and although the reserve bank s balance sheet is a fraction of the size of the fed s it owns a significant chunk of the local bond market as lowe noted this week the reserve bank now owns 42 per cent of australian government bonds on issue and 60 per cent of some bond lines
press release socialist equality group the working class in new zealand faces immense dangers as a result of the labour party led governments decision to allow the omicron variant of covid 19 to spread throughout the country the socialist equality group calls on workers students and the working class in new zealand faces immense dangers as a result of the labour party led government s decision to allow the omicron variant of covid 19 to spread throughout the country the socialist equality group calls on workers students and young people to take action to prevent a looming catastrophe and to unite with workers internationally to put an end to the pandemic in justifying the decision to reopen the schools on january 31 and to keep all businesses open prime minister jacinda ardern echoed the claims being made internationally that omicron is mild and manageable this is pure propaganda worldwide the variant continues to kill more than 9 000 people every day the economist estimates that the pandemic has killed more than 20 6 million people since covid 19 was detected more than two years ago a death toll comparable to the first world war the vast majority of these lives could have been saved and the pandemic ended in a matter of months if governments had adopted scientific policies to stop the spread and eliminate the virus this is proven by the successful elimination measures including strict lockdowns implemented in new zealand during the first year and a half and by china s continuing zero covid policy the covid death toll in new zealand stood at 26 in the middle of last year and is now 53 since may 2020 china has recorded just four fatalities and its total death toll is 4 636 about the same number are dying of covid in the united states every two or three days in october last year in the middle of an outbreak of the delta variant ardern announced that new zealand would abandon its elimination policy her government proceeded to end a lockdown in auckland and has now joined the us australia and most other countries by adopting a policy of mass infection this decision is driven by the demands of big business that schools must be open and workers remain on the job so that the extraction of profit from the working class can continue uninterrupted ardern declared bluntly on january 20 we won t stop omicron but we can try and slow it down in fact since the outbreak was detected on january 23 daily community case numbers have soared from 20 30 to more than 100 and omicron has overtaken the delta variant the institute for health metrics and evaluation has projected that new zealand could see cases peak at 80 000 a day with a total of more than 400 dead by the middle of the year canterbury university covid 19 modeller michael plank has said up to half the population might eventually be infected starting at the end of february the government plans to begin dismantling the quarantine requirements for people entering the country which has kept hundreds of omicron cases out of the community this will further fuel the outbreak in addition to hundreds or thousands of deaths thousands of people will end up in hospital and many will develop long covid this affliction can impact every organ of the body persist for an unknown period of time and leave the infected individuals with serious health problems including brain damage there are many warnings that hospitals already in crisis due to decades of underfunding will not cope with the flood of cases while the government used the pandemic to give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to big business it has done virtually nothing to strengthen the healthcare system stuff reported on january 15 that out of eight district health boards surveyed hospital bed capacity in use was already between 81 and 112 percent while between 61 and 79 percent of intensive care units were occupied st john ambulance has 150 unfilled staff vacancies nationwide an 11 percent vacancy that is placing immense pressure on ambulance services vaccination rates are low on february 2 ardern declared that 94 percent of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated giving new zealand a head start on omicron in fact only about 35 percent of people over the age of 18 27 percent of the total population have received a third shot of the pfizer vaccine which is necessary to provide significant protection against omicron in a somewhat desperate move the government has just decided to shorten the gap between the second and third shots from four to three months in australia hundreds of double vaccinated people are dying from covid every week in denmark which ardern has described as one of the models for new zealand s approach omicron infected 272 811 people in the last seven days and killed 135 workers in public transport education food processing retail hospitality the healthcare system and other major industries are all highly exposed to the virus the government has placed the country in a red setting under its covid 19 protection framework this means that the virus is circulating and mandates that businesses use mitigation measures such as requiring vaccine passes masking and limits on gathering sizes none of which applies in schools the framework also known as the traffic light system excludes lockdowns and other serious measures such as school and business closures to stop the spread of covid trains and buses are being crammed with people not physically distanced and wearing low quality masks the government has refused to supply the most effective n95 and similar masks for the population as a whole thousands of children returning to school have no significant protection against covid fewer than 40 percent of those aged 5 to 11 have received one vaccine dose masks are only required for children from year 4 7 and 8 year olds up most schools and early childhood education centres eces have no mitigation measures such as air purifiers or ventilation the ministry of education is merely advising teachers to open windows and hold classes outdoors the government and the media are spreading false claims that schools are not a major risk for infections and must remain open for the sake of children s mental health in fact schools have played a central role in spreading the virus since the start of the pandemic in new zealand worldwide covid has ripped through schools and eces infecting millions of children who can easily pass on covid to others by the middle of 2021 an estimated 1 5 million children had lost a parent or caregiver to the virus children are at risk of severe illness and death in the us more than 1 000 children have died from covid and over 6 400 have developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome children mis c a condition characterised by inflammation of vital organs such as the heart lungs and brain in europe canada and the us growing numbers of teachers parents and students are fighting to close schools in order to save lives in opposition to governments big business and the trade unions that support the reopening drive in south australia the australian education union recently intervened to cancel a planned strike voted for by two thirds of teachers the new zealand government would not be able to implement a let it rip policy without the complicity of the trade union bureaucracy which has worked hand in glove with the state and big business to keep everything open the primary teachers union nzei posted on facebook on january 31 happy first day of school our primary school members across the country despite the challenges red settings bring we know you ll be out there providing an amazing safe fun and educational experience to our tamariki former council of trade unions secretary sam huggard told radio nz he was comfortable with schools reopening and new zealand was lucky in a sense that we ve been able to get through summer and do the best we can to try and prepare for this while the unions parrot the government s false claims there is growing anxiety and opposition among working people to the pro business response to the pandemic a one news kantor poll published last month found ardern s approval rating has fallen to 35 percent the lowest since her labour government was first elected in 2017 hundreds of parents and teachers have spoken out on social media against the reopening of schools these sentiments must be transformed into a political movement of the working class directed against the government and the entire capitalist political establishment including labour and the unions which supports policies that will lead to mass infection and death urgent action must be prepared including strikes and shutdowns to close non essential workplaces and schools this must be the starting point of a fight for the global elimination of the coronavirus waged by workers in new zealand hand in hand with their class brothers and sisters around the world the following principles must serve as the foundation of such a movement 1 the present policy of herd immunity i e allowing covid 19 to spread throughout the population must be repudiated a new strategy directed toward the elimination and eradication of sars cov 2 must be adopted 2 the policies implemented to stop viral transmission must be determined by the needs of public health the protection of human life and safety must take absolute and unconditional priority over all corporate financial interests the costs of fighting the pandemic including the payment of wages and salaries compensation to small business owners full medical coverage for the ill and payments to bereaved families must be borne by corporations and a 100 percent tax on the windfall pandemic profits obtained by large investors through the run up in the stock market 3 the fight against the pandemic must be conducted on a global scale the pandemic cannot be stopped unless sars cov 2 is eliminated in all countries new zealand workers must demand that vaccines be provided in necessary quantities free of charge to their class brothers and sisters in the less developed countries labour the greens the opposition national party big business and the corporate controlled media together with the trade unions and their pseudo left supporters will declare that these policies are 1 impossible to implement and 2 incompatible with the existing capitalist system the answer to the first objection is that it is impossible to accept the infection of millions of people and the massive loss of life as for the second objection the answer is simply this if capitalism can offer no solution to a crisis that threatens the lives and well being of the vast majority of the population then it should be gotten rid of and replaced with a socialist system that prioritises life over profits the fight against covid is in essence a struggle against capitalism the tragedy of the past two years has made the case for the reorganisation of the world economy in the interests of the working class we urge all workers to circulate this statement initiate discussion at your workplace form rank and file committees and win support for collective action to stop the spread of the pandemic contact the socialist equality group and the international workers alliance of rank and file committees we are eager to discuss with you the situation in your workplace and to assist you in organising the fight to end the pandemic originally published here on 4 february 2022 content sourced from scoop co nz

peter goodman your view our legislature is in session for an entire month unpaid my first suggestion for legislators is to pass the measure to study lengthening the session and paying legislators and staff currently we avert disaster because many if not most legislators are working their tails off all year in committee hearings and other work that prepares them for the actual one or two month session but that system tends to limit possible candidacies by folks who can t afford that kind of commitment without payment we re all instinctively skeptical about giving money to politicians but maybe we need to the voting rights act sb8 is important and should have an easier path with the straight ticket voting option removed watching various other states attack our democracy it d be nice to see new mexico first in facilitating democracy another study i d like to see concerns the effects of a small guaranteed annual income for poor folks so far evidence seems to indicate such programs help not only the beneficiaries but the surrounding community but the present draft of hm22 calls for a taskforce of representatives of community organizations working on behalf of low income communities and agencies and organizations working with those communities i d add an economist or two who does not work for a nonprofit that helps the poor and maybe even a businessperson folks who think this kind of program sounds like a waste of money won t be convinced by a study done by folks who already believe in it there are dozens of environmentally helpful bills i favor them but the words we ll be poor within three years should be on every wall in the roundhouse as big as chinese wall posters oil and gas provides a huge share of our economy and that industry is not only cyclical in the best of times but ultimately doomed further the federal pandemic assistance money contributing to our present temporary solvency ain t gonna happen every year i d temper my enthusiasm for all the good ideas and programs and recognize that we face some very tough choices water supply improving education children fighting global warming our court system and dozens of other important needs remain woefully underfunded most of these are musts not shoulds i m not a legislator let alone a financial guy but we need to improve state revenues the opportunity scholarship act sb140 providing for free college tuition and fees at any new mexico public or tribal college or university for residents maintaining a 2 5 gpa while working toward a degree is a great idea but is that a promise we can keep in down years i doubt the governor s hydrogen hub development act will truly benefit us or our environment it will more surely help supporters exxon nmoga and gallup s chamber of commerce none of them famous as committed environmentalists we must cap interest rates at a usurious 36 freeing poor folks from the absurd stratospheric rates that destroy their lives we should have pursued a state bank and taxing rich folks who if any ever do fly from the spaceport into space at 200k per ticket and in a drought that climate change is making worse we need to give our state engineer a long term budget reasonably calculated to deal with a host of severe problems including water studies infrastructure and lest we forget the texas v new mexico lawsuit in the supreme court paid or not i m glad i m not a state legislator las cruces resident peter goodman writes shoots pictures and occasionally practices law his blog at contains further information on this column more from peter goodman
