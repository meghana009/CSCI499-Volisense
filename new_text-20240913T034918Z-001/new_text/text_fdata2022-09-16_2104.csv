arthur sadoun has shaken up his top team at publicis groupe promoting four leaders to the directoire a new top tier of management as he wants the french agency group to be next century ready ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2026 sadoun who announced the shake up at the same time as the supervisory board in paris gave him a new four year mandate as global chairman and chief executive described the quartet as a new generation of leaders they are agathe bousquet president of publicis groupe france dave penski chief executive of publicis media u s carla serrano chief strategy officer of publicis groupe and nigel vaz chief executive of publicis sapient steve king below who has been coo since 2019 and has been widely regarded as sadoun s no 2 will leave the current top team known as the directoire and he takes a newly created role as chairman of publicis groupe europe king s decision to step back as coo and leave the directoire is a significant moment because the briton has been a key figure within the group for decades as ceo of zenithoptimedia and founding ceo of publicis media he first made his name as a founding member of zenith when saatchi saatchi separated media from its creative operations and set up the buying agency in a pioneering move in 1988 to leverage its trading power publicis groupe said maurice lévy the chair of the supervisory board and the other board members thanked steve king for the remarkable work throughout his career which began at saatchi saatchi and continued after the acquisition of the network by the groupe the board added his career is that of a great professional who has always had the success of clients and teams at heart while representing our values king who turned 63 in august will keep working full time and be a member of the management committee the next tier of management below the directoire he will continue to work for some major clients and bring his experience to the groupe s future talents in areas such as mentoring the company said big international regions such as king s new remit covering europe matter within publicis groupe sadoun added noting he has responsibility himself for north america the new age of commerce publicis said sadoun had picked the four new members of the directoire because they are highly qualified individuals who have demonstrated great mastery of operations in their role he explained the rationale for the new changes in a video to staff when he became ceo in 2017 his focus was on digital transformation for clients and shifting to a platform organisation rather than being siloed with creative media technology and data being separate that move has paid off he said as publicis groupe has been performing strongly with 10 revenue growth in 2021 and again in h1 2022 as the group has bounced back above pre pandemic levels now publicis needs to evolve again for what he called the new age of commerce as areas such as ecommerce and retail media become more central to how clients run their businesses most of our industry is still relegating commerce to a specialism a siloed capability just like everyone did wrongly with digital years ago sadoun said this is a mistake we won t make michel alain proch cfo and anne gabrielle hellebronner secretary general remain on a wider directoire along with members of the directoire which is responsible for corporate and administrative functions the management board which includes about 18 leaders operates below the directoire and directoire the shake up is arguably the biggest management change at publicis groupe since 2014 when the company said lévy would step down as ceo in 2017 after 30 years and previously created a directoire sadoun and king were both appointed to the directoire in 2014 and sadoun later went on to succeed lévy as ceo lévy welcomed sadoun s new mandate as ceo and said the directoire was a formula that has proven its worth in the past and the creation of the new management line up has been the subject of very thorough work this team will be in charge of operationalising the power of one in an even deeper broader and more demanding way with the integration of the e commerce functions now inseparable from all dimensions of marketing and business transformation levy said publicis whose main pr firm in the u s is msl is the world s second largest agency group with about 90 000 employees sadoun told staff as part of his presentation that the group has overtaken wpp and closed the gap on omnicom in terms of stock market capitalization and was ahead of both in terms of organic growth since 2019 this story first appeared on campaignlive co uk

at first glance the inflation reduction act would seem like a financial problem for the u s oil and gas industry the fine print suggests otherwise the bill signed into law by president joe biden last month imposes a new minimum tax on high earning companies and a tax on corporations that buy back shares of their own stock it came just weeks after top u s oil producers reported record earnings and billions in share purchases a funny thing happened on the way to the president s desk though lawmakers shaved off the tax provision s rough edges and added a couple of breaks that will allow oil producers to benefit potentially from one of the industry s worst ever years it gives them a gimme for one year said trey cowan an oil and gas analyst at the institute for energy economics and financial analysis which aims to accelerate an energy transition the upshot is that some companies that lost money during the oil price crash of 2020 will be able to use those losses to ease their tax liability in 2022 when the industry has reported record profits it s unclear how many companies will benefit because many of them will pay their taxes under the conventional tax law rather than the inflation reduction act s minimum tax provision the new minimum tax system requires corporations to pay their federal taxes based on their financial statement income sometimes called book income companies that earn more than 1 billion will either have to pay their standard tax bill or 15 percent of their book income whichever is greater according to the text of the law but the law allows companies to take a couple well known tax breaks when calculating their minimum tax payments including one that former president donald trump used in his real estate business and it also calculates the 1 billion earnings threshold based on a three year average which could significantly cut oil companies liabilities for 2022 companies will be able to use a maneuver called the net operating loss carryover when they calculate their bills under the minimum tax the loophole allows a company that has a loss in one year to carry the loss into a future year and reduce its taxable income by the same amount those types of carryovers have been used for decades in the energy industry and other businesses trump declared a net operating loss from his casinos and other businesses of 916 million for 1995 which would have been enough to offset 50 million in income for the next 18 years the new york times reported the inflation reduction act will allow companies to carry forward their book income losses starting at the end of 2019 and offset up to 80 percent of their company s minimum tax bill in any given year said wes poole americas oil and gas tax leader at the consulting firm ey the law also allows a couple of other important tax breaks when calculating what a company owes under the minimum tax provision companies can deduct the depreciation of their assets and certain foreign taxes both of which are important to the oil industry it s unclear how much the industry could carry forward in offsets but it s potentially a large amount collectively a sample of 36 top oil and gas producers lost 91 billion in 2020 according to research cowan provided companies that wind up paying the minimum tax can also use any losses from 2020 to smooth out their tax bills for the next two years under the law s averaging clause more dividends the new tax setup may leave the oil industry in a good position financially even as questions remain about its business model and long term decarbonization trends analysts predict that major u s producers are headed for a lengthy period of high profits and they ve committed themselves to stock buybacks as a way to attract and keep investors oil and gas companies will have to pay more taxes in some cases but the overall impact of the tax changes may not be drastic said matthew gardner a senior fellow at the institute on taxation and economic policy it s going to be an important boost for the federal government but it s not going to transform the way oil and gas companies or any companies experience the corporate tax system gardner said of the minimum tax system the tax on share buybacks will require companies to pay 1 percent of the amount they use to buy back their own stock buybacks are popular with investors because they can help prop up a company s stock price a higher stock price also benefits the top managers at a lot of companies who may see significant compensation in shares and options to buy shares exxon mobil corp for instance earned 17 9 billion in the second quarter of this year and spent nearly 3 billion during the same period buying back shares of its stock energywire aug 1 buybacks have been criticized by environmental groups and activist investors who say it diverts companies resources at a time when they should be investing in new forms of energy the tax could force companies to move away from buybacks poole said companies may pivot to pay more dividends as a way to deploy capital he said in an email oil industry reaction to the inflation reduction act s tax provisions has been mixed exxon is opposed to any taxes that make us businesses less competitive spokesperson casey norton said in an email the american petroleum institute a major industry trade group said the taxes will increase energy costs at a time when consumers are paying higher prices for gasoline and diesel fuel other oil and gas companies including conocophillips and occidental petroleum corp have said that the minimum tax won t affect them because they re already paying substantial taxes under the current system and they re intrigued by other provisions of the law which would provide billions of dollars in incentives for technology and fuels that they re already working on everything from biofuels to capturing carbon dioxide energywire aug 5 the interplay between the tax implications and the incentives for clean energy will be important because it ll shape how the industry spends a projected gush of profits over the next few years according to the consulting firm deloitte the industry s exploration and production companies could produce 1 5 trillion in surplus cash by 2030 the firm said in a report last month that s enough to meet the industry s core goals of paying down debt rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks and still invest in the energy transition according to the report to us the big question is where will they invest how will they move into clean energy said jeff wright who leads the u s oil gas and chemical tax practice at deloitte

heading out the door read this article on the outside app available now on ios devices for members download the app on the eve of its 50th anniversary patagonia one of the nation s most innovative and ethical corporations is under new ownership the outdoor apparel maker founded in 1973 by yvon chouinard and run by the chouinard family since its inception announced today that the company has restructured with the chouinards ceding control to two private entities a trust that owns all of patagonia s voting stock and a nonprofit called the holdfast collective that owns all nonvoting stock and oversees patagonia s environmental work which is set to expand sharply in other words one of the most powerful businessmen in the world just voluntarily gave away his company and he did it primarily to fight climate change effective immediately 100 percent of patagonia s earnings not reinvested in the business will be distributed to the holdfast collective which will use the money to help slow the advance of the climate crisis the company has for years donated 1 percent of its sales to environmental causes but this shift is poised to increase that figure dramatically the charitable outlay of the new company will be roughly 100 million a year yvon chouinard has owned patagonia since he founded the company in 1973 photo campbell brewer ryan gellert the company s current ceo will remain in place as chief executive and the chouinard family will maintain heavy involvement sitting on the company s board guiding the trust that owns the voting stock and overseeing the philanthropic efforts of the holdfast collective the company s headquarters will remain in ventura california creating a new corporate model chouinard 83 started planning the corporate restructuring two years ago searching for a way to grow the company s positive impact on the environment and increasingly queasy about his status as a billionaire he began exploring options for divesting himself from the business he founded as a tiny mom and pop selling climbing gear and grew into a global brand valued at an estimated 3 billion his thinking followed the path he has famously trod for years bucking conventional corporate trends and redefining what entrepreneurs are capable of when they wield their businesses as social tools one option was to sell patagonia and donate all the money he wrote in a letter published today but we couldn t be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed another path was to take the company public what a disaster that would have been even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short term gain at the expense of long term vitality and responsibility truth be told there were no good options available so we created our own yvon chouinard in 1972 a year before he founded patagonia photo tom frost gellert and a small team of patagonia executives were tasked with creating the new business model under the cover of a project code name chacabuco a nod to a fishing location in chile they began brainstorming solutions in mid 2020 other than selling the company or taking it public proposals included transforming it into a nonprofit or a consumer owned co op like rei eventually they landed on the current plan two years ago the chouinard family challenged a few of us to develop a new structure with two central goals gellert wrote in a release today they wanted us to both protect the purpose of the business and immediately and perpetually release more funding to fight the environmental crisis we believe this new structure delivers on both the restructuring required the chouinard family yvon his wife malinda and their children claire and fletcher to donate all their company shares to the new trust officially called the patagonia purpose trust which will cost them about 17 5 million in gift taxes as for the holdfast collective it s structured as a 501 c 4 which the company said it chose for the flexibility of the legal entity 501 c 4 s are allowed to make unlimited donations to political causes meaning the chouinards get no tax benefit for money that flows to the nonprofit patagonia s head of communications and public policy corley kenna said to expect the holdfast collective to distribute its funds in wide and varied ways in grants to organizations addressing the root causes of the climate crisis investments in land and water protection and support for stronger environmental policy for a hint at the type of aggressive advocacy patagonia is likely to go after kenna urged people to remember this is the brand that called on its community to vote the assholes out during the trump administration and joined with grassroots groups in utah to sue the same administration for its shrinking of bears ears national monument patagonia s ventura campus where the company has been headquartered since its founding photo kyle sparks in the end the corporate restructuring especially the transfer of all nonvoting stock to a nonprofit was only possible because patagonia doesn t offer employee stock options in his book the responsible company published a decade ago chouinard outlined his concerns about employee and public ownership arguing that wider control of the company s shares might have prevented a change like the one announced today are concerned that with shares more broadly distributed the company would become overly cautious about undertaking risks in the pursuit of its environmental goals chouinard wrote in 2012 so that patagonia can continue to push back the boundaries of what business considers possible are willing to undertake risks that might give pause to broader ownership even of employees committed to reducing environmental impact announcing the changes the company shared the news with employees in a virtual town hall this morning in its announcement patagonia pointed out that chouinard is in good health but that he wanted to have a plan in place for the future of the company and the future of the planet according to kristine mcdivitt tompkins a board member the current system of capitalism has made its gains at an enormous cost wrote charles conn patagonia s board chair in a release today the world is literally on fire companies that create the next model of capitalism through deep commitment to purpose will attract more investment better employees and deeper customer loyalty they are the future of business if we want to build a better world and that future starts with what yvon is doing now true to its talent for attractively marketing its environmental efforts patagonia has devised a pair of slogans that sum up the company s retooled structure instead of going public the brand has gone purpose and because the patagonia purpose trust is the business s controlling shareholder and must adhere to the company s environmental mission the brand now claims that earth is its only shareholder the claim may be less exaggerated than it sounds the patagonia purpose trust has no individual beneficiaries and the stock it controls can never be sold meaning according to deputy general counsel greg curtis there is no financial incentive or structural opportunity for any drift in this trust s purpose an unnamed independent protector has also been designated to monitor and enforce the mission of the trust it s been a half century since we began our experiment in responsible business chouinard wrote today addressing the company s roughly 3 500 employees if we have any hope of a thriving planet 50 years from now it demands all of us doing all we can with the resources we have as the business leader i never wanted to be i am doing my part instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth we are using the wealth patagonia creates to protect the source we re making earth our only shareholder i am dead serious about saving this planet

mcm fans and homeowners today seem to love all things modern like the vintage knoll chairs above more than ever it was springtime 1999 in palm springs and the desert was heating up as summer was approaching something else was heating up too only chris menrad didn t know it menrad a stock trader with an eye for good design stumbled upon a butterfly roofed house in palm springs and had to have it i just liked the roofline he recalls it looked like the fins of a cadillac about the twin palms neighborhood which was filled with such houses he thought it s a time warp it s exactly what i want menrad had no idea who built or designed the houses his real estate agent told him there s no rush stuff doesn t sell here it just sits and sits and sits today menrad who has become a real estate broker himself in the desert smiles at the memory he knows all about the history of twin palms of architect bill krisel and of the homes developer the alexanders so does everyone else the mid century modern homes that dot the coachella valley northern california and the los angeles region are hot today buyers they all know what are and they all want them menrad says recalling that he bought his home just before the great mid century modern revival hit the then down at its heels desert town it was a zeitgeist that was changing at the moment he says from the 1940s through the mid 70s glass walled modern homes were a growing part of the american suburban landscape along with the low slung chairs and abstract space age lighting fixtures that adorned them then gradually even unnoticeably to some they were not but bill krisel noticed when i was doing those palm springs houses he recalled they were quite different than other tract houses a lot of builders from all over wanted what i was doing pretty soon along came what we called cinderella houses with picket fences peaked roofs and fairytale entrances my builder clients wanted me to do those and i didn t know how to do those and i didn t want to do those so i stopped doing tracts i couldn t understand it i was so upset things were going backwards
canva 3 home improvement projects with the highest payoff before and after covid 19 bright kitchen with white cabinets and wood countertops that kitchen remodeling you ve been saving for it may not add as much value to your home today as it would have three years ago that s because generally returns on investment in home improvement projects are lower now than pre pandemic but there are still several upgrades including a kitchen remodel that can help homeowners recoup a majority of their investment angi analyzed data from zonda media s remodeling 2022 cost vs value report to find the three projects that saw the highest percentage of their costs recouped the analysis compares cost and return on investment for those projects in 2019 and 2022 to see the status before covid 19 and in its wake honing in on the 10 largest cities in the u s for 2022 the three projects with the highest cost recouped are garage door replacements manufactured stone veneer and minor midrange kitchen remodels overall home renovation costs have been steadily increasing overall the past two years as global supply chains were thrown into disarray by pandemic era regulations and public health precautions labor has also become an increasingly expensive part of construction and home renovation work due to a national shortage of skilled workers in building trades employers face pressure to increase wages in order to attract the needed workers resulting in a larger bill at the end of the day for consumers the u s is projected to have a shortage of 650 000 construction workers over the remainder of 2022 according to a february 2022 report from associated builders and contractors but rising costs haven t stopped americans from upgrading their homes home remodeling activity in the u s has been heating up since the end of 2020 and is just now starting to moderate according to harvard university s joint center for housing studies one thing to keep in mind if you are planning a new project demand for building materials has grown over the past year and as a result manufacturers are increasing materials prices prices have gone up 10 to 15 this year and many parts of the country are experiencing long delivery times according to an angi industry analysis if you re planning a building project start as early as possible in the season prepare for potential price fluctuations and allow extra time to order materials angi garage doors maintain the highest return on investment diverging bar chart showing the percentage point change in roi for garage door replacements with a text annotation of the 2022 roi if you can get your hands on one a brand new garage door will provide the best return on investment compared to any other project according to remodeling s latest annual report still the return on investment a homeowner will see from replacing their garage door has been decreasing over the last three years in most major cities garage doors are a home component that even major home builders are having a hard time reliably obtaining yes construction material prices skyrocketed workers are tough to find and other supply chain bottlenecks have plagued homebuilders this past year but garage doors specifically emerged in 2022 as the number one sourcing challenge for builders according to john burns real estate consulting experts point to disruptions including hurricanes and winter 2021 s texas freeze that have stifled plastic production at oil refineries along the u s gulf coast hurricane season this year could set off another slew of supply chain disruptions globally steel is also in limited stock due to supply chain troubles and a persistent backlog generated from high demand in recent years according to the world steel association angi garage doors are also a relatively low cost project dot plot showing the cost of a garage door replacement in 2019 and 2022 in 10 different cities and nationally a new garage door costs around 4 041 on average in 2022 12 or 430 more expensive on average than in 2019 still it s one of the more affordable renovation projects homeowners can undertake in major texas cities the cost of a garage door has risen faster than the national average angi the returns on manufactured stone veneer are down across most major cities diverging bar chart showing the percentage point change in roi for manufactured stone veneer with a text annotation of the 2022 roi the return on investment for this project increased from its pre pandemic payoff in phoenix san diego and new york where stone siding would have boosted home values pre pandemic in los angeles san jose philadelphia and dallas homeowners in those cities will have to settle for recouping the majority of money spent on it today angi manufactured stone veneer costs are up but remain on the lower end dot plot showing the cost of installing manufactured stone veneer in 2019 and 2022 in 10 different cities and nationally upgrading the siding on your home to include a stone veneer accent provides the second best return on your investment after replacing the garage door these projects have increased across the country by 24 on average since 2019 the average stone veneer siding renovation job will set a homeowner back 11 066 in 2022 angi kitchen remodels saw a sharper decline in value return diverging bar chart showing the percentage point change in roi for minor midrange kitchen remodels with a text annotation of the 2022 roi a major upscale kitchen remodeling project will only see half of its costs recouped in 2022 but a smaller project will return closer to 70 of your investment when you sell the house a minor kitchen remodel could include replacing large appliances with energy efficient models or updating trim and laminate countertops it does not include a full cabinetry refresh or projects of similar scale angi minor kitchen remodels are pricier and costs have increased by the highest margin dot plot showing the cost of a minor midrange kitchen remodel in 2019 and 2022 in 10 different cities and nationally the value of making minor updates to a kitchen has been on the decline since 2019 with the difficulties finding large appliances

boise idaho ap the idaho legislature can intervene in a lawsuit filed against idaho by the u s department of justice challenging recently passed state water laws but a federal judge has yet to rule on whether ranchers and the idaho farm bureau federation can take part the justice department in court documents filed this month challenged a request by ranchers to intervene contending ranchers have not shown that the legislature and state attorney general s office can t adequately represent their interests the justice department also contends that ranchers failed to identify any water rights or other property interests they claim to own that are part of the case the complex water law case has statewide ramifications for millions of acres of land in idaho administered by the forest service and bureau of land management it involves laws passed in the last five years that create a path through the idaho department of water resources for ranchers to take control of federal public land instream water rights through a state approved forfeiture procedure instream water is water that flows in streams as opposed to water that is diverted from streams the justice department in the lawsuit filed in june contends that the state s forfeiture procedure violates the u s constitution s supremacy clause that states federal law takes precedence over state law the justice department also said the state laws violate parts of the idaho constitution the idaho attorney general s office in court documents countered that the state laws are valid and enforceable chief u s district court judge david c nye at the beginning of september granted the legislature s unopposed request to intervene he wrote that the legislature has significant protectable interests relating to this action and that existing parties do not adequately represent their interests nye in that order also noted that ranchers had significant protectable interests that are not adequately represented by the existing parties or the legislature but the time to challenge the ranchers request to intervene had not expired and the justice department then challenged the ranchers request it s not clear when the court will rule on whether ranchers can participate the complex water law case involves a nearly three decade effort by the snake river basin adjudication court that concluded in 2014 and determined ownership of some 160 000 water rights the case also involves a 2007 idaho supreme court ruling in favor of a rancher who sued the u s government over water rights idaho officials and ranchers have interpreted that ruling to mean the federal government can t maintain water rights because without cattle that graze the land and drink the water it does not put the water to beneficial use but the federal government contends it does put the water to a beneficial use because it issues grazing permits to ranchers that in turn graze livestock that drink the water the legislature in 2017 approved a change in state law that said a rancher with a grazing permit can t be considered an agent of the federal government state laws also possibly go beyond the 2007 ruling by the idaho supreme court the idaho department of water resources in information obtained by the idaho conservation league said there are nearly 18 000 stock water rights potentially at stake that were decided by the snake river basin adjudication of those 11 ranchers have filed 254 claims with the idaho department of water resources seeking to get control of water rights on federal grazing allotments from the federal government lawmakers capped the application fee at 100 so ranchers can file multiple claims for that amount

on august 4 the u s commodity futures trading commission cftc had withdrawn its no action letter i e permission to operate with respect to predictit an online prediction market operated by the university of wellington new zealand and ordered predictit to shut down its operations as of february 15 2023 this no action letter was issued in 2014 and allowed the university of wellington to operate a small scale not for profit market in futures or swaps event contracts for educational purposes without registration as a designated contract market foreign board of trade or swap execution facility i e an exchange and without registration of its operators mainly predictit s event contracts allowed participants to bet on the outcome of political elections for example predictit s contract was very accurate in predicting the win for donald trump in the 2016 u s presidential elections predictit was able to justify its social utility on the basis of the efficient market theory that financial markets operate on all available information and therefore are much more accurate than political polls predictit lists actively traded futures contracts on the results of the 2022 elections as well as the 2024 upcoming presidential nomination and election under the commodity exchange act cea the cftc is required to oversee and regulate operation of commodity derivative markets and particularly scrutinize event markets such as political elections results markets because these may not be in the public interest under the cea political events such as elections or congressional control results are considered commodities and the public trading of futures contracts on commodities may qualify as an exchange previously the cftc had already shut down a similar event market in 2012 however years before the cftc had issued a similar no action letter to the university of iowa to operate a prediction market for educational purposes which is still effective on august 26 the cftc further signaled that all political event contract markets are under enhanced scrutiny by posting for public comment kalshiex s proposed congressional control futures contract collectively the withdrawal of predictit s no action letter and the review of kalshiex s contract are indicative of the cftc s increased reluctance to allow the development of political prediction markets however soon the cftc will have to come up with more definitive guidance for political event contracts on september 9 several academics traders and a technology provider filed a suit in texas seeking a court order blocking the cftc s action as arbitrary and capricious and asking the court to allow all existing markets to resolve in an orderly manner past february 2023 this action is likely to force cftc s hand in making a definitive finding whether political events futures contracts are gambling and not in the u s public interest under cea 5c c 5 c

the pandemic of course forced an immediate embrace by most firms of remote workflow capabilities that had only emerged as fully capable a few years prior additional factors have also had a substantial impact including staffing challenges specific to the profession amplified concerns about diversity equity and inclusion dei issues the reshuffling of work life balance an increasing movement toward client accounting services significant tax and business legislation such as wayfair and automation issues the accounting profession continues to experience rapid evolution in the past five years a variety of factors have converged to dramatically change the nature of professionals careers in accounting firms of all sizes as well as tax practices corporate accounting and tax departments and even governmental entities and academic institutions is your firm a destination workplace if you ve experienced significant challenges with staffing particularly retention and recruiting it may mean your firm is missing some of the key factors that make a workplace enjoyable rewarding and challenging and that cause talented staff to want to join and stay with you it s about much more than compensation dozens of the profession s thought leaders recently met virtually as part of avalara s accounting meta influencers sessions they identified and discussed these and other critical issues facing the profession today and those shaping its future we re excited to address what it takes for a firm to become a true destination workplace said sona akmakjian cpa the global head of strategic accounting partnerships for avalara the panel discussion moderated by accounting today editor in chief dan hood initially identified the following staff focused challenges facing accounting firms declining pipeline of cpa accounting candidates career development opportunities compensation benefits e g parental leave flexibility including initiatives to support work life balance lack of interesting fulfilling work dei firm culture return to work hybrid work environments technology automation with impacts ranging from recruiting to staffing expectations around growth e g private equity funding streaming into accounting outsourcing offshoring hiring non accountants for specific work the thought leaders then focused their remaining discussion on three issues they see as having the most significant impact on firms of all sizes career development opportunities the declining pipeline of cpas and accounting candidates and the continuing return to office environments instead of uncoordinated individual home office settings for more than a decade accounting today has done a best firms to work for survey where we look at what it takes to be a workplace of choice said hood rick telberg founder and ceo of cpa trendlines noted that his group recently did research on the same topic we used the best places to work concept and ran it through something quantitative he said the result was that the research identified firms as leaders and laggards where leaders hit goals and laggards don t leaders in great places to work are more likely to work as a team not individually telberg said as a result they have a healthy work life balance low turnover fair and competitive compensation all of these are very much bottom line effects of being a good place to work compensation career development and partnership tracks in hood s survey they asked firm leaders why they thought people were leaving and one of the top responses was a lack of career development opportunities he said some of the best firms have gotten much better at providing mentorship and other opportunities to younger staff people don t quit their company they quit their boss or bosses said jennifer wilson partner and co founder of convergencecoaching it s because they don t think their boss cares about them or they don t think they want to grow and develop there they can t see a path blake oliver a cpa who is now ceo of earmark cpe related to wilson s comments i was a manager in public accounting but left that to go into tech he said and a big reason is because there wasn t a clear path to partnership in tech there s often a clear path here s stock options and a trajectory of where we re going and how you ll benefit too firms need defined measurable objectives for attaining partner status because it seems the tradition is just that partners vote every year and it s somewhat political in addition to the connection between employees and their bosses compensation does of course play a significant role while some firms may try to only pay about average the thought leaders agreed firms that want to be competitive and take a leading role need to be more competitive than average i ve always tried to pay 20 above the average for my market and recommend firms do that as well said randy johnston founder of the operational consulting firm nmgi and a nationally recognized technologist and speaker he noted that he s found many firms with high staff exit rates are compensating partners well but paying line team members very poorly part of the issue is that some accounting firms are still operating under an old model from when firms were relatively small and a partner was truly a partner said yvonne scott the ceo of cio concierge and a national speaker author and strategy consultant now with firms getting bigger and bigger there are many people at the bottom of the pyramid and few opportunities at the top a lot of young professionals look at it and say i don t want to invest 20 years and so they opt out and go somewhere with more opportunity to move up this is particularly so she said for women and minorities who may not see a lot of representation at the top and it feels like a political process with the trend in private equity firms investing and taking ownership interests in firms the topic of stock options for staff was also a point of interest while most firms haven t yet started to offer stock to junior staff that may be an option and i think that s where firms are starting to go said mark koziel cpa the president and ceo of allinial global amy vetter a cpa national speaker and business technologist noted that many staff don t necessarily want to be partner they ve looked at the partner level and despite the income they don t want the lifestyle and the overwork she said this results in some experienced staff deciding to stay only a few years at a firm then take a corporate job or one that offers better work life balance there are also professionals who don t want to be a partner but want to stay with the firm in a lower role said diane yetter president of yetter tax a sales tax consulting and tax technology firm there are great workers who don t want to move into leadership or even become a manager she said they are good specialists and workhorses and you don t want to lose them so your culture shouldn t be up or out which is what many firms have firms need to look at bonus and other incentives some leading firms have developed non partner tracks that let such professionals build a career they want at intraprisetechknowlogies a firm founded by donny shimamoto cpa they ve implemented a very flexible work environment we have amazing retention because of our culture and the way we work shimamoto said there is literally no overtime and we offer complete flex time so people sometimes work as little as 10 hours a week of course their pay is based on performance but they come and are a member of our team this helps a lot of parents spend as much time with their children as they want we don t just focus on pay the size of the firm matters too as far as what they re able to offer in larger firms you re going to have a lot more people who have the option of going down the partner track said dan luthi a partner at ignite spot outsourced accounting and a member of the intuit accountant council he noted that accounting grads have been told what to expect at large firms but not smaller ones in smaller firms there may only be one or two partners for the existence of the firm which changes the global culture of it they need to know that they likely won t become a partner at a firm that size he said these firms should look at options for extending equity outside of partnership for loyal productive staff but this needs to be clarified in these firms from an educational perspective san jose state university tax program professor annette nellen cpa said she sees many young professionals staying at their first firms for less than a year that s just kind of pointless because they don t get the experience that will carry them further in their career to help students prepare for the reality of the profession her department has introduced a capstone course focused on professional development it has various elements and includes how to make a one five and 10 year career plan and keeping it up to date she said peter wen co founder and ceo of tallyfor tax flow automation for cpa firms agreed that a more defined career track is appealing i left accounting because i saw a lot more opportunity in software and technology employees also want to do meaningful work and know that they re doing something for their clients that s where having the right technology can help said wen remember that one size fits one especially when it comes to employee hr said jennifer wilson the number one reason your staff stays with you is the relationship the rapport with the leader and that s unique to each staff member a one size fits all approach won t suffice is the pipeline a problem many professionals and thought leaders have noted a decreasing number of new accounting graduates and cpas is becoming one of the profession s greatest challenges a recent survey of firms also showed it s the top workforce concern unfortunately as hood noted it s not an area where individual firms can do much to fix the situation i m very passionate about this subject because i m a career changer said blake oliver i m a nontraditional cpa and didn t follow the traditional path of college then big firm then smaller firm or corporate instead he went back to college to get his accounting degree after being in another profession given the shortage we have we need to consider how do we make it easier for people who might want to change careers and come into accounting the state societies and aicpa are focusing on high school and college students which is the beginning of the pipeline but we are losing a lot of people in the middle of the pipeline too because the requirements make it challenging and the promise of deferred compensation as a partner may not ever happen gail perry a cpa and the editor in chief of cpa practice advisor said that when she first started in public accounting in illinois young professionals generally had to pass the exam before being hired at a firm then you had to put in three years at a firm before you could get the cpa credential and get licensed she said so firms were providing a place for these people to get licensed in exchange for working their butts off for three years being on a partner path or not wasn t really the issue according to perry now that people don t need those three years they don t have to put in that time unless they want to and they have different expectations for that job this ties into the staff retention issue too noted amy vetter a major current reason staff quit is because they re overwhelmed and don t see relief coming via the pipeline of new cpas she said they see a limited bench strength and the workload isn t going to be fixed anytime soon shayna chapman principal of shaynaco a firm in southern ohio said she has a different perspective because of the rural setting of her practice there are a lot of small firms across the country that are in small rural communities she said one of the keys to our pipeline is community colleges and junior business colleges but we re losing those in our communities and our local university doesn t even have accounting as a major donny shimamoto whose 12 person firm is in hawaii said they also have a limited field of degreed accountants and cpas in the area but his firm has brought in people from other fields with firms providing a broader array of business services it isn t necessary for everyone to be a cpa the nature of the work we re doing is different he said we re doing business transformation work and need cross disciplinary staff including hr and marketing as well as taxes bookkeeping etc the three cpas we have are the center point leading the holistic picture as cpas we bring the whole picture together attracting a more diverse talent pool into the field of accounting is also important to alleviating the pipeline issues several of the participants noted when i went into college i planned on majoring in finance i didn t even know what an accounting major was said nicole davis founder and ceo of the atlanta area firm butler davis the profession was doing a poor job of persuading and enticing diverse students but when i found the major in accounting i loved it public accounting is much more interesting because you don t have to be doing audits or taxes only but a broad range of things universities don t do a great job of explaining what different careers there are in accounting said diane yetter who is involved at her alma mater the university of kansas i m working on getting lined up for the fall a chance to bring in professionals to talk about alternative career paths in accounting the return to office is turning into a hybrid model another key focus of the group s discussion was on the phenomenon of the return to office after more than two years of adjusting workflows and work locations for staff as a result of the pandemic more firms are finding that returning to the pre pandemic model may not happen while the most severe disruptions occurred during the spring and summer of 2020 the flexible work environments have become more of the new norm according to dan hood a recent survey of financial professionals in multiple industries asked when they thought the majority of their staff would return to the office full time in other industries about 60 said they would be going with a hybrid model where a notable part of the staff work remotely on a permanent basis or at least regularly on certain days only about 50 of accounting firms said they were leaning in this direction but that s still a significant change accounting firms don t always need to be live and in person said yetter i ve been in a remote work setting for 12 years and as far back as 25 years ago i had managers who were remote it s completely doable while there are benefits at times to being in person you don t always need to be i ve been remote since 2014 and there s a cultural idea of what remote work looks like in traditional firms said gabrielle luoma founder and ceo of mod ventures an arizona based accounting and advisory services firm i ve seen some partners in firms who think that remote workers are really just the grunt workers and don t bring in new business or produce the relationship building with clients so we have to show the profession what it really does look like to have remote relationships i have clients across the country and most of our conversations are via video the size of the firm also makes a big difference said peter wen there s a small medium and large way of dealing with remote relationships he said having a local presence has long been a mainstay of how you get customers so the sales side may need to stay in person but there are so many benefits to being remote including bringing in clients and skilled staff from across the country closing out the conversation hood noted that firms that want to be a best place to work need to have management take an active role

updated washington reuters major u s railroads and unions secured a tentative deal on thursday after 20 hours of intense talks brokered by president joe biden s administration to avert a rail shutdown that could have hit food and fuel supplies across the country and beyond biden called the deal a big win for america and for tens of thousands of rail workers thanking business and labour the democratic president promised more worker company agreements in the future i m optimistic that we can do this in other fields as well biden said advertisement read also organics planting decisions still to be made in the midst of dryness in western canada and an organics market stuck in a standstill organic growers are making decisions on what to plant in the coming weeks chances are they may be dictated by their own rotations unions and management can work together for the benefit of everyone biden added if they accept the deal that was announced at about 5 a m workers whose pay had been frozen will win double digit increases and will be allowed to seek certain types of medical care without fear of being punished union leaders said the agreement includes an immediate 14 1 per cent wage rise the railroads said advertisement unions whose members bitterly rejected prior proposals will now vote on the agreement even if those votes fail a rail strike that could have happened as soon as a minute past midnight on friday has been averted for several weeks due to the standard language included in such a deal a person familiar with the negotiations said biden s labor secretary marty walsh hosted contract talks in washington that ran for 20 consecutive hours between unions representing 115 000 workers and railroads including union pacific bnsf csx norfolk southern and kansas city

soaring 10 per cent in the prior session oil futures fell about four per cent to a one week low diesel and gasoline futures also fell investors expected that a rail strike would have threatened coal supplies to power plants and boost demand for rival energy sources advertisement amtrak which runs passenger rail said it will resume normal service on friday after cancelling long distance trains in anticipation of a strike the impact of a shutdown also would have stretched beyond u s borders because trains link the u s to canada and mexico and provide vital connections to massive ships that ferry goods from around the globe negotiations between the companies and a dozen unions had stretched for more than two years leading biden to appoint an emergency board in july to help break the impasse biden personally called walsh and negotiators on wednesday evening to prod them toward a deal telling them once again to recognize the harm that a shutdown would have on families farmers and businesses according to a person aware of the negotiations advertisement national retail federation ceo matthew shay thanked biden s administration for intervening adding in a statement that his group is relieved and cautiously optimistic emily skor ceo of the biofuel trade group growth energy also praised the deal and noted that much of the country s ethanol moves by rail freight railroads had halted transportation of hazardous goods including chlorine for water purification and ammonia for fertilizer as well as shipments of refrigerated food and other goods that use rail and at least one other mode of transport their goal was to prevent cargo from being stranded in unsafe locations job cuts the railroad industry slashed almost 30 per cent of its workforce over the last six years cutting pay and other costs as they increased profits stock buybacks and dividends for investors profits at billionaire warren buffett s berkshire hathaway which owns bnsf rose 9 2 per cent in the

technology and cost cutting the result is that many industry workers are on call at all hours waiting to respond at short notice to work for days at a time the latest deal follows some earlier recommendations of the president s emergency mediators it includes a 24 per cent percent wage increase over a five year period from 2020 through 2024 as well as 1 000 lump sum payments in each of five years biden who has called himself the most union friendly president in history and attacked companies for raking in excessive profits praised a deal he said would give workers better pay improved working conditions and peace of mind around their health care costs the president is not yet out of the woods when it comes to supply chain labour issues some 22 000 union workers at 29 west coast

train shipments of grain fertilizer lumber produce and fuel will not come to a screeching halt on friday as a strike that could have idled freight and passenger trains across the state and the country seems to have been averted for now after some 20 hours of negotiations railroad leaders and unions announced a tentative agreement thursday morning that at the least paused a pending national rail strike that had the potential to shut down rail shipments across a variety of industry sectors and hobble already struggling supply chains iowa democrats said the proposed deal would provide better pay improved working conditions and peace of mind for railroad workers in the state around their health care costs echoing a statement from president joe biden announcing the tentative agreement early thursday morning u s sen chuck grassley r iowa meanwhile cautioned in a senate floor speech that there s no guarantee that union members who have been furious with employers for years over working conditions will ratify the agreement if they don t grassley said congress must step in and force railroad workers and companies to accept recommendations from a white house panel to avoid a strike that would affect millions of americans the alternative is unacceptable grassley said a railroad strike would plunge us back into the supply chain issues that have just now started to improve he said these trains carry the food we eat the gas for our tanks and the energy that heats our homes already i m hearing from grain elevators that they re having trouble transporting feed hazardous cargo such as the chlorine that cities need to purify drinking water stopped moving earlier this week due to the potential strike and amtrak canceled long distance passenger train routes that run on tracks owned maintained and dispatched by freight railroads but this is just the tip of the iceberg unless they agree to a long term deal grassley said the last thing we need is for grain shipments to grind to a halt right as farmers are trying to harvest their crops iowa corn and soybeans can t feed the world if they are stuck on the farm an official for one of the unions that represents represent engineers and conductors in iowa said railroad workers in the state had yet to see specifics of the tentative agreement but that workers were quietly optimistic the transportation division of the international association of sheet metal air rail and transportation workers or smart td has roughly 700 members in the state mainly train conductors and some engineers i m glad that they ve reached a voluntary tentative agreement before the deadline was reached aid christopher smith iowa state legislative director for smart td we hope that the agreement is good enough that membership can ratify a vote and go from there smith said he was hesitant to say too much about the agreement and the threat of a possible strike as negotiations continue u s freight railroad workers were close to striking over claims that grueling schedules strict on call policies and poor working conditions have been driving employees out of the industry over the past several years a major sticking point in the labor dispute between rail companies and the unions was the adoption of a points based attendance policy by some carrier those policies penalize workers up to termination for going to routine doctor s visits or attending to family emergencies conductors and engineers say that they can be on call for 14 consecutive days without a break and that they do not receive a single sick day paid or unpaid rail employees remained on the job throughout the pandemic often working mandatory overtime to compensate for staff cuts and departures but note they have gone without a raise for three years while rail companies saw record profits in 2021 and stock buybacks have boosted shareholder values the railroad and unions have been negotiating a new contract since 2019 smart td s smith also pointed to a paragraph in a report issued by a presidential emergency board appointed by biden to help the resolve the labor contract dispute between major freight railroads and unions the paragraph states the rail companies believe that capital investment and risk are the reasons for their profits not any contributions by labor it also says the carriers assert that since employees have been fairly and adequately paid for their efforts and do not share in the downside risks if the operations are less profitable then they have no claim to share in the upside either smith said the statement riled union membership that has worked through the pandemic and now works hard to maintain the railroad in the place it is that is still a troubling statement that we have to work to get past he said so hopefully this agreement is good and we can move forward smith said members were largely reserving judgment until they have a chance to see the exact wording and get briefed on the tentative agreement which could take a couple of days we quietly are remaining optimistic he said we have faith in our national bargaining team that if they re coming back saying they have something that s worthwhile to potentially ratify we re entrusting them to bring forward a good contract one pleasant hill iowa railroad worker with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen who did not wish to be identified said he was still processing and trying to understand the details of the proposed deal but that he heard from workers who were not pleased the worker said that if implemented the agreement still would contribute to attrition and health and safety problems and that it does not address current labor concerns needed to build a better functioning rail network and supply chain iowa democratic party chairman ross wilburn however called the tentative agreement an important win for our economy and iowans so the bottom line is that rail workers deserve a fair contract wilburn told reporters thursday noting his brother is a retired rail worker a fair contract and bargaining in good faith is critical but regardless of what happens this tentative agreement ensures that rail workers will get better pay improved working conditions and peace of mind around their health care costs iowa s lone democrat in congress u s rep cindy axne of west des moines applauded rail union leaders for reaching a tentative agreement on a new contract that will avoid a work stoppage it s disappointing that union leaders had to fight so hard for fundamental and reasonable demands such as unpaid time off so their members could visit the doctor or take care of loved ones without penalty axne said while this agreement still needs to be ratified i am optimistic this progress will keep our goods moving and give a raise and better working conditions for the men and women who work day in and day out to provide for their families and help iowa farmers and businesses get their goods to market caleb mccullough of the gazette lee des moines bureau contributed to this report

insights an inconvenient merge but semiconductor stocks could still be a good buy by sam reynolds chipmakers nvidia and amd which once provided the brains to ether mining farms worldwide are having a rough year their struggles are not entirely because of crypto yet ethereum s shift to proof of stake might provide an interesting opportunity for investors despite an exciting few moments where record setting exchange inflows of ether signaled a potential sell off ether traded flat in the hours following the merge and then dropped more than 9 at one point during the following u s trading day ethereum classic etc was recently up 1 as proof of work fans stage a protest vote with their trading accounts as a result of this graphics processing unit gpu prices are in free fall and data from analyst house john peddie research shows that channel supply distributors is bulging nvidia never a fan of crypto mining will always downplay things nvidia chief financial officer colette kress line is that the company has limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall gpu demand and is unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced cryptocurrency mining contributed to the decline in gaming demand perhaps these non answers have resulted from nvidia s settlement with the securities and exchange commission for failing to disclose that crypto mining was a major contributor to its 2018 revenue nvidia and crypto mining it would be reasonable to assume that nvidia s stock is being driven down because of the glut of gpus on the market but that s not entirely the case nvidia does not only sell gpus on the retail level but also to organizations using data centers and high performance computers that crunch large stacks of numbers for research purposes the ability of these chips to address massive amounts of information and make cpus more efficient through what s called parallel computing makes them a considerable asset worldwide thus data center is the company s largest segment china has been a large buyer of these data center chips during the last decade as the country s industries double down on artificial intelligence and its universities catch up to their american counterparts in research within these companies and universities data centers are nvidia s chips this demand is why nvidia s stock tumbled when washington announced an export ban on its most advanced ai chips to china alongside amd which also designs similar products nvidia said the new ban could mean the loss of up to 400 million in revenue amd didn t disclose its loss but it s expected to also be large this scenario has precedent in 2015 the u s department of commerce banned the export of intel s xeon chips used in data centers to some of china s largest universities including china s national university of defense technology which was at the time developing the world s fastest supercomputer the rationale given was that these universities were engaged in nuclear weapons research intel s stock was unaffected by the news in contrast nvidia s dropped nearly 10 on the news of its export ban compounding losses throughout the year as tech stocks have struggled nvidia has lost nearly half its value putting it back to where it was in october 2020 an overreaction could this all be an overreaction and the market acting irrationally maybe says one analyst we view the 8 sell off in the stock yesterday vs 2 sox as an overreaction and view the recent weakness as a particular buying opportunity jeffries analyst mark lipacis was quoted as saying lipacis notes that most of nvidia s business in china goes to tech giants not the government which would make it easier for the company to get an export license insulating its loss potential analysts polled by dow jones seem to agree that there s a value buy here 27 give it a buy rating 11 say it s best to hold and one says it s a sell the decline of mining has likely already been priced into the stock too as early as february

tracks owned by the freight railroads amtrak had already canceled a number of its long distance trains this week and said the rest of its long distance trains would stop thursday ahead of the strike deadline following the tentative agreement amtrak said it was working to quickly restore canceled trains and reaching out to impacted customers to accommodate on first available departures a strike by railroad workers is looming here s how it could impact you the five year deal retroactive to 2020 includes the 24 raises and 5 000 in bonuses that a presidential emergency board recommended this summer but railroads also agreed to ease their strict attendance policies to address some of the unions concerns about working conditions railroad workers will now be able to take unpaid days off for doctor s appointments without being penalized under railroad attendance rules previously workers would lose points under the attendance systems that the bnsf and union pacific railways had adopted and they could be disciplined if they lost all their points the unions that represent the conductors and engineers who drive the trains had pressed hard for changes in the attendance rules and they said this deal sets a precedent that they will be able to negotiate over those kinds of rules in the future but workers will still have to vote whether those changes are enough to approve the deal the threat of a shutdown had put biden in a delicate spot politically the democratic president believes unions built the middle class but he also knew a rail worker strike could damage the economy ahead of the midterms when majorities in both chambers of congress key governorships and scores of important state offices will be up for grabs that left him in the awkward position on wednesday he flew to detroit a stalwart of the labor movement to espouse the virtues of unionization while members of his administration went all out to keep talks going in washington between the railroads and unionized workers as the administration was trying to forge peace united auto workers local 598 member ryan buchalski introduced biden at the detroit auto show as the most union and labor friendly president in american history and someone who was kickin ass for the working class buchalski harked back to the pivotal sit down strikes by autoworkers in the 1930s in the speech that followed biden recognized that he wouldn t be in the white house without the support of unions such as the uaw and the international brotherhood of electrical workers saying autoworkers brung me to the dance but without a deal among the 12 unions in talks back in washington biden also knew that a stoppage could halt shipments of food and fuel at a cost of 2 billion a day far more was at stake than sick leave and salary bumps for 115 000 unionized railroad workers the ramifications could have extended to control of congress and to the shipping network that keeps factories rolling stocks the shelves of stores and stitches the u s together as an economic power white house press secretary karine jean pierre speaking aboard air force one as it jetted to detroit said a rail worker strike was an unacceptable outcome for our economy and the american people biden faced the same kind of predicament faced by theodore roosevelt in 1902 with coal and harry truman in 1952 with steel how do you balance the needs of labor and business in doing what s best for the nation railways were so important during world war i that woodrow wilson temporarily nationalized the industry to keep goods flowing and prevent strikes union activism has surged under biden as seen in a 56 increase in petitions for union representation with the national labor relations board so far this fiscal year with the economy still recovering from the supply chain disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic the president s goal was to keep all parties so a deal could be reached biden also knew a stoppage could worsen the dynamics that have contributed to soaring inflation and created a political headache for the party in power eddie vale a democratic political consultant and former afl cio communications aide said the white house pursued the correct approach at a perilous moment no one wants a railroad strike not the companies not the workers not the white house he said no one wants it this close to the election sensing political opportunity senate republicans moved wednesday to pass a law to impose contract terms on the unions and railroad companies to avoid a shutdown democrats who control both chambers in congress blocked it the economic impact of a potential strike was not lost on members of the business roundtable a washington based group that represents ceos it issued its quarterly outlook for the economy wednesday we ve been experiencing a lot of headwinds from supply chain problems since the pandemic started and those problems would be geometrically magnified josh bolten the group s ceo told reporters there are manufacturing plants around the country that likely have to shut down there are critical products to keep our water clean by 5 05 a m thursday it was clear that the hard work

lawflash us china auditing oversight agreement signals cooperation between nations but could lead to increased enforcement risk september 15 2022 due to a recent agreement between the public company accounting oversight board and chinese securities regulators many us exchange listed companies audited by accounting firms based in mainland china and hong kong may be able to continue trading on us exchanges preserving liquidity for investors and ongoing access to us capital markets however this agreement could lead to an increased enforcement risk through more regulatory inquiries in recent years securities regulators us congress and the public have expressed concern about ensuring that certain public companies those that trade on us exchanges while being domiciled outside the united states abide by the rigorous regulatory requirements intended to protect american investors recent attention has been directed at public companies and accounting firms based in the people s republic of china prc and hong kong where the public company accounting oversight board pcaob has historically been limited in its ability to ensure that audits of companies listed on us exchanges are being conducted in accordance with pcaob standards and other applicable regulatory requirements this is not a small subset of companies as of september 14 2022 there were 249 chinese companies whose securities trade on us exchanges with a total market cap of approximately 915 billion partially as a result and against the backdrop of an increasingly fraught us prc relationship congress enacted the holding foreign companies accountable act of 2020 hfcaa to restrict access to the us capital markets by foreign public companies whose financial statements are audited by accounting firms that the pcaob is unable to fully inspect due to interference by a foreign government a growing number of prc and hong kong based public companies appear wary of continued listing on us exchanges or have transitioned their primary listings to the hong kong stock exchange other such companies with a primary listing on a us exchange have chosen to try to avoid potential delisting pursuant to the hfcaa by switching to us based auditors on august 26 2022 the pcaob announced a statement of protocol agreement sop with the china securities regulatory commission and china s ministry of finance regarding cooperation in the oversight of pcaob registered public accounting firms in the prc and hong kong which could prove to be a monumental step forward in the cooperation between the pcaob and prc regulators us securities and exchange commission sec chair gary gensler said this agreement marks the first time we have received such detailed and specific commitments from china that they would allow pcaob inspections and investigations meeting u s standards if the sop is fully implemented and adhered to by prc authorities then many public companies audited by prc and hong kong based accounting firms may be able to avoid the trading prohibition on us exchanges that the hfcaa would otherwise impose and preserve liquidity for their investors and ongoing access to america s deep capital markets pcaob is newly empowered to ensure audit quality in prc and hong kong congress established the pcaob through the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 sox to provide oversight of the audits of public companies listed on us exchanges its authority includes the registration inspection and investigation of audit firms including firms located in foreign jurisdictions that are engaged to conduct audits of foreign companies listed on us exchanges with respect to accounting firms headquartered in foreign jurisdictions the pcaob typically enters into cooperative arrangements with foreign regulators and it works with foreign regulators to address any concerns regarding data protection state secrecy or other sensitive substantive concerns for jurisdictions other than the prc and hong kong the pcaob has been able to address foreign regulators concerns in a way that is compatible with its core mission in the prc and hong kong however the road to the sop has been a long one in 2013 the pcaob entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with prc authorities that was intended to establish a framework for future cooperation despite the mou the pcaob has repeatedly stated that it has received insufficient cooperation to conduct full inspections and investigations of audit firms in the prc and hong kong the new sop seeks to establish a method for the pcaob to conduct inspections of pcaob registered public accounting firms in the prc and hong kong as contemplated by sox specifically the sop includes assurances from prc authorities on issues that have historically hindered the pcaob s ability to conduct its inspections and investigations the pcaob has sole discretion to select the firms audit engagements and potential violations it inspects and investigates with neither consultation with nor input from prc authorities pcaob inspectors and investigators can view complete audit working papers without redaction and the pcaob can retain information as needed the pcaob has direct access to interview and take testimony from all personnel associated with the audits that the pcaob inspects or investigates the pcaob can transfer information to the sec and the sec can use the information for all sec purposes including administrative or civil enforcement actions pcaob inspectors will begin their on site inspections in mid september 2022 which would include access to all necessary audit working papers by the end of 2022 the pcaob must determine whether it can complete inspections and investigations of public accounting firms headquartered in the prc and hong kong as required by sox and thus reassess whether such public accounting firms continue to present the concerns that the hfcaa was intended to address increased number of regulatory investigations and possible enforcement actions likely the sop is a significant sign of potential cross border cooperation as part of the pcaob s work to ensure that investors in public companies can rely on quality audits it will investigate the competency and conduct of accounting firms and professionals in the prc and hong kong the pcaob has settled disciplinary orders with accountants and accounting firms around the world based on information learned during inspections pcaob inspectors and investigators may also determine that there is reason for the sec and or the us department of justice doj to investigate not only the accounting firms over which the pcaob has jurisdiction but also the public companies whose audits the pcaob will now be able to thoroughly inspect if the pcaob inspections uncover material compliance issues enforcement actions by the sec and doj could result from pcaob referrals auditor working papers and an auditor s record of the accounting judgments made by the public company that could be memorialized in those working papers may also reveal possible accounting irregularities in a public company s financial statements and result in additional regulatory scrutiny or action over the last 15 years multiple prc companies have been subjected to enforcement actions and investigations by regulators relating to accounting issues these past issues may fuel ongoing skepticism from us regulators toward prc and hong kong based public companies thus an increasing number of investigations is likely especially given the emphasis on enforcement at both the doj and the sec indeed enforcement is an essential part of the mission statement of both organizations and the number of prc and hong kong based public companies whose accounting firms audits will now be subject to scrutiny such investigations can lead not only to enforcement actions but often are followed by securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits if a public company s auditor is subject to pcaob sanctions or the company is made aware of significant concerns about its auditor s quality control standards then the public company may want to consider conducting thorough internal investigations to address possible compliance shortfalls while regulators assess remediation in their enforcement decisions even if these investigations do not lead to enforcement actions prc and hong kong based us public companies and their executives should be prepared for the time expense and scrutiny of a potential us regulatory inquiry key takeaways and suggestions the sop is a breakthrough in cooperation between the two nations and should allow prc and hong kong based us public companies to avoid delisting pursuant to the hfcaa despite the extremely positive nature of this aspect of the sop for these companies the level of pcaob access that the sop entails warrants preparation by prc and hong kong based auditors and public companies for increased scrutiny and possible enforcement risk auditor considerations from the auditors perspective if actions by prc authorities match their commitment under the sop pcaob chair erica y williams has noted that the agreement at present is merely on paper the pcaob s improved access may require additional preparation and planning if an issuer chooses to engage a us based accounting firm that newly engaged firm will be expected to obtain prior year working papers and should still make inquiries of the predecessor accounting firm about certain matters including among other things integrity management disagreements audit committee communications unusual or significant transactions and the reason for the change in auditors on the other hand issuers who maintain non us based accounting firms should recognize that the firm s audit staff likely has not previously been subject to full pcaob inspections and investigations thus preparation for an inspection is advisable and could include coordination with us affiliates or secondments by us audit partners familiar with the pcaob s process to select and perform its inspections such as the level of engagement necessary from audit partners with inspectors and the types of informational requests made to audit personnel among other things these firms must ensure that their personnel cooperate with the pcaob inspectors and make all requested working papers available to them because the pcaob requires and takes into consideration cooperation during its inspections and investigations in addition the pcaob has signaled that it may seek to conduct inspections of prior years audits given the restrictions that it faced prior to the new sop as such prc and hong kong based accounting firms should be prepared for inspections of prior year audits and requests for accompanying working papers by the pcaob public company considerations from a public company s perspective pcaob inspections under the sop may result in regulatory and or disciplinary actions being brought against an accounting firm that the public company engaged and could result in heightened scrutiny of its financial statements and other public disclosures proactive engagement of international legal counsel is important to assist public companies when addressing concerns raised about its auditor and the quality of the audit performed as a result of pcaob inspections including seeking guidance in the event that the inspection results in a referral to the sec or doj and counseling on whether to self report issues to regulators counsel should be well versed in us securities laws and enforcement practices and trends but also have a significant presence in the prc and hong kong that informs a robust understanding of the business and legal considerations facing prc and hong kong based public companies in addition public companies should pay particular attention to three areas that remain a focus of sec and doj enforcement ensuring a robust set of internal controls and regularly confirming compliance with them maintaining a culture of compliance which includes among many other things open honest and fulsome communication and coordination with external auditors maintaining and regularly ensuring the maintenance of books and records that accurately and completely reflect the company s financial information finally prc and hong kong based companies should also be aware that the sec and doj like the pcaob expect and take into consideration cooperation if prc and hong kong based auditors and us exchange listed public companies proactively take steps to address the potential issues discussed they may be able to significantly limit the discomfort associated with a us regulatory inquiry

patagonia founder gives company away to environmental trusts gene j puskar ap outdoor gear company patagonia says the earth is now our only shareholder after transferring the company s ownership from founder yvon chouinard and his family to two nonprofits established to fight climate change in a letter posted on the 50 year old company s website wednesday night chouinard said patagonia would transfer 100 of its voting stock to the patagonia purpose trust created to uphold the values of the company long known for its environmental activism all of its nonvoting stock will go to the holdfast collective a nonprofit dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature while we re doing our best to address the environmental crisis it s not enough chouinard wrote we needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company s values intact patagonia estimates that after reinvesting some profits back into the company about 100 million annually will be distributed to the holdfast collective as a dividend depending on the health of the business grace chiang nicolette the center for effective philanthropy s vice president of programming and external relations said this unusual move by the chouinard family may become a blueprint for company founders looking to donate their businesses to causes important to them business owners are often faced with fraught decisions on the future of their company when it s time to sell said nicolette who also co hosts the giving done right podcast the very wealthy are also faced with the fact that their net worths are growing faster than they can conceive of giving it away this plan makes the company s social impact its guiding principle and i think we re going to see more donors pursuing this approach chouinard said other options for the ventura california company to dedicate itself to protecting the planet selling the company and donating the proceeds or taking the company public were not viable for patagonia s ultimate goals instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth for investors we ll use the wealth patagonia creates to protect the source of all wealth chouinard wrote chuck collins the institute for policy studies director of the program on inequality and the common good said chouinard s actions reflect a personal connection to the environmental crisis and a desire to back up his beliefs with his wealth it shows that somebody who has substantial wealth is responding with the kind of scale needed to address the problem he said he s working with the tools that he s got and it s a pretty good response patagonia ceo ryan gellert said in a statement that the chouinards challenged him and others at the company to develop a new ownership structure they wanted us to both protect the purpose of the business and immediately and perpetually release more funding to fight the environmental crisis gellert wrote we believe this new structure delivers on both and we hope it will inspire a new way of doing business that puts people and planet first brian mittendorf a professor of accounting at ohio state university who focuses on nonprofit organizations and their financial statements said the new patagonia structure is similar to the one paul newman created for his salad dressing company newman s own the profits from the business go into the newman s own foundation which donates to nonprofits supporting children facing adversity the difference is that the holdfast collective is organized as a 501 c 4 corporation according to the new york times which first reported the ownership change that allows it to lobby politicians which a public benefit charity like newman s own foundation is not allowed to do what i don t think is getting enough attention here is that the tax advantages of choosing a donation to a charity over a social welfare organization just aren t that pronounced in this particular case said mittendorf he noted that the gift tax the chouinards will pay is on their initial investment in patagonia not on its current worth estimated at 3 billion i kind of just view it as a desire to retain control over the company while ensuring that the resources that the company generates are used for a particular goal he said patagonia makes outdoor clothing gear and accessories for everything from skiing to climbing and camping the company said it will continue its previous charitable donations including donating 1 of its sales each year to grassroots activists and remaining a b corp a designation for companies that prioritize social and environmental standards as well as profits chouinard said he never wanted to be a businessman and started patagonia as a craftsman making climbing gear for himself and his friends

things nvidia chief financial officer colette kress line is that the company has limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall gpu demand and is unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced cryptocurrency mining contributed to the decline in gaming demand perhaps these non answers have resulted from nvidia s settlement with the securities and exchange commission for failing

industries double down on artificial intelligence and its universities catch up to their american counterparts in research within these companies and universities data centers are nvidia s chips this demand is why nvidia s stock tumbled when washington announced an export ban on its most advanced ai chips to china alongside amd which also designs similar products nvidia said the new ban could mean the loss of up to 400 million in revenue amd didn t disclose its loss but it s expected to also be large this scenario has precedent in 2015 the u s department of commerce banned the export of intel s

ncr corporation nyse ncr a leading enterprise technology provider to banks retailers and restaurants today announced its board of directors has unanimously approved a plan to separate ncr into two independent publicly traded companies one focused on digital commerce the other on atms the separation is intended to be structured in a tax free manner and is targeted for the end of 2023 it has become clear that ncr has the opportunity to unlock value for our shareholders by separating our digital commerce business and our atm business we have made significant strides over the past four years in creating a leading software as a service business while continuing to strengthen and grow the atm business by creating two best in class independent companies we should be able to accelerate the pace of transformation by enabling each to execute its own growth strategies and better capture the value creation opportunities ahead said frank r martire executive chairman ncr board of directors throughout the strategic review process we received material interest in a whole company sale of ncr as well as interest in various individual segments of our business in recent days it has become increasingly clear to the board that given the state of current financing markets we cannot deliver a whole company transaction that reflects an appropriate and acceptable value for ncr to our shareholders the digital commerce company will be a growth business positioned to leverage ncr s software led model to continue transforming connecting and running global retail hospitality and digital banking it will maximize common solutions to drive innovation and boost operational efficiency the company will also reinvest in the business to accelerate growth and recurring revenue the atm company will be a cash generative business positioned to focus on delivering atm as a service to a large installed customer base across banks and retailers it will build on ncr s leadership in self service banking and atm networks to meet global demand for atm access and leverage new atm transaction types including digital currency solutions to drive market growth the company will also continue shifting to a highly recurring revenue model to drive stable cash flow and capital returns to shareholders this announcement is the right next step in ncr s transformation the separation would create two strong companies at scale each with distinctive business goals and capital structures and allocation as well as increased flexibility to innovate said michael d hayford ceo of ncr each company can simplify its operations and focus on what it does best and because they will have different growth profiles and economic models separating them will also provide investors with greater transparency and a better ability to value each of the businesses and importantly we believe this approach will put us in the best position to drive the most competitive products and solutions for our customers the separation transaction will follow the satisfaction of customary conditions including effectiveness of appropriate filings with the u s securities and exchange commission and the completion of audited financials ncr will host a conference call to discuss the creation of two independent companies on friday september 16 at 8 30 a m et a webcast and related presentation providing additional clarity on the separation process and the financial characteristics of each business will be available at the conference call will be archived and available on the same site shortly after the call is

constipated scorpions love at first sight inspire ig nobels file audience members toss paper airplanes during the ig nobel awards ceremony at harvard university in cambridge mass sept 12 2019 the 32nd annual ig nobel prize ceremony on thursday sept 15 2022 was for the third year in a row a prerecorded affair because of the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic ap photo elise amendola file boston ap the sex lives of constipated scorpions cute ducklings with an innate sense of physics and a life size rubber moose may not appear to have much in common but they all inspired the winners of this year s ig nobels the prize for comical scientific achievement held less than a month before the actual nobel prizes are announced thursday s 32nd annual ig nobel prize ceremony was for the third year in a row a prerecorded affair webcast on the annals of improbable research magazine s website the winners honored in 10 categories also included scientists who found that when people on a blind date are attracted to each other their heart rates synchronize and researchers who looked at why legal documents can be so utterly baffling even to lawyers themselves even though the ceremony was prerecorded it retained much of the fun of the live event usually held at harvard university as has been an ig nobel tradition real nobel laureates handed out the prizes using a bit of video trickery the nobel laureates handed the prize off screen while the winners reached out and brought a prize they had been sent and self assembled into view winners also received a virtually worthless zimbabwean 10 trillion bill curiosity ig nited learn more about some of the winners get your ducks in a row science is fun my sort of a tagline is you re not doing science if you re not having fun said frank fish a biology professor at west chester university in pennsylvania who shared the physics ig nobel for studying why ducklings follow their mothers in single file formation it s about energy conservation the ducklings are drafting much like stock cars cyclists and runners do in a race he said it all has to do with the flow that occurs behind that leading organism and the way that moving in formation can actually be an energetic benefit said the appropriately named fish whose specialty is studying how animals swim he shared the prize with researchers at the university of strathclyde in glasgow scotland who found that the ducklings actually surfed in their mother s wake that syncing feeling eliska prochazkova s personal experiences inspired her research on dating that earned her and colleagues the cardiology ig nobel she had no problems finding her apparent perfect match on dating apps yet she often found there was no spark when they met face to face so she set people up on blind dates in real social settings measured their physiological reactions and found that the heart rates of people attracted to each other synchronized so is her work evidence of love at first sight it really depends on how you define love prochazkova a researcher at leiden university in the netherlands said in an email what we found in our research was that people were able to decide whether they want to date their partner very quickly within the first two seconds of the date the participants made a very complex idea about the human sitting in front of them a cruel sting solimary garcía hernández and glauco machado of the university of são paulo in brazil won the biology ig nobel for studying whether constipation ruins a scorpion s sex life scorpions can detach a body part to escape a predator a process called autotomy but when they lose their tails they also lose the last portion of the digestive tract which leads to constipation and eventually death they wrote in the journal integrated zoology the long term decrease in the locomotor performance of autotomized males may impair mate searching they wrote that s a moose dummy magnus gers won the safety engineering ig nobel for making a moose crash test dummy for his master s thesis at kth royal institute of technology in stockholm which was published by the swedish national road and transport research institute frequent moose vs vehicle collisions on sweden s highways often result in injuries and death to both human and animal gers said in an email yet automobile makers rarely include animal crashes in their safety testing i believe this is a fascinating and still very unexplored area that deserves all the attention it can get he said this topic is mystical life threatening and more relevant than ever can you speak legalese anyone who has ever read a terms of service agreement knows that legal documents can be downright incomprehensible that frustrated eric martinez a graduate student in the brain and cognitive science department at the massachusetts institute of technology who also has a law degree from harvard he francis mollica and edward gibson shared the literature ig nobel for analyzing what makes legal documents unnecessarily difficult to understand research that appeared in the journal cognition ultimately there s kind of a hope that lawyers will think a little more with the reader in mind he said clarity doesn t just benefit the layperson it also benefits lawyers

this story was originally published by grist you can subscribe to its weekly newsletter here over 20 million households in the us have unpaid electricity bills but it s not just inflation that is putting them behind it s also our increasingly extreme weather blistering temperatures over the summer led many to keep their air conditioning on longer than they might normally and now that winter is on the horizon the cost of heating adds to the stress there s no relief in sight said mark wolfe executive director of the national energy assistance directors association or neada which monitors the effectiveness of federal utility assistance programs all signs point to another expensive winter and for many of the nation s struggling families this means dealing with service shut offs deciding whether to heat or eat or continuing to incur debts to utilities that will eventually have to be paid black latino and indigenous households are the most at risk of having their power cut off according to a survey on electricity utility equity conducted by indiana university s energy justice lab in january nearly 40 of hispanic households and more than 26 of black households said that they were unable to pay their electricity bill twenty nine percent of hispanic households and 20 of black households received a disconnection notice and more than 18 of hispanic households and 13 of black households had their energy service disconnected hispanic households were 80 more likely than white households to have their service disconnected by a utility provider a separate study on water equity by the pacific institute found that black households that receive a utility shutoff warning notice are more than twice as likely to be disconnected as white households receiving a notice black households while making up approximately 14 of the nation s housing stock nonetheless represented 29 of the total disconnections native american households were disconnected at the highest rate at 4 though they only make up 1 of the national population the impacts of redlining and disinvestment mean that black and latino neighborhoods are more likely to have aging and low quality infrastructure and are more likely to forgo heating or cooling their homes in order to save money for food nearly one in three americans faced extreme heat advisories and a surge of heat related emergencies over the summer forcing many to seek respite outside their homes sacramento california s capital opened cooling centers in community centers and schools for residents as summer temperatures reached over 95 degrees for days on end and in the midwest and east coast officials and communities struggled to keep public swimming pools open amid a national lifeguard shortage numerous factors including inflation higher energy costs due to the war in ukraine and harsher winter weather have contributed to the increase in unpaid electricity bills and august utility bills are expected to reflect a dramatic increase in cooling costs if we re taking energy as a human right then that means no more shut offs justin schott project manager for the energy equity project at the university of michigan s school of environment sustainability two federal programs are aimed at protecting energy insecure populations the low income home energy assistance program known as liheap helps low income households pay their utility bills while the weatherization assistance program helps households become more energy efficient thereby reducing the monthly costs but the former is chronically underfunded and only serves 20 of eligible households beginning in the first months of the pandemic 34 states offered their residents protection against utility shut offs all had expired by the end of 2021 while 41 states have protections against utility shut offs during extreme cold weather events only 18 states have protections against utility shut offs during a heat wave although hot states like arizona have developed a permanent policy against summer shut offs after a well publicized death of an elderly resident in 2018 other hot states like florida have no heat protections at all with the limited scope of nationwide utility assistance there is growing concern that the millions of households who are behind on their electricity bills will have their utility services cut even as extreme weather conditions become the norm some experts and advocates argue that the most immediate policy that can protect households vulnerable to mounting utility debt is to stop shut offs entirely during the summer if they ve missed one or more payments if we re taking energy as a human right then that means no more shut offs said justin schott project manager for the energy equity project at the university of michigan s school of environment sustainability because we know that whether that happens in extreme heat or extreme cold this can lead to death from 2017 to 2021 there were an average of 188 heat related deaths in the u s up from an average of 81 in the five years before that schott believes that there is no reason why moratoriums on shut offs should not continue while the government continues to tinker with the electricity affordability and assistance programs i think we saw that it dramatically worked and that states were able to do it he said so there s no reason why we can t continue to do that other than lack of will from regulators and utilities to continue on that path but mark wolfe head of the professional group for energy assistance directors disagrees for
