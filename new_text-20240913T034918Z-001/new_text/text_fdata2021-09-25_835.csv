by david randall new york reuters the federal reserve s signal that it will soon unwind its bond buying program is bolstering the case in financial markets for the so called reflation trade which lifted treasury yields and boosted shares of banks energy firms and other economically sensitive companies in the early months of 2021 the reflation trade stalled during the summer but the central bank said this week it would likely begin pulling back on its 120 billion a month government bond purchasing program as soon as november while also signaling that it may raise interest rates in 2022 earlier than many expected though monetary tightening is frequently seen as a drag on stocks some investors view the fed s stance as a vote of confidence for the u s economy normally a hawkish turn would be bad for risk on assets particularly equities the fact the fed is putting this out there signals to the market that the economy is on pretty firm footing said ralph bassett head of north american equities at aberdeen standard investments the russell 1000 value index where reflation trade stocks are heavily represented is up 0 9 since the start of the quarter well behind the 5 7 gain in the russell 1000 growth index over the same time the value index is up 17 year to date with the growth index up 19 compared to an 18 7 rise for the market watchers have also kept a close eye on treasury yields which have risen since the fed meeting as expectations of stronger growth and inflation worries drove some investors out of safe haven government bonds the benchmark u s 10 year yield recently stood at 1 45 near its highest level since the start of july higher yields on treasuries make some stocks less attractive analysts at ubs global wealth management said the 10 year yield will rise to 1 8 by year end but do not believe such a move will disrupt equities the pace of any rise would be key the bank s research showed that a three month change in nominal yields of between 50 and 100 basis points has been accompanied by a 5 7 return in the msci us index since 1997 only a rise in real yields of more than 50 bps over three months would likely weigh on equity returns particularly in emerging markets the bank said in a report investors will watch a raft of u s economic indicators next week including durable goods orders and the ism manufacturing index as well as the progress of debt ceiling negotiations in washington investors will also monitor developments in the evergrande saga after the heavily indebted chinese company missed a payment deadline on a dollar bond this week leaving global investors wondering if they will have to swallow large losses when a 30 day grace period ends margaret patel a senior portfolio manager of equity and fixed income funds at wells fargo nyse said fed tapering should benefit high yield bonds because it implies a stronger economy that will result in fewer corporate defaults the trend of u s coronavirus case counts will also influence financial markets said jim paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group a covid 19 resurgence earlier in the year helped undercut forecasts for the u s economic rebound we know where to go during the reopening cycle he said referring to value stocks and small caps the current seven day moving average of u s case counts now stands at 146 182 a 6 1 increase over the previous seven days though there was an 1 8 decline in the number of tests that proved positive for the virus according to the centers for disease control at the same time investor confidence in the economy could be dented by a prolonged fight over raising the u s debt ceiling analysts at capital economics said the u s senate is days away from voting on a measure to suspend the 28 4 trillion debt ceiling and keep federal agencies operating after sept 30 the end of the fiscal year next week the focus will shift to fiscal policy capital economics said in a report a debt ceiling crisis in late october could even delay the fed s taper plans the firm said

new york a new study analyzing more than 12 million home appraisals between 2015 and 2020 found racial and ethnic disparities across the united states the research shows that black and latino homeowners are nearly twice as likely as white homeowners to have their homes undervalued some experts like andre perry a senior fellow with the brookings metropolitan policy program say this is a sign that racism in the real estate industry is a major factor in keeping black and latino families from accumulating wealth when most people talk about structural racism and racism in general they generally think of klansmen in robes carrying torches but where we still see pervasive discrimination that takes money out of people s pockets are in these everyday behaviors or practices that strip wealth perry told abc news the report by mortgage giant freddie mac shows that 15 4 of appraisals in latino neighborhoods and 12 5 in black neighborhoods are valued less than the property s contract price that number drops to 7 4 in majority white neighborhoods as black or latino populations grow the total of undervalued appraisals also rose the study said researchers accounted for many of the potential factors that could lead to a low home appraisal the home s structure the neighborhood s features still black and latino areas were disproportionately given lower appraisals nationwide 85 of appraisers at the end of 2018 were white according to the appraisal institute an appraisal falling below the contracted sale price may allow a buyer to renegotiate with a seller but it could also mean families might miss out on the full wealth building benefits of homeownership or may be unable to get the financing needed to achieve the american dream in the first place said michael bradley senior vice president of modeling econometrics data science and analytics in freddie mac s single family division generational wealth represents the assets passed from one generation to the next this can include things like stocks investments businesses and real estate homeownership perry said is one of the primary means of building wealth families lose money when their homes are valued lower which can have a cumulative effect on their family for generations to come if you have less equity in your home you have less means to uplift yourself perry said the equity in people s homes determines so much it s the money people use to send their kids to college to start a business most people start the businesses using the equity in the home to move to a better neighborhood it s used when someone dies or gets married it s significant the net worth of an average white family is nearly 10 times greater than an average black family and eight times greater than an average latino family in 2016 those totals were 171 000 17 150 and 20 600 respectively according to a pew research center analysis a brooking institute report also found that homes in predominately black neighborhoods nationwide are valued 48 000 less than predominately white neighborhoods which results in a cumulative loss of approximately 156 billion in equity these gaps in net worth highlight some of the ways housing discrimination and other forms of systemic racism impede the ability of latino and black to accumulate assets and invest in the future of their families solving these gaps perry said can help bridge the racial and ethnic disparities in other aspects of society we don t want to lay the complete blame on the loss of home values on appraisers said perry they are certainly an important trigger but the same attitudes that appraisers have so do lenders real estate agents and other people in various markets so this is a great first step in identifying the causes for the loss of value in homes and it is a key to understanding how we can restore value to people who ve been robbed by racism over time freddie mac s bradley says these problems are pervasive and hopes the survey is the latest step toward addressing equity in housing our research marks the beginning of a comprehensive effort to better understand the key drivers contributing to the appraisal gap bradley said in a statement our goal is to develop solutions to this persistent problem including appraisal best practices uniform standards for automated valuation models enhanced consumer disclosures improved value processes and revised fair lending exam procedures and risk assessments copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

melvin van peebles the pioneering black filmmaker playwright and musician died this week at the age of 89 at his home in new york he was known as the godfather of modern black cinema and his movies burst with the sounds of soul and funk and resistance related 25 years later the buena vista social club still connects the world through old school mambo van peebles has left behind an immense legacy in american and world cinema the multitalented van peebles wrote numerous books and plays and recorded several albums playing multiple instruments and delivering rap style lyrics he later became a successful options trader on the stock market related a new film explores the stories of 6 men from china who survived the titanic sinking racquel gates a professor of film at columbia university and the consulting producer and editor for the melvin van peebles box set being released by the criterion collection next week discussed his work life and legacy with the world s host marco werman marco werman van peebles was something of a renaissance man a novelist musician painter worked in the theater and of course was a filmmaker how influential and widespread was his work racquel gates i think we really cannot emphasize enough how immensely influential he was not just in terms of his storytelling practices i mean van peebles really figured out a way to work outside of the hollywood system as well as figuring out ways to articulate his vision in really subversive ways within the hollywood studio system there is a certain generation of filmmakers in africa who are influenced by his work what did those african directors see in van peebles work that they did not see elsewhere in hollywood i think what filmmakers around the globe saw was somebody from a community from a marginalized community telling his own story and telling the story of people who had been overlooked and ignored or misrepresented by hollywood and we see that within the context of the 1960s part of the black arts movement here in the united states but also larger global and national cinemas and i m thinking of somebody like santiago álvarez in cuba people who are really interested in using film as a way of articulating a political vision he had an innate sense of confidence in what he was doing and the importance of what he was doing giving attention to individuals and communities that had been long overlooked so more of an intentional revolutionary director absolutely an intentional revolutionary director i mean just such a clear sense of vision and purpose and also a clear sense of where his art practice fit into larger conversations he lived for some time in france i gather why did he move there and what effect did that have on his career and his life so you know melvin van peebles was living in san francisco and he tells the story of trying to make it as an american filmmaker but the sort of racism of the industry made that impossible and so he picks up his family has all kinds of different jobs at one point he was a street performer in france he was an actor on the stage in the netherlands for a bit but it s in france that he s able to make the connections in order to make the film that he wants to make and really develop and hone his craft and was he able to achieve that in france absolutely the story of a three day pass people talk about it in terms of the ways that it deals with racism it s the story of an american gi and his relationship with a white french woman comes out the same year as guess who s coming to dinner starring sidney poitier but it s a completely different lens that melvin van peebles is using and really looking at the psychological state of the main character but the thing that people don t talk about enough is it s such an amazing and experimental film in terms of aesthetics it s clear that he in conversation with the french new wave filmmakers you know there s a really amazing shot a double dolly shot which spike lee has made famous this kind of shot where it looks like a character is floating through space and melvin van peebles uses that and this is 1967 for your own scholarly research you ve met and interviewed van peebles at his home give us a sense of what he was like it s kind of a crazy story i had a mutual contact i was writing an academic article about watermelon man and i asked his contact i d love to chat with him do you know how to get in touch with them and this contact gave me a phone number and i thought it was a secretary or something so i called and melvin van peebles answers the phone and i said i d love to chat with you and he says well if you can get here in 20 minutes i ll chat with you for like 10 minutes or something like that and so i jump on the subway and i go over his apartment i mean he s in the phone book which is sort of insane to me he welcomed me in we sat for two hours and he was just so incredibly generous with his time and with his knowledge and talked to me about making that film but also his experiences in hollywood and his thoughts on representation and that s one of the things that s really come out the more that people have been talking about him it s just it is immense generosity to people so just as van peebles dies this week there are new audiences learning about his work sweet sweetback s baadasssss song is screening at the new york film festival this weekend a revival of his play ain t supposed to die a natural death is slated for return to broadway next year what do you think all that says about his work and how his legacy is going to live on people talk about melvin van peebles usually in the context of the 1960s and 1970s but what i think this demonstrates is that the stuff that he was exploring these ideas of black liberation and elevating ordinary people to the level of figures really worth celebrating and really worth watching on film i think there s universality a timelessness about that and i think particularly now where people of color both in the united states but also around the globe are still fighting some of these same battles right to have their lives celebrated and fight just to be recognized for their humanity those themes are just as relevant and significant as they were then well there has been so much scrutiny of the lack of diversity in hollywood in recent years from preproduction to acting to direction to postproduction oscarssowhite how do you think melvin van peebles processed where this arc landed in recent years as someone who is determined to bring justice to the system i think that melvin van peebles recognized early on that the system is inherently broken his response to that was in the 1960s hollywood won t let me be a filmmaker screw it i ll go to france when he wants to film a particular ending for watermelon man and columbia pictures tells him no we want a different ending he just lies to them right he tells them he s going to shoot two endings he only shoots one he breaks down the sets he sends everybody home and then he puts columbia in his position where they have no choice but to use his preferred ending when he wants to make sweetback and he realizes that that s never going to be a hollywood film he just does his own thing i mean i think that his response would be when hollywood is closing the door you find your own way you craft your own path you find a new way to do the thing that you want to do and you don t let people tell you no this interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity ap contributed to this report
file in this sept 27 2020 file photo a house burns on platina road at the zogg fire near ono calif pacific gas electric has been charged with manslaughter and other crimes friday sept 24 2021 in a northern california wildfire last year that killed four people and destroyed hundreds of homes ap photo ethan swope file the associated press san francisco ap pacific gas electric was charged friday with involuntary manslaughter and other crimes after its equipment sparked a northern california wildfire that killed four people and destroyed hundreds of homes last year prosecutors said it is the latest legal action against the nation s largest utility which pleaded guilty last year to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in a 2018 blaze ignited by its long neglected electrical grid that nearly destroyed the town of paradise and became the deadliest u s wildfire in a century shasta county district attorney stephanie bridgett announced the 31 charges including 11 felonies against pg e saying it failed to perform its legal duties and that its œfailure was reckless and criminally negligent and it resulted in the death of four people if the utility is convicted of involuntary manslaughter the punishment would be a fine for each person killed in the zogg fire last year near the city of redding a corporation œcan t go to jail so we re talking fines fees the ability for the court to order remedial and corrective measures ť bridgett said œone of our primary functions here is to hold them responsible and let the surviving families know that their loved one did not die in vain ť she added pg e ceo patti poppe said failing to prevent the fire was not a crime œthis was a tragedy four people died and my coworkers are working so hard to prevent fires and the catastrophic losses that come with them they have dedicated their careers to it criminalizing their judgment is not right ť poppe said in a statement the wind whipped zogg fire began on sept 27 2020 and raged through rugged terrain and small communities west of redding killing four people burning about 200 homes and blackening about 87 square miles 225 square kilometers of land three of the victims died as they tried to outrun the blaze and were found inside or near their vehicles a fourth victim died at a hospital in march state fire investigators concluded that the blaze was sparked by a gray pine tree that fell onto a pg e distribution line shasta and tehama counties have sued the utility alleging negligence saying pg e had failed to remove the tree even though it had been marked for removal two years earlier the utility says the tree was subsequently cleared to stay the district attorney determined that the company was criminally liable for the fire the charges friday include enhancements for injury to a 29 year old firefighter who was hit by a falling tree that fractured his spine paralyzing him from the chest down they also include felony arson counts linked to several fires started by the utility s equipment in shasta county over the last year bridgett said pg e which has an estimated 16 million customers in central and northern california filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 after its aging equipment was blamed for a series of fires including the 2018 camp fire that killed 85 people and destroyed 10 000 homes in paradise and neighboring communities company officials have acknowledged that pg e hasn t lived up to expectations in the past but said changes in leadership and elsewhere ensure it s on the right track and will do better they have listed a wide range of improvements that include using more advanced technology to avoid setting wildfires and help detect them quicker pg e also remains on criminal probation for a 2010 pipeline explosion in the san francisco bay area city of san bruno that killed eight people giving a federal judge oversight of the company the judge and california power regulators have rebuked pg e for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the company has acknowledged that its equipment may have played a role in sparking this summer s dixie fire which has burned nearly 1 million acres and is now the second largest wildfire in state history pg e emerged from bankruptcy last summer and negotiated a 13 5 billion settlement with some wildfire victims but it still faces both civil and criminal actions including charges from the sonoma county district attorney s office over the 2019 kincade fire that forced nearly 200 000 people to evacuate in the meantime most of the roughly 70 000 victims who have filed claims for the devastation caused by pg e s past misdeeds still are awaiting payment from a trust created during the bankruptcy the trust which is run independently of pg e is facing a nearly 2 billion shortfall because half its funding came in company stock ___ this story has been corrected to show that the zogg fire didn t burn in the sierra nevada this story also has been corrected to say that in march state fire investigators concluded that the blaze was sparked by a gray pine tree that fell onto a pg e distribution line not a

dealership in missouri this week she sighed in a normal month we probably will have like 120 new cars she said right now i think we have maybe 10 and she s happy to have 10 last week we had five she added her dealership has rearranged its vehicles to try to make the lot look fuller but you can t really hide the difference between 10 and 120 the used car selection is two thirds smaller than usual too automakers are struggling with persistent shortages of essential parts especially semiconductors which are embedded throughout vehicles these days and whose production hasn t kept up with the

hyundai palisade instead she still had to pay to put her name on a waitlist and wait weeks longer to actually get the vehicle which was mind boggling to her i don t feel like i should have to do that for a car you know she says and i m not talking about some handmade foreign german engineered something this is the family car but that s what it took and experts say that looking beyond your preferred make and model or even at vehicle classes you weren t considering like a sedan instead of an suv can expand your likelihood of driving a vehicle home even if it s not the car of your dreams if you have a trade in use it to your advantage with so few vehicles for sale it s proving tough to haggle over the price of a vehicle you re trying to purchase sellers know that if you won t pay up someone else will but if you have a vehicle you re trading in you can use the tight market to your advantage and shop around for the best offer instead of haggling down on your purchase price haggle up on your trade in value and you may be able to offset the sticker shock david zalubowski ap ap a small assortment of unsold 2022 models sits outside a mini dealership in highlands ranch colo on sept 12 being flexible and staying patient are among the things to keep in mind if you are shopping for a car place an order and wait and wait ramon and claire castillo who live near tampa fla were looking for a new toyota rav4 and they specifically wanted a hybrid ramon was driving a hybrid ford fusion and loved it it s amazing to see 41 miles to the gallon on the trip computer he says just fantastic but after months of looking at what dealers had available all over the state of florida they hadn t found a single hybrid rav4 on a lot so for the first time in their decades of car buying they worked with a dealer to place an order direct with toyota ordering a new vehicle from the factory with exactly the color and features you want and a weekslong wait for delivery is commonplace in europe but like many americans the castillos had never even considered it it took a little over two months for their rav4 to arrive but ramon castillo says it was a positive experience i would be comfortable doing this again he said ordering a vehicle is one way to cope with the current lack of options on dealer lots and it could also have big implications for the future of u s auto sales ford s ceo recently said he s committed to switching toward an order based system and electric automakers like tesla and rivian have built their business models around vehicle orders with no dealerships involved at all just pay up if you can afford to of course if you re willing to pay significantly more than a car would typically cost car shopping right now can be pretty easy we are marking some of our vehicles up 5 000 over msrp chismar the toyota salesperson says referring to the manufacturer s suggested retail price that s a hard pill to swallow and people are doing it it shocks me all the time pay more is not exactly a top secret pro shopping tip we know but some shoppers are flush with cash thanks to foregone vacations saved relief checks or a surprisingly valuable trade in others are just at the end of their rope or as one exasperated shopper told npr i was willing to spend the extra money because i was tired of shopping for cars david zalubowski ap ap two unsold 2021 subaru suvs sit in an otherwise empty storage lot at a subaru dealership in littleton colo on sept 12 ordering a car directly from an automaker can mean long waits but doing so can be easier than finding a car you want at a dealer can you travel look farther afield some shoppers are trawling the internet and calling up dealerships far from home to expand their options ultimately driving hours or even hopping on a plane to buy the vehicle they want without forking over thousands extra ian scott fleming who lives in lubbock texas was determined to get a plug in hybrid a vehicle that can run on pure electric power in addition to gasoline but texas dealerships said that not only did they have none in stock but they wouldn t even be able to get one for him so he started calling dealerships that were farther and farther away finally he said with a chuckle i found a dealer in massachusetts that actually believed me when i said that i would be willing to drive 2 000 miles to go to get a new car that kind of road trip is unusual for sure but many shoppers are driving an hour or more to find a relative bargain or a vehicle in short supply finally ask yourself do you have to buy a car now that s a question lots of frustrated car shoppers are asking themselves pedro moncada and stefanie franc live in salt lake city with their 21 month old son they are hoping to have a second child so this spring they went looking for a bigger vehicle that could fit two car seats unlike their current compact sedans they d set what had seemed like a reasonable budget for a late model used crossover but they were shocked by the prices they were seeing virtually as much as for a brand new vehicle after months of searching they found exactly one vehicle they liked in their price range but then franc says as we were driving around we noticed it kind of smelled strange and there was like mud in the crevices it was a branded title a vehicle that had been totaled in a hurricane then repaired and would be sold without a warranty their only viable option was off the table and that s when we kind of realized maybe we should put a little timeout in the planning to expand our family for now moncada says most people aren t putting off pregnancies because of the terrible car market but plenty of people are putting off car purchases a survey from kelley blue book foundthat nearly 50 of vehicle shoppers are delaying their purchases prepared to wait for up to a year and hoping for the market to get back to something like normal of course nobody knows how long that will take lots will not stay this empty forever the problem is no one can predict exactly when things will get better either copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

don t miss out on the headlines from victoria followed categories will be added to my news victorians in the state s northeast have felt another tremor after a 5 9 magnitude earthquake on wednesday a 2 8 magnitude tremor was recorded at 12 09pm lasting about 20 seconds 10km underground at rawson east of melbourne near the site of the original quake geosciences australia geophysicist hadi ghasemi said more aftershocks were likely in the coming months more than 10 shocks have now registered in the aftermath of the major quake which was detected as far away as adelaide canberra and launceston victoria could experience more aftershocks but they are unlikely to be widely felt the first aftershocks happened just 10 to 15 minutes after the earthquake and had magnitudes of 3 5 and 4 1 the larger of these two rumbles were reported by more than 530 people while the original tremor was felt by more than 41 000 six more aftershocks were recorded throughout the day in the mansfield area all with smaller magnitudes of 2 4 to 3 2 the smallest of the aftershocks were felt up to 50km away the last recorded aftershock happened about 6pm on wednesday evening and was only reported by 11 people chapel st is strewn with debris after an earthquake rocked burger shop betty s burgers picture mark stewart senior duty seismologist hugh glanville said the aftershocks were felt over a much smaller area the 4 1 magnitude aftershock was felt by a much smaller area maybe a couple of hundred kilometres but it was not felt any further than that magnitudes of 2 5 were only felt around 50km away mr glanville said the geoscience australia seismologist said there could be more aftershocks in the mansfield area near the quake s origin after an earthquake you get most aftershocks straight away then they trail off mr glanville said there could be more today we are expecting magnitude twos possibly three or four given the current pattern on wednesday the 5 9 magnitude tremor rocked homes rattled windows and sent workers scurrying for the fire stairs when it hit at 9 15am reverberating for about 30 seconds stock fell from supermarket shelves and businesses right across the state faced disruption to their operations residents and media gather near the damaged building on chapel st another six smaller aftershocks ranging from 2 1 to 4 1 in magnitude were recorded later in the morning vibrations were felt as far as adelaide canberra and even launceston as the shockwaves rolled out from the epicentre 10km underground in the gaffneys creek woods point region just south of mansfield 115km northeast of melbourne state emergency management commissioner andrew crisp warned that aftershocks were likely but unlikely to be as severe as the initial jolt the worst damage was recorded at the betty s burger s building in chapel st windsor where debris spilt on to the footpath and the roads below most other damage was minor with cases of crumbling brick chimneys cracked walls and internal breakages recorded in homes across the city residents also reported birds falling silent as the tremor rumbled through the suburbs victorian ses chief officer tim wiebusch said more than 108 calls for help were made to the service mostly for help with building damage no one had been reported as injured if the earthquake occurred in a densely populated urban area it would have been a different result mr wiebusch said seismology research centre senior seismologist wayne peck confirmed that the quake was the biggest recorded in victoria since such events were measured australia s most deadly quake on december 28 1989 in newcastle had a magnitude of 5 4 because its epicentre was close to urban areas the disaster killed 13 people injured more than 160 and left a 4 billion damage bill we re fortunate it happened near woods point it s a much more remote area than newcastle was mr peck said the previous strongest quake recorded in the state was at mt hotham in may 1966 and had a magnitude of 5 7 power was lost to more than 35 000 victorian homes in metropolitan melbourne and the northeast of the state most were back online by midafternoon all victorian magistrates courts were

across wattle st in prahran picture mark stewart it s important to remain calm but vigilant aftershocks can continue to occur for some time after the main earthquake if you are located in victoria you need to know what to do he said expect aftershocks and ensure to stay away from damaged buildings and other hazards deputy chief health officer deb friedman confirmed that positive covid 19 cases and people who were in quarantine or isolation could leave their homes if the structure became unsafe people s safety always comes first professor friedman if they need to leave the premises of where they are we just ask them to please remember to take a mask but their safety comes first and we understand there may be reasons why people may need to leave the place that they were previously isolating what caused dramatic quake the dramatic tremors that rocked homes and buildings in melbourne was likely caused by australia s continent edging north and crunching into asia pacific nations curtin university s structural geologist professor chris elders said australia is moving away from antarctica at 7cm a year rapid speed in geology terms unsettling plates surrounding the nation and forcing the earth under our feet to move at regular intervals the indian ocean is getting bigger and we re colliding with indonesia timor and new guinea to the north he told nca newswire so all those boundaries produce stresses that get transmitted through the crust and then when they hit a weak fault the fault moves and causes the earthquake australians are more acquainted with seasonal disasters such as fires floods and cyclones with earthquakes closely linked with california japan and the pacific but the curtin university academic said shakes across the country were surprisingly frequent he said quakes of this magnitude recorded in victoria on wednesday occurred about every five years but there is a shake of three or more magnitude detected once a week if you look at a map of the distribution of earthquakes they re occurring in all the states prof elders said that is a reflection of the fact that australia is a very ancient bit of continental crust so there s lots of fault lines and lines of weakness that kind of fail when the stresses build up it s a combination of the plate boundaries all the way around australia and the abundance of lines of weakness within the ancient australian crust can fail and cause earthquakes to occur fallen brickwork in a laneway off chapel st in prahran picture andrew henshaw chapel st remains closed after an earthquake hit

having a hissy fit too read the full story here flash on screen frights and excites the first clue national earthquake alert centre received about victoria s ground shaking event was when a computer screen began flashing there is no way to accurately predict earthquakes so the federal government s geoscience team cannot know about a tremor until a seismometer records it geoscience australia seismologist spiro spiliopoulos said the expert on duty on wednesday morning would have seen their screen light up with a large event soon after that they would have located it automatically it would have flashed up in front of them and then they have to look at it and quickly confirm that it s a real event mr spiliopoulos said a graph shows the earthquake s tremor on wednesday picture seismology research centre we ve got tools that allow us to send information to emergency management australia and the state emergency centres then we post it online to make it publicly available most of the time the alert centre is reasonably quiet a team of eight seismologists rostered on 24 hours a day keep a constant eye on tremors around the country and more frequently off the australian coastline but there was a bit more excitement on wednesday it was both a frightening and exciting morning for mr spiliopoulos being part of the team to investigate the biggest earthquake on record in victoria

on to where it was and how big it was and what people were feeling and stuff like that such large earthquakes come with a short but intense buzz at the alert centre the thing with earthquakes is that they come out of nowhere he said most of the alert centre s day to day work involves monitoring earthquakes in the indian and pacific oceans to assess whether they could pose any kind of tsunami threat to australia mr spiliopoulos said researchers would now deploy specialist equipment to the mansfield area to pick up aftershocks an engineering group would also be sent out to assess how much

the australian prime minister scott morrison has said australia is really good at digging stuff up while announcing a clean energy summit after the first in person meeting of the leaders of australia the united states india and japan speaking outside the white house at the end of the meeting of leaders that make up the quadrilateral security dialogue morrison said australia would host the summit next year under the quad umbrella and take a bigger role in the supply of critical minerals in the indo pacific region the gathering of the four major democracies was being closely observed by china which earlier this week said it was doomed to fail morrison said he and the us president joe biden were on the same page on china which has been steadily increasing its military and political influence in the indo pacific region to the alarm of the us and others what we talked about today is how we achieve a free and open indo pacific and the way you do that is that countries like australia and india and the united states and japan we stand up for the values that we believe in morrison told reporters in washington we resist any suggestion or any pressure that would come on any of us to be anything different to what we are and we want that opportunity for all countries in the indo pacific on the planned climate summit to be held in australia in 2022 morrison said it would be an applied summit focusing on expert research and technology it aims to deliver a roadmap to transfer scientific knowledge on clean energy to countries in the indo pacific this is about pulling together a very clear work program as to how clean energy supply chains can be built up morrison said without giving more details it was an honor to host the prime ministers of australia india and japan this afternoon for the first ever in person quad leaders summit we share a common vision for the future and we re coming together to meet the key challenges of the 21st century pic twitter com oqyrvzkqeq president biden potus september 24 2021 he said the quad leaders recognised the role australia can play in the supply of critical minerals to support energy and other technologies we are really good at digging stuff up in australia and making sure it can fuel the rest of the world when it comes to the new energy economy morrison said critical minerals are metals and non metals such as rare earth elements deemed at risk due to scarcity geopolitical issues trade policy or other factors they are used in the manufacture of semiconductors mobile phones flat screen monitors wind turbines electric cars solar panels and many other high tech products including defence equipment morrison was speaking ahead of the release of the official quad communique and before he leaves the us to head back to australia morrison biden the japanese prime minister yoshihide suga and the indian prime minister narendra modi also discussed the supply and delivery of more than 1 billion covid 19 vaccine doses for developing indo pacific countries the last meeting of quad leaders was held online in march the leaders underlined their support for people trying to leave afghanistan following the taliban takeover of the country and the departure of us troops after 20 years view image in fullscreen scott morrison addresses the un general assembly in a pre recorded message photograph peter foley ap morrison said the quad including australia wanted to help as many people as possible under their humanitarian programs we want to be able to facilitate that he said without giving further details in a video recorded before he left canberra that was delivered overnight to un general assembly morrison defended australia s record on reducing carbon emissions without setting a timetable for net zero we are committed to achieving net zero emissions morrison said we know the world is transitioning to a new energy economy it s no longer about if or even when for that matter it s about how how we achieve the reduction in global emissions in our own emissions in individual nations emissions while still lifting living standards across all nations and the answer as history has shown us time and time again it s technology practical scalable and commercially viable technologies on friday the federal treasurer josh frydenberg told business leaders the morrison government cannot run the risk of financial markets falsely assuming australia is a climate change pariah because that would increase the cost of capital and undermine financial system stability in his pre recorded address to the un general assembly morrison also doubled down on calls for an independent review into the origins of covid 19 despite months of economic pain inflicted by china he said preventing future pandemics remained a priority and pushed for accelerated efforts to identify how covid 19 first emerged australia called for an independent review and sees understanding the cause of this pandemic not as a political issue but as being essential simply to prevent the next one morrison said we need to know so we can prevent this death and this calamity being visited upon the world again

covid times have given rise to a trend in home baking yeah pun intended and full disclosure more to come folks who ve never been closer to fresh bread out of the oven than standing in their local bakery have discovered the joys and the comfort provided by kneading dough the icing on the cake they watch their efforts nourish their family their community and ultimately their souls the effort to provide fresh baked bread to those people experiencing food insecurity through food pantries across the pacific northwest has graduated from a group of sourdough geeks to include all interested parties in the communities baking up a unique delicious and nutritious solution community loaves which stocks the pantry at spots like our own edmonds food bank began in washington hubs have sprung up in oregon and idaho growing the network to serve more communities i asked the individuals in these next sections a question what s in your ovens these days edmonds resident kim wahl shared her experiences with baking not just for her own family but for the community at large kim is a member of community loaves and the motto we re breader together is apt i am proud to share that the edmonds hub has donated over 1 600 loaves and currently has thirty six active members kim says we need more i d heard about community loaves from edmonds resident and former seattle times restaurant writer nancy leson last year when she became hub coordinator for the edmonds group nancy is a food person has been all of her life both professional and personal so i could see her getting involved up to her eyeballs or maybe up to her elbows i peppered kim with questions kp what incited you to join kim i like most people started making sourdough bread during the pandemic but it s just my husband and i at home so i was giving it away and freezing lots of loaves i saw the article about community loaves and thought it would be a great way to give back to people in need i was making bread anyway so why not make a few extra loaves i also liked the idea of using grain from local farms and having access to purchase it for my own use kp what is your previous experience with baking kim i ve always baked but never worked in food service love to cook and always willing try new things my other hobby is making chocolates and giving them away been asked a lot why i don t start a business and sell them my answer is that i enjoy giving them away and i don t need another job i m co owner of a floor covering store in edmonds kp are you part of the edmonds group kim i am part of the edmonds hub and nancy is our hub leader she s great and very helpful if you need supplies quick or have questions she is there kp how long have you participated kim i attended a training seminar in february but didn t start baking until april community loaves asks individuals to use specific types of flour and i had to wait to get my flour order we order and pick up once a month at nancy s kp approximately how many loaves of bread have you baked so far kim i have donated approx 100 loaves so far kp what is your most enjoyable part of this project kim favorite part is donation day and knowing that someone is getting a homemade loaf of bread the bread from our hub goes to the edmonds food bank so i know it s my community that is benefitting it s flexible and i can participate on my schedule kp which part of the process that is especially enjoyable for you kim favorite part of the process is pulling them out of the oven the loaves smell so good kp what is the most challenging aspect kim most challenging is finding room in my freezer for more loaves i m considering getting another freezer kp now that is what i call commitment to the cause kp any special prep for kitchen home area needed to participate beyond common sense type steps kim i would say the only thing that helps is having a stand mixer not necessary but helpful also some free time helps you bake as much or as little as you want we are all volunteers kp has being part of community loaves opened up new friendships relationships for you kim i ve meet some really great people who care a lot about this program they will help you with anything they will train you walk you through the process and even invite you to join them so you can get some hands on training kp what would you say to someone considering joining the group kim i would tell anyone who was interested to attend the training see if it s something that interests you you can bake one loaf or 10 every loaf is needed they provide recipes for yeast and sourdough and will teach you how to make the bread we all make the same recipes it is really good bread they even encourage you to make some for donation and some for you and your family to eat her closing pitch come bake with us edmonds hub coordinator nancy leson checked in to share even more about this amazing movement and the way it gives back to participants initially nancy joined to offer help to the community at large and because she loves to bake bread what i didn t expect was that the baking knowledge i ve gleaned through community loaves and more perhaps more importantly the many new friendships i ve forged with my edmonds neighbors and fellow bread bakers around the sound it has made belonging to this organization an integral part of what i do to keep myself emotionally grounded and involved with the world around me as a hub coordinator nancy looks forward to donation sundays hub mates arrive at my house in cars and trucks on bikes scooters and by foot bearing gifts gorgeous loaves of bread that go from their hands and their homes directly to mine and from there to the edmonds food bank and to homes of edmonds seniors in need nancy loves everything about the process including the fact that those loaves are made with northwest wheat milled right here in skagit valley and yes she says i always keep a loaf for myself a bit of history initially all the groups loaves went to hopelink in kirkland and as the numbers multiplied they were distributed to all five of hopelink s pantries including shoreline when nancy started baking exactly a year ago she was the third edmonds baker and drove her loaves to a new hub one of far fewer at the time in kenmore nancy became the edmonds hub coordinator and today her hub s edmonds volunteers number at 40 and nancy states for the record i d love to have 40 more in our group she notes that while not all 40 members bake for every donation day there s a core group who show up every time bags of bread in hand some bring three loaves others a dozen when i stack them into big produce boxes which hold a dozen loaves each and pack those into my car i m amazed at what we can all do together she said as of sunday sept 18 nancy leson has personally donated 120 loaves some of my bakers are retired professionals others are beginners who rely on me and our extended team at community loaves central especially our fearless leader katherine kehrli to troubleshoot readers do you love to bake or want to learn the skill community loaves could use your assistance there s such a demand for bread and all the hubs are looking

feverpitched istock new york a new study analyzing more than 12 million home appraisals between 2015 and 2020 found racial and ethnic disparities across the united states the research shows that black and latino homeowners are nearly twice as likely as white homeowners to have their homes undervalued some experts like andre perry a senior fellow with the brookings metropolitan policy program say this is a sign that racism in the real estate industry is a major factor in keeping black and latino families from accumulating wealth when most people talk about structural racism and racism in general they generally think of klansmen in robes carrying torches but where we still see pervasive discrimination that takes money out of people s pockets are in these everyday behaviors or practices that strip wealth perry told abc news the report by mortgage giant freddie mac shows that 15 4 of appraisals in latino neighborhoods and 12 5 in black neighborhoods are valued less than the property s contract price that number drops to 7 4 in majority white neighborhoods as black or latino populations grow the total of undervalued appraisals also rose the study said researchers accounted for many of the potential factors that could lead to a low home appraisal the home s structure the neighborhood s features still black and latino areas were disproportionately given lower appraisals nationwide 85 of appraisers at the end of 2018 were white according to the appraisal institute an appraisal falling below the contracted sale price may allow a buyer to renegotiate with a seller but it could also mean families might miss out on the full wealth building benefits of homeownership or may be unable to get the financing needed to achieve the american dream in the first place said michael bradley senior vice president of modeling econometrics data science and analytics in freddie mac s single family division generational wealth represents the assets passed from one generation to the next this can include things like stocks investments businesses and real estate homeownership perry said is one of the primary means of building wealth families lose money when their homes are valued lower which can have a cumulative effect on their family for generations to come if you have less equity in your home you have less means to uplift yourself perry said the equity in people s homes determines so much it s the money people use to send their kids to college to start a business most people start the businesses using the equity in the home to move to a better neighborhood it s used when someone dies or gets married it s significant the net worth of an average white family is nearly 10 times greater than an average black family and eight times greater than an average latino family in 2016 those totals were 171 000 17 150 and 20 600 respectively according to a pew research center analysis a brooking institute report also found that homes in predominately black neighborhoods nationwide are valued 48 000 less than predominately white neighborhoods which results in a cumulative loss of approximately 156 billion in equity these gaps in net worth highlight some of the ways housing discrimination and other forms of systemic racism impede the ability of latino and black to accumulate assets and invest in the future of their families solving these gaps perry said can help bridge the racial and ethnic disparities in other aspects of society we don t want to lay the complete blame on the loss of home values on appraisers said perry they are certainly an important trigger but the same attitudes that appraisers have so do lenders real estate agents and other people in various markets so this is a great first step in identifying the causes for the loss of value in homes and it is a key to understanding how we can restore value to people who ve been robbed by racism over time freddie mac s bradley says these problems are pervasive and hopes the survey is the latest step toward addressing equity in housing our research marks the beginning of a comprehensive effort to better understand the key drivers contributing to the appraisal gap bradley said in a statement our goal is to develop solutions to this persistent problem including appraisal best practices uniform standards for automated valuation models enhanced consumer disclosures improved value processes and revised fair lending exam procedures and risk assessments copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

alexandria ocasio cortez 31 has explained that she wept on the house floor after the 1 billion iron dome bill was passed with an overwhelming majority because she felt there was a complete lack of regard for the party s most vulnerable members in a letter she released on friday she slammed the 420 to 9 vote in the house which will send israel 1 billion for its iron dome defense system yes i wept she wrote i wept for the complete lack of care for the human beings that are impacted by these decisions i wept at an institution choose a path of maximum volatility and minimum consideration for its own political convenience and i wept at the complete lack of regard i often feel our party has to its most vulnerable and endangered members and communities she continued with an apology to those she had disappointed with her present vote but cited this wasn t the first time people s wellbeing was tossed for political convenience aoc who originally said she would vote no for the bill changed her vote to present on thursday a visibly distraught ocasio cortez can be seen being comforted by representative barbara lee she claimed she cried because the bill which passed 420 to 0 was a complete lack of care for the human beings that are impacted yes i wept new york congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez released at letter to her district explained why she wept on the house floor after the unjust iron dome bill was passed on thursday this came after the congresswoman requested house majority leader steny hoyer to postpone the bill 24 hours so they could do the work necessary and explain our positions hoyer denied her request in her letter she condemned congress s military spending citing that in addition to the 1billion the bill provided the government had already issued another 3billion to israel that was authorized earlier this year she clarified that her vote did not mean she didn t approve funding for the dome but that opposing it would not defund u s financing of the system in any way shape or form i believe strongly that congress should take greater scrutiny with all military funding across the world i also believe that for far too long the u s has handed unconditional aid to the israeli government while doing nothing to address or raise the persistent human rights abuses against the palestinian people and that this imbalance of power must be centered in any honest conversation about israel and palestine in addition to the many other government we militarily fund with a pattern of human rights abuses she wrote a wider shot shows a group of lawmakers including representative debbie dingell comforting aoc the congresswoman requested house majority leader steny hoyer to postpone the bill 24 hours so they could do the work necessary and explain our positions hoyer denied her request she cited saudi arabia and colombia in her letter before continuing with how deeply unjust the iron dome supplemental bill was brought to the house floor she claimed the bill was quietly slip in without the proper channels of committee debate she called the house s decision reckless and that it threatened to tear our community apart among the no votes were tlaib and her fellow squad members representatives ilhan omar of minnesota and ayanna pressley of massachusetts during the debate before the vote foreign affairs chair representative ted deutch of florida who opposed the 1billion in funds initial removal from an earlier bill condemned tlaib when it was his turn to speak during the debate i cannot cannot allow one of my colleagues to stand on the floor of the house of representatives and label the jewish democratic state of israel an apartheid state deutch said thursday i reject it if you believe in human rights if you believe in saving lives israeli and palestinian lives i say to my colleague who just besmirched our ally then you will support this legislation the moderate democrat directed at tlaib he was cut off for time but given an additional 30 seconds during which his barrage against tlaib s criticisms of israel continued when there is no place on the map for one jewish state that s anti semitism and i reject that deutch said representative rashida tlaib urged her colleagues to vote against funding for israel s apartheid regime on thursday prompting a stunning rebuke from fellow democrat representative ted deutch the end of his speech was met with applause in the chamber a few minutes earlier tlaib asserted that israel committed war crimes invoking human rights watch s previous condemnation of the country s actions in the gaza strip i will not support an effort to enable war crimes human rights abuses and war crimes tlaib told lawmakers in the house chamber we cannot be talking only about israelis need for safety under a time when palestinians are living under a violent apartheid system we should also be talking about palestinian need for security from israeli attacks we must be consistent in our commitment to human life she went on to lambast her colleagues for allocating taxpayer money to fund what she said human rights watch called war crimes like bombs launched at religious centers the israeli government is an apartheid regime not my words the words of human rights watch tlaib continued despite being told her allocated time was up republican representative chuck fleischmann of tennessee also attacked tlaib over her comments speaking directly after the michigan lawmaker fleischmann gestured broadly as he delivered a furious condemnation of her remarks representative chuck fleischmann also reacted forcefully to tlaib s comments urging her fellow democrats to condemn her israeli foreign minister yair lapid praised the house vote on twitter they have a vocal minority in the majority party that is anti israel that is anti semitic and as americans we can never stand for that the gop representative declared as americans i beseech you i reach out to the majority and i say condemn what we just heard on the house floor condemn terrorism you just saw something on this floor i thought i would never see not only as a member of this house but as an american let s stand with israel and condemn anti semitism israeli foreign minister yair lapid posted on twitter celebrating the house vote i am grateful for the overwhelming bipartisan support for israel and the solid commitment to our security demonstrated today by the vote on the replenishment of the iron dome missile defense system lapid said it s not clear yet when the bill will get a vote in the senate majority leader chuck schumer suggested it wasn t a matter of if it ll pass but when iron dome is very important and it ll get done that s all i m going to say schumer told defense news on thursday before the house vote on twitter earlier today tlaib said she will not be voting for democratic leadership s bill allocating 1billion toward israel accusing the us ally of war crimes the bill was introduced by house appropriations chair representative rosa delauro on wednesday after house majority leader steny hoyer first announced it tuesday night backed by speaker pelosi senate majority leader schumer and president biden israel s iron dome is partially supported by us funds and has been operational since 2011 funding for the iron dome was originally part of democrats continuing resolution aimed at suspending the debt ceiling and averting an october government shutdown it was removed after progressive democrats including tlaib and fellow squad members representatives ilhan omar of minnesota alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and ayanna pressley of massachusetts threatened to tank the crucial measure otherwise but the morning of the vote tlaib attacked the measure on twitter i will not support a standalone supplemental bill of 1 billion to replenish the bombs israel used to commit war crimes in gaza she wrote the progressive lawmaker was referring to a provision in the text of the bill adding that the funds are being used to address emergent requirements in support of operation guardian of the walls it refers to the israeli defense force idf rocket campaign in may that killed more than 200 palestinians in the gaza strip and destroyed apartments health clinics and a building that contained an associated press office the idf said it was targeting hamas the terror group also launched thousands of rockets into israel killing at least 10 israelis in what they called sword of jerusalem iron dome missiles intercepted 90 percent of rockets fired into israel during the bloody conflict israeli officials claimed tlaib took issue with a provision in the bill s text that promotes israel s rocket campaign against gaza in may dubbed operation guardian of the walls tlaib the only palestinian american in congress announced her intention to vote against the measure on wednesday night the text in house democrats bill promoting operation guardian of the walls is relatively vague it could be interpreted a number of ways including the us leaving the door open for more strikes on gaza however intercepting hamas rockets likely depleted a significant portion of israel s iron dome missile supply so the mention could refer to the 1 billion going toward replenishing the stocks but on thursday during debate ahead of the bill delauro said the funds could not be used for the procurement of offensive weapons tlaib the only palestinian american in congress first announced her intention to vote against the funds on wednesday night i plan on casting a no vote the michigan lawmaker said we must stop enabling israel s human rights abuses and apartheid government during the conflict in may tlaib made an impassioned speech on the house floor lambasting israel s inhumane tactics and accused the us government of failing to recognize palestinian humanity israel s iron dome aerial defense system is activated to intercept a rocket launched from the gaza strip on may 12 a palestinian man inspects the damage following reported israeli airstrikes on rafah in the southern gaza strip on september 12 to read the statements from president biden and secretary blinken general austin and leaders of both parties you d hardly know palestinians existed at all tlaib said in may in august she was accused of anti semitism when she told an audience at the democratic socialists of america s national convention that people behind the curtain are making money off of racist and broken policies they do it from gaza to detroit and it s a way to control people to oppress people she said earning accusations of using anti semitic tropes of jewish people secretly controlling the world and exploiting others for financial gain yesterday her fellow squad member representative ilhan omar expressed outrage on after house majority leader steny hoyer announced he d bring the standalone bill allocating 1billion toward israel s iron dome to the house floor we sold 175 billion in weapons last year more than anyone in the world to some of the worst human right abusers in the world omar wrote on twitter here s an idea don t sell arms to anyone who violates human rights omar issued a scathing statement after the house moved to bring 1 billion toward israel s iron dome defense system to a vote hoyer spoke on the house floor tuesday evening two hours after crisis talks with israeli foreign minister yair lapid iron dome saved lives and property and held israel secure hoyer told the house chamber he said the legislation already has the support of top democrats in government including president joe biden the president wants this bill passed mr schumer wants this bill passed the speaker wants this bill passed hoyer said scores of others on both sides of the aisle want to make sure that israel is secure lapid said the maryland democrat told him the measure was pulled on tuesday because of a technical postponement resulting from the debate in congress over the us budget deficit i thanked majority leader hoyer for his commitment and emphasized to him the need to approve the request as soon as possible to ensure israel s security needs lapid wrote in hebrew on twitter house majority leader steny hoyer spoke with israel s foreign minister before announcing the house would vote on a standalone bill to fund the iron dome republican representative byron donalds of florida told dailymail com he would vote for the measure if it went through traditional house channels but expressed hesitance at voting for an expedited bill the congressman joins the republican conference and moderate democrats in condemning the removal of these funds at the behest of anti israel leftists like aoc and omar while it doesn t make sense for the house to take up this funding in a standalone bill representative donalds will likely support a clean bill that appropriates this vital funding to our longstanding ally israel donalds communications director harrison fields told dailymail com he blasted its removal from the debt ceiling bill as reprehensible and completely unnecessary gop representative michael guest of mississippi told dailymail com he would support the measure representative jody hice of georgia also told dailymail com he d vote yes israel s iron dome has been operational since 2011 and is one of the most sophisticated defense systems in the world it was created by israeli military firms with additional support from the us the all weather system uses radar technology to detect incoming airborne threats and destroy them before they can cause damage the radar then activates a control center that calculates a rocket s flight path if it s found to be dangerous interceptor missiles are launched to detonate the incoming weapon each iron dome battery comprised of radar control center and missiles costs roughly 100million missiles fired from the iron dome cost between 50 000 and 80 000 according to estimates from the jerusalem post israel uses iron dome systems to defend on land as well as at sea where it can be fixed to navy ships to guard offshore property
when salesforce announced that it was buying slack nine months ago it was a big deal it wasn t cheap so clearly salesforce had a plan what the plan was was never really clear at the recent dreamforce conference which returned as an in person event in san francisco this year slack announced a bunch of new releases that seem to indicate that slack is not really changing direction even if its future has a lot of salesforce in it in fact if you look at the releases it looks like slack will continue to develop as digital hub albeit one that has salesforce services tied to it in a statement announcing the new release many of which are focused on making the entire video experience in slack better slack explains that its strategy is to continue to build for the hybrid post covid workplace no matter what an organization s return to work strategy looks like permanently remote back to the office or more likely somewhere in between we re entering an era in which digital infrastructure is replacing the physical headquarters as the backbone of work the statement said a digital first approach fosters greater flexibility inclusivity and productivity encouraging people to work when and where it is best for them the first thing slack is doing is pushing clips into general availability clips provide a way to create and share audio video and screen recordings within any channel or dm in slack asynchronously this means that users can send messages video or otherwise to watch and respond to whenever it s most convenient for them it is also expanding slack connect plans slack connect brings communication out of siloed email inboxes into channels so teams can work quickly and collaboratively with outside organizations so far this has been limited by the fact that it hasn t worked with companies on free plans now workers on paid plans will be able to connect with those on free plans opening slack to whole new range of workers for the public sector slack is also releasing govslack a version of slack that runs in a government certified cloud environment and provides the same slack experience while complying with the security and operational requirements of the federal government including fedramp high and dod il4 certifications salesforce closed its 27 7 billion deal to buy slack in july while this has been going on microsoft has been pulling teams deeper into the heart of the digital workplace and both google and facebook have been adding to their productivity offerings whether slack can or will add enough functionality to keep it interesting remains to be seen but what does seem certain at least from this year s dreamforce is that salesforce seems committed to its continued development in the space here comes microsoft office 2021 the release of a new version of microsoft office in the past was always a big date in the enterprise technology space since the emergence of office 365 and the constant updates to office its less of an event now that it was even still it s worth noting last week redmond wash based microsoft announced the release of its latest perpetual version of microsoft office for commercial customers it also promised an office 2021 consumer release in october the new commercial version or microsoft office long term servicing channel ltsc for windows and mac is now available and offers a version that does not need an ongoing subscription while there is little reason for most enterprises to buy one of these permanent licenses given the functionality and the apps that are now available through office 365 for regulated industries where the enterprise stack needs to be kept away from online prowlers the perpetual license is the best solution there are disadvantages though the perpetual versions wont ship with the ai driven features that you find in office 365 and microsoft 365 while many of the new features that regularly come online for office 365 users won t be available either the perpetual release is also considerably slower than the online release in a post about it microsoft explains office ltsc 2021 is separate from office that s available through microsoft 365 or office 365 plans for example if you ve deployed microsoft 365 apps for enterprise previously named office 365 proplus to the users in your organization you don t need office ltsc 2021 you already have all the features that are included in office ltsc 2021 along with many more features that aren t in office ltsc 2021 it also comes with teams according to microsoft office ltsc 2021 includes the teams client app when the user launches the teams client app they ll be prompted to sign in users whose azure active directory account is linked to an existing teams microsoft 365 or office 365 service plan will be able to use that account to sign into their existing licensed version of the teams service users without an existing license for teams will be able to use the free or the exploratory service for microsoft teams the consumer office 2021 perpetual release will be very similar offering a locked in time release without feature updates microsoft hasn t yet detailed pricing for office 2021 but the company says it will be
