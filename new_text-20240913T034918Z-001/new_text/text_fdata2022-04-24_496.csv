in 1980 mustangs camaros or corvettes were rolling around with v8s that could barely go over 150 horses and the future didn t look too bright however a glimmer of hope came from the unlikely partnership between ford and mclaren that resulted in 10 wild fox bodies due to the oil crises of the 1970s that crippled the economy and led to stricter emission regulations the muscle car era seemed like a distant dream to sell new cars detroit s major corporation had to improvise especially since people were getting tired of the economy focused models that bored them to death at ford talks centered around making the third gen mustang even more appealing introduced in 1978 it was an improvement over the hideous pinto based model that helped keep the company alive during the first half of the 1970s and like its hideous predecessor the fox body stang was selling like hotcakes in 1979 dealers sold a whopping 369 936 units the sixth best sales year in the history of the nameplate but there was room for more so how can you make the car even more popular build a ludicrous performance model of course we all know that this endeavor led to the creation of the special vehicle operations department and the 1984 mustang svo which was a terrific yet underrated limited production car but the ludicrous performance model i m alluding to was born several years earlier and it donned mclaren badges photo ford motor co it all starts in 1980 when representatives of a marketing firm commissioned by ford to explore the feasibility of a thoroughbred performance variant approached mclaren s american division based in livonia michigan with the idea of creating an imsa spec race car and a series of closely related street legal versions the idea quickly became the ford sanctioned m81 project and in 1981 the race car made its debut at daytona with drivers tom klauser and john morton taking turns behind the wheel the mclaren engineered mustang managed to finish the 24 hour race despite a crash in the early hours of the event it crossed the finish line 21st but made headlines all across the globe for being patched up using countless rolls of duct tape back in livonia mclaren engineers had finished 10 road worthy cars all heavily resembling the daytona car hand built from production on the stock hatchbacks that were previously stripped to the bare chassis they featured bulging fender flairs grille less front ends imsa style fiberglass hoods with massive scoops and bbs wheels wrapped in firestone hpr tires in addition mclaren engineers beefed up the suspension with fully adjustable koni shocks stiffer springs and sturdier anti roll bars with tungsten bushings taken from the fairmont police cruiser inside the cars were equipped with a roll cage recaro ls bucket seats stewart warner instrumentation and a racemark steering wheel unlike their competition spec sibling that was powered by a legendary cosworth bda the street mustang mclarens were fitted with the 2 3 liter turbocharged inline four that ford wanted to promote to its v8 loving customers linked to four speed manuals these units were blueprinted received ported heads and everything was meticulously fine tuned by the engineering team with performance and reliability in mind to comply with emission regulations boost was limited to 5 psi 0 34 bar so the rated output stood at only 132 hp the same figure as the standard spec 2 3 liter turbos however the engines were more than capable of handling a lot more two of the cars were fitted with boost gauges and their turbos could go all the way up to 10 psi 0 69 bar which translated into close to 180 ponies legend has it that with more time and money mclaren could have pushed the four cylinder well over the 200 hp mark making it more powerful than ford s 5 0 v8 but unfortunately that never happened although the blue oval s decision makers were extremely pleased with the m81 project and a limited production run of 249 units was seriously considered they ultimately chose to redirect funds to the svo division which was also developing a performance oriented stang the completed cars were sold for 25 000 79 000 today each and now and again one goes under the hammer in 2020 chassis number 0f03a308227 was sold at a barrett jackson event for only 37 400 by today s standards calling the mustang mclaren m81 a performance car is laughable its output figure wasn t particularly mind blowing four decades ago either but it is unquestionably the wildest looking fox body of them all it helped pave the way for the fantastic svo that hit the streets in 1984 and we can only wonder what could have transpired if ford would have signed off on further development
april 24 2022 04 50 am updated april 25 2022 07 37 am ist the story so far on friday tamil nadu chief minister m k stalin wrote to prime minister narendra modi requesting him to ensure adequate supply of coal to the power generating units in the state in maharashtra deputy chief minister ajit pawar said the state government planned to import coal to cope with the power crisis the other top power consuming state in the country gujarat is also planning to import coal according to reports decline in coal stocks and the resulting power outages in several states have spurred queries of renewable energy s potential to fill in for the conventional resource earlier this week coal stocks in more than 100 thermal power plants in india fell below the critical mark less than 25 of the required stock while it was less than 10 in over 50 plants across india on saturday the minister for coal and mines pralhad joshi said at present 72 5 million tonnes mt of coal is available at different sources of coal india singareni collieries and coal washeries and 22 01 mt with thermal power plants there is sufficient coal availability in the country to last over a month which is being replenished daily with record production he tweeted is there a coal crisis coal accounts for 55 of the country s energy needs according to mr joshi the india energy outlook 2021 report of the international energy agency iea said energy use in india has doubled since 2000 with 80 of demand still being met by coal oil and solid biomass pandemic related disruptions however prevented the stock up of coal mining operations were halted to curb the spread of the virus despite the gradual easing into operations mining activities were hampered during the monsoons delaying arrival of stocks with household demand for power picking up and the arrival of summer combined with the sudden acceleration in economic activity it has resulted in a demand supply mismatch the country had experienced a similar situation last october but with peak summer approaching the coal stock situation is more worrisome now because demand for power will be high the energy demand will go up as urbanisation and the population increase the iea estimates that despite the shock from covid 19 india s demand is expected to grow by almost 5 a year till 2040 what is the consumption pattern coal is abundantly available has shorter gestation periods and coal based plants have lower capital costs than hydel and nuclear plants therefore making it the most viable enabler of energy security in the country the conventional resource s capacity addition is further helped by the increased participation of the private sector in power generation in washington recently finance minister nirmala sitharaman said india s move away from coal will be hampered by the war in ukraine at the recently concluded budget session mr joshi said despite push for renewables country will require base load capacity of coal based generation for stability and also for energy security where does india stand on renewable energy sources the report of the central electricity authority on optimal generation capacity mix for 2029 30 estimates that the share of renewable energy in the gross electricity generation is expected to be around 40 by that financial year the union government has spent 3 793 crore until march 14 in 2021 22 for implementing varied renewable energy related schemes and programmes a total of 152 90 gw of renewable energy capacity has been installed in the country as on february 28 as per government figures this includes 50 78 gw from solar power 40 13 gw from wind power 10 63 gw from bio power 4 84 gw from small hydel power and 46 52 gw from large hydel power in accordance with the prime minister s announcement at cop26 the 2021 united nations climate change conference the ministry of new and renewable energy aspires to install 500 gw of electricity capacity from non fossil fuel sources by 2030 in 2020 21 as per the cea 1 381 83 billion units bu was generated in total of which renewable energy sources share was 297 55 bu representing 21 5 of the overall generation up to august 2021 the share stood at 24 over the next 10 years the strong growth of renewables is not sufficient in the stated policies scenario to keep up with the projected pace of electricity demand growth and coal fired power generation makes up the difference the iea said in its report on india what are the challenges the capacity of a plant does not necessarily translate into the actual power it generates for the grid some of it is lost owing to external factors such as heat or transmission losses this applies for both renewable and conventional sources solar and wind energy are variable resources with variability being particularly exposed during periods of peak demand for example solar energy is abundantly available during daytime in summers however the domestic consumption peaks in the evenings when we turn on the air conditioner after returning from work with no sunlight outside then energy requirement and supply face a mismatch another dimension to it is the seasonal variation in monsoons solar energy is barely available with wind energy available in abundance another factor is spatial variability regions near coastal areas enjoy more wind and therefore possess greater ability to produce wind energy like gujarat in comparison to states which are drier and experience more sunlight like rajasthan use of renewable energy therefore would essentially require a balancing act what about transmission and storage transmission and storage are central to addressing variability issues they help cope with the duck curve power demand among consumers in india resembling a duck the curve is a graphical representation exhibiting the difference between the demand and availability of energy through the day with both wind and solar being variable sources it becomes imperative to establish a complementing model this would require import and export technologies between states as well as optimising the trade between those with differing demand and production profiles thermal plants in the eastern region by contrast provide flexibility for demand centres to the south and west which have high industrial and agricultural loads and may call on imports during periods of low renewables availability iea says they further add india s national infrastructure has not been designed to account for so much variability in energy generation the grid is accustomed to consistent supply from thermal power plants which is diametrically opposed to the erratic generation from solar pv wind turbines and other renewables how will the cost factor work transition to renewable energy would depend a lot on inculcating energy efficient behaviour such as operating acs both for commercial and domestic usage more flexibly through the day and opting for energy efficient products cooling systems emerge as a utility during summers the usage however is divided between higher and lower income households with the former being more economically secure opting to run them all through the day a demand response programme in the direction would help address such issues keeping external factors constant further lifestyle changes to reduce energy demand too would be essential an example here could be japan s cool biz campaign permitting employees to wear light and casual clothes at work instead of the conventional jackets and tie in order to reduce the need for air conditioning as per government data india has seen record low tariffs of 1 99 per kwh for solar power and 2 43 per kwh for wind power much cheaper in comparison to electricity produced from conventional sources

the collapse of the share price of netflix last week carries a wider message for investors in the us high tech giants it is that successful and fashionable companies can stop their headlong run of growth and become well more like the rest of the global commercial pack and when that happens the basis on which they are valued changes instead of being rated for their imagined future prospects they will be rated for their current profitability they will probably go on being successful but they will have to prove their worth to a more sceptical investment community sceptical the collapse of the share price of netflix last week carries a wider message for investors in the us high tech giants the netflix story is simple enough it pioneered online streaming then used that position to generate wonderful content including of course bridgerton but to justify its valuation it had to keep piling on subscribers when that growth faltered its share price collapsed in november last year its shares were worth 700 each on friday the price was below 215 it is still a great company worth 100billion 75billion about the same as bp but if you bought its shares last november you would be feeling a bit sore now think more widely about the high tech giants they are all different but all play major parts in the daily lives of just about all of us apple the most valuable of the lot is currently worth 2 7trillion well down from the 3trillion peak at the beginning of this year that works out as a fall of more than 8 per cent its rival microsoft is down nearly 16 per cent amazon by more than 12 per cent alphabet parent of google by nearly 14 per cent and meta parent of facebook a massive 43 per cent tesla for all the hype about elon musk is down 16 per cent so far these are beefy declines mitigated only slightly for uk and european investors by the climb in the dollar so what has happened to the ftse100 index this year on friday it closed at 7 522 actually a tiny bit up on its opening level of 7 505 on january 4 the decline in valuations of the us high tech giants does not mean they will decline commercially they may go on doing very well it is just that a sensible valuation for apple may be 2trillion not 3trillion the change is one of mood what has led to that well the obvious answer is that money is no longer free the central banks have belatedly started to increase their interest rates but the bond markets are way ahead of them last week the ten year gilt yield nudged above 2 per cent in inter day trading the highest since 2015 the us ten year treasuries were trading just under 3 per cent german government ten year bonds were just under 1 per cent the highest since 2014 that may not sound a lot but early last month the yield was negative the sharpest example of the shift in market sentiment is what has happened to spacs special purpose acquisition companies you may remember they were all the rage a year ago companies floated mostly in new york to buy other companies without disclosing what those companies might be they have been dubbed blank cheque companies with some justification well they are still around and the number of spac mergers or acquisitions peaked at 104 in the last quarter of 2021 however now they have fallen back to 66 in the first three months of this year there are hundreds of spacs that have failed to find anyone to buy or partner with regulation is being tightened and the boom is past so if high tech america is losing its lustre and frothy concepts such as spacs are no longer fashionable what do you do where is safety there is no easy answer except to say that the traditional safe haven of bonds is absolutely not the place to be no one knows how fast the climb in bond yields will be and how far it will go but since the price of bonds moves inversely to the yield there is a near certainty that buyers will lose money the most helpful thing to note is that on a very long view global equities have produced a real return of about 5 per cent in the uk and 6 per cent in the us there are scores of large enterprises around the world providing our daily needs and those with established brands should be able to increase their prices enough to fight their way through this surge in costs not glamorous but we need toothpaste even if we don t need a subscription to netflix
north carolina is one of 13 states that have no legal avenue for the use of medical marijuana much less the sale and distribution of recreational cannabis that hasn t deterred a 100 year old raleigh bank west town bank trust from launching last week a dedicated cannabis cbd banking program that officials believe will have national appeal the program represents an extension of the bank s mission to make financial services more accessible to emerging and underserved industries as one of the first banks to roll out a hemp banking program in 2019 after the 2018 federal farm bill we witnessed first hand the role dedicated banking programs played in advancing the entire industry ross sloan west town s senior vice president of hemp cannabis banking said in a news release wednesday the cannabis banking team is made up of seven certified financial service professionals we re excited to do the same for cannabis businesses offering them the banking services they need to fuel not only their growth but the growth of the entire cannabis industry sloan said west town s work with hemp cbd oil businesses already has made it stand out within the industry cbdadvertisingagency com wrote that west town is probably one of the banks that is most dedicated to the hemp business the company has a special program focused on cannabis entrepreneurs you will get the same services as if you were a regular business west town relies on its innovative platform to create actionable solutions for cannabis businesses cbdadvertisingagency com said that with the emergence of cbd we have also seen the emergence of cbd friendly banks even though america doesn t have a sound legal system that would allow for rapid expansion of the industry by itself hemp products are pretty controversial and until recently most banks regarded them as high risk there are also major legal and regulatory differences from state to state making it really hard to sell and transport cbd across the us this caused issues for cbd businesses as well even if you got a loan you had to pay enormous interest reach spreading recreational use of cannabis has legal status in 18 states primarily blue and purple states but also red states alaska and montana because federal law forbids recreational use of marijuana most cannabis businesses struggle to find financial institutions willing to provide traditional business products that leaves most of the businesses to operate without bank accounts or electronic payments while some rely on third party groups that collaborate with federal deposit insurance corp insured banks behind closed doors west town said without banks the cannabis industry must by necessity be an all cash business that means no electronic payments no credit and debit card transactions no access to bank depository and safekeeping services no audit control and payments tracing services and other oversight requirements since federal law prohibits the sale and use of marijuana national banks like wells fargo may not knowingly bank or provide services to marijuana businesses or for related activities wells fargo said in a statement truist financial corp said in a statement that as federally regulated bank we abide by all applicable federal laws and regulations as the production distribution and sale of marijuana is illegal under federal law truist cannot provide banking services to those engaged in these activities we recognize this is a complex issue for the banking industry and we welcome clarity from lawmakers and regulators as more states consider legalizing marijuana for medical and recreational purposes physical threats the challenges of such financial limitations for cannabis businesses are not only risky revenue wise but physically as well just last week the associated press reported that dozens of cannabis businesses in the san francisco bay area were robbed last fall in a wave of attacks that sometimes appeared coordinated industry trackers in washington state have reported at least 80 robberies so far this year mostly in the puget sound region for example ap reported that in march a suspect shot and killed an employee at a cannabis store in tacoma an id checker shot and killed a robber in covington seattle police shot and killed a suspect following a robbery in bellevue and a robber pistol whipped a worker at an everett shop ap also reported that marijuana shops that can afford it have hired private security guards sometimes at costs of more than 50 000 a month for a round the clock detail said adán espino executive director of the craft cannabis coalition espino said he s pushing for state lawmakers to give tax credits to cannabis stores that have to shell out money for security industry support the lack of dependable financial services stunts the industry s potential for growth profitability and increased consumer trust according to west town the federal uncertainty about legal cannabis use and the often piecemeal state regulatory approaches have led the american bankers association and most state banking commissions including in north carolina to lend their support to the latest push for the federal safe banking act that was submitted initially in 2013 the bill would keep federal regulators from penalizing banks that work with licensed cannabis businesses the state bankers association has written the u s senate banking housing and urban affairs committee to conduct hearings on the merits of providing cannabis related businesses access to banking services the associations stress that although we do not take a position on the legalization of marijuana our members are committed to serving the financial needs of their communities including those that have voted to legalize cannabis we believe federal action is necessary and support a solution that would allow banks to serve cannabis related businesses in states where the activity is legal the associations wrote that leaving the cannabis industry unbanked presents serious public safety revenue administration and legal compliance concerns and must be remedied immediately these businesses also must remit payments for state taxes and licensing fees in cash denying the states the efficiencies and safety of more modern payment methods from the financial institutions perspective the associations wrote that because revenue paid to them by cannabis businesses can be considered monies derived from illegal activities financial institutions that bank the unrelated businesses can be accused of violating anti money laundering laws if banks are forced to discontinue relationships with these unrelated businesses a significant portion of the economy in states where cannabis is legal will be cut off from the regulated banking system the american bankers association cited similar points to the associations while stressing the indirect benefits of federal cannabis legislation for vendors and suppliers landlords and employees indirect connections to marijuana revenues are hard if not impossible for banks to identify and avoid the aba wrote to the same senate committee while aba takes no position on the moral issues raised by legalizing aba believes the time has come for congress and the regulatory agencies to provide greater legal clarity to banks operating in states where marijuana has been legalized for medical or adult use medical marijuana bill because north carolina law doesn t permit the use of recreational marijuana and most medicinal purposes the legislative spotlight is squarely on bipartisan senate bill 711 titled nc compassionate care act the bill advanced through three senate committees during the 2021 session before stalling in the gateway rules and operations committee in august it is projected to resurface early in the 2022 session sb711 s odds of clearing the senate are considered promising given that sen bill rabon r brunswick and chairman of rules committee is one of its three primary sponsors the pathway through the state house could be equally daunting if not more so according to political analysts the bill requires the medical marijuana system be self sustaining from a revenue perspective following initial money to set up the system the funding would come mostly from license fees and a monthly fee equal to 10 of the gross revenue derived from the products sold at the medical cannabis centers opponents who included sen joyce krawiec r forsyth expressed concern that sb711 will serve as a gateway to legalized marijuana in north carolina by 2024 that the licensing fee for vendors is too low that a license should not be allowed to be sold and that the potential profit levels need to be lowered rabon a cancer survivor has said sb711 would not serve as a gateway to recreational marijuana use the bill previously was amended to reduce the number of medical cannabis centers from eight to four two of which would be located in one of the state s 20 tier 1 counties likely mecklenburg and in the triangle forsyth and guilford counties are in tier 2 reactions banking analysts are mixed about whether the federal law if approved would entice more mainstream financial institutions to serve the hemp and cannabis industries the short answer is yes said bowman gray iv a local independent stock broker at this point the big banks are in the best position to lobby the government for these changes and they should lean hard gray said the main hurdle is that without federal standards for all things related to cannabis product regulation and standardization to uniform banking rules it is extremely difficult for the larger banks to be able to stay in compliance with laws that differ from state to state the federal government needs to step up to clear the way for an industry with such huge potential all aspects from financial regulation to legalized use to criminal justice reform etc the list is long and i don t think it can wait much longer zagros madjd sadjadi an economics professor at winston salem state university said he doubts that large mainstream banks such as bank of america corp truist and wells would embrace serving the hemp and cannabis industries however madjd sadjadi said he could envision td bank group getting involved td based in toronto is pursuing regulatory and shareholder approval of its 13 4 billion offer for first horizon corp of memphis tenn which has a sizable branch presence in the triad marijuana is fully legal in canada and thus financing could be arranged potentially through the canadian parent company especially if it was lending to a canadian subsidiary of an american company madjd sadjadi said since they lend in both u s dollars and canadian dollars a canadian bank might be a first mover into this space however madjd sadjadi cautioned this scenario might still have significant issues if the u s federal government tried to push back especially with the onerous regulations that the u s has tried to impose on foreign lenders in an effort to collect more taxes from american taxpayers with accounts in other countries tony plath a retired finance professor at unc charlotte said it s time for prudentially regulated banks to embrace what is in many jurisdictions a legal industry the problem lies with our schizophrenic legal regulatory and political systems that make marijuana possession and usage in several states quite legal while said possession and use remain most illegal in other jurisdictions like north carolina as well as at the federal level plath said that since absolutely no federally insured bank seeks to break federal law in the first place the former choice wins hands down over the latter leaving just about all of the cannabis industry unbanked in the traditional sense now stop for a moment and think about the secondary and tertiary consequences of leaving a popular and growing industry without access to mainstream american banks and the payments and loan services they provide either this stuff becomes a legal and legitimate product at the federal level which is consistent with contemporary social attitudes and mores in practically every jurisdiction of the country or it should remain illegal everywhere in the country
in california mexican restaurants can be found on almost every street corner so when brandon stephens moved from san francisco to the uk he felt that something was missing that was in 2003 mexican food certainly existed over here but it seemed as if nothing quite replicated the wholesome fare he was used to back home an entrepreneur by nature stephens decided to fill in the gap himself in 2007 he opened the first tortilla mexican grill restaurant selling burritos pancake like wraps rolled around a variety of tasty fillings it s a wrap meals at tortilla where customers can build their own burritos are a healthy step up from fast food today there are more than 50 tortilla restaurants dotted across great britain and a further nine in the middle east the company was floated on aim in october last year at 1 81 a share but the price has since drifted down to 1 63 the decline seems unjust tortilla is a fast growing and popular chain that has proved its resilience over the past couple of years and is likely to double in size over the next five years the tortilla offering is simple a step up from fast food joints but cheaper and less formal than most restaurants meals typically cost 8 to 9 and customers can build their own burrito choosing fillings from healthy chicken and salad to more indulgent options stuffed with sour cream and cheese about 70 per cent of the food is prepared in a giant central kitchen in north london and shipped out daily to the restaurants themselves spicy salsas and guacamole are then made in individual sites according to strict specifications the simplicity of the food means that tortilla does not need to hire chefs instead training young workers to marinate and put together ingredients the group has therefore managed to avoid much of the staffing pressure felt by other restaurants particularly as it pays decent wages and makes a genuine effort to treat employees well with tasty food low costs and well trained staff tortilla was making steady progress when the covid 19 pandemic erupted and the uk went into lockdown with every restaurant in the country closing its doors to diners by that time stephens had stepped down from the top job making way for richard morris a veteran of the restaurant industry with decades of experience both here and in america a few weeks into the lockdown morris noticed that some eateries had reopened serving deliveries and takeaways only spotting an opportunity morris did likewise sales soared as hungry consumers keen for a break from home cooking ordered burritos tacos and nachos in droves sales grew new stores were opened and tortilla found itself with thousands more customers than in pre pandemic times the company had also branched out into the franchise world setting up partnerships with ssp which runs eateries in airports and stations merlin entertainments which runs chessington world of adventures and eathos a restaurant chain in the middle east a flotation seemed timely particularly as restaurant and retail closures had left landlords eager to fill vacant sites and prepared to do attractive deals with robust businesses emma woods former boss at wagamama then joined the board as chairwoman adding her experience to morris s turnover soared last year and brokers expect further strong growth suggesting that sales will be up nearly 20 per cent to 57million for 2022 and will be more than 78million by 2024 profits of 3 8million are forecast for this year rising to nearly 5million in two years growth is likely to come from three sources the existing estate new openings and more franchise operations the deal with ssp already has several sites including a tortilla at gatwick airport and earlier this year morris signed a franchise deal with catering giant compass which intends to open tortilla sites on more than a dozen university campuses the group is also better able to weather inflationary and economic pressure than many peers its energy costs are relatively low it has secured competitive arrangements with suppliers and can tweak ingredients if need be meals are reasonably priced so likely to remain affordable even if belts need to be tightened midas verdict the world may seem an uncertain place right now but people still need to eat and tortilla offers a chance to enjoy well priced mexican fare in a bright and cheerful restaurant or in the comfort of their own home the shares have had a lacklustre debut on the stock market but this does not reflect the group s current performance or prospects at 1 63 the stock is a buy traded on aim ticker mex contact tortillagroup co uk or 020 7637 4015

stock indices finally got the message from the credit markets and they didn t like it interest rates across the curve have been surging higher since december with the rate of change accelerating since early march but the leading stock indices remained no more than a few percentage points away from all time highs late this week with fed officials and analysts talking about bigger and bigger rate hikes the alarm bell finally rang and the dow dropped 1 700 points from thursday s high to friday s low creating a bearish weekly key reversal on the chart perhaps some fund managers expect that fed tightening will be transitory because sharply higher interest rates will precipitate a recession and the fed will quickly back off we ve seen rotation inside the stock market from growth to defensive sectors but this week even the defensive sectors got hit the bond that didn t bounce late this week after a brutal four month decline bonds couldn t even sustain a bounce while the stock market was getting hammered negative sentiment is extreme in the bond market soaring american interest rates drive the us dollar to new highs the usdx had its highest weekly close except for one week during the covid panic in five years this week i keep repeating capital comes to america for safety and opportunity the yen reversed from an uptrend to a downtrend in early january last year in my blog early last year i often referred to the us dollar inflection point that occurred when the us capitol building was stormed on january 6 2021 the yen has fallen 20 against the usd since january 2021 and has dropped 10 in the last seven weeks it is now at a 20 year low vs the usd inflation in japan has been benign relative to many other countries and the boj is determined to keep bond yields from rising they have created trillions of new yen to fund their unlimited buying of japanese bonds and this increase in the supply of yen together with ever widening spreads against american yields has killed the yen the dramatic plunge in the yen s value has dramatically increased import costs which will feed through to higher japanese inflation levels from a trader s perspective the whole world is short yen shorting japanese bonds has been a widow maker trade for the past two decades but if the pain of a tumbling yen and sharply rising domestic inflation motivates the boj to finally allow bond yields to increase then the yen could soar btw gold is at an ath in yen terms the korean won closed this week at a 13 year low vs the usd down 13 from january 2021 korea needs to stay competitive with japan the chinese offshore renminbi had its biggest weekly tumble against the usd since the covid panic this chart shows how many rmb are needed to buy one us dollar rising prices mean the rmb is falling the eurusd closed at its lowest level this week since the covid panic down 12 from the january 2021 inflection point the ecb remains reluctant to raise interest rates there is a french election this sunday and the war in ukraine continues the canadian dollar briefly rallied above 80 cents on a stronger than expected cpi report on wednesday another reason for the boc to remain hawkish but reversed sharply thursday friday as the overall market tone went distinctly risk off the cadusd has closed lower each of the past four weeks with a bearish weekly key reversal this week the toronto stock index has been one of the strongest in the world ytd perhaps investors saw it as a play on commodities but was battered thursday friday gold fell 75 from monday highs to friday lows a surging us dollar and sharply higher interest rates are usually kryptonite for the gold market the gold miners etf and the junior gold miners etf made new multi month highs monday but closed on their lows friday generating weekly key reversals on the chart martin murenbeeld has been writing the gold monitor for 40 years his clients are the who s who of global gold producers and institutional investors his short term gold pricing models which depend very much upon the usd and the tips yield suggest that the ukraine war premium may be 300 his longer term models indicate that gold is fairly priced at 1950 corn traded above 8 for only the 2nd time in history grains and oilseeds have been rallying along with other commodities since the 20 year lows made during the covid panic their rally was super charged by the russian invasion of ukraine and subsequent malthusian stories of widespread starvation energy shares have been the hottest stock market sector ytd the stock market rout was so bad thursday friday that even the energy sector fell wti crude oil spiked to 130 when russia was hit with sanctions but quickly fell back to trade around 100 despite a powerful bullish narrative for future prices i ve been skeptical about the idea that the flow of oil from russia will be reduced to a trickle read the king of oil about marc rich and you might agree with me that oil finds a way to get to markets this wsj story describes one way russian oil is now finding a way to world markets nat gas looks like another market that took a speculative run on a bullish narrative but then stumbled hard when genuine sellers showed up my short term trading i made money early in the week with long positions in s p t notes and yen i couldn t get turned around fast enough to short the stock market thursday friday so i missed that huge move on thursday i shorted cad above 80 cents and covered it a few hours later for a 45 point gain if i had stayed with the trade the cad fell another 100 points friday i gave back some of my early week profits by buying t notes and yen on friday looking for a bounce as stocks tumbled but that didn t happen so i closed the positions for small losses to go into the weekend flat my p l was up 1 5 on the week how much is already in the price in the quotes section of my april 2nd blog i quoted my friend kevin muir the macrotourist saying sometimes the most difficult part of investing is not figuring out what will occur but what s already priced in on thursday evening i watched a great rtv video with jim bianco making the point that the stock market was not pricing in the same steep rise in interest rates that the credit markets were jim declared that many money managers probably thought the fed would tighten a bit and then back off if the stock market and or the economy weakened due to higher rates given the steep stock market tumble on friday we can assume that the stock market is starting to price in a steep rise in interest rates so now what i m always looking for market opportunities like the one jim described where something is not priced in or where something is more than fully priced in i love to look for reversals especially when a pervasive and convincing narrative has been wholeheartedly embraced a lot of inflation is surging higher and the central banks will raise interest rates quickly to cool inflation before it gets out of control is already priced into markets especially bond yields and exchange rates bond yields and the usd may continue to trend higher they may have a modest short lived correction and be much higher a few months from now i don t know but i ll be watching for reversals for my short term trading my long time friend ross clark has done terrific technical analysis for decades and he currently sees daily and weekly capitulations in the bond market i won t buy a market just because i think it has gone down too far too fast i need to see some signs of a turn first i bought both t notes and yen early this week when they started to bounce but i took profits quickly when the bounce ran out of steam i ll be looking for opportunities to buy t notes and yen next week quotes no government in the world has enough money to be able to affect the transition we need to affect to move us much more rapidly into sustainable energy postures in our nations europe is probably the lead on the planet in terms of the efforts it s making europe has had no choice but to understand they ve got to move off of russian fossil fuels as fast as they possibly can and to their credit they ve really taken the

the senate the soft connective tissue that cushions impact between opposing joints but in recent years that cartilage has been ground to a nub all movement has become bone on bone our ideas grate

allies were facing legal battles and investigations some of which the president has been implicated in if you want to you can blow it way out of proportion you can do a lot of things since he s become

nature we can transcend our tribal instincts and preserve our democracy for future generations hatch said in his final speech on the senate floor that we may do so is my humble prayer
cambridge commentators have generally offered two arguments about advanced economies performance since covid 19 struck only one of which can be true the first is that the economic rebound has been surprisingly rapid outpacing what forecasters expected and setting this recovery apart from the aftermath of previous recessions the second argument is that inflation has reached its recent heights because of unexpected supply side developments including supply chain issues like semiconductor shortages an unexpectedly persistent shift from services to goods consumption a lag in people s return to the workforce and the persistence of the virus the first argument is more likely to be true than the second strong real inflation adjusted gdp growth suggests that economic activity has not been significantly hampered by supply issues and that the recent inflation is mostly driven by demand moreover there is reason to expect demand to remain very strong which means that inflation will persist to be sure inflationary pressures reflect both supply and demand factors the exact combination of which is unknowable but when considering the economy as a whole it is implausible that all the individual supply stories would add up to the generalised inflation we have seen it is far more likely that the increase in demand exceeds what the economy can produce leading to higher prices by definition price growth equals the growth of nominal output minus the growth of real output with a small difference due to compounding over the course of 2021 us real gdp grew by 5 5 per cent nominal gdp grew by around 11 5 per cent and gdp price growth thus came in at around 5 9 per cent for the oecd as a whole real gdp growth was slightly lower at 4 9 per cent and nominal gdp growth was 10 4 per cent yielding 5 2 per cent gdp price inflation recall that policymakers largely protected or increased disposable personal income at a time when consumption possibilities were constrained through most of 2020 if one considers these excess savings alongside the persistence of low interest rates through most of 2021 a rising stock market pent up demand and additional fiscal support the magnitude of the increase in nominal gdp is not particularly surprising in the united states discretionary fiscal stimulus totaled 2 trillion in the 2021 calendar year but nominal gdp was only 1 6 trillion higher than it was in 2019 if anything the surprise is that nominal spending was so constrained and that saving rates remained so elevated what about real gdp here we need to remember that all the supply side stories are different ways of saying that real output was constrained according to one common story consumption shifted from services to goods and because goods production is less responsive to market changes more inelastic it could not expand quickly enough another story is that labour supply was constrained by the pandemic and the policy response owing to weaknesses in labor supply in the us and to reductions in hours worked in europe and still other stories focus on particular markets like the reduction in microchip production or the snarling of us ports the problem with these accounts is not that they are false it is that they miss the most important story in economies that have also experienced surprisingly strong real gdp growth major economies have enjoyed faster recoveries than they did in the wake of the global financial crisis in fact the recovery in most countries was more v shaped than anything we have seen in decades growth in 2021 greatly outpaced what forecasters had expected at the end of 2020 when forecasters were already optimistic about covid 19 being eliminated overall the us economy grew 1 6 per cent annually from the end of 2019 to the end of 2021 which is only slightly lower than previous estimates of the economy s potential that is an amazing accomplishment considering all the headwinds that have reduced potential gdp lower immigration premature deaths reduced capital formation and the hysteresis associated with high unemployment the point is not that there are no supply chain issues ships really have piled up at ports and manufacturers really are holding up production for lack of microchips but this is not necessarily evidence of an adverse change in supply if we gave every household millions of dollars that too would lead to pileups at ports and overloaded manufacturers the fact that quantities are up so much judging by the volume at ports and the level of global microchip production not to mention the real gdp figures suggests that our problem is not mainly reduced supply but increased demand looking ahead there are some reasons to expect demand to cool but these will need to be weighed in the balance fiscal support is indeed winding down everywhere interest rates are starting to rise in the us and the united kingdom and will increase later this year in europe as well and equity markets have recently fallen back sharply but households still have substantial excess savings and the overall stance of monetary policy remains accommodative suggesting that demand will continue to be strong moreover with russia s war in ukraine there is now a genuinely large supply shock boosting inflation in the form of higher oil and gas prices especially in europe combine that with the increase in short run inflationary expectations and we should expect high inflation to stay with us for some time jason furman a former chair of president barack obama s council of economic advisers is professor

on the image cover a protestor wearing a mask of sri lankas president gotabaya rajapaksa performs during a protest against president rajapaksa in front of the presidential secretariat amid the country s economic crisis in colombo by darini rajasingham senanayake for vt sri lanka the writer dr darini rajasingham senanayake is a social and medical anthropologist based in colombo sri lanka links to gospa news articles have been added by our editorial staff in cherry blossom lined washington dc in the glare of global media last week sri lanka became the poster child of the international monetary fund s imf spring meetings the strategic indian ocean island s pathetic plight featured on major media and television channels that craft the global narrative with images of people in queues amid food fuel and medicine shortages due to its crashing currency soaring cost of living and arab spring style protests one of the wealthier nations in the south asia region and listed as a lower middle income county mic sri lanka with a population of 22 billion people had just defaulted on her debt payments for the first time in the country s history global media imaging of the scenic island nation s financial crisis served to affirm the relevance of the washington consensus and the fund albeit as the lender of last resorts the timing of the sri lanka rupee s crash against the exorbitantly privileged us dollar was as miraculous as the easter sunday hybrid war attacks in the tourism dependent island that targeted chinese owned shangri la and other luxury hotels which were mysteriously claimed by islamic state isis in 2019 meanwhile oxfam released the inequality kills report and called on the imf to abandon demands for austerity as a cost of living crisis drives up hunger and poverty worldwide its spokesperson noted that 87 percent of the international monetary fund s imf covid 19 loans require developing countries facing some of the world s worst humanitarian crises to adopt tough new austerity measures that will further exacerbate poverty and inequality the organization noted that the wealth of the world s 10 richest men doubled since the pandemic began while the incomes of 99 of humanity are worse off because of covid 19 263 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2022 due to the combined impact of covid 19 inequality and food and energy price inflation accelerated by the war in ukraine sri lanka s total debt is usd 51 billion and the country must pay usd 7 billion this year to international sovereign bond isb traders based in new york as noted by senior economist and head of the institute for policy studies ips dr dushni weerakoon for a comparative perspective elon musk offered to buy twitter for usd 43 billion in the same week the greatest transfer of wealth in human history transpired over the past two years while much of the world was in covid 19 lockdowns and global trade disrupted also resulting in speculation in commodities futures which were partly responsible for the spike in global food and fuel prices as noted by economist jayati ghosh is the exorbitantly privileged greenback weaponized against sanctions hit russia being used on other strategic emerging economies as a hybrid cold war envelops the world should the us dollar and its supporting financial architecture be dumped staged dollar shortage down grades and arab spring protests back on colombo s galle face seafront arab spring playbook style protests by youth enjoying their freedom after 2 years of covid lockdowns unfolded as part of the push to propel the colombo regime s pivot to washington dc usually anti government protests happen at the iconic independence square but the current protests were staged close to south asia s busiest sea port the colombo harbour and notably near the chinese built colombo port city while the protestors anonymously organized via social media called on the sri lankan president gotabaya rajapakse to go home they did not say gota go home to america the president after all was a us citizen until 2019 nor was debt cancellation or a debt jubilee on the agenda of the protestors some of whom held posters calling on the government to go to the imf in the hope of better financial management the imf had been painted as a savior by various economists and local think tanks as the drum beat to default intensified but the protestors had other creative solutions to the island s crisis of corruption and economic miss management a buy local products campaign to encourage citizens to support local manufacture and industry and stop consuming expensive imported luxury goods for instance some suggested a permanent halt of the practice of providing duty free car permits to politicians doctors university lecturers and the privileged professional class as well as abolishing various special health insurance schemes other protestors wanted to reverse the privatization of the national health care and education system and the sale of yugadhanavi power plant to a dubious american company called new fortress the latter had compromised sri lanka s energy security several protestors suggested marching to the us embassy and call on the us government to return all the assets of the dual us citizen and minister for economic disaster basil rajapakese in los angeles to pay down the national debt others called for accountability for those responsible for the central bank bond scams long term suggestions to grow the economy and develop the country were setting up research and development working groups on energy security ocean and mineral resources some academics supporting the protests suggested debt cancellation and cited the debt jubilee project that had earlier called on the imf and world bank to offer an immediate cancellation of all principal interest and charges due to the deadly economic toll of the world health organization s who covid 19 lockdowns in poor countries the jubilee project had also recommended that the g20 support moves by any country to stop making payments on debt to private external lenders and that new imf and world bank finance should be in the form of grants not loans and require other lenders to reprofile the debt where sustainability is uncertain or restructure their debt where it is unsustainable to help ensure money is used to support public policy priorities in response to the covid 19 crisis rather than to repay other lenders sovereign bond debt trap like lebanon once known as the paris of the middle east sri lanka is a relatively wealthy country in south asia and listed as a lower middle income country mic the strategic island is ahead of india pakistan bangladesh nepal and afghanistan on the saarc regional poverty count the country has always paid down its debt and had no previous history of default likewise its debt to gdp ratio another metric to determine the solvency of a county at 110 percent was not off the map although this is cited as one of the reasons for rating agency downgrades leading to difficulty borrowing to sustain debt servicing and default but this too may be kept in perspective the top ten countries with the highest debt to gdp ratio according to the world population review are while china has often been identified as the source of sri lanka s debt trap it is euro american based international sovereign bond isb traders whose names are kept secret that are mainly responsible for the default at this time the above map s colour coding may be miss leading since it is the green coded international sovereign bonds isb s and other financial markets that are the cause of sri lanka s debt default at this time sri lanka s bi lateral and multilateral donors which include the adb japan china and india have all indicated a desire to help donated food fuel and medicine to the cash strapped island and a willingness to delay debt payments due to them while the names and proportions of the national debt owned by various bi lateral donors and multi lateral agencies such as the adb world bank japan china each with around 10 percent and india around 4 percent were known however the names of the us and eu based isbs that own over 55 percent of the island s debt and which are part of the shadowy international financial system where black money is parked in off shore accounts which are primarily responsible for the debt trap and down grades are never disclosed isbs are the root cause of the sri lanka s default at this time this is a well kept secret hidden by the chinese debt trap propaganda narrative and by local economists and think tanks funded by usaid and eu grants in the final analysis downgrades by rating agencies are based on various and subjective considerations of confidence as stated by dr nishan de mel in the ability of the county to sustain debt when the imf determines that a country s debt is not sustainable the country needs to take steps to restore debt sustainability prior to imf lending the fund s country director masahiro nozaki said recently in a statement regarding sri lanka the imf does not differentiate between illiquidity and insolvency from a longer and wider perspective the question arises was sri lanka pumped and dumped by the washington consensus which up graded it to a lower middle income country mic in 1997 and then an upper mic in 2019 thus making it ineligible for low interest development aid which compelled borrowing on capital markets like other countries that are placed in the middle income country trap rating agencies and sovereign bond traders work in concert with the washington consensus and the oecd paris club of western aid donors and do not recognize the difference between illiquidity and insolvency it is increasingly evident that the island s debt crisis has many external dimensions and is not entirely internally driven arguably under most metrics sri lanka should not have been down graded to the point of default by rating agencies like moodys and fitch at this time the downgrades were principally due to the usd 7 billion payments due to us based bond traders like goldman saks black rock and vanguard asset managers blackrock inc and ashmore group plc are said to be among the creditors organizing in a group ahead of the talks and have hired law firm white case for advice ayres investment management llp decisionboundaries llc and perella weinberg lp are among firms seeking to provide financial advice to sri lanka s creditors sources said as the country heads towards a revamp of its 12 billion of external debt recent filings show major asset managers such as fidelity t rowe price and tiaa also hold some of the country s outstanding dollar bonds disregarding the difference between illiquidity and insolvency the drum beat and narrative of and for sri lanka s default was in the air for some time at least since the rejections of the millennium challenge corporation mcc compact as professor howard nicholas of the institute of social studies iss recently suggested in a lecture organized by the economic students association of the university of colombo alluding to geopolitics and the recent visit by us secretary for south and southeast asia victoria nuland to colombo the island s default seemed to followed a systematic deliberate and planned route to deliver sri lanka into imf s and washington s clutches default would effectively enable the imf s and foreign legal advisors to effectively takeover this strategic island nation s economic policy process and sri lanka would lose economic and social policy autonomy and sovereignty simultaneously the imf s aid conditionalities would enable washington to stave off a perceived china threat and likely make it impossible for sri lanka to source its oil gas and other energy requirements which are at the root of the current crisis at discount rates from sanctions hit russia has sri lanka become like ukraine a theater of us proxy war this time in the indian ocean region as the new cold war escalates however from a different perspective this island at the center of indian ocean sea lanes of communication sloc seems to suffer from a paradox of plenty or perhaps a geostrategic resource curse an unsinkable aircraft carrier asset stripping a strategic island former us under secretary for south and central asia alice g well a few years ago called sri lanka a valuable piece of real estate in the indian ocean and the country not long ago turned down a millennium challenge corporation mcc compact and a status of forces agreement sofa others have termed sri lanka an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the indian ocean more strategic than the chagos islands whose citizens were forcibly evicted by us marines in the early sixties in order to set up the diego garcia military base and cia black site which was recently green washed by the occupying british government as a marine protected areas mpa in february 2019 the international court of justice in the hague had ruled that the british and hence us occupation of chagos islands is illegal under international law as the island belongs to the government and people of mauritius in the context it is noteworthy that the sri lanka business times of april 17 2022 announced that the government heading into imf negotiations is hoping to raise us 8 billion from the lease or sale of valuable public assets to bolster its rapidly dwindling foreign reserves based on a report of a newly appointed economic advisory committee among the main items for sale or long lease were the katunayake international airport for 2 billion mattala airport for 300 million and ratmalana airport for 400 million the colombo north port development project was to be handed over for an investment of 600 million while colombo port city lands would be leased out at a total of 4 billion shares of sri lanka telecom will be sold at a price of 500 million and sri lanka insurance corporation shares for 300 million the strategic island s telecom frequencies important for cyber security 5g technology had been previously targeted like the island s land transport and energy sectors by the mcc divestment of non strategic state owned assets such as lands owned by sri lanka railways and sri lankan airlines has been suggested as a part of the government s multi pronged plan in the short term to improve their operational and financial efficiency while increasing the country s reserves position there is a difference between illiquidity and insolvency that has been ignored in the rush to monetize strategic transport energy land and cyber security assets in this island at the center of the indian ocean sloc moreover divesting strategic assets because of cultivated corruption in the targeted public institutions is tantamount to throwing the baby out with the bathwater questions arise as to who made the above valuations of sri lanka s strategic assets when and on what basis in the context of the island being deemed valuable real estate in the indian ocean sloc with extensive ocean and mineral resources including rare earth elements the island may actually suffer from a geostrategic resource curse that made it a donor darling in the past and the subject of various colonization projects in the name of development aid selling off strategic assets of the island that had been previously ear marked by mcc seems to be a pre condition for the lender of last resorts it is increasingly evident that the island s debt crisis has many external dimensions and is not entirely internally driven the strategic island has long been in the cross hairs of big power rivalry geopolitics of sri lanka s permanent crisis a staged default and the dollar weaponized the imf was gracious in washington and commended sri lanka s brand new finance minister ali sabry who was previously minister for lawfare for his dash to washington for a bailout and for the steps it has taken to stabilize the economy sri lanka was urged to apply for rapid financing instrument rfi having delayed debt restructuring for two years meanwhile indian finance minister nirmala sitharaman who was also in dc for the spring meetings made representations on behalf of her dear debt trapped southern neighbor india is a us quadrilateral group quad partner in america s confrontation with china in the free and open indo pacific the country was advised to find financial and legal advisers in 15 to 20 days to chart the restructuring and payments of debts that s accompanied by fiscal reforms and other points to meet the requirements of traditional multilateral lenders like the imf and wb sri lanka needs 4 billion this year to help ease shortages of food fuel and medicines as its foreign reserves dry up and it heads for a default notably absent at the imf meetings was the president s brother dual us citizen and ex minister of economic disaster who had staged and led sri lanka s default into washington s arms back in 2020 during covid 19 lockdowns the law of the land was changed to enable basil rajapakse s high school dropout known as mr 10 percent for seeking commissions and corrupt deals to enter parliament and head the covid 19 task force that directed 2 years of militarized covid lockdowns and excessive purchases of pfizer injections basil was supposed to lead the gosl delegation to the imf but had become a liability as questions are asked about the external actors behind sri lanka s staged defalut questions had been raised about foreign interests and hands behind sri lanka s crisis following pakistan prime ministers allegation of regime change operations in his country was the long planned and anticipated plunge of the sri lankan rupee against the exorbitantly privileged us dollar that came to pass just in time for the imf s spring meetings partly to preempt a rescue from china which has invested heavily in sri lanka in the final analysis questions arise if sri lanka ruled by a hybrid rajapakse family comprise of dual american citizens being targeted for hybrid economic warfare with the usd increasingly weaponized also against sanction hit russia and other emerging economies this is not just a theoretical question is the debt crisis staged by local and global networks of financial corruption at play in this strategic island in order to deliver sri lanka on a platter to washington and its consensus after all we live in a post covid 19 world where conspiracy theories increasingly seem to come true darini rajasingham senanayake the writer dr darini rajasingham senanayake is a social and medical anthropologist based in colombo sri lanka links to gospa news articles

even today amid a mounting exodus among those who can afford it and with its appeal diminished to businesses and newcomers california legendary state of american dreams continues to inspire optimism among progressive boosters laura tyson the longtime democratic economist now at the university of california at berkeley praises the state for creating the way forward to a more enlightened market capitalism like minded analysts tout silicon valley s massive wealth generation as evidence of progressivism s promise the los angeles times suggested approvingly that the biden administration s goal is to make america california again and despite dark prospects in november s midterm elections the president and his party still seem intent on proving it laura tyson distinguished professor of the graduate school chair board of trustees uc berkeley haas school blum center for developing economics speaks at the 2017 concordia annual summit at grand hyatt new york on sept 18 2017 paul morigi getty images for concordia summit but most californians according to recent surveys see things differently they point to rising poverty and inequality believe the state is in recession and that it is headed in the wrong direction parting with the state s cheerleaders the new york times ezra klein a reliable progressive and native californian says the golden state s failures are making liberals squirm reality may well be worse than even klein admits in a new report for chapman university my colleagues and i find california in a state of existential crisis losing both its middle aged and middle class while its poor population faces dimming prospects despite the state s myriad advantages research shows it plagued by economic immobility and inequality crushing housing and energy costs and a failing education system worse than just a case of progressive policies creating regressive outcomes it appears california is descending into something resembling modern day feudalism with the poor and weak trapped by policies subsidized by taxes paid by the rich and powerful journalist ezra klein attends the new yorker s david remnick hosts white house correspondents dinner weekend pre party at w hotel rooftop in washington on april 26 2013 dimitrios kambouris getty images for the new yorker california may conjure images of rodeo drive and malibu mansions in the public imagination but today the state suffers the highest cost adjusted poverty rate in the united states the poor and near poor constitute over one third well over 10 million of the state s residents according to the public policy institute of california los angeles by far the state s largest metropolitan area and once a magnet for middle class aspirations has one of the highest poverty rates among major u s cities a united way of california analysis shows that over 30 percent of residents lack sufficient income to cover basic living costs even after accounting for public assistance programs this includes half of latino and 40 percent of black residents some two thirds of noncitizen latinos live at or below the poverty line in california there is this idea of oh we care about the poor but on this metric we are literally the worst stanford university s mark duggan principal author of an economic comparison of california with texas told the san francisco chronicle the state s poverty and associated dysfunction are on full display in leading cities like los angeles and san francisco where a large underclass now inhabits the streets the once iconic locales having become poster children for urban dysfunction beyond massive homeless camps crime has become so bad that the lapd has warned tourists it can no longer protect them san francisco meanwhile suffers the highest property crime rate in the country businesses like walgreens have shut down numerous bay area locations due to rampant burglaries homelessness and crime increasingly dominate the state s political discourse particularly in these two deep blue bastions california also faces growing inequality by the gini index a measure of the distribution of income across a population california has the third highest inequality behind new york and louisiana and has experienced the fifth largest expansion of inequality since 2010 according to american community survey data california also suffers the widest gap between middle and upper middle income earners of any state tents housing the homeless line up in front of closed storefronts near downtown los angeles on feb 16 2022 frederic j brown afp via getty images once among the most egalitarian regions in the country silicon valley has become among the most segregated places in the country citylab has described the technology hub as a region of segregated innovation a trend becoming more pronounced according to recent research silicon valley now boasts its own underclass of those who clean its buildings and provide food service nearly 30 percent of its residents rely on public or private financial assistance similarly according to the brookings institution san francisco the technology industry s most important urban center has experienced the most rapid growth in inequality among the nation s large cities in the last decade the california budget and policy center has named the city first in california for economic inequality the average income of the top one percent of households in the city averages 3 6 million forty four times the average income of the bottom 99 percent which stands at 81 094 in a city and state with a high cost of living the situation is worse elsewhere in the state over the past decade more than 80 percent of california jobs paid under the median income and most under 40 000 annually a poverty wage in california worse yet as demonstrated in our analysis california lags all peer competitors texas arizona tennessee nevada washington and colorado in creating high wage jobs in fields like business and professional services as even tech growth begins to shift elsewhere the biggest losers in california have been those industries that historically provided the best opportunities for working class people manufacturing construction energy as well as agriculture the state s historic economic powerhouse on a per capita basis california builds only a fraction of the housing compared to its main rivals while corporate new investment suggests a new hoover institution study has shriveled to a rate one tenth texas and one sixteenth that of ohio the state s climate change policies however well intentioned have had a particularly devastating impact on manufacturing california s renewable energy push has generated high energy prices and the nation s least reliable power grid crippling an industry reliant on fossil fuels and a stable electric supply the state fell to 44th in the country in manufacturing sector employment growth last year its industrial new job creation has lagged competitors such as nevada kentucky michigan and florida even without adjusting for costs no california metro ranks in the u s top ten in terms of offering well paying blue collar jobs notes the new york times but four ventura los angeles san jose and san diego sit among the bottom ten under california s green agenda electricity has skyrocketed while its grid has become less stable foundation for research on equal opportunity as the environmentalist breakthrough institute summarizes it the state s climate agenda has created a new green jim crow era keeping more people particularly minorities in poverty housing policy has also hurt most of those who can least afford it california s state planning policies aim to reduce urban sprawl the shift to locales where costs are lower and the state is gaining migrants the heavily minority inland empire which has little political influence now has more people than the san francisco metropolitan area which dominates state politics but the former is unable to reverse any of these policies despite expectations by planners that limiting suburban growth would reduce prices for the masses and greenhouse emissions by encouraging density studies in vancouver canada and several other locations have shown the opposite they associate densification with higher land and housing prices california has the highest urban density of any state yet suffers the second highest housing costs and rents of any state except hawaii on this issue some media coverage appears to have been influenced by the pro density preferences of tech titans like mark zuckerberg facebook founder and ceo mark zuckerberg speaks during a panel talk at the 2020 munich security conference msc in munich on feb 15 2020 johannes simon getty images striving largely minority middle and working class families bear the brunt of such policies according to a recent american enterprise institute survey california is home to six of the nation s worst markets for first time homebuyers it would take more than 100 years for the median income household to save for a mortgage on a median priced home in san francisco los angeles or san jose the state now ranks 49th in homeownership rate producing far less new housing than competitive regions like arizona texas or florida a recent study by economist john husing found not one unionized construction worker can afford a median priced home in any coastal california county unable to buy their own home many working class families find themselves paying extraordinarily high rents with more than half of all renters shelling out in excess of 30 percent of household income the traditional definition of an outsized housing burden nearly four in ten california households meet or exceed this level not surprisingly one quarter is contemplating a move elsewhere high rents and house prices along with low wages also have produced the nation s highest level of overcrowding nor has densification brought the purported environmental benefits cited by california s champions at brookings and in the biden administration the pro density terner center projects that if california s cities followed the density guidelines at best the state would see a 1 percent reduction in emissions manifest education failures historically education was seen particularly among traditional liberals as critical to upward mobility for poor and working class people yet for decades the state s schools have underperformed national norms particularly for poor students since 1998 california has ranked on average 46th in 8th grade reading and mathematics subject area performance on the national assessment for educational progress naep the only comparable assessment between states nationwide this includes comparisons with demographically similar states like texas which spends less money per student today almost three of five california high schoolers are not prepared for either college or a career the percentages are far higher for latinos african americans and the economically disadvantaged among the 50 states california ranked 49th in the performance of poor largely minority students san francisco the epicenter of california s woke culture and site of the recent recall of several far left school board members suffers the worst scores for african americans of any county in the state these students are often unprepared for college at california state university where ethnic studies programs are now mandated the need for remedial courses or 40 percent of freshmen demonstrates a low level of preparedness in such basic skills as reading comprehension writing and mathematics some educators have decided to eliminate this problem by eliminating remedial classes california s model curriculum which focuses on how to build new possibilities for post imperial life that promotes collective narratives of transformative resistance may only exacerbate these problems by inculcating attitudes antithetical to those necessary to succeed in a highly competitive capitalist economy many california educators from the highest reaches of academia down to the grade school level champion equity in education over developing hard math skills and fostering excellence even basic life skills such as being on time are eschewed the san diego unified school district will no longer count such scruples as turning in work on time in grading and evaluation it may reduce the penalties for cheating this is justified as a way of redressing racial issues as many of the malefactors like most california students are from disadvantaged minority groups most californians support charter schools including nearly half of all democrats and three chapters of the southern california naacp san diego san bernardino and riverside the state s powerful teachers unions and the democrats they back oppose such education alternatives tech titans once focused on improving schools now seem less engaged this may make sense given the extent to which tech relies on global talent rather than recruiting locally in 2018 three quarters of the tech workforce in the bay area was foreign born a majority on short term non immigrant visas the answer to many of the problems plaguing california s struggling lower classes has been to throw more of the upper class s money at them michael bernick a former director of the state s employment development department says the culture for much of california driven by state politics is one of the benefits and now guaranteed income not a jobs strategy or expectation california is unlikely to be devoting the state s surplus driven largely by stock and property gains among the wealth as texas and other states do to attract businesses instead as bernick suggests the preference has been to boost the welfare state as it did in initiating record setting stimulus payments during the pandemic it is now contemplating handing out debit cards to cope with high energy prices created by the state s environmental policies andrew yang former democratic presidential candidate and founder of the forward party speaks during the milken institute global conference in beverly hills calif on oct 20 2021 patrick t fallon afp via getty images california s technology industry consists of staunch funders of the state s progressive democrats they may themselves be obsessed workaholics and living testaments to entrepreneurial capitalism but greg ferenstein who interviewed 147 digital company founders says most believe that an increasingly greater share of economic wealth will be generated by a smaller slice of very talented or original people everyone else will increasingly subsist on some combination of part time entrepreneurial gig work and government aid many prominent business people including those who made their fortunes in california such as zuckerberg pierre omidyar elon musk and sam altman founder of the y combinator have embraced the notion of a guaranteed wage that would cover the most critical bills democratic presidential candidate andrew yang s campaign was built around this concept in the interim people are fleeing the state demographer wendell cox notes that since 2000 california has lost 2 6 million net domestic migrants more than the current populations of san diego san francisco and anaheim combined in 2020 california accounted for 28 percent of all net domestic outmigration in the nation about 50 percent more than its share of the u s population california s net out migration equals the populations of san diego san francisco and anaheim combined chapman university california s population growth has fallen below the national average for the first time and the state appears to have even possibly lost population in the last two years the pandemic seems to have accelerated this movement last year california was home to three of the five large regions over one million with the highest percentage of population loss san francisco san jose and los angeles both san francisco and los angeles school districts face large decreases in enrollment the la district the state s largest projects a 20 percent cut in this decade this outmigration trend cannot be dismissed as white flight an analysis of minority population flows shows that latinos and african americans are settling increasingly west of the sierra particularly in the south texas and parts of the midwest similarly the foreign born population so critical to the state s economy has declined in los angeles over the past decade and stagnated in the bay area while swelling in places like dallas ft worth austin houston nashville and even midwestern cities like columbus des moines and indianapolis simply put california is in danger of losing its youthful mojo many of those leaving according to irs data come from young middle and working class families when these people leave birthrates plummet los angeles and san francisco rank last and second to last in birthrates among the 53 u s major metropolitan areas among california s big metros only riverside san bernardino exceeds the national average in women aged between 15 and 50 with births california s total fertility rate long above the national average is now the nation s 10th lowest los angeles county alone has lost three quarters of a million people under 25 over the past twenty years california today is as old as the rest of the country and aging 50 percent faster than the national norm it is rapidly replacing the surfboard with a walker

reuters photo file us president donald trump awards the 2018 presidential medal of freedom to us sen orrin hatch r ut in the east room of the white house in washington us november 16 2018 reuters jonathan ernst file photo by will dunham washington reuters orrin hatch the gentlemanly long serving republican u s senator from utah who championed deep tax cuts an anti terrorism law and a children s health program while fighting for conservative judicial nominees died on saturday at age 88 his death was announced by the nonprofit orrin g hatch foundation which said he died surrounded by family in salt lake city outpourings from fellow lawmakers some of whom had known hatch for decades started flooding the internet late on saturday as word of his death spread this breaks my heart utah governor spencer cox wrote on twitter utah mourns with the hatch family longtime friend and fellow senator jim inhofe a republican from oklahoma said on twitter nyse orrin was the one who i would go to for wisdom and we had the same love for jesus and everything we hold dear utah senator mike lee posted that hatch was a friend a mentor and an example for him in his career his name and memory will forever be enshrined in the history of the u s senate and the state of utah lee wrote an enduring conservative voice in congress hatch held a seat in the senate from 1977 to 2019 and served under eight presidents starting in the waning days of gerald ford s term and ending with donald trump s first two years in office he served in the senate longer than any other republican ever trump awarded him the medal of freedom the highest us civilian honor in 2018 hatch fiercely advocated for conservative supreme court nominees including robert bork nominated in 1987 by reagan but rejected by the senate as well as clarence thomas nominated in 1991 by republican george w bush and narrowly confirmed by the senate and brett kavanaugh nominated by republican trump and also narrowly confirmed by the senate in 2018 hatch a lay minister in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints a champion of religious liberty and an opponent of abortion rights represented the state that is home to the mormon church and was one of the foremost mormons in public life in american history he was elected to seven six year terms as utah s longest serving senator his first election victory was boosted by an endorsement from future president ronald reagan hatch ran for his party s 2000 presidential nomination but dropped out early in the race he was known for a courteous demeanor and liked writing poetry and songs but showed flashes of temper he held powerful posts including chairman of the influential senate judiciary and finance committees hatch was one the architects of the patriot act passed in the aftermath of the sept 11 2001 attacks on the united states by the militant islamist network al qaeda the law expanded the government s ability to track potential terrorists by among other steps expanding its surveillance powers the law s critics called it an infringement on individual liberties hatch called it constitutional legal and effective hatch was a driving force behind a republican package of deep tax cuts particularly benefiting corporations and the wealthy that trump sought and signed in 2017 despite vociferous democratic opposition the tax cuts were forecast to greatly increase the federal deficit children s health hatch was a staunch conservative but sometimes broke with fellow conservatives he was willing to work with democrats to get certain bipartisan bills passed and often did so with close friend edward kennedy a lion of liberalism who died in 2009 the two senators partnered in 1997 to create the state children s health insurance program in which the federal government helps states provide healthcare coverage for children in low income families the program has given medical care to millions of children whose families earn too much to qualify for the larger medicaid healthcare program for the poor but still cannot afford private medical insurance he advocated for the nutritional supplements industry for which utah is a center he authored a law allowing companies to make health claims about products but sparing them from federal reviews of safety or effectiveness hatch played a key role in trump s 2017 action to scale back the bears ears and grand staircase national monuments covering millions of acres in utah a move condemned by conservationists a former boxer he took off the gloves when he fought for conservative judicial nominees he defended thomas from a sexual harassment accusation by reading aloud from the horror novel the exorcist during confirmation hearings implying the nominee s accuser had cribbed lurid details of her allegations from the book hatch defended trump s nominee kavanaugh after he was accused by a woman of sexually assaulting her years earlier telling anti kavanaugh female protesters he would talk to them when they grow up hatch was born on march 22 1934 in pennsylvania and grew up in a poor family in pittsburgh during the great depression he practiced law after college and was a complete unknown when he decided to run for the senate in utah in 1976 he vaulted out of obscurity when reagan a champion of the conservative movement endorsed him before the republican primary hatch then upset three term incumbent democratic senator frank moss in the general election that election was a harbinger of the conservative ascent nationally in 1980 and the decline of the democratic party in many western states early in his career he called democrats the party of homosexuals in 1990 he told the new york times that was a dumb thing for me to say i deserve to have fault found with me because i said it in 1988 hatch had a showdown on the senate floor with conservative north carolina republican jesse helms who had offered an amendment that would have scuttled hatch s bipartisan aids fighting

profiting from war represents real intention of u s 10 00 april 24 2022 by gao ge people s daily online the era of the cold war is already more than 30 years in the past and yet nato has never stopped pursuing its eastward expansion which eventually led to the russia ukraine conflict the u s the backstage manipulator of natoâ s eastward expansion and which has already raked in huge profits from the conflict has not only benefited from the conflict but also has attempted to seek hegemony amid tensions since the russia ukraine conflict broke out the stock prices of relevant companies have all dropped but those of american military companies have meanwhile soared the stock prices of u s military firms lockheed martin and raytheon technologies corporation increased by about 13 percent and 10 percent respectively in the most recent nearly one month period gregory j hayes ceo of raytheon technologies corporation said his company will benefit from the tensions now unfolding around the world this is not the first time that the americans have profited from a war and the repeated conduct of the u s in its raking in profits from wars around the world are just too numerous to count according to a report released by the stockholm international peace research institute sipri on march 14 the overall volume of international transfers of major arms between 2017 and 2021 was lower than that between 2012 and 2016 however during the same period the arms exports of the u s increased significantly the u s is the worldâ s largest arms exporter while crises and wars undoubtedly provide hotbeds for u s military companies and american politicians to make a fortune in addition to supporting american arms producers there are other measures that washington has taken to allow the u s to profit from wars plundering and controlling the energy markets has always been an important aim of the u s government in instigating confrontations and waging wars around the world the u s authorities while saying that they stand on the side of peace and justice are actually thinking about how to get more americans engaged in what is a lucrative business the rights and wrongs in the russia ukraine crisis can and will be witnessed by all the u s has exposed its selfishness and hypocrisy by pouring fuel on the fire washington is the one that is profiting from the conflict and the americans may be the only ones who benefit from the conflict while taking advantage of the conflict to rake in huge profits the u s has also reinforced the bloc that it established by ganging up with its western allies and has attempted to contain its â imaginary enemies â thus further exacerbating divisions and confrontations between countries and then taking advantage of these divisions and confrontations to consolidate its global hegemony in the meantime with the u s government failing to curb such persistent domestic problems as the countryâ s political divides ethnic conflicts and rising violent crimes not to mention the rapidly spreading covid 19 virus and rampant high inflation a conflict in europe offers a perfect opportunity that u s politicians can make use of in order to serve u s domestic political purposes and distract the attention of the american public from domestic contradictions however the whole world is paying a price as the u s seeks selfish gains led by the u s western countries have imposed all round and undifferentiated sanctions against russia which not only has complicated the situation in the region but has also struck a heavy blow to the world economy affected by a rise in the prices of bulk commodities many countries and regions including the eurozone are seeing soaring inflation which is severely straining the livelihoods of the common people residing in these various european countries and regions europe is entering a difficult phase in its history the region will face in the short term higher inflation and slower growth there is considerable uncertainty about how large these effects will be and how long they will last for christine lagarde president of the european central bank ecb pointed out for a long time the u s has instigated confrontations and conflicts in countries around the world in an attempt to make a fortune severely undermining international peace and stability the tricks of american leaders will sooner or later be seen through for what they are the u s by hyping up threats of wars aggravating regional conflicts profiting from tensions in relevant countries and raking in huge profits from crises at the expense of its allies and even the whole world is bound to be resisted and opposed by the international community of nations web editor hongyu bianji
in with the squid out with the salmon ubc researchers tracked down menus from 362 vancouver restaurants stretching from 1880 to 2021 to find out how climate change is affecting local restaurant menus it s sunday june 3 1888 and you ve just sat down for dinner at the hotel vancouver outside two recently installed edison dynamos light up the city for the first time elsewhere whaling is big everywhere atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are at 294 parts per million nearly a third lower than current levels in victoria the capital s newspaper warns water levels in the fraser river are higher than at any time in the season it is still rising salmon is scarce on the river notes a weekend dispatch from the victoria daily times you order the fish salmon a la victoria pommes a la duchese reads the menu typical b c fare it s easy to think 141 years later today the location of the hotel has changed its restaurant rebranded as notch8 those old menus i remember them well there was always salmon on there said dennis peckham a former chef at notch8 who now oversees eight local restaurants for the glowbal restaurant group not any more salmon is out roasted trout cod and seared scallops are in according to the restaurant s latest dinner menu today we look at sustainability said peckham are we doing our part a link between vancouver restaurant menus and climate change as climate change warms many seas to the south fish species are moving pole ward in a migration never seen in modern times how those climate triggered migrations impact the fishing industry has been well documented but few have linked the warming of local seas to the changing nature of what lands on our plate now a new study from researchers at the university of british columbia has set out to correct that published this week in the journal environmental biology of fishes researchers from the ubc institute for the oceans and fisheries tracked down menus from 362 vancouver restaurants stretching from 1880 to 2021 even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life said institute director william cheung who co authored the study with john paul ng their central question have vancouver s fish and seafood menus changed with warming local seas pulling old menus from the royal bc museum in victoria and the vancouver archives the researchers documented all the locally caught species on offer throughout the decades next they matched each species with their preferred ocean temperatures as cheung put it they took the temperature of a seafood menu by comparing different time periods they discovered the highest preferred temperature had climbed 3 c since 1880 the more the ocean has warmed the more fishers caught warm water fish and the more they ended up on a restaurant s menu big questions remained was vancouver an anomaly were restaurants in other cities adjusting their menu to the shift in locally available fish to answer those questions cheung and ng compared contemporary menus in restaurants in anchorage alaska and in los angeles calif the pattern held in alaska restaurants were serving more cold water fish and in l a more warm water fish were on offer as cheung put it they established a strong correlation between changing ocean temperatures and what fish dishes are found on local menus in with the blob out with the salmon salmon once dominated our seas and seafood menus but in recent decades a confluence of changing ocean temperatures habitat destruction overfishing changing predator relationships and disease have all taken their toll between 1980 and 2014 the fraser river averaged 9 6 million sockeye returns annually with up to 28 million one year by 2020 salmon returning to the fraser river fell to an all time record low of 293 000 according to cheung the biggest shift in menu offerings was seen between the periods 1981 1996 and 2019 2021 the latter coming after the arrival of extreme marine heat waves known as the blob as cold waters migrate north others have started to fill the void left behind in the early 1990s humboldt squid suddenly started to appear on local menus as the species expanded its territory into b c waters said cheung where some species have gained traction on local menus the pacific sardine once a popular menu item before the 1950s disappeared as its stocks were decimated by overfishing in b c such declines however are not always a dead end sardines are a warm water species so we expect our waters will become more favourable to them and their populations will come back said cheung that s good news for peckham who places both squid and sardines high on his priorities of culinary ingredients along with octopus caught as bycatch that would otherwise go to waste humbolt squid we already use he said sardines would be very high on the list i love sardines i used to use them in california quite a bit it affects your everyday life populations of popular fish like albacore tuna could also increasingly spend more time in b c s warming waters others iconic species like sockeye salmon face an uncertain future some of the species we take them for granted said cheung pointing to the impact climate change is having on sockeye even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life those culinary cultures might need to be adjusted cheung is careful to point out that his study did not take into account how vancouver s shifting demographics have driven demand for different kinds of seafood over the years the restaurants especially in metro vancouver are increasingly mindful about serving sustainable seafood said cheung we want to see if those seafood menus have a lower carbon footprint the researchers are also planning to investigate how a culinary culture focused on sustainability but constrained by supply chains and rising prices will adapt peckham who is about to open another san francisco style seafood and chop house this time in toronto says it s already a tough balance seafood prices have surged in recent years a trend he says is made worse by large scale export to asian markets still sustainability will remain at the core of what his restaurants do it s what his customers want he says there are some beautiful fish available to us at all times from hawaii said peckham but it s easier to tell a story when it s local

elon musk has now put together a 46 5bn financing package to buy twitter two thirds of it from his own assets and a third from bank loans secured against twitter s assets it s the biggest acquisition financing ever put forward for one person twitter s founder and top managers don t want musk to take over the company they offered him a seat on the board but he didn t want it because he d have to be responsible to all other shareholders now they re adopting a poison pill to stop him but musk plans to buy shares directly with a tender offer that shareholders can t refuse after all it s a free market musk says no one should object to what he wants to do with twitter because he s a free speech absolutist and who can be against free speech besides he and his apologists say if consumers don t like what he does with twitter they can go elsewhere freedom to choose free market free speech free choice when billionaires like musk justify their motives by using the word freedom beware what they actually seek is freedom from accountability they want to use their vast fortunes to do whatever they please unconstrained by laws or regulations shareholders or even consumers the free market increasingly reflects the demands of big money unfriendly takeovers such as musk is mounting at twitter weren t part of the free market until the late 1970s and early 1980s before then laws and regulations constrained them then came corporate raiders like carl icahn and michael milken their mo was to find corporations whose assets were worth more than their stock value borrow against them acquire enough shares to force them to cut costs such as laying off workers abandoning their communities busting unions and taking on crushing debt and cash in but the raiders antics often imposed huge social costs they pushed america from stakeholder capitalism where workers and communities had a say in what corporations did to shareholder capitalism where the sole corporate goal is to maximize shareholder value inequality skyrocketed insecurity soared vast swaths of america were abandoned and millions of good jobs vanished the raiders altered the free market to allow them to do this that s what the super rich do there s no free market in nature the free market depends on laws and rules if you have enough money you can buy changes in those laws and rules that make you even more money you can also get the government to subsidize you musk has received a reported 4 9bn so far free speech is another freedom that turns on wealth as a practical matter your ability to be heard turns on the size of the megaphone you can buy if you re extremely rich you can buy the washington post or own fox news if you re the wealthiest person in the world you can buy one of the biggest megaphones in the world called twitter and then decide who can use it what its algorithms are going to be and how it either invites or filters out big lies musk said last week that he doesn t care about the economics of the deal and is pursuing it because it is extremely important to the future of civilization fine but who anointed musk to decide the future of civilization which brings us to free choice if consumers don t like what musk does with twitter they cannot simply switch to another twitter like platform there aren t any the largest social media platforms have grown gigantic because anyone who wants to participate in them and influence debate has to join them after they reach a certain size they re the only megaphone in town where else would consumers go to post short messages that can reach tens of millions of people other than twitter with social media the ordinary rules of competition don t apply once a platform is dominant it becomes even more dominant as donald trump discovered with his truth social fiasco upstarts don t stand much chance musk s real goal has nothing to do with the freedom of others his goal is his own unconstrained freedom the freedom to wield enormous power without having to be accountable to laws and regulations to shareholders or to market competition which is why he s dead set on owning twitter unlike his ambitions to upend transportation and interstellar flight this one is dangerous it might well upend democracy

by john cannon carbon emissions due to tropical deforestation are accelerating a new study has found using detailed maps of forest change as well as aboveground and soil carbon deposits the researchers demonstrate that annual emission more than doubled between 2015 2019 compared with 2001 2005 though the study reveals that the world has not met its commitments to stem deforestation the authors say it also reveals that investments in forest protection and restoration are critical to addressing climate change the rate at which carbon escaped from the deforestation of tropical forests more than doubled in the first two decades of the 21st century according to new research earlier assessments relied primarily on government statistics on the land which painted a much different picture paul elsen a climate adaptation scientist with the wildlife conservation society and a co author of the paper said in an interview that picture was one in which tropical deforestation is still a serious problem with each razed hectare of quality forest representing the loss of wildlife habitat ecosystem services and the ability to continue siphoning carbon from the air but the calculations of the amount of carbon lost from deforestation around the world suggested the emissions from this major source of atmospheric carbon had stabilized or even started dropping at the same time members of the team had previously documented the worrisome expansion of deforestation into mountainous forests in southeast asia their analyses showed these higher elevation forests had a massive carbon stock said lead author yu feng a doctoral student at the southern university of science and technology sustech in china they found that the annual figures for the amount of carbon emitted when cleared were unprecedented which they reported in a 2021 study published in the journal nature sustainability surprised to find such a little known source of substantial carbon emissions the team decided to take a global look at the problem and determine whether these high rates were confined just to southeast asia don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free to do that though they needed a more detailed understanding than that provided by the bookkeeping studies used by countries to ballpark forest carbon loss elsen said don t locate in space where the forest loss is occurring and how much carbon is there he said improvements in satellite technology and the monitoring work that remote sensing scientists such as matt hansen and his colleagues are doing at the university of maryland have put more detailed information at the fingertips of researchers around the world elsen added we re in sort of a golden era of data sets that enables us to look at this very very precisely he said the maps and data that hansen and his team make available can tease apart what has happened to forests since the turn of the century the data set has a resolution of 30 square meters 323 square feet making it much more reliable than tabulations based on government gathered statistics feng told mongabay elsen feng and their colleagues then used several other maps that plot out forest and soil biomass to estimate the amount of carbon held by the deforested areas mapped by hansen s team the carbon found below the ground in root systems and the soil for example typically takes longer to bleed into the atmosphere after deforestation than the carbon in aboveground sources such as the trees trunks but the team concluded this discrepancy wouldn t change the overall trend in the amount of carbon lost so they bundled the above and below ground carbon into a single statistic known as committed loss the researchers found that the world s tropical forests emitted nearly 2 billion metric tons of carbon per year between 2015 and 2019 the final five years of the study period that s roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of 1 900 coal fired power plants and more than twice the yearly tabulated forest carbon loss between 2001 and 2005 the team reported their findings online feb 28 in the journal nature sustainability it s definitely concerning that their findings are that there s a doubling of carbon loss just in two decades said giuseppe molinario a geographer with the world bank who was not involved in the research molinario said the study will likely confirm what many researchers suspected that there s been an underestimation of the carbon loss it would follow that it s somehow in sync with how much forest cover loss we re seeing he added as the team drilled into the data they uncovered regional patterns in where and when forest carbon loss occurred for example a lot of the carbon emissions in the early 2000s came from parts of the brazilian amazon and the dry forests of the cerrado but later on in the 2010s those hotspots of carbon loss were deeper in the amazon and parts of the congo basin and those montane jungles in southeast asia the 20 year data set also revealed that more than two thirds of the areas cleared for agriculture during the study period remained cleared in 2020 that s a huge amount of area where once you lose that carbon you re not returning it back elsen said the fact that the cleared lands are staying cleared and the carbon is gone is definitely problematic molinario echoed that sentiment but he said that statistic includes everything from forest that had been converted to agriculture nearly for two decades to land that had been cleared just a few years ago what i would like to know is how many of the 2000 to 2005 clearings are still agriculture in 2020 he added i wouldn t assume that a farmer leaves the field that he just spent a half a year clearing in just two years around the world subsistence farmers employ shifting agriculture clearing and usually burning the vegetation on a plot of land to prepare it for farming for a year or two then farmers let the field lay fallow often for years at a time while moving on to cultivate another plot the fallow period allows the land to recover and the forest to regrow if it sits unused by humans for long enough but in some parts of the world such as the congo basin conflict growing populations and other pressures appear to have forced a shorter rotational cycle that change means that forests haven t been able to return as robustly as they once did molinario who has worked on mapping forest loss in central africa said there s often more intensive farming with less time for the land to recover near the region s larger towns roads mines and plantations don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free if we want to stop this issue and we have to help those people living there to find to increase their living standards so they can they can better live with the forest said zhenzhong zeng an associate professor and earth systems scientists at sustech and a co author of the study the fact that an area remains cleared of forest may indicate that the agriculture is more intense than it once was said alan ziegler a professor in fisheries and aquatic resources at thailand s mae jo university and a co author of the study in the amazon and southeast asia that can often mean industrial scale agriculture or livestock ranching feng said the team s study serves as a warning that more effort needs to be put into protecting forests the accelerating forest carbon loss uncovered by the study demonstrates that forest loss has not been reversed or even halted the authors write in 2020 the world missed a key deadline to halve rates of deforestation a key goal of the 2014 new york declaration on forests this type of evidence also suggests global climate goals may be slipping out of reach such as the effort to keep global warming under 1 5 celsius 2 7 fahrenheit above pre industrial levels scientists say a rise of 1 5 c or perhaps 2 c 3 6 f could lead to dangerous and potentially irreversible impacts as a result of warming triggered by sea level rise increasing drought and intensifying storms world leaders committed to keeping warming to under 2 c in the 2015 paris climate change agreement and they reaffirmed the pledge along with promised cuts in deforestation by 2030 at the 2021 u n climate conference in glasgow ziegler said the changes at these high level meetings aren t translating into action that will address the problem we get together and shake hands we make a pact and then it really doesn t make a change he said forests play a huge role in our ability to fight climate change because of the massive amount of carbon they emit when they re degraded or cleared elsen said this increasing acceleration of forest loss goes right in the face of a lot of the national commitments to help emissions this study however does provide pathways to stem carbon emissions the authors say notably through forest protection and restoration we know that just because we re seeing a lot of deforestation doesn t mean that actions can t be taken to restore healthy forests and restore some of that carbon elsen said it does take time but it is something that we should be investing in this

notion that the government should be the servant of the people and fully accountable to them since then a steadily more conservative supreme court has eviscerated all the most important campaign finance reforms most disastrously in 2010 with citizens united and in 2013 destroyed the most effective parts of the voting rights act congress let the special counsel law lapse partly because of how ken starr abused it when he investigated bill clinton the unraveling of watergate reforms was one of many factors that set the stage for the most corrupt us government of modern times that of donald trump even someone as inured as i am to trump s crimes can still be astonished when all the known abuses are catalogued in one volume what the authors of this book identify as the seven deadly sins of trumpery include disdain for ethics assault on the rule of law incessant lying and disinformation shamelessness and of course pursuit of personal and political interest the book identifies trump s original sin as his refusal to put his businesses in a blind trust which led to no less than 3 400 conflicts of interest it didn t help that the federal conflict of interests statute specifically exempts the president under the first president of modern times with no interest in the legitimacy or the appearance of legitimacy of the presidency this left practically nothing off limits the emoluments clause of the constitution forbids every government official accepting any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state but lacks any enforcement mechanism so a shameless president could be paid off through his hotels by everyone from the philippines to kuwait while the bank of china paid one trump company an estimated 5 4m as a fig leaf trump gave the treasury 448 000 from profits made from foreign governments during two years of his presidency but without any accounting trump even got the federal government to pay him directly by charging the secret service 32 400 for guest rooms for a visit to mar a lago plus 17 000 a month for a cottage at his new jersey golf club the us office of special counsel catalogued dozens of violations of the hatch act which prohibits political activity by federal officials miscreants included peter navarro dan scavino nikki haley and most persistently kellyanne conway the osc referred its findings to trump who of course did nothing conway was gleeful let me know when the jail sentence starts she said there was also the secretary of state mike pompeo addressing the republican convention from a bluff overlooking jerusalem during a mission to israel in a different category of corruption were the 43 000 soundproof phone booth the epa administrator scott pruitt installed and the 1m the health secretary tom price spent on luxury travel those two actually resigned the book is mostly focused on the four year trump crimewave but it is bipartisan enough to spread the blame to democrats for creating a climate in which no crime seemed too big to go un prosecuted barack obama s strict ethics rules enforced by executive orders produced a nearly scandal free administration but claire o finkelstein and richard w painter argue that there was one scandal that established a terrible precedent the decision not to prosecute anyone at the cia for illegal torture carried out under george w bush this failure of accountability was profoundly corrosive the decision to look forward not back on torture damaged the country s ability to hold government officials to the constraints of the law however the authors are probably a little too optimistic when they argue that a more vigorous stance might have made the trump administration more eager to prosecute its own law breakers the authors point out there are two things in the federal government which are even worse than the wholesale violation of ethical codes within the executive branch the almost total absence of ethical codes within the congressional and judicial branches the ethics manual for the house says it is fundamental that a member may not use his or her official position for personal gain but that is virtually meaningless because members can take actions on industries in which they hold company stock the senate exempts itself from ethical concerns with two brilliant words no member can promote a piece of legislation whose principal purpose is to further only his pecuniary interest so as long as legislation also has other purposes personal profit is no impediment to passage the authors argue that since the crimes of watergate pale in comparison to the corruption of trump this should be the greatest opportunity for profound reform since the 1970s but of course there is no chance of any such reform getting through this congress because republicans have no interest in making government honest nothing tells us more about the collapse of our democracy than the primary concern of the house and senate minority leaders kevin mccarthy and mitch mcconnell their only goal is to avoid any action that would offend the perpetrator or instigator of all these crimes instead of forcing him to resign the way nixon did these quivering men still pretend donald trump is the only man qualified to lead them
funtay istock via getty images market volatility has increased significantly in recent days as investors deal with soaring inflation rates and consider the impact higher interest rates will have on companies earnings prospects british american tobacco nyse bti could potentially be a refuge for investors that worry about growing market volatility shares of british american tobacco offer a 6 9 yield and the firm is set to see strong growth in its non combustible product categories a potential hedge against growing market volatility the dow jones dropped more than 900 points on friday the largest single day point drop since the early stages of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 inflation and interest rates are now the top concerns for investors replacing the ongoing ukraine russia war in eastern europe i believe that british american tobacco is going to make it through growing market volatility just fine in part because the firm offers a strong dividend yield that may limit downside in the stock data by ycharts british american tobacco s big bet on new products is paying off it is no secret that traditional tobacco use is on the decline in response to this challenge companies in the industry are developing new categories of tobacco products devices that heat tobacco vapour products and tobacco free nicotine pouches are seeing growing customer uptake the three brands that create this growth for british american tobacco are vuse glo and veloâ all of which have seen strong volume growth in fy 2021 british american tobacco british american tobacco consolidates these brands into a category called non combustibles british american tobacco s vapour brand vuse has been the fastest growing brand within the firm s new category portfolio vuse has seen 59 revenue growth in fy 2021 followed by glo which sells heated tobacco products glo grew revenues 46 year over year in fy 2021 and velo which sells nicotine pouches delivered revenue growth of 41 year over year customer acquisition for all three brands is growing fast as smokers seek alternatives to the traditional tobacco smoking experience british american tobacco british american tobacco s new category brands are driving the company s revenue growth total company revenues grew 6 9 in fy 2021 but new category brands led by vuse have seen 51 revenue growth last year based on constant rates british american tobacco aims to grow its new product category portfolio to â 5 0b in revenues by fy 2025 which is the equivalent of 6 4b indicating that revenues will grow ten fold compared to fy 2017 british american tobacco s new product categories generated â 2 1b in revenues in fy 2021 which calculates to 2 7b the expected annual top line growth rate in constant currencies is expected to be 25 over the next four years vuse growth potential vuse is the number one vapour brand in canada the united kingdom germany and france and the number two brand in the u s but vuse has a lot of potential in the u s to grow its market share and catch up to the number one brand in the country juul altria group mo acquired a 35 stake in juul labs for 12 8b back in 2018 and the company has had a considerable advantage regarding market share in the vapour category ever since but vuse has made inroads with traditional smokers which is the key demographic that the brand targets vuse is now the second largest vapour brand in the u s with a 35 9 value share and it has the potential to become the number one vapour brand longer term british american tobacco high yield cheap price i like the combination of a low p e ratio and a high dividend yield shares of british american tobacco have a fy 2023 p e ratio of 8 5 x while altria group has a p e ratio of 10 8 x while british american tobacco has a lower earnings ratio than altria both tobacco firms offer investors decent sized yields shares of altria deliver investors a 6 9 yield while altria which i also consider a buy based off of valuation and yield supplies a dividend yield of 6 4 data by ycharts risks with british american tobacco regulation and litigation are two big risks that british american tobacco has to deal with the share of smokers is decreasing and new restrictions on tobacco advertising could accelerate this trend longer term british american tobacco and the industry as a whole will have to transition to alternative tobacco products to generate growth what would change my mind about british american tobacco is if the firm s new categories saw slowing volume and revenue growth final thoughts despite challenges to british american tobacco s core business which is still selling traditional cigarettes the growth in new product categories is promising all new categories are seeing strong customer uptake resulting in volume and revenue growth for bti vuse especially has a lot of potential in the u s due to increasing market share and has a shot at becoming the number one vapour brand in the country longer term the real reason to buy british american tobacco however is the firm s exceptionally attractive dividend that i believe is worth owning as markets get more volatile
happy friday traders welcome to our weekly market wrap where we take a look back at these last five trading days with a focus on the market news economic data and headlines that had the most impact on gold prices and other key correlated assets and may continue to into the future what could we say that the chart doesn t after a few promising ticks higher on monday gold longs are probably very happy to be dropping the curtain on what s been one of the most price destructive weeks for gold in months so what kind of week has it been brutal is not a fun word to use in describing the week that is mercifully finally closing for the gold market but it s also not inaccurate with little in the way of true directional input from either headlines or from macroeconomic data an issue that most asset classes not just gold reckoned with this week gold s resistance to strength from its traditional opposition finally gave way and pulled the spot price away from what looked like a promising opportunity to move towards 2000 oz again it was an uneven start to the week for most major assets on monday and us markets opened in a stress position created by quickly running and rising treasury yields the 10 year note had already climbed and held firm above 2 85 nearly 10 basis points higher than last week gold for weeks has remained resilient in the face of these higher interest rates but it seemed that the pace and peak of monday s move in yields finally snapped high priced support for the yellow metal and spot began falling from a promising perch above 1990 oz to the neighborhood of 1975 the somewhat quiet driver of the week in markets has been investors and managers worry about inflation in the months ahead although the concerns about decades high inflation have stopped mounting for now they remain very present in the psyche of the marketplace indeed it s being taken as given in the week s coverage of financial markets that while rising bond yields can often be driven by investors positive view of the medium to long term health of the market in this case the tailwind is a more negative sense of stress around how long inflation will remain where it is we ve suspected that in recent weeks that this concern and uncertainty was enough to keep gold aloft as an important safe haven trade enough to buffer prices higher despite the fact that gold usually weakens its position in higher rate environments but it s clear that the move in the 10 year yield towards 3 which has persisted since monday has finally been enough to drawdown investors interest in gold as an asset no matter the underlying predictions driving the move the us marketplace was decidedly more positive on tuesday as investors seemed to better digest the elevated level of bond yields all three major us stock indexes made solid gains on the day led by a resurgence in the play for tech growth stocks that tuesday s rally was so heavily composed of a rally in the tech sector would come back to bite markets of course with the benchmark 10 year yield moving above 2 9 the markets on tuesday appeared to have returned to the stance of acknowledging the persistent risk posed by high inflation but buying in to the outlook that the labor market and other macro developments allow the fed room to act aggressively against it the briefest glance at gold s chart this week would tell you that this a sharp improvement in risk sentiment timed with the benchmark treasury yield continuing to climb came at a particularly bad time to for already woozy gold bulls through the first hours of trading in new york on tuesday gold spot prices collapsed by more than 20 oz en route to a flat road at 1950 for the session as bond yields reached their highs of the week the momentum generated by investors jumping back into the tech sector on tuesday was slammed into reverse after the bell when netflix released a quarterly report that announced the first contraction in its subscriber base in more than 10 years once trading re opened on wednesday morning netflix stock went into a free fall that would total up to a loss of 50 billion in market cap a 35 slide on the session the gravity of one of the vaunted faang stocks of the new economy falling so sharply absolutely ruined investors mood for the remainder of the week the sudden jump back into risk aversion benefited gold s performance somewhat on the day but only enough to keep things level with no real signs of a rally the remaining two trading days of the week for gold and other usd tied assets have been all about once again the fed but this time also the dollar itself investors turned on thursday as equities again slid slower across the us stock markets to the final marquee appearance from fed chair jerome powell who took the stage as part of the annual imf meeting in washington dc while powell s comments were mostly a reiteration of what we ve heard from the chair and other important members since march that is that a 0 50 hike is just around the bend it s more than possible that powell s remarks will continue to be parsed further this afternoon and into friday for clues about the fomc s next steps and its appetite for monetary tightening through the rest of this year the reporting on which could have an impact on virtually every piece we ve touched on this week stocks gold the dollar certainly rates and the dollar has certainly already benefited from the fed s most recent and upcoming policy plans as yields remain near recent highs with the 10y eyeing 3 the us dollar has also returned to highest levels in 2 years growing in value against its most common trading partners thanks to higher rates and the fed s path for more tightening should the greenback return to and remain in the position of king dollar once again it could pose a threat to stock market s upside as a very strong dollar is always pointed to as a negative pressure in quarterly earnings reports even as it does aid to balance out inflation s upside it s worth noting this being earnings season that we re not yet hearing ceos and boards pointing to the risk or resistance created by a super strong dollar but should q2 earnings pale in comparison we can expect commentary around usd to become more volatile regardless of when the dollar might start to further slow the us stock market it is almost a certainty that the bull running dollar and higher rates are working in tandem and in a feedback loop to apply the tremendous pressure on gold prices this week which at friday s end we see lowering gold spot prices to recent support at 1935 oz even though many major commodities have had a positive week gold market seems to have finally cracked somewhat under the pressure of the dollar s surge while bond yields remain drawn to recent highs and higher and the fed has all but promised to extend and accelerate that move for next week we re looking at an even more quiet calendar than this week s if you can believe it true enough we ll get a report on the fed s measurement of inflation in the us economy but there shouldn t be much there than cpi and the like haven t shown us already and with the fomc entering a blackout period ahead of the may meeting rates sensitive assets like gold will be left at the mercy of investors and pundits trying to dial in their expectations for the next hike and all while markets are again likely to be turned to and fro by headlines around the war in ukraine and its reverberations through the global financial system for now traders i hope you can get out and safely enjoy your weekend for the next couple of days after that i ll see everyone back here on monday for our preview of the week ahead
what to watch ahead of amazon s earnings call and how certain trends may impact investors strategies leading up to the company s upcoming split investors seem to love stock splits even though there is no direct effect on the stock s value after all what s not to love splits are fun exciting and offer a distraction from the daily rush of financial news there is often tremendous movement in the stock price around the announcement date and the split date which in turn affects investors profits amazon amzn 1 35 is one company preparing for a blockbuster 20 for 1 split in june but when is the best time for interested investors to buy amazon stock before or after the split to find out it can be helpful to examine historical stock movements around recent splits and take a deep dive into amazon s current challenges and successes let s look at some key factors heading into the company s first quarter 2022 earnings release on april 28 e commerce headwinds likely continue 2021 brought a share of challenges to amazon and many of these hurdles will likely continue in 2022 labor was one such challenge hiring was extremely tight last year in large part due to the effects of the pandemic and its economic and social fallout the company absorbed billions of dollars in additional operating costs through increased wages sign on bonuses and covid 19 mitigation measures in a sense this is just the nature of the beast for a corporation with hundreds of thousands of employees the good news is that the company did not shy away from this investment or attempt to cut staffing or salaries in order to get its way out of a bind investing in employees could pay future dividends through productivity and stability supply chain challenges tied to ongoing coronavirus variants also presented major issues for the e commerce giant these logistical delays and dilemmas added more costs to amazon s bottom line add inflation to the mix and it s no surprise that the company s north american and international segments posted net operating losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 even despite rising net sales it s likely that these macroeconomic headwinds will persist in 2022 and continue to cause headaches luckily for shareholders amazon has a couple of aces up its sleeve aws and advertising shine amazon s diverse mix of businesses has been the company s saving grace when dealing with the aforementioned problems amazon web services aws for instance has largely carried the day and still has a tremendous runway the cloud computing market is snowballing due to increased adoption and more significant cloud infrastructure needs aws s net sales reached 62 2 billion in 2021 representing 37 year over year growth amazon is the clear leader in this space with about a 33 market share as of the fourth quarter of 2021 digital advertising has grown to be a force as well so much so that amazon broke out the numbers in more detail during a recent earnings report advertising service sales reached 31 2 billion in 2021 up 146 from the 12 6 billion in 2019 this is a revenue stream to watch during the upcoming report is it better to buy before or after a stock split amazon stock has gained over 10 since the split was announced on march 9 as shown below the chart shows an immediate positive effect on shares this could continue in the lead up to the june split with earnings also weighing in since amazon has not split in over 20 years recent examples of how recent splits impacted the stock prices of other major tech companies will offer helpful indicators to inform investor timing tesla tsla 5 59 and apple aapl 2 19 had stock splits in 2020 and both followed a very similar pattern these are cogent comparisons to amazon as each is highly successful and has a large following of retail investors as seen in the chart above both apple and tesla stock experienced gains ahead of the split date which dropped off as the event passed tesla s rise was much more pronounced but the pattern is clear of course this does not mean that amazon will follow the same pattern the factors discussed above could outweigh the emotional trading surrounding the split but history does tend to repeat itself even in the stock market patient investors are often rewarded

the ev maker shares some dna with tesla but could it follow in tesla s footsteps and join the 12 zero club lucid group lcid 2 41 the electric vehicle maker that went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company spac last july has often been compared to tesla tsla 5 59 lucid s ceo and cto peter rawlinson previously served as tesla s chief vehicle engineer from 2009 to 2012 its debut vehicle the lucid dream can travel up to 520 miles on a single charge which beats tesla s model s long range by more than 100 miles lucid also targets a higher end market than tesla with even pricier evs however lucid only started shipping its first vehicles last october and it will likely take more than a decade for the fledgling company to match tesla s current production capabilities lucid s market cap of 35 billion is also tiny compared to tesla s market cap of 1 01 trillion but could it repeat tesla s success story and join the 12 zero club by 2030 overcoming its near term challenges between last october and the end of this february lucid delivered 300 air sedans it had planned to deliver 20 000 vehicles in 2022 but it reduced that target to 12 000 14 000 during its fourth quarter report in february it blamed that reduction on the ongoing chip shortage and supply chain challenges across the world it also postponed the upcoming launch of its second ev the gravity suv from 2023 to the first half of 2024 despite those challenges lucid s reservations still reached 25 000 at the end of february which represents a steady increase from 13 000 reservations last september and 17 000 reservations last november lucid s amp 1 manufacturing plant in arizona has an annual production capacity of 34 000 vehicles it expects its phase 2 expansion which broke ground last july to boost its annual capacity to 90 000 vehicles in 2023 expanding its capacity and entering new markets at the same time lucid plans to expand overseas it already expanded into canada last year and it s gearing up to enter the europe middle east and africa emea market this year with its first factory in saudi arabia it also plans to enter the booming but fragmented chinese ev market in 2023 lucid expects its expenses to soar in 2022 and 2023 as it executes those plans based on its reduced shipment targets analysts expect the company to generate just 1 3 billion in revenue this year compared to its original target of 2 2 billion while incurring a net loss of 2 2 billion in 2023 analysts expect lucid s revenue to rise 172 to 3 5 billion as its net loss narrows to 1 6 billion in 2024 they expect its revenue to grow another 70 to 6 0 billion as its net loss narrows to 1 1 billion lucid expects to turn profitable on an adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda basis for the first time in 2024 and for its free cash flow fcf to turn positive the following year swinging for a home run by 2030 lucid expects to generate 14 billion in revenue in 2025 as it ships 135 000 vehicles and to generate 22 8 billion in revenue in 2026 from 251 000 vehicles here s a clearer breakdown of that ambitious roadmap model 2025 shipments 2026 shipments air 42 000 42 000 gravity 86 000 134 000 new model 7 000 8 000 75 000 total shipments 135 000 251 000 target revenue 14 0 billion 22 8 billion but between 2026 and 2030 lucid expects to double its annual shipments to 500 000 by comparison tesla s annual deliveries rose from 245 240 in 2018 to 499 550 in 2020 and it delivered 936 172 vehicles in 2021 lucid s planned four year gap between a quarter million and half million deliveries seems more conservative than tesla s two year gap but it s still a very lofty goal considering that lucid lacks tesla s first mover advantage and targets a much smaller niche of top tier luxury buyers could lucid possibly become a trillion dollar company assuming that lucid s average selling prices stay roughly the same at about 91 000 per vehicle between 2026 and 2030 it will likely generate about 45 billion in revenue by the final year with a market cap of 35 billion lucid currently trades at 27 times this year s sales if we multiply that price to sales ratio by 45 billion we get a market capitalization of 1 2 trillion however it s highly unlikely that lucid will continue to trade at such a high valuation as its year over year revenue growth decelerates that s why tesla currently trades at 12 times this year s sales if lucid hits its growth targets and also trades at 12 times sales in 2030 it would be worth about 540 billion which would broadly miss the trillion dollar mark but still make it one of the world s most valuable automakers i believe that s the best case scenario for lucid s investors and it would still represent a 15 bagger gain from its current price but for now investors should focus on lucid s ability to achieve its near term goals for 2022 and 2023 as it navigates its supply chain challenges if it needs to cut its production targets again or revise its long term roadmap it could struggle to maintain its current valuation and its stock could crash
you might also like elon musk wants free speech on twitter it s been an eventful few weeks since elon musk announced that he owned a major stake in twitter the stock prices initially soared on the announcement but what has followed since has been one of the strangest corporate narratives that one has ever witnessed valuation guru aswath damodaran says it s ironic that the threat to twitter has come from elon musk as he has arguably used the platform to greater effect than perhaps anyone else on it damodaran believes what has made the whole saga more interesting is that it focuses on not only musk and twitter but on broader issues of social and economic value of social media platforms corporate governance investing and how politics has become part of almost every discussion there are some twitter personalities who have more followers than musk but most of them are either inactive or tweet pablum but musk has made twitter his vehicle for selling both his corporate vision and his products while engaging in distractions that sometimes frustrate his shareholders while he has made veiled promises of alternative platforms for expression it was a surprise to most when he announced on april 4 2022 that he had acquired a 9 2 stake in the company damodaran wrote in his blog musings on markets damodaran says in order to understand the maths behind musk s bid for twitter one has to also understand the company s journey to its current situation he says twitter which was founded in 2006 by jack dorsey noah glass biz stone and evan williams succeeded greatly in attracting people to its platform hitting 100 million users in 2012 and then doubling those numbers again by 2013 when it went public with an ipo the offering price for twitter s shares was set at 26 by its bankers and the stock debuted on november 7 2013 at 45 in the weeks after that momentum continued to carry the stock upwards with the price reaching 73 31 by december 26 2013 he says but over the years since its ipo damodaran feels the twitter story has taken an unexpected turn which none of its founders or its investors would have predicted although it has performed better than expected on some parameters of user engagement and influence it has lagged in the operating numbers measuring its success as a business as twitter s user base and influence have grown there has been one area where it has conspicuously failed and that is on business metrics the company s revenues have come primarily from advertising 90 and while these revenues have grown they have not kept up with user engagement he says damodaran says the market has responded accordingly to the disappointments on the operating metric front as twitter s stock price has dropped to below ipo levels in 2016 and its performance has lagged its social media counterparts damodaran says while musk s acquisition bid is not exactly conventional it has initiated a completely predictable tussle between twitter and musk unsurprisingly twitter s initial response to musk s bid was that it was worth much more than musk s offering price and that its shareholders would be receiving too little for their shares if they sold musk countered this argument by stating that the market clearly did not believe that current management could deliver that higher value and that he would be able to do a much better job with the platform according to damodaran although there is a possibility that twitter s value could be higher it is not a particularly strong argument for the board to make looking at the current scenarios damodaran says twitter s management is expected to claim that its platform has the potential to deliver significantly more value either by changing the business model or fine tuning the advertising model he feels musk will agree with the argument about twitter s untapped potential but will claim that only he can make the changes to twitter s business model to deliver this potential the problem that twitter s management will face in mounting a case that twitter is worth more if it is run differently is that they have been the custodians of the company for the last decade and have been unable or unwilling to deliver these changes shareholders in twitter will welcome management s willingness to consider alternative business models but the timing makes it feel more like a deathbed conversion rather than a well thought through plan he says damodaran believes it is difficult to predict right now what is going through musk s mind and what musk will be doing if he acquires twitter as he also has a trillion dollar company to run in tesla and a host of other ventures that he is part of musk s unpredictability makes it difficult to judge what his endgame is at least with twitter since he could do anything from selling his position tomorrow to bulldozing his way through a poison pill taking twitter down with him the fact that twitter s stock price has stayed stubbornly below musk s offering price suggests that investors have their doubts about musk s true intentions and whether this deal will go through he says damodaran says it can t be denied that musk has forced twitter to act and it is likely that the company that emerges from this episode will look different from the company that initially went into it he sees 4 possible outcomes damodaran says it is possible that twitter may prevent musk s takeover bid and that the poison pill adopted by the board will force him to walk away from the deal leading to him selling his shares along the way damodaran says musk has the ability to pull off the impossible which he has proved on many occasions so it won t be a surprise if he is able to buy enough shares in a tender offer and or convince other shareholders to put pressure on the board to remove the poison pill and allow him to move forward with his plans damodaran says even if twitter is able to resist musk s entry institutional investors are expected to push for change in the company with new board members and perhaps even a new ceo the way that the company s management and board have handled the deal does not inspire confidence in their ability to run the company in fact having gone through five ceos over twitter s life it is worth asking the question whether the dysfunction at the company lies with the board and not just with the ceo he says damodaran says there is also a possibility that the board may be willing to sell the company to someone other than musk at a slightly higher price only to save their face damodaran believes the twitter musk saga at its core is a political story and not a financial one as with most things political you will provide an alternate more reasoned argument for why you are for or opposed but you are deluding yourself and hypocrisy is rampant on both sides he says damodaran says critics of musk argue that twitter needs to be preserved or at least protected from money digging billionaires and they should not control social media platforms but the same critics are not as upset about jeff bezos owning the washington post or a george soros bid for fox news if it is musk s personality that you feel is what makes him an unsuitable owner i wonder whether we should be requiring full personality tests of the owners of other media companies he says on the other hand some people are in favor of the deal just because they want twitter to be a bastion of free speech but they must remember that every social media platform is involved in some degree of censoring for legal reasons and self preservation it should also be noted that while those disaffected with twitter have attempted to build their own social media platforms they still get far more mileage from their presence on twitter than from their posts on alternate platforms and the complaints about twitter not being balanced seem to end up being on twitter he says damodaran concludes that while there are some who come to twitter for news and witty banter many come to the platform to witness and sometimes take part in deranged arguments about trivial issues much as we like to complain about the ugliness and anger that we see on social media it is exactly those forces that draw users to it and arguing that elon musk will make it worse misses the point that he symbolizes the strengths and weaknesses of the twitter platform better than any other person walking the face of the earth he says disclaimer this article is based on aswath damodaran s article in his blog musings on markets

condition the therapist wanted me to accept her truth but i refused i explained to both of them that i knew god wanted a better life for her and that living a life of sin would never bring healing and restoration my daughter cried throughout the whole meeting but she knew she could never change my mind since that time i have gently and repeatedly explained that being a woman did not mean she could not have what society says are male qualities she was god s daughter strong outspoken resilient and beautiful just as he intended i affirmed my unconditional love for her and my duty as a parent to proclaim these eternal principles regardless of whether society said they were outdated or backward we had many painful nights filled with tears and feelings of hopelessness for both of us slowly i saw her childhood joy return i cannot guarantee it will last forever but she no longer claims to be the wrong gender and steadily appreciates how god has made her i share this heart wrenching struggle because i experienced the blessings of standing on god s word i would never give up on my daughter and we cannot give up on this country she is just one of the thousands of kids being torn apart by the demonic forces at work in their lives though much of disney s lgbtq advocacy has come to light with their public opposition to the florida parental rights bill disney s transformation has been going on for a long time for years christian parents have been navigating the corrupt and collapsed culture of a one time family friendly brand the movies consistently elevate central female characters who dare to reject tradition and exert their independence from conventional society the programming blatantly rejects a christian worldview of the family and god s view of human sexuality

movement sweeping the country refuses to stay silent about it any longer cp contributor jerry bower said it best outrage is not enough it s time for christians to stop merely talking about disney and start talking to them there are several ways we do that one of the most impactful ways is withdrawing our financial support for the disney brand that includes canceling disney subscriptions annual theme park passes and divesting from disney stock we also need to publicly express our disapproval with rallies protests and social media campaigns several southern california churches and worship leaders are leading the charge pastor rob mccoy teamed up with prominent christian activist sean feucht calling on the church to be bold and outspoken in defense of our children the first rally was outside of disney headquarters in burbank and this week it will take place at the theme park in anaheim calif christian social media influencers have also taken to instagram and facebook to encourage the public disappointment with disney s stance absent a sudden worldwide revival we may never turn back the tide of an increasingly debased culture however we defend biblical values because that is what we are called to do as christians regardless of the personal consequences even the threat of death could not deter peter and john from preaching what they knew do you think god wants us to obey you rather than him we cannot stop telling about everything we have seen and heard acts 4 19 20 we also appreciate suffering because suffering produces perseverance perseverance character romans 5 3 4 being a christian today takes courage because everyone seems to be moving in the opposite direction so the next time you pass your child on the couch watching a disney show about same sex parents and homosexual teenage romance remember those messages will be imprinted in their minds and later reinforced by their peers we must do everything in our power to challenge their narrative because every child matters the longer we stay silent the worse it will get

according to mary quite contrary gardens grow with silver bells and cockle shells or so the classic nursery rhyme goes cindy lyon a blue earth resident has slightly different advice for the horticulturally obtuse lyon a master gardener suggests a successful garden is first conceived in the mind rather than in the dirt where do you want to visualize what you re doing she prompts first time gardeners lyon s thumb has been green long enough to warrant taking her advice when asked how long she has been gardening lyon answers probably my whole life she recalls growing a single sunflower when she was six years old the cheerful giant which lyon patiently fed with milk grew to an impressive six feet tall we had to cut it down with an axe lyon laughs she officially became a member of the master gardener program which trains individuals in the science and art of gardening 15 years ago now lyon enjoys sowing seeds of gardening knowledge in her community she has done everything from offering basic advice to resolve local gardening quandaries to serving as superintendent at the faribault county fair s horticultural building to founding a garden tour during blue earth s giant days celebration after many years of watching gardens blossom lyon still gets excited at the prospect of a new landscape when confronting a new outdoor space lyon suggests using visualization to determine what the space ought to be filled with for example prospective gardeners should first visualize which of the many types of gardens will suit their needs best do they want a nursery landscape out front for passersby to admire or perhaps they have a front path and would enjoy planting a convoy of blooms along it leading to the front door a garden in close proximity to the kitchen may call for a variety of sweet smelling herbs however lyon also suggests new gardeners realistically tailor their vision to their environment they should consider not just what they would like to grow but also what will consent to grow in the space they have what s the soil like around the house lyon urges prospective gardeners to consider soil type has a huge effect upon which plants will be at home in a particular plot lyon shares those unfamiliar with their property s soil type can send it to the university of minnesota for a soil test new gardeners should also consider their property s growing zone growing zones which range from one to 10 in the united states are established by the us department of agriculture according to the climate of specific areas of the country they are an easy way for gardeners to determine which plant species are best suited to their area the minnesota area lyon explains occupies growing zones four and five lyon also says gardeners should consider whether their property contains a microclimate an area altered by extra shade or sunshine high winds or other factors affecting the growth of its green inhabitants a single backyard can contain multiple microclimates so plants new homes should be chosen thoughtfully some shrubs enjoy the shade provided by a large oak tree other bright blooms flourish in un obstructed sunlight after a prospective gardener has given consideration to these many factors however they can get more specific with their preferences after all the world of horticulture offers endless possibilities for each garden bed for example a gardener interested in flowers can select picking flowers or flowers they intend to let alone they may want to consider flowers which bloom annually or perennials lyon notes climbers can be fun although they may necessitate the purchase of a trellis there is also a whole realm of vegetables for those looking to eat the products of their outdoor toil for those who feel bewildered by the wide world of plant life lyon suggests several resources worth consulting she highly recommends the university of minnesota extension site which houses an ask a master gardener site at extension umn edu master gardener ask master gardener com there gardeners in a quandary can send their question to a master gardener volunteer and receive a personal response it s a wealth of information lyon says lyon also loves combing gardening magazines for new ideas however she adds seeking advice can be as simple as visiting a local nursery i d hope someone at a nursery can give you advice she says lyon recommends several spots which are worth a visit for those in search of seeds soil greens or guidance in blue earth lyon notes gartzke s greenhouse twisted vine floral bomgaars and juba s stock gardening supplies for those willing to travel further lyon mentions that hill s gardens in albert lea is a favorite horticultural haunt of hers of course the work has only just begun after the plants have been selected and transplanted into their new home lyon shares a few words of wisdom for tending to a newly planted plot follow the instructions on everything lyon suggests noting printed instructions on gardening products should be followed to the letter she also urges those who expect children will be frequent visitors of their gardens to be on top of which products may be poisonous sometimes plants get diseases lyon warns adding this is a possibility for new gardeners to be on the look out for finally she advises new gardeners be aware of what their plant friends may attract someone who is allergic to bees may not wish to plant blooms which will tempt a swarm of the striped pollinators when asked how much time a new gardener can expect to invest in their greens lyon says you can spend an hour every day or spend weekends for lyon though the time is well worth it it s a lot of work lyon admits but it s pleasurable and rewarding

my quiet neighborhood in the capital which is patrolled by the metropolitan police the u s park police and the secret service s foreign missions branch has been the site of an unprecedented number of crimes someone identity unknown as far as i know tried to break into and presumably rob the peruvian ambassador whose home is about four blocks away four blocks in the opposite direction a sniper shot four people and then killed himself the roads were blocked by law enforcement the search for the shooter involved police helicopters circling overhead for hours at about the same time the shooter was committing suicide a woman leapt eight stories from an apartment building a block from my home apparently to escape from a man who was abusing her then some distance from here at the supreme court a man set himself on fire all this as spring in washington is at its most glorious the dogwoods are in full blossom the tulips and daffodils are in bloom and the azaleas are about to bathe every lawn and hillside in red pink and white beautiful cardinals are swooping about gathering nesting materials the juxtaposition of the glories of nature with the madness of men was dramatic i d find this depressing except on the national scene this has been a rare wonderful week for the rational it seems that on multiple occasions sanity is prevailing over nuttiness mask mandates florida u s district judge kathryn kimball mizelle issued a ruling ending mask mandates on public transportation indicating they infringed on americans rights and were imposed without adhering to the laws governing administrative rule making regardless of the attacks on her as out of line her decision was in perfect accord with a recent supreme court decision that also said the cdc had overreached its authority when it limited evictions stephen carter writes last august in alabama association of realtors v department of health and human services the justices rejected the cdc s claim that the public health service act granted the authority to restrict evictions of renters during the pandemic the court held that the statute s language though broad wasn t as broad as the government argued the cdc s interpretation of the phsa the majority wrote strains credulity which leads us to the problem the cdc justified its transportation mask mandate by citing exactly the same language judge mizelle quotes the supreme court majority to the effect that since enactment in 1944 the phsa has rarely been invoked and has generally been limited to quarantining infected individuals and prohibiting the import or sale of animals known to transmit disease here wrote the judge the cdc went well beyond those limits intuition might suggest that masking travelers unlike regulating landlord tenant relations is close to the act s core purpose but judge mizelle again following the supreme court s example closely parses the statutory language and finds no support for the cdc s action most travelers and airline personnel were elated to be able to breathe freely again and those who don t are free to continue masking up but dr fauci seemed disconsolate that his dictatorship over the country was over this is a cdc issue he said it should not have been a court issue in so doing he exposed his own hubris if the constitution made the cdc a coequal or even superior branch it must be in invisible ink after some flummoxing the administration said it would appeal but this is not to say that mizelle will be overruled or even that the appeal is a serious effort to do so the department of justice did not seek to have her order stayed it did not even ask for an emergency appeal and clearly because to do so would be unpopular the congressional democrats are making no effort to revive the rule by imposing a federal mask mandate on air travel interstate bus routes and train transportation most likely sometime after they file the appeal the cdc will end the mandate rule on the ground that it is no longer necessary snd argue that the appeal should be dismissed as moot because it no longer exists such a ploy would allow the fans of the administrative state to keep the supreme court from ruling squarely on the scope of the cdc s authority so they again could try such a stunt ruling the country often most arbitrarily and discriminatorily under the pretext of protecting us from some disease cnn folds bleeding viewers and revenue the honchos at cnn decided it was a swell idea to create another venue cnn which would be a subscriber only streaming service it must be nice to be a network executive because no matter how bad your judgment and loss to stockholders you still rake in the big bucks on april 30 a little over 30 days from its creation cnn will cease to exist cnn s chief media correspondent brian stelter is yet again a laughingstock having this week said with a straight face that it was too early to tell if cnn was a success or failure wait a month after its demise and let us know netflix and spotify there are lots of ways that favored that is democratic pols and their families clean up when out of office for the obamas it was a reported 65 million book deal and apparently generous production deal contracts with netflix and spotify netflix s woke offerings did not appeal to more than the kind of selective audience who showed up for biden campaign appearances netflix stock lost 50 billion in one day after it announced that for the first time in 10 years it had lost subscribers spotify and netflix both reportedly were not enthralled with the products the obamas produced for them so both contracts were not extended disney agonistes in the parade of losers we can t ignore disney for motives that defy reason it decided to attack florida s governor ron desantis and the florida legislature for enacting a law that barred teachers from discussing their sex lives with young students in their care the media and the bright lights of the sort who publish in the new england journal of higher education distorted the language and import of the law mislabeling it the don t say gay law it has nothing to do with gays and everything to do with what parents consider the best age and venue school or home for such discussions outside of the legacy media and academia the law has wide support tucker carlson the polling firm public opinion strategies found out why they do fully two thirds of voters believe it is inappropriate for teachers or school personnel to discuss gender identity with children in kindergarten through third grade well of course it is everyone thinks that so if there was ever a law that accurately reflected public opinion which should matter in a democracy this was the law but across the country in the state of california bob iger was watching and bob iger didn t like it in any event the florida legislature decided that disney s dishonest campaign against this legislation required a suitable response and stripped the company of its decades long legislatively granted self governance the 27 000 acres of reedy creek district and tax exemption the company tax tab for listening to iger and its wokester staff is estimated at 20 million per year and that doesn t include the public response many are waving mickey goodbye twitter vs elon the outfit that has delighted in silencing anyone who disagrees with its views and deplatforming them like soviet era censors is coming closer to being taken over by elon musk a libertarian sort who does believe oddly enough to the left that free speech means you can say things with which he disagrees this is a concept unknown or disregarded on college campuses where anything the left doesn t like is attacked as racist or triggering or offensive and must be silenced he secured the financing 46 5 billion to buy the company this week and i wish him and his financial backers well in his bid to buy up all the company s shares from stockholders and turn this juvenile

tech companies across canada are struggling to keep and retain staff as they face competition from higher salaries in the u s so some employers are trying to find new ways to attract the workers they need to thrive recent moves by u s technology giants meta google and amazon to significantly beef up their presence and staffing levels in canada have cemented the country s status as a growing hub for technology talent while canada s tech boom may be welcome news for those who dream of working for these tech giants it comes at a cost for local startups which suddenly have to compete with foreign goliaths for the country s best and brightest the more companies are being created and built the more pressure there is said jeremy shaki co founder of lighthouse labs a toronto based technology education company that offers coding boot camps and other services for people looking to level up their careers shaki says it s no secret why large foreign tech firms are eager to set up shop in canada beyond the access to new customers canadian universities are cranking out skilled workers at a rapid clip and they often come at a fraction of what they would cost in places like silicon valley in late march meta formerly known as facebook announced plans to hire up to 2 500 people in toronto and in other parts of canada while google says it s looking to triple its workforce here amazon wants to hire for some 600 tech jobs but in pure financial terms these companies have the resources to outbid everyone else when it comes to securing the right person and that can make things difficult for local firms trying to compete more than just money ron spreeuwenberg faces that challenge every day he s the ceo of himama a software company founded in toronto in 2013 himama makes software solutions for the child care industry and employs roughly 180 people more than half of whom have been hired in the past two years now boasting 10 000 customers the company has expanded its hiring pool well beyond their home base of toronto with staff across canada and the u s canada s days of being little more than a source of cheap coders are over says spreeuwenberg i think we had a period of time where we were lucky where we could find really great quality talent at lower compensation rates he said in an interview but people have found out about us and it made it challenging watch how small startups compete with the big guns fighting to keep canada s tech talent duration 0 50 ron spreeuwenberg ceo of toronto based software company himama says his business is booming but it is getting harder and harder to compete with u s giants setting up shop in canada because of all the technology talent here the biggest thing spreeuwenberg says he hears time and again from new hires is that they want the opportunity to grow and develop their skills the no 1 reason why people choose a company or a role is what the company does and the opportunity for them in terms of learning and development and the challenge he said that said he acknowledges money helps we know we re competing against companies who certainly can afford a lot more than us when it comes to compensation spreeuwenberg says a major selling feature for recruiting would be hires to himama from outside canada is the country itself as is the opportunity to work toward the company s goal of improving childhood development those are very important for us and things that a lot of our employees care deeply about he said meta recently announced plans to hire up to 2 500 more people in canada as part of a plan to pivot toward what is called the metaverse evan mitsui cbc that desire to do good work and help solve problems is a major theme at another canadian startup mysa based in st john s founded as a kickstarter project in 2016 the smart thermostat company has grown from just two employees at launch to more than 100 across canada today serving more than 150 000 customers just as shopify is synonymous with ottawa and blackberry is to waterloo the 800 pound gorilla of the technology sector on the east coast is verafin a st john s based cybersecurity firm that made headlines last year when it was bought by nasdaq for nearly 3 billion while not a household name in the rest of canada verafin s successes have shone a light on the region s booming technology sector said mysa co founder joshua green that means he too is dealing with the same compensation conundrum other startups face it s hard to compete with deep pocketed big tech but just as himama appeals to people looking to live in toronto he s able to make a similar pitch that quality of living of being able to work for a technology company while also living in a place like newfoundland and labrador is appealing to not everyone but a growing number of people green said and the no 1 reason why i think people want to join our mission and the purpose of why we exist as a company is to fight climate change investment money pouring in too the himamas and mysas of the world aren t just attracting the attention of tech giants like google meta and microsoft when it comes to hiring they re also attracting u s investment dollars himama recently secured 70 million in funding from boston based private equity firm bain capital a sign of just how on the radar canada s tech ecosystem has become there s a lot of interest from investors outside of canada in canadian companies because of the talent and the quality of the startups said craig leonard a partner with venture capital fund graphite ventures but also they are relatively less expensive at times than some of the companies who would be built in in some of the other ecosystems say in the united states according to a recent report from commercial real estate firm cbre toronto is the third largest technology hub in north america ottawa and vancouver also rank in the top dozen well ahead of places like austin texas portland ore and chicago though it may be hard to believe there are more tech workers in toronto than there are in seattle which is home to amazon and microsoft not that long ago lower salaries would have been a major selling point for a u s tech company looking to establish a beachhead in canada but the pandemic changed things some as the shift toward virtual offices allowed canadian companies to attract talent from around the world it also levelled up the salaries and the opportunity for canadian talent to go and work for other companies said leonard watch tech at its best is a flywheel of talent this investor says canada a flywheel of tech talent duration 0 36 craig leonard with investment firm graphite ventures says the right tech ecosystem for everyone is one where companies invest in their employees to create value for them but also end up creating the next generation of companies in the process for dr alexandra greenhill the ceo of vancouver based health care focused artificial intelligence firm careteam technologies inc a little healthy competition is good for everyone making companies of all sizes better while also spurring on the next generation of startups if we do this right it could be a very positive thing for the country she said in an interview but if we don t do this right it can be a disaster greenhill said she recently lost a handful of great people to amazon after it set up shop in her backyard of vancouver and were offering two to three times the salary that i offer my engineers while she doesn t begrudge anyone for leaving she d like to see large rivals invest a little more in training less experienced workers as opposed to simply hoovering up a local talent pool that s been painstakingly created over time we can give them all kinds of perks and interesting things to do and whatnot but the pure dollars are just completely out of our league and drive all the prices up she said though greenhill admits it s a constant struggle she s optimistic about canada s tech future because she can see what s possible when the right environment is created one that encourages foreign companies to come in and participate in the ecosystem rather than just take from it technology giants including netflix google amazon and facebook now known as meta have been on a hiring spree in canada of late jason alden bloomberg she s on the board of canada s digital technology supercluster a government led initiative seeking to fast track canada s status as a digital hub greenhill says the initiative combines the carrot of government cash to fund tech projects with the stick that strings come attached to that money specifically foreign tech giants wishing to participate have to invest themselves and set up roots too they have a role to play in making the ecosystem a better stronger place she said a rising tide lifts all boats with the backing of government the supercluster initiative plays something of a convener role greenhill said holding big tech accountable for their commitments and inviting them to behave like good corporate citizens and instead of seeing big tech as an adversary they can help to cross pollinate the whole ecosystem they set up accelerators they become mentors they create joint projects with the local companies she said to the investment community dollars and cents will always be top of mind but graphite s leonard says the best outcome for canada s tech sector is one where there s a lot of collaboration and competition if you get that consistent investment it creates a flywheel effect of anchor companies that then develop that talent he said they start companies those companies exit that talent goes back into the pool as well as investment dollars without that collaboration and long term commitment there will be no rising tide to raise all boats if we don t do anything you can end up being a country that just exports talent greenhill said

part of the series covering climate now this story originally appeared in the nation and is part of covering climate now a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story republican state leaders are on the warpath against blackrock the largest financial asset manager in the nation the company s sin statements by blackrock leadership that climate change is a long term threat and that the company will pursue investments that promote a reduction in emissions in january west virginia declared that it was barring the company from managing its state pension funds texas passed legislation in february prohibiting any firm divesting from fossil fuels from managing state assets in march the arkansas state treasurer march withdrew 125 million from money market accounts managed by blackrock this followed a letter last year sent by a dozen republican state treasurers threatening to pull funds from banks that had made commitments in line with the paris climate accord to stop financing new fossil fuel investments despite chairman larry fink s bold statement in his annual letter to ceos that every government company and shareholder must confront climate change blackrock pledged in a february letter to texas officials we will continue to invest in and support fossil fuel companies as a company holding investments in nearly every major firm in the nation blackrock s change of tune did not amount to an actual change in policy since the firm hadn t actually divested from anything but it still sounded like a defeat to progressives in reality though the reason red states are scrambling to pass such legislation and make these threats is because they are losing the fight fossil fuel firms are facing disinvestment campaigns all over the country mounted by grassroots activists thanks to this pressure blackrock and the two other largest top managers of retirement funds vanguard and state street have pledged to use their voting power in corporate governance to support a transition to a net zero emissions economy over time with the investments they manage the problem for the fossil fuel industry is that while pro fossil fuel red state officials tout the 600 billion in pension and other financial assets they oversee that s a tiny fraction of the 5 6 trillion in public pension funds and related assets in 6 000 separate public sector retirement systems across the nation the assets of those who believe in climate change dwarf the assets of those that don t observes david walleck in dismissing the texas and west virginia threats noting that his organization for the long term works for 17 state treasurers committed to addressing climate change who collectively manage 2 trillion in assets and that doesn t even include new york state for example and many other state city and country funds allied with his organization s efforts public tantrums by red state officials reflect the dramatic successes of climate change activists in pushing fundamental shifts by the financial sector even if the steps actually taken by blackrock and others are only the beginning of what is needed there is now a network of state based activists who recognize that they can exercise real power over pension assets controlled by the states and they don t need the permission of joe manchin or anyone else at the federal level to use that power there is a straight line to this point from a march in new york city in june 2017 the day donald trump announced that he was pulling out of the paris agreement on climate change led by new york communities for change nycc a local community organizing group a multiracial crowd of 2000 people showed up demanding that the city divest from the fossil fuel industry nycc had recently launched a climate change inequality campaign partly in response to superstorm sandy and the clear threat climate change posed to the city s future and the worsening of racial and economic inequality in the wake of such climate catastrophes new york attorney general tish james who was then new york city s public advocate spoke that night in her role as the first trustee of the city pension funds to come out in support of fossil fuel divestment rallies die ins at usually staid pension fund meetings and other direct actions led to the city trustees voting in 2018 to completely divest from fossil fuels making new york city s 267 billion pension system the largest fund in the country at that point to join the divestment movement though the fossil fuel divestment movement had started on college campuses and in the philanthropic sector it expanded steadily throughout the early 2010s nyc was first big us pension fund to move explains the nycc campaign s firebrand organizer pete sikora and it is at the heart of global capital important in size and in a city where fossil fuel is funded by creating international headlines says sikora nyc asked other cities to follow and it mainstreamed divestment larger and larger and more and more funds began to follow along with london and other jurisdictions around the world new york state followed new york city in 2020 in announcing that it would divest its 268 billion in assets from direct investments in fossil fuels within five years and would sell all shares in any company contributing to global warming by 2040 beyond dumping specific fossil fuel stocks which it is moving to do within a few years state controller thomas dinapoli is working toward a completely carbon free fund by 2040 that affects the whole portfolio argues sikora which affects car companies and the utility industry it is demanding far reaching changes from all companies by 2040 puts a hammer on all those companies to change their behavior that is an extremely important thing new york has been joined by multiple states backing mandates of various levels of toughness one of the most forceful being by the california state teachers retirement system which has committed to similar timelines for decarbonizing its 328 billion in investments because red states have never provided decent pensions for their public employees which is sad for everyone in those states as sikora notes blue state pension funds are just far bigger pools of capital and bring more firepower to any financial fight why target blackrock the reason blackrock finds itself in the crosshairs is because activists want to not just have public pension funds invest their trillions of dollars in assets in a more climate friendly fashion but are also seeking to use those public assets to leverage changes in tens of trillions of dollars in spending by private financial firms like blackrock that is ultimately the only way to begin to decarbonize the estimated 250 trillion in financial assets globally partly as an offshoot of its successful new york city divestment campaign nycc would join blackrocksbigproblem a network formed in 2018 of us and international organizations from the sierra club to amazon watch to the union of concerned scientists along with grassroots action partners like nycc climate finance action in boston and break free switzerland many people won t even recognize blackrock s name but investors know their ishares exchange traded funds and other low cost index mutual funds that sit in their iras and 401ks founded in 1988 blackrock now manages 10 trillion in assets meaning it could buy apple microsoft google and amazon outright and still have money left over to buy tesla as well but the nature of its index fund business means that instead it owns a bit of nearly every major company blackrock holds a 5 percent or greater stake in more than 97 percent of the companies that make up the s p 500 index combined with other asset managers like vanguard and state street those three firms control 25 percent of shares voting in corporate director elections at s p 500 companies blackrock is one of the few transnational government level entities that can affect geological history says sikora while he admits that the firm has made steps in the right direction right now overall it is using that power to light the planet on fire by pouring money into oil and coal blackrock needs to change to save the planet blackrock is also a target because many of the assets that it manages are from public pensions it depends on providing a range of consulting and other services to governments as well the federal reserve itself hired blackrock to help manage its massive corporate buying program in the middle of the pandemic while the concentrated power of big financial management firms is certainly cause for concern as the american economic liberties project argued in its report the new money trust this concentration also means that when blue state pension funds act together they can leverage that power across the financial landscape which is precisely why the red state treasurers are in such a meltdown there is a powerful institutional customer lever that public pensions have they hire blackrock and vanguard to run sleeves of their portfolio says mary ceruli who led climate finance action s organizing in boston working with the sierra club and college divestment groups and seiu to move the massachusetts public pension funds in an activist direction it sends a signal when public pension funds express concern on blackrock not being active enough on climate change or other issues blackrock is not just concerned about losing access to the 5 6 trillion in public pension funds that make annual payments to retired public employees so called defined benefit plans it also wants to access the 2 6 trillion flowing through the 401k style defined contribution plans administered by state retirement programs thereby creating relationships directly with individual retirees that gives states additional leverage for asset management firms participating in public retirement programs acts as a seal of approval of prudent management in the public mind firms have reason to fear being labeled by state pension funds as enemies of sustainability individual investors especially the millennials whom every firm wants to attract as new lifetime customers overwhelmingly report 70 percent of respondents in one survey taking into account companies environmental practices along with other social issues when deciding where to invest their money although many correctly express the belief that such social investing reduces market risk and improves returns more than half say they are willing to sacrifice some performance on investments to achieve such goals including 75 percent of millennial investors climate change activists are particularly focusing on what are known as target date funds that adjust the mix of stocks and bonds as workers approach retirement since an estimated two thirds of savers park retirement savings there activists note that blackrock moved swiftly to exclude russian assets from their core index funds after the ukraine invasion similarly they argue firms could remake them to be climate safe as well what climate change activists and now allied public pension fund managers are also demanding is that blackrock and other firms use their control of shares in firms to change those firms behavior voting on shareholder resolutions and board elections to make management operate their firms in a more climate friendly manner and they are getting results three years ago blackrock and other asset management firms said they didn t use their shareholder votes explains myriam fallon a media spokesperson for blackrocksbigproblem now they actively vote last year they voted out three out of four exxon board members in favor of ones who are more climate friendly they haven t gone as far as we want but they have gone forward blackrock and other firms have signed onto a 2050 net zero emissions commitment and blackrock is preparing to present a 2030 goal as blackrock makes such commitments it encourages other firms to think twice about new investments in fossil fuel companies as financial analyst david carlin recently argued in forbes fossil fuel mining exploration and extraction all are capital intensive activities that demand constant access to capital if capital costs rise or the supply of capital is reduced projects can become uneconomical and fossil fuel companies can see their valuations fall private equity firms have increasingly abandoned new fossil fuel startups where the majority of private equity went to conventional energy funds as recently as 2015 by 2020 the majority was going to renewable funds with only a minimal amount going to the conventional fossil fuel investments if blackrock and other firms say they won t be buying such assets in a few years many investors are asking who will buy this business in five years time says philippe poletti head of the buyout team at private equity firm ardian the goal of climate change activists is to leverage every public asset to force every firm to decarbonize they are building alliances with private us pension funds which manage 3 6 trillion as well as with the rest of the 35 trillion in global pension funds in the developed world both public and private which if properly mobilized can have a decisive impact on global financial markets climate change activists are also eyeing another massive pot of financial assets namely the insurance industry insurance companies both assess risk and are asset managers think about flood insurance or folks losing home insurance due to wildfires notes moira birss another leader at blackrocksbigproblem and climate director at amazon watch insurance regulation happens almost entirely at the state level so that is a place where state action could have an impact globally insurance companies hold 40 trillion in assets 9 7 trillion by us insurance companies alone to cover anticipated losses losses that will only grow if climate change is not checked there is plenty of room for state based activists to encourage more sustainable investments by insurance companies with the assets they manage in multiple states activists are still working to get some public pension funds off the sidelines and getting the rest to be more ambitious in their goals part of what s needed is to have more progressives recognize the power of these state controlled pensions one thing i ve noticed over the years argues nycc s sikora climate activists put an enormous effort into moving us government action and policy but for the same energy you can put a lot of heat on wall

tommy williams just about the time you think it s safe to go back in the water think again it s not a simple metaphor for the that persistent covid 19 that has crept back into the headlines several states are experiencing surges and the mask mandate has been eliminated for public transportation of course this week the center for disease control asked the justice department to appeal that mask removal ruling that had been rendered by a federal judge stay tuned on that seems a bit unnerving that the pandemic has not gone away yet we all want to act as if it s over it is now impossible to determine even a close estimate of positive cases as home testing kits are in so many homes perhaps two very important takeaways we are much better prepared now than two years ago so our investment accounts are going to have to fret about other things until we see a new trend emerge and 2 the hospitalization and death counts are still greatly reduced from a recently as february maybe the new normal may very well include us living with an ever evolving virus this week i checked out the weekly commentary from nuveen investments for their take on the markets the economy and the potential impact on investment accounts they state it like this a volatile start to the year underscored the adage that markets do not like uncertainty they do not pretend that making portfolio decisions is easy right now because of that they anchor their views on the premise that taking a longer term view has proven to provide the right perspective also they suggest that we investors focus on the knowns rather than the many unknowns they state three important things we know market volatility investors with an appetite for risk and with the fortitude to weather wide price swings may well find compelling opportunities in some asset classes that are beaten up the federal reserve certainly replaced will they or won t they the high level of speculation in march regarding interest rate increases was made much clearer some stocks will benefit from this reduction in uncertainty alone inflation while they expect inflation to remain somewhat elevated they do not predict an out of control inflationary spiral allocations to select real assets and other traditional inflation hedges will like serve investors well i realize i m back to playing a broken record again but i do find some measure of comfort when the experts from unrelated entities express similar views i will add however that if you want to find some bad news like a prediction that the financial world as we have known it is ending and that the inevitable market crash is on a near horizon you won t have to look far there are plenty of pessimists out there i m just not one of them let me close with some pearls of wisdom from my friend and colleague rick weddell chief investment officer at rfg advisory in birmingham alabama in an excellent presentation delivered to a group of clients in shreveport last week he reminded the group of a very meaningful fact on the subject of recently experienced volatility it goes like this all of you have or should have a very carefully prepared financial plan one that is suited to accommodate your goals objectives risk tolerance time frame etc etc this plan has built into it assumptions for volatility and how to weather numerous types of storms that being the case here are a handful of conclusions 1 if your plan is in place let it perform short term knee jerk reactions are not your friend 2 if anything changes your objectives for example get with your trusted advisor and see what tweaking might be in order and 3 if you don t have such a forward looking financial plan you ought to get one this is not a healthy climate for the majority of do it yourselfers

connecticut speaker of the house matt ritter speaks during opening session at the state capitol wednesday feb 9 2022 in hartford jessica hill associated press since the start of the pandemic the issue of children s mental health has been top of mind not just for policymakers but parents and teachers with the unprecedented disruption caused by closed schools and canceled activities leading to overwhelming demand for services the search has been on for ways to fill those needs a number of proposals have been put forward during this year s short legislative session for tackling this crisis which has manifested in overwhelmed emergency departments and long waits for services that often demand immediate attention as should have been expected the remedies will not come cheap as reporting in the ct mirror attests the price tag could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars one measure senate bill 2 is projected to cost up to 210 million over two years to pay for increased child care rates for providers and their employers more money would go toward broadening access to mobile crisis services while different proposals would dedicate separate funds toward other needs advertisement article continues below this ad those proposals are matched by increased demand including huge jumps in the number of young people waiting at hospitals to receive services parents and caregivers who face a crisis in connecticut are faced with an impossible choice of going to an emergency department and potentially facing waits that are hours long or worse knowing that waiting in a hospital is helping no one or trying alternative means to get through the worst of a situation there are no good answers legislative leaders to their credit say they are committed to spending what it takes to alleviate this situation the money needed to fund these bills will be in the budget house speaker matthew ritter said at the same time that word of the proposals high price tag was going around came the most recent news about the state s financial situation it s the opposite of what many in connecticut had come to expect as the norm in a state that had been characterized by constant budget shortfalls gov ned lamont s budget office recently projected a single year surplus of 3 95 billion that s up from recent projections and bigger than the entire rainy day fund which has been statutorily maxed out some is from covid relief and a rising stock market is still the biggest contributor but there are positive signs on many fronts the state for the moment at least has a lot of money advertisement article continues below this ad a chunk of that will go toward tax cuts there are limits on that based on rules regarding covid relief funds but connecticut will surely find ways to reduce taxes in various ways other funds will go toward securing our long term future something that was too often neglected in the leaner years but when we look to current spending needs it s hard to come up with something more pressing than children s mental health the need is acute and the solution more providers and improved access is within our reach

new york cnn business does the richest person on the planet need another massive pay package that s the decision facing the tesla board of directors ceo elon musk doesn t receive any cash salary or bonus he s paid only with stock options but he has just about exhausted the options available from the compensation package he got from tesla in 2018 a package that turned out to be the most lucrative package of stock options issued by any company according to courtney yu director of research at executive compensation firm equilar the 93 9 million options musk has received so far from that package were worth 86 8 billion as of friday s close after taking into account the exercise price musk got 25 3 million of those options just this past week due to the record earnings tesla posted wednesday he s likely to soon receive another 8 4 million options probably after the company posts its second or third quarter results based on analysts revenue forecasts for the company but those 8 4 million options worth billions are a relatively small portion of what musk ultimately might receive once he gets those additional options he will have received all 101 million split adjusted options that were part of that 2018 pay package the question should be whether he ll get even more options perhaps tens of millions more options musk dodged a question about such a payday during an investor call wednesday saying simply there are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me but that doesn t mean he won t be offered that kind of payday in the future not all tech ceo get options some tech billionaires have done just fine without stock options amazon amzn founder jeff bezos who is the world s second richest person worth about 100 billion less than musk and facebook fb founder mark zuckerberg have received no stock grants or options since their companies initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012 respectively they also have not earned much in the way of salary bezos got 81 000 a year in salary while he was ceo and zuckerberg has taken home a salary of 1 a year for most of the last decade they profited from the vast appreciation in value of the shares they have held since their companies went public much of musk s net worth estimated at 270 billion comes from the appreciation in tesla shares but he has also regularly received stock options as a form of compensation since 2009 the year before the company s ipo he has exercised many of those options as they were due to expire virtually all his remaining options come from his 2018 pay package wall street wants more musk options many analysts believe it s only a matter of time before tesla comes up with another package of options for musk alex potter the analyst for piper sandler co who asked musk about a possible new compensation package on wednesday s investor call took a moment to say that the previous package seemed to work quite well and 81 of tesla shareholders who voted on musk s pay package in 2018 approved of it other analysts believe a new package will be good for the company as well as musk eventually the board will reload elon s plan and that plan will be massive just like the last plan said gene munster managing partner at loup ventures elon thinks big and he has massive new markets to go after and build large businesses including autonomy and robots is there a public relations downside to lavishing the world s richest person with additional options that could add tens if not hundreds of billions to his wealth elon is the richest person in the world and he still can appeal to hardworking people munsger said those people would largely cheer him on with a massive new comp package a new options package for musk could do much to assure investors worried that he might lose his focus on tesla due to his ceo position with spacex or his interest in buying and transforming twitter it will make tesla investors sleep better at night knowing he has a five to 10 year comp package signed sealed and delivered said dan ives tech analyst with wedbush securities does musk need more options to care about tesla it s tough to picture someone as wealthy as musk and as passionate as he is about tesla being motivated to spend more or less time on the company based on what he gets in his next compensation package and if money is a motivating factor the value of his current 265 5 million tesla shares and options should provide all the incentive he needs he s already financially motivated for tesla to continue to do well said equilar s yu but advocates of a new package say it would answer many of the doubts about musk s focus that have been swirling since he announced his plans to buy twitter twtr even though his dna is not going to change whether or not he has new tesla options the street is going to want him to have another comp package said ives there are costs to tesla involved in giving musk additional options even though it s non cash compensation the estimated accounting value of those options shows up as an expense in its earnings statement last year tesla booked 571 million in expenses related to musk s 2018 pay package alone if he doesn t get a new one that expense will disappear from its profit and loss statement and while a new package for musk is sure to be criticized by those who believe executives are paid too much tesla shareholders and no one else will be making that decision musk is already either a hero or villain in eyes of people said ives a new package is either going to cause people to hate him more or be relieved he s staying put

pretax segment operating margin expanded 229 basis points bps led by well construction and reservoir performance these results reflect the strength of our core services divisions the broad based activity increase and the continued realization of our improved operating leverage the quarter also marked the tragic start of the conflict in ukraine which is of grave concern accordingly we established local and global crisis management teams to respond to the crisis and its effect on employees business and our operations in addition to ensuring that our operations are compliant with developing sanctions we took the step in the quarter to suspend new investment and technology deployment to our russia operations we urge the cessation of hostilities and are hopeful that peace will return to ukraine and the entire region shifting trends in the energy landscape concurrently a shift in focus is emerging in the energy landscape exacerbating an already tightly supplied oil and gas market the dislocation of supply flows from russia will result in increased global investment across geographies and the entire energy value chain to ensure the diversification and security of the world s energy supply the confluence of elevated commodity prices demand led activity growth and energy security are resulting in one of the strongest outlooks for the energy services industry in recent times reinforcing the market fundamentals for a stronger and longer multiyear upcycle absent a global economic setback in this context energy has never been more essential to the world schlumberger which uniquely benefits from increasing e p activity and digital transformation provides the most comprehensive technology portfolio to help customers deliver diverse cleaner and more affordable energy first quarter growth led by well construction and reservoir performance year on year revenue growth by division was led by well construction and reservoir performance our core services divisions both of which grew more than 20 outperforming global rig count growth digital integration revenue grew 11 while production systems revenue increased 1 our core services divisions experienced double digit revenue growth in drilling evaluation intervention and stimulation services both on land and offshore in digital integration growth was driven by strong digital sales increased exploration data license sales and higher revenue from asset performance solutions aps projects in contrast production systems growth was temporarily hampered by ongoing supply chain and logistics constraints resulting in lower than expected product deliveries however we are confident that these constraints will gradually abate enabling backlog conversion and accelerating revenue growth for production systems through the rest of 2022 on a geographical basis revenue growth compared to the same quarter last year was broad based with international revenue increasing 10 and north america growing 32 international growth was widespread across all areas led by latin america due to higher drilling in mexico ecuador argentina and brazil europe cis africa grew primarily from higher production systems sales in turkey and increased exploration drilling in offshore africa particularly in angola namibia gabon and kenya these increases however were partially offset by revenue decline in russia central asia middle east asia revenue increased due to higher drilling stimulation and intervention activity in qatar iraq the united arab emirates egypt australia and across southeast asia in north america growth was pervasive across drilling and completions activity coupled with a strong contribution from our aps project in canada year on year first quarter pretax segment operating income margin expanded due to improved operating leverage from higher activity favorable offshore activity mix greater technology adoption and an improving global pricing environment which continues to evolve favorably in well construction and reservoir performance digital integration margin expanded further while production systems margin was impacted by supply chain constraints sequentially the quarter s revenue primarily reflects the typical seasonal activity decline in the northern hemisphere with the decline in europe cis africa more pronounced due to the depreciation of the ruble as well as global supply chain constraints impacting production systems in contrast north america and latin america revenue was essentially flat sequentially by division well construction revenue was slightly higher than last quarter as strong drilling activity in north america latin america and the middle east more than offset the seasonal reductions in europe cis africa and asia reservoir performance production systems and digital integration were sequentially lower due to seasonal reductions in activity and sales first quarter cash from operations was 131 million including a first quarter build up of working capital above the usual level ahead of the anticipated growth for the year we expect free cash flow generation to accelerate throughout the year consistent with our historical trend and still expect double digit free cash flow margin on a full year basis moving forward the outlook for the rest of the year particularly in the second half is shaping up very well with both short and long cycle investments accelerating notably a number of fids for long cycle development projects have been approved new contracts were awarded offshore exploration drilling is resuming and several customers have announced a significant step up in their spending plans for this year and over the next few years consequently it is our view that increased activity both on land and offshore higher technology adoption and pricing momentum will drive simultaneous growth internationally and in north america this will result in a sequential seasonal rebound in the second quarter followed by significant growth in the second half of the year particularly in the international market with this backdrop and despite the uncertainty linked to russia we believe the current market dynamics should allow us to maintain our full year ambitions of year on year revenue growth in the mid teens and adjusted ebitda margins exiting the year at least 200 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 our positive outlook extends further into 2023 and beyond as we anticipate successive years of market growth as demand continues to strengthen and new investments are committed to diversify energy supply the duration and scale of this upcycle may potentially prove higher than originally anticipated absent a setback in the economic recovery based on these strengthening fundamentals we made the decision to initiate incremental return to shareholders with a 40 dividend increase the trajectory of our cashflows affords us the flexibility to accelerate our return of capital program while continuing to deleverage the balance sheet and invest for long term success at this pivotal moment in energy for the world schlumberger is well positioned our advantaged market position technology leadership and execution differentiation are aligned for significant returns potential throughout the cycle other events on april 21 2022 schlumberger s board of directors approved a 40

eagle ford shale ensign natural resources was able to reduce new well capital expenditure and well pad emissions using vx spectra surface multiphase flowmeters previously ensign was using a three phase separator for production monitoring on every well by deploying vx spectra flowmeters which measure without the need to separate components of production ensign is now able to use a single test separator per pad and a vx spectra flowmeter for real time monitoring of individual well performance this reduced capex by decreasing the number of required separators lowering well pad emissions by 75 the first worldwide 6 in ora intelligent wireline formation testing platform implementation was performed in kuwait in january 2022 with a 3d focused radial probe on a deep drilling rig at 16 100 ft enabling the first ever downhole sampling in the jurassic tight gas reservoir koc s implementation was a great opportunity to prove schlumberger technology leadership and the ora platform enabled a fourfold increase in sampling efficiency in one of the most complex reservoirs in kuwait this operation reduced koc s carbon footprint using one of our transition technologies and paves the way for

a stock market scorned for high tech growth stocks is producing some interesting opportunities that any investor can take advantage of investors hungry for stocks they can buy with modest sums have a lot of great options right now that s because many of the growth stocks that soared in the pandemic s early days have fallen hard not all of the stocks that tanked this year deserve to bounce right back but more than a few are primed for a rebound shares of roblox rblx 4 46 global e online glbe 3 40 and pubmatic pubm 5 21 are currently trading for 35 or less and all three have a good shot at delivering eye watering returns to investors who buy and hold their shares for the long run roblox right now you can scoop up shares of roblox for a little less than 35 per share that s about 75 less than you would have paid for this metaverse stock when it was at its peak last november roblox shares have been beaten down because the company s incredible growth rate during the peak of pandemic related lockdowns hasn t continued along the same trajectory in 2022 this february the number of daily active users climbed 28 year over year to 55 1 million unfortunately average bookings per daily active user fell by around 24 5 compared to last february with fewer kids and parents forced to stay home from school and work it s no wonder that roblox s user base is a little less engaged this probably isn t a reason to avoid the stock especially at its recently discounted price shares of roblox are trading at around 9 times trailing sales which is incredibly low for a company with sales figures that more than doubled last year the 60 year over year growth rate the company estimated in february is a relative slow down but it s still fast enough to drive the stock to new peaks if it continues global e online shares of global e online have been beaten down to around 25 at recent prices that s about 61 less than the e commerce stock was trading for at its peak last december the stock is in freefall due to external economic factors that investors expect to pressure e commerce and the adoption of cloud based business solutions looking at the company s recent performance it seems the fear is overblown global e online helps merchants sell their goods to a much larger international customer base than those merchants could ever hope to reach on their own and demand is shooting through the roof the total value of merchandise sold with help from global e s cloud based products soared 87 year over year in 2021 at just 1 45 billion though it s clear this company has only scraped the surface of its total addressable market we can reasonably expect global e s international e commerce footprint to continue expanding by leaps and bounds earlier this year the company expanded its strategic partnership with shopify to offer its merchants headquartered in north america a chance to reach a larger international audience pubmatic shares of this online advertising business soared following its stock market debut in late 2020 since peaking in early 2021 though the stock has tumbled by 67 to around 23 per share pubmatic operates a platform that lets advertisers purchase ad impressions on websites smart tvs and smartphone apps pubmatic contracts with ad buyers who bid on available space but pubmatic receives payments from its partnered publishers who are eager to sign up the company monetized connected tv inventory from 167 publishers in the fourth quarter up from 154 publishers during the third quarter pubmatic s operation is a lucrative one with net income that worked out to 25 of revenue in 2021 last year was the company s ninth consecutive year of profitability with earnings that more than doubled to an even 1 00 per share this year the company expects to more than double its roster of engineers who support pubmatic s global infrastructure there are around 300 at the moment and this figure will swell as the company fills a new engineering hub in pune india that will house around 800 employees if the current hiring spree pressures earnings as expected the stock could tumble further this year on a longer timeline though this company s rising share of a large and growing market for programmatic advertising gives pubmatic a great chance to produce market beating gains for patient investors

welcome to t3 s traeger ironwood 650 review i ve built and tested this bbq and here after a multiple weeks of use i give you my considered take for t3 com the traeger ironwood 650 has won the best barbecue award at the t3 awards 2022 here s why the judges selected it the traeger ironwood 650 is a wood pellet fired barbecue that can grill roast and smoke basically anything you throw at it for all intents and purposes it is an bona fide outdoor oven and smoker that can cook any food fast or slow pellet grills are all the rage in the united states and their advocates swear by them due to how the pellets infuse the food with an authentic wood smoke flavour that is tricky to attain using charcoal or gas that s why we have so many in our best bbq and even best portable bbq buying guides and as pellet grills like the traeger ironwood 650 are effectively controlled by their own on grill computer they re good as they can be very hands off letting their owner say drink beer in the sun while their food cooks so is the traeger ironwood 650 a smart buy for the avid grillist here s my professional opinion traeger ironwood 650 review price and availability the traeger ironwood 650 is available right now at amazon the home depot and best buy in the usa for 1 399 95 while in the uk john lewis stocks the grill for 1 499 not then the cheapest option for upgrading your bbq but this is very much a grill from the crème de la crème of barbecues and a product that will likely do you for life the investment will be worth it in my opinion for any bbq aficionado if you like the idea of the traeger ironwood 650 but would prefer something smaller and cheaper then also consider the traeger pro 575 to see today s best traeger ironwood 650 prices in your region consult the below deals chart the traeger ironwood 650 comes ins a large very heavy box image credit future traeger ironwood 650 review unboxing and assembly ok let s be clear here the traeger ironwood 650 is a large heavy barbecue that comes in a very large and very heavy box unboxing in itself is a serious operation and if you buy one you should be prepared to recycle a lot of cardboard two people are literally asked for on the box for unboxing and setup and when you see the size of the thing it is understandable why the traeger ironwood 650 is heavy very heavy so getting it out of its box is tricky unless you have two people to hand image credit future i had to do this myself though and can confirm that providing you have a good amount of upper body strength and plan correctly you can unbox and assemble on your own i would not advise this though you basically remove the box s top sleeve remove component boxes and extras and are then left with the main grill unit and its hopper pre built this is good as you really just have to attach the legs to the traeger ironwood 650 and a few extras before you are cooking ready the actual cooking drum hopper and pellet furnace come pre made meaning you really just have to attach the legs and a few extras image credit future all the tools that are needed to do this are included in the box which is basically a screwdriver and hex key and the assembly instructions are clear and the components are even numbered with stickers too this all helps to make setup fast the main drum and hopper though remain incredibly heavy throughout and this means that manoeuvring it so it is on its side so you can fit the legs is tough you should keep the grill on the carboard base at all times to avoid scratching the grill and i advise building it in a wide open environment with plenty of space attaching the legs to the traeger ironwood 650 is straightforward image credit future assembly once the grill is actually unboxed takes about 30 minutes with the grill made you can admire its quality which i personally think was top rate the craftsmanship that has gone into making the traeger ironwood 650 is evident with all its components feeling really weighty and premium this extends to things like its shelves legs wheels lid handle drum hopper shelves drip tray drip collection pale and even accessories you can tell this a premium well made product no matter where you look the fully assembled traeger ironwood 650 with it s two cooking shelves clearly visible image credit future it also looks very smart too the lid is emblazoned with traeger while its cooking drum holding base has ironwood 650 on it the finish to all the casing has that lovely mottled and slightly rough to touch finish that i associate with premium products too without doubt the traeger ironwood 650 is something you re going to enjoy having on display while in use and is a world away from a grim looking barbecue pit or cheap rickety budget burner that rusts up before your very eyes stylish and well made the traeger ironwood 650 is this pale collects any run off and debris from the drip tray image credit future with the grill assembled i then followed the manual s instructions and downloaded the official traeger app which lets you connect the grill to a wifi connection and then customise your grill as well as downloading cooking programs for it the app lets you control the grill remotely too and also can provide notifications for key things like when the bbq hits temperature or when it transitions to a different part of a cooking program this is useful for the grill master who likes to mingle the traeger app is excellent and lets you customise your grill and download cooking programs for it image credit future the downloadable cooking programs are where the app is at though these let you effectively program your traeger ironwood 650 to cook specific things in an optimal way such as brisket ribs or a whole bird you prepare the meat and load it into the traeger then download one of these programs and just click go it s really that simple finally before use i loaded the traeger ironwood 650 s pellet hopper with wood pellets i was now ready to fire the grill up for the first time and run it in once the temperature is set you click ignite and sit back and watch the traeger ironwood 650 come to temperature image credit future traeger ironwood 650 review operation and performance let s talk operation the first thing those new to pellet grills will notice is that the traeger ironwood 650 like others of its kind need to be run through a start up cycle and then actually fired up and run for an hour before any food can be cooked on it this helps burn off any production residues and make sure all systems are run in prior to food actually being cooked this is straight forward to achieve with you just using the traeger ironwood 650 s control panel to prime the auger the corkscrew mechanism that feeds pellets to the burner and then asking the grill to ignite and then reach one temperature for 20 minutes and then another higher temperature for a further 30 the large pellet hopper of the traeger ironwood 650 load this up with wood pellets image credit future and while this hour long run in is a one time thing priming the auger and waiting for the grill to ignite is not this can take up to around 7 minutes give or take and it is then at that point the grill starts to properly heat up to the selected temperature i d say that you d need about 20 minutes to reach a decent cooking temperature on the traeger ironwood 650 so you need to factor that into your plan when deciding to cook with it wood pellet systems as a general rule are faster to cook on than charcoal but not as instant on fast as gas grills when setting up the traeger ironwood 650 you need to run the auger priming cycle image credit future quick note here on how the traeger ironwood 650 is powered you have a single kettle lead that connects on the underside of the hopper and being blunt this is too short i m lucky enough to have an outdoor plug socket array on my home s external wall but even with that i could not position the grill away from my home on my patio where i wanted the pre heating of the traeger ironwood 650 takes time image credit future my fix as i am sure the vast majority of people will do who buy a traeger ironwood 650 is to get out an extension cable this allowed me to position the traeger ironwood 650 away from my house on my patio naturally if you don t have an outdoor power socket you re going to be trailing cables out a window again something to consider also something to consider is the fact that the traeger ironwood 650 definitely makes an audible burn roar when in operation this is low level and background noise y something that would be unnoticed in a garden party setting but it is there i think it adds to the drama for the grill master but you wouldn t want to sit right next to the grill in a quiet environment again something to consider with the grill at temperature i could start the good bit loading the grill up with meat i cooked burgers sausage wheels coated chicken breasts kebabs and corn on the cobs on the traeger ironwood 650 and well what results did it deliver this is where it all came together instantly everything was just cooked so evenly and for want of a better word well the patina coating on the chicken was crisp while the chicken itself moist and tender the dense sausage wheel browned beautifully and with a delicate smoky finish to the skin while the kebabs and burgers were incredibly succulent the wood pellet fuel of which different infusions are available that subtly change the taste of the food also meant that nothing came out of the ironwood as if it had just come out of a standard indoor oven you got the smokey charred barbecue flavour of a more traditional outdoor grill the traeger ironwood 650 is almost too much of a system just to cook burgers on but it did it superbly image credit future the traeger ironwood 650 cooked this sausage ring perfectly evenly and it tasted great image credit future being honest cooking for my family like this was almost beneath the traeger there s so much room in its cavernous insides split over two shelves that you could cook probably over 10 different things all at once or have a shelf for fish and a shelf for vegetables or a shelf to cook pizzas on while you rustle up some sweet potato wedges and lamb kebabs on the other honestly just thinking about the range of things you could cook in here both fast and slow as well as how you can infuse things with a smoky finish really enthused me during this test i think it is grill that will reward experimentation for sure and that s a good thing in my mind you don t spend this money without being serious about cooking outdoors for friends and family the delicious smoky yet moist chicken i consumed as cooked on the traeger ironwood 650 image credit future indeed cooking larger piece of meat like brisket ribs steaks or whole birds are all in the traeger ironwood 650 s wheel house and judging by the delicious smoky finish and even cook of my own produce here i think it s safe to say the results are going to be equally good the fact that you could cook these things optimally while also being quite hands off also appeals to me i read the sunday times and red wine while our food was cooked in the traeger ironwood 650 and that was just me operating it manually buy a piece of brisket download the brisket cooking program click go and then sit back and wait this is going to happen oh yes is that hands off ability a good thing in my mind yes but i do know that being hands on and constantly monitoring a grill is part of the fun for many grillists you can do that with the traeger but from my usage i honestly don t think you need to this thing makes it easy to be hands off top level craftmanship is evident throughout the traeger ironwood 650 s components image credit future traeger ironwood 650 review verdict hopefully my traeger ironwood 650 review has shown you the quality and cooking power of this grill as well as the benefits delivered by powering your outdoor cooking by wood pellets i think the reasons to buy the traeger ironwood 650 are obvious it is a superb barbecue that can grill roast and smoke food to a professional artisanal level you can also bake pizzas in it seriously it can do it all and everything comes with a delicious flavour enhancing wood pellet infusion you can cook for an army of people too on it due to its large size and capacious dual grill shelves and the way you can download cooking programs to it through the app so you can just sit back and chill while say a whole chicken is perfectly cooked is very welcome the craftsmanship on the traeger ironwood 650 is also superb and the accessories i tested of high quality simply put it s a superb product that s very well made i don t think it is the right fit for everyone though its price will obviously be a stumbling block for many people as the truth is that you can buy a gas or charcoal grill for far less money wood fired grills like the traeger ironwood 650 are also not the fastest type of barbecue on the market either there s a decent wind up time on this grill while it feeds pellets into the burner and then rises in temperature to ignition levels before then further time to come to cooking temperature i can be up and running at cooking temperatures on a gas grill in 5 minutes while on the traeger ironwood 650 it is more like 25 30 this in of its own is no bad thing providing that is how you like to grill pellet grills are faster than charcoal but slower than gas basically the traeger ironwood 650 also definitely emits a notable background noise from its furnace i only noticed this while sat next to it or cooking on it but in the quiet of my garden it was noticeable obviously all grills make some sort of noise and if there was a garden party or gathering of people you d likely tune it out but it is something to be aware of it does add to the drama of using it though a few other small things need to be considered too such as the grill s kettle plug lead being very short which means you will almost certainly need an extension cable and that you better have multiple people on hand when receiving delivery of this grill and building it as it is incredibly heavy the instructions even specify that two people are needed for assembly so take this into consideration i managed on my own but one i am a seasoned bbq builder and two i m a large male that has a good amount of upper body strength overall then the traeger ironwood 650 is undoubtedly a superb product and it is impossible not to recommend providing you buy with your eyes open to the sort of system you re buying if you want to take your outdoor cooking to a whole new level this is a great way to do it

nicole palmer is a lawyer who graduated from columbia university her profile states that she specializes in the application and protection of industrial design and has been building her career successfully for 30 years the only problem is that she doesn t exist and she helped me uncover an online scam operation involved in shady activities including extorting backlinks from bloggers and website owners i ve spent a good part of the past week investigating arthur davidson the so called law firm nicole works for what i found was unsettling a testament to how advances in technology have made it easy for scammers to set up legitimate looking outfits to prey on their victims hopefully my findings will help others become more aware and protect themselves against similar scams dmca copyright infringement on april 13 nicole emailed me a dmca copyright infringement notice presenting herself as a trademark attorney of arthur davidson legal services and claiming that an image i had used in techtalks belonged to one of her clients the 3 of eu tech the latest rumblings from the eu tech scene a story from our wise ol founder boris and some questionable ai art it s free every week in your inbox sign up now our client is happy for their image to be used and shared across the internet however proper image credit is due for past or ongoing usage she wrote i had seven days to add the image credit to the offending page with a link to the homepage of her client s website she added otherwise we are required to take legal action i intentionally blacked out the client s name and website above for reasons i will explain soon the email ended with references to section 512 c of dmca and a professional signature it looked legit the one thing that seemed a bit off was a link to imgur an image sharing website where anyone can upload images without even setting up a profile so it was perfectly possible that they had downloaded the image from my website uploaded it on imgur and then claimed that their image was there before mine i usually keep track of the sources of the images i use on my website and try to make sure that i do not use anyone s intellectual property without permission but mistakes do happen and i was more than happy to double check my source and provide attribution to the client if i had wronged them as i had guessed the image came from pexels an online license free stock photo library i emailed nicole back with a link to the image and the creative commons license that states that no attribution is required i asked for clarification on why she believed the image belonged to her client and then i waited a decent website with little depth not having heard anything i circled back the next day asking whether she was dropping the case at this point i was starting to suspect that this was a bullying tactic to force me to insert a backlink to her client s website one of the methods to improve your site s position in search engine result pages is to have high authority websites link back to your web pages i ve had previous encounters with companies or individuals who had tried to sneak links into my website but doing so with a legal facade was new to me i decided to take a closer look at the website of arthur davidson legal services obviously whoever had set up the website had done a good job first the domain name arthurdavidson com was well chosen suggesting that the website and the firm have existed for a long time perhaps since the early dot com days according to the website arthur davidson has been working since 2009 involved in 420 cases and achieved 380 wins approx 90 percent success rate the website also lists a boston phone number and an address at 177 huntington ave a building that houses several other law firms the website has a blog with several articles including one that conveniently says copyright infringement can result in a 10 000 fine the about page shows the profiles of 18 lawyers graduates of northeastern brown princeton harvard and other renowned universities but unlike other professional websites none of the lawyers lists their linkedin profile on the website a parked domain a closer investigation revealed many more red flags first i looked up the domain s record on icann s website internet corporation for assigned names and numbers apparently arthur davidson had been working for 13 years but just decided to set up their domain in february 2022 and then i looked up the website s record on the wayback machine archive org apparently the domain had been parked between 2005 and 2022 to be fair there could be a logical explanation to this the law firm might have used another domain name and recently purchased arthurdavidson com from its previous owner and then i googled the firm s name and looked up the news section logically a firm that houses so many high profile lawyers and claims to have won multi million dollar lawsuits on behalf of its clients should have at least been mentioned in the news a few times no results gan faces almost sure that this was a scam i took a closer look at the about us page the photos of the lawyers seemed a bit out of place i opened nicole s photo in full size on a separate tab what i saw was an image created by a generative adversarial network a deep learning model that can be trained to create faces art or anything else gans have come a long way since they were invented in 2014 today they produce higher resolution and more natural images than their earlier versions there is a website called this person does not exist that generates gan faces some of them are eerily convincing but gans still create unnatural artifacts that can be easily detected if you re familiar with the technology you can easily spot irregularities in places such as earrings shadings on the side of the face edge of hair and beard wrinkles borders of eyebrows and the sides of eyeglasses with clear evidence that this was indeed a scam operation i decided to investigate arthur davidson and report my findings i reached out to the client on behalf of whom nicole had contacted me on april 16 asking them to clarify their relationship with arthur davidson on april 18 a support agent replied that they had no relationship with the law firm shortly after the arthur davidson website was shut down you can still see a version of it on the wayback machine even though i suspect that the client was in fact in touch with the so called law firm since i have no concrete evidence i decided to not mention them closing thoughts my suspicion is that arthur davidson was run by a grey hat seo team for now they re down but i m sure they will crop up under a different name soon looking back what they did was not very difficult all they needed was some web copy for law firms easy to obtain off the web and reword a few template dcma emails available for free a few gan generated faces there s a website for that some web design knowledge and a bit of money to buy a phone number and a domain and they were using a social engineering tactic to cause a sense of urgency seven day deadline legal action etc in their victims to act without thinking i hope these findings will help other website owners avoid falling victim to similar scams all the tools i used to investigate arthur davidson are free and easy to use and you can do it for yourself don t panic do your research and you ll be fine a note on anonymity i have no issue with people wanting to hide their identity online there are dozens of legitimate reasons to do so but scamming other people is not one of them as to companies that are considering using the services of such scammers my advice is don t the next person might not be as forgiving as i was in my own experience there is no shortcut to gaining authority on the internet create great content develop your network and find legitimate ways to distribute your content and people will give you backlinks shady shortcuts might end up doing more damage than good to your website and business this article was originally written by ben dickson and published by ben dickson on techtalks a publication that examines trends in technology how they affect the way we live and do business and the problems they solve but we also discuss the evil side of technology the darker implications of new tech and what we need to look out

go download the app email address sign up by clicking sign up you accept our terms of service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time retirement is an important financial goal and there are many different ways to get there a common path is via a 401 k a pre tax retirement plan offered by many employers as a financial planner i m a big fan of these plans they encourage automatic contributions and sometimes come with employer matching but i also believe you shouldn t be putting your whole nest egg in one basket maybe you ve heard about the power of diversification when it comes to choosing your investments investing in too much of one thing can open you up to more risk and make you susceptible to market swings but did you know you should also diversify where you invest when it comes to saving for retirement i believe tax diversification is just as important as portfolio diversification taxes affect how much money you get to keep in retirement and tax diversification is a strategy to help your money last your retirement accounts contain either tax deferred taxable or tax free funds creating a strategy that accounts for the various tax treatments of your accounts can help you save money and give you more flexibility in how you access your savings related the best retirement plans choose both pre and post tax retirement accounts retirement plans are made of either pre tax or post tax contributions or a mix of both pre tax contributions typically found in your standard 401 k reduce your income taxes during your pre retirement years while after tax contributions typically found in roth ira and roth 401 k accounts help reduce your tax burden in retirement you can also save for retirement in traditional investing accounts which are often after tax contributions pre tax contributions allow you to delay paying taxes on contributions and earnings for example if you contribute to your company s 401 k any money you add to it and any growth on your investments won t be taxed as long as the money stays in your account when you retire you ll pay taxes but there s a chance you ll be taxed at a lower rate because your taxable income and tax bracket is lower than in your working years post tax contributions provide tax free income in your golden years and can reduce your overall tax burden in retirement the benefits of tax diversification in retirement investing in both pre and post tax retirement accounts gives you the best of both worlds having a balance between these two different tax streams offers more flexibility and sustainability for your savings and makes your accounts more resilient against future tax law changes having tax diversification helps provide some order in how you should take withdrawals in retirement helping you structure your withdrawals to maximize your after tax income typically once you reach retirement age you ll begin taking required minimum distributions from your accounts to get the biggest benefit you ll take distributions from tax deferred accounts and then distributions from tax free accounts of course it s important to consult your personal financial advisor or tax professional to get a specific tax minimizing plan the 3 accounts you should consider so where should you be investing i recommend a combination of a few different accounts my rule of thumb is to invest first in your 401 k if your company offers one make sure you re at least contributing up to your employer s annual maximum match otherwise you re just leaving money on the table if you have extra funds available consider

what doesn t kill you having dealt with the pandemic many civil service managers have emerged as more effective leaders illustration by katy smith the pandemic has presented civil service leaders with huge challenges but it has also provided the best leadership development and identification exercise there ever was at the 2022 global government summit matt ross hears national leaders detail the skills required of the next generation of civil service chiefs when covid 19 first emerged said tan ching yee those civil service leaders who d learned the lessons of the 2004 04 sars outbreak tended to respond most effectively then as covid lasted through 2020 and kept changing its form those who could adapt and adapt fast were the people who succeeded and as covid drags into a third year i think we find out who among us can last the distance and remain positive especially for the people we lead said tan the permanent secretary of singapore s ministry of finance if i can put it this way covid is probably the best leadership development and identification exercise there ever was that said i d like this exercise to end now as tan had observed covid s uncanny knack of exposing weaknesses in every field from health to household incomes and from logistics to leadership has also revealed where strength lies illuminating the forms of management best suited to today s tumultuous world and these were the topic at the last session at the 2022 global government summit which brought together top leaders from 14 countries for two days of informal online discussion and debate earlier this year a stronger centre for dustin brown deputy assistant director for management in the usa s office of management and budget omb one key challenge is that of improving public servants ability to manage programmes reaching across departments there s a need he said to think much more strategically about the tools that our civil servants in the centre of government need if they re going to be effective supporting line departments to improve both citizens experiences of public services and their ability to realise governments policy goals tan ching yee we re facing horizontal problems and yet we have vertical organisations brown commented so the centre needs governance systems and structures to make decisions that cut across organisational boundaries and when the centre makes such decisions he added it needs the capacity to follow through when for example the omb reformed the infrastructure permitting process it was able to cut decision times by 45 but that only happened because we have a fully dedicated team of 20 staff working on the project said brown if the centre does little more than write the memo with the requirements that get passed down then we re adding additional responsibilities onto people who already have a full plate so in today s world the idea that the kind of skillsets we need in the centre of government are focused primarily on policy should be questioned he added we need a set of skills that really appreciate the role of implementation the kind of skillsets that i ve hired onto my immediate team are people with mbas not necessarily our public policy schools pushing v persuading the centre also needs levers to chivvy departments forwards on such cross cutting programmes and michael wernick former clerk to the privy council of canada noted that there s a lively debate over just how much leverage it should exert the decentralists make the argument that will adapt and innovate faster if they re left to do their own thing he said i m not of that school because what it leads to is a proliferation of different financial systems different standards problems in interoperability a lack of central powers has certainly slowed a cross cutting reform programme in one participant s country we re inching our way forwards they commented one of the challenges has been that it s not necessarily mandated by government it s something that we ve tried to implement by encouraging people to want to come along on this journey that s had really mixed success another challenge for the centre commented brown is that of making use of governments ever growing stocks of data the omb s federal staff survey provides information on engagement levels in 28 000 teams across the workforce he noted providing insights into where some of the risks are where some of the performance challenges are design for users not departments and data is just as important in improving service delivery providing the evidence to support a focus on outcomes rather than simply on resources expended and supporting far more streamlined and accessible services too often said brown people are forced to go through multiple agencies and multiple steps to meet the requirements around a particular life event this stands in start contrast to the experiences they have come to expect and demand from the private sector he added using data to improve services demands human centred design skills brown continued this represents a fundamentally different way of approaching problem solving breaking with the traditional method of getting officials at the most senior levels in a room to write the policy memo instead he said civil servants should first understand service users needs and experiences putting these at the heart of policy design and this focus on users must be maintained throughout the development process commented taimar peterkop the state secretary of digital pioneer estonia it s important not to let the it people develop the services because they will develop services for the it people he said technically they will probably be very good services but most of the citizens won t be able to use them get the tech kevin cunnington the centrality of data life events and human centred design in a discussion on leadership skills illustrates the importance of digital technologies in realising governments goals and kevin cunnington former director general of the uk s government digital service had some invaluable pointers on the topic working with global government forum he explained he recently carried out some research interviewing cios from seven digitally advanced nations he s produced a report setting out the here and now challenges facing the leading countries in the world read more asking the experts what do digital leaders need to succeed the report s first finding cunnington explained concerns national digital strategies which are often quite samey quite wordy and all talk about similar things if i was being a bit provocative i d say you can pick up one change the name of the country copy and paste it and call it your own the differentiating factors lie not in the vision he continued but in the implementation plan strategies that set out in detail the required funding powers performance metrics and delivery responsibilities typically support much better progress second cunnington described the great digital divide countries that have digital id are racing ahead they are the haves the countries that have not cracked digital id and the vast majority of countries have not are falling behind because they simply don t have the ability to recognise individuals and to join up data on those individuals building this capability is much easier for countries with an existing national id system that can be used as the spine of a digital solution he added leo yip know your customer this joining up of data around the individual is an essential building block of a digital government commented leo yip head of civil service of singapore the city state another nation at the forefront of digital got around this very complex challenge by designating agencies as trusted centres for specific kinds of data so if i want business data i go to this particular agency and they gather that data organise it and avail it to the rest of us he explained it s an important building block you can digitalise government at the front end but until you digitalise government upstream where all the data resides and then organise that and make it available to the rest of government will be constrained cunnington also warned that in many countries digital is not an invest in area any more yet it needs to be because most countries that have complicated legacy haven t addressed the legacy much at all they ve built largely new services instead and even where they don t have such a legacy the stuff built ten years ago is rapidly becoming legacy even estonia whose no legacy policy requires it to renew systems every 12 years has legacy constraints noted peterkop the country has an advanced health records system but it proved poorly suited to handling vaccination data ethical concerns also limited officials options during the pandemic they could have linked up data held in various agencies to trace the people who are sick or have been in contact with them peterkop added but leaders exercised restraint once you build a big brother then you cannot unbuild it there s a particular need commented wernick for investment in what he called g2g services the part of the public service that provides pay it security cybersecurity property that mirrors singapore s experience said yip surveys carried out there a few years ago found that the positive impact of digital transformation on citizens and businesses was much stronger than its impact on our own employees whose expectations had not yet been met the government subsequently stepped up its efforts to ensure that digitalisation programmes benefited civil servants in their work he added a lack of leadership cunnington s next findings covered governments systems of procurement spending approval and project management which typically provide a poor fit with digital programmes and the challenge of building digital workforces where at most levels all the front runners are saying that s no longer a problem while many countries have rapidly developed their digital cadres however they still struggle to attract and retain senior digital leaders particularly where nations have an advanced tech sector and where pay is constrained to the pay of their political masters commented cunnington these countries are suffering really acutely from not having the right leadership in place and the bottom line is that a false economy government ends up wasting far more money by not getting its major programmes right than it ever saves by implementing these kinds of pay restraints finally cunnington said that departmental leaders often lack the understanding and commitment to drive digital transformation and without their full engagement transformation projects flounder cios don t have the longevity the authority the mandate to make those decisions he noted leaders don t need to be digital specialists commented peterkop who worked in law and the military before taking senior digital jobs leadership is leadership it s important to demystify the it the cyber yet as yip pointed out you cannot drive digital transformation with digitally illiterate senior leaders departmental chiefs need both a good understanding of digitally enabled business transformation and the courage and ambition to make big changes in the pursuit of better government pandemic positives finding such leaders is not straightforward particularly given the demographic challenges affecting many countries commented wernick in canada with the baby boomer retirement and the growth in other sectors we re going to be fighting to retain talent over the next five to 10 years but peter pogačar director general of the public sector directorate in slovenia s ministry of public administration pointed to a silver lining accompanying covid 19 during the pandemic the image of public service really improved among the people because they saw that in the end the public service is the one you can always rely on he said so the image the perception of public service changed significantly for the better certainly the pandemic has given an opportunity for the public service to be more visible commented hannah cameron deputy commissioner in new zealand s public service commission there are opportunities to capitalise on that though cameron would not use these words new zealand has of course had a good pandemic as discussed in her recent interview with ggf but trust in the public service was already rising before covid 19 arrived she said naming some of the contributory factors identified in research one key element is the responsiveness and the reliability of the services have received she commented another is about the human interaction with people perceiving public servants as honest and fair one challenge for the public service commission she added is to help citizens to understand that the person whose help and assistance they ve so valued is part of an overall system called the public service so their experience of an individual is attributed to the institution read more trust and teamwork hannah cameron on how new zealand dodged the covid bullet as tan ching yee had spotted though covid 19 always finds cracks in the defences and in new zealand the government discovered that some poorer rural or maori populations weren t taking up the vaccine that became a big national conversation about the inequities that exist within new zealand said cameron when it meant that part of the population wasn t vaccinated and that had an impact on everyone else people paid more attention testing different ways into the problem public service leaders accepted that government can t be the best channel to reach all communities and that sometimes they have to cede control to community groups common challenges collective opportunities as the session drew to a close albert chua permanent secretary of singapore s ministry of sustainability and the environment recalled the first emergency meeting held to discuss covid 19 at that time he remembered veterans of the 2003 sars outbreak confidently predicted we re going to get over this in six months two years later we re still here during this period public servants have achieved amazing things i ve never been more proud of the public service said chua i think it s trust between the government public service and people that s getting us through this covid fight trust will also get us through the fight on the climate front how do you persuade people to forego convenience to pay more to make sacrifices for future generations i think it all goes down to trust as civil service leaders work to build public trust and address challenges from covid to climate breakdown noted wernick they have much to learn from one another despite people s very different contexts he said he d been struck by how common some of the issues are and the value of these kinds of conversations brown agreed it s a real benefit to have a network like this to be able to reach out to better understand what s been tried in other places he commented yip too had noticed how strikingly common are the challenges that we all face and responding well to these challenges he argued would bring benefits far beyond the immediate problem the summit s first session had covered risk management he noted adding that addressing today s complex threat landscape creates the opportunity to build new resilience its second had covered environmental sustainability here said yip the threat gives us a burning platform to mobilise the whole of the nation creating a new green sustainable future and this third session had explored the multi domain multi disciplinary character of the big challenges that we re all up against from that we have the opportunity to rebuild how we organise government with such policy pressures giving reforms momentum and digital technologies providing the delivery tools said leo civil servants around the world can make big changes creating governments better able to deal with both today s problems and those yet to come as he concluded from common challenges i think there is huge opportunity to seize

ctech five years ago b had the life of a typical hasidic man he studied at one of the large yeshivas married young and was a father of four when he turned 30 he consulted with his rabbi about earning a living received approval and began pursuing his academic studies with a degree in computer science with a black velvet kippah and payot the long curled sideburns he wasn t exactly a run of the mill college student at the open university of israel s his manager shares what happened when he received b s resume and took one glance at his profile picture doubting whether b would integrate well into the company s who is also ultra orthodox and has been getting the cold shoulder from the high tech industry throughout his career decided to invite b to an interview today b is one of the most prominent employees at rafael advanced defense systems cyber division that operates out of jerusalem and is shattering stigmas left and right they didn t cut any corners with me said b had i continued on the yeshiva path i would have never gotten the chance to deal with issues of state security i still study torah in the evenings rafael s jerusalem branch is one of the most fascinating places in the israeli defense industry it certainly isn t a typical high tech office there are black hats and coats classic ultra orthodox wear strewn on coat hangers and in doorways outside the commercial building which is located in the heart of jerusalem s commercial and industrial area security guards stand near gatherings of men in midst of mincha and maariv prayers the feeling of responsibility hangs heavy in the air these men and women are responsible for protecting the iron dome missile defense and trophy systems against cyberattacks and ensure that the systems data doesn t fall into enemy hands over the past year when many high tech companies competed for the best minds at rafael by offering them enticing salary and stock options that typical government controlled companies cannot offer rafael succeeded in recruiting an impressive influx of manpower hiring nearly 1 000 people the atypical division both in terms of location and religious leanings has more than doubled its workforce from 25 to 55 employees over the past year it all started back in 2017 when rafael received a request from a group of nine people who formerly worked at nds a jerusalem based company that specializes in cable tv security the company was later acquired by american cisco systems and the group was looking for a change these types of transitions are common in the high tech industry clarifies s we looked for a place that would take us in respect our values and allow us to stay in jerusalem i went to several companies even international ones some recoiled at the thought of opening up an office in jerusalem others at the sight of my black kippah rafael was looking for cyber experts and we expressed interest an atypical high tech lifestyle none of the employees took the standard route of pursuing a science and math track in high school serving in unit 8200 in the israeli military or studying a four year degree at a large college such as the technion or hebrew university later on living with a leased car a subsidized lunch card and all the other perks of working in the high tech sector this group is the exception and has no lunch cards which work with few glatt kosher level restaurants however they do have a budget to eat at one of the glatt kosher restaurants nearby none of them served in the military and never dreamed they d work at a place like rafael h 52 is one of the older employees a father of 10 he s also far from your run of the mill cyber expert but that didn t stop him from working for multiple high tech companies in the past until he heard about rafael s cyber division there are different challenges here compared to other high tech companies but i could relate to this place he said s is one of the female employees in the division only 23 she completed her degree in computer science at the religious women s campus at the jerusalem college of technology which also incorporates jewish studies in seminary i was drawn to subjects like electrical engineering and programming but it was hard to find a job i was glad to find this place how can yeshiva students who haven t studied core subjects in high school succeed in degrees like computer science which are challenging even for secular students who pursued difficult math tracks in high school i started out my journey where my knowledge in math was on the elementary school level admits b i only knew the multiplication tables but one thing aside from torah that you learn in yeshiva is how to study how to acquire knowledge and delve deeper i discovered that i m quite talented in math and after taking some pre college courses i started my degree in addition to being a father h also discovered that he excelled at math since he was good at analytical thinking from studying talmud in yeshiva i already knew english since my parents are anglos english is a basic requirement to succeed in high tech and is no less important than math but it s a struggle for many ultra orthodox who don t study languages aside from hebrew and yiddish in school when they learn it later on it s much harder to catch up some womens seminaries have excellent academic programs and there s potential admits s who is a lecturer at both the separate men s and women s campuses at the jerusalem college of technology even at secular high schools students aren t really prepared to enter the high tech workforce i think that in the ultra orthodox sector instructors need to know how to identify talent and see who has potential due to his background and his success in the ultra orthodox cyber division many organizations and companies have turned to s to consult with him on how to better incorporate the ultra orthodox in the workforce or at specific companies rafael doesn t recoil at the sight of my kippah and once it saw that our team is doing professional work we got the backing to grow and expand rafael also knows how to exercise flexibility to take into consideration ultra orthodox employees at company outings or events an ultra orthodox family wouldn t feel comfortable taking a vacation in eilat and rafael knows that it needs to offer alternative vacation plans i think that incorporating ultra orthodox into the workforce needs to be more than just a slogan it needs to be done in a meaningful way the manager and recruiter need to be open minded and considerate and maybe that s a way to encourage more ultra orthodox to enter the workforce and bring their friends along closing the education gap but the division at rafael also raises the issue as to why more ultra orthodox men haven t yet entered the workforce women study core subjects in high school and seminary so that they can support their families financially while their husbands study torah in kollel or yeshivas most of the day due to the high salaries inherent in the high tech sector several women s colleges have begun teaching subjects like accounting and math which are becoming more in demand meanwhile the men continue to study torah those who are considering entering the workforce typically only do so after the age of 25 after consulting with their rabbis and then need to start studying core subjects like math from scratch how can israeli companies encourage more ultra orthodox men to enter the workforce i think the most important factor is to not get directly involved or pressure them says b these things need to happen from within and receive approval from leading rabbis otherwise it will be regarded as coercion and people will reject this concept there are those who will realize this path suits them and they ll find their way but we need to open the door for those people my children study in ashkenazi lithuanian institutions and some of my daughters have decided to become teachers while others have chosen tech tracks adds h boys can t pursue a tech track unless they consult with their rabbis first in our society heavy emphasis and value is placed on learning torah they also know that they won t be accepted easily by our society programs or companies not every company knows how to accommodate us i m not worried about the academic part in yeshiva studies are intense and contain depth whoever internalizes the algorithms in judaism and has a talent for math will know how to learn to code later on how can society open the doors to find a suitable academic track says s an ultra orthodox man won t feel comfortable sitting next to secular female college students every time that big universities try to offer gender separate studies people say they re caving in to the ultra orthodox and the plans don t take off but in order for men to learn they need the proper environment without that nothing will move forward another obstacle they point to is studying english now i realize how important it is to learn english from a young age how much easier it is than trying to learn it as an adult ultra orthodox schools need to have special extra curricular english courses for after school something that won t take time away from studying torah and receives rabbinic approval so that these children will grow up and be able to provide better for their families in the future math can be taught later but english is much harder to learn as an adult he said i think these courses should be subsidized by the government or even free adds s an ultra orthodox family pays nis 450 139 a month to send their son to religious cheder or elementary school and nis 1 250 388 for an older child to study in yeshiva ketana or high school it s not financially possible for every family to send their child to an extra curricular

fayetteville jim blair is downsizing he s selling his 6 000 square foot house in fayetteville and moving with his wife nancy into a condo about half that size an online auction of more than 500 items from his house began last sunday and will end today it includes african art a life size reconstituted terracotta soldier and two campaign jackets from bill clinton s 1992 run for president while going through some boxes blair came across a picture of his late wife diane doing a new york times crossword puzzle with clinton diane blair was in hospice at their house in fayetteville at the time she died of lung cancer in 2000 jim blair said he ll give the picture along with some other newly found things to special collections at the university of arkansas fayetteville where the diane blair papers are stored she was a prominent political science professor at the university all of the stuff people want to see i shredded said jim blair can t write a book until a lot of people die and i m afraid i ll die first so the book will probably never be done a lot of people breathed a sigh of relief on that i guess blair 86 is a well known figure in arkansas legal business and political circles he s probably best known as the former general counsel for tyson foods inc and as a close friend of bill and hillary clinton blair has lived in the house on tanglebriar lane in fayetteville for 46 years raised by his grandparents in fayetteville blair learned to read by accident when he was 3 years old by the age of 19 he had graduated from the university and by 21 he had finished law school when he was 13 he said a voice moved through him as adults quarrelled during a meeting at first baptist church i m sitting there on a wednesday night listening to all this and god tells me to go up and take the microphone and tell these people to knock it off said blair do i think god talks to 13 year old boys i do not i think it must have been some kind of auto hypnosis but i go up i take the microphone i chew out the congregation of the first baptist church in fayetteville blair said the incident marked him as being maybe more religious than he actually was by the time he was 18 blair was an ordained baptist minister a few years later things changed when it came to the segregation issue the church in 1957 would not stand up on what was clear to me if you believe in the bible and you believe in christianity you could not be a segregationist said blair referring to the little rock central high crisis at that point i just had to leave the church he said while going to college in fayetteville blair made milkshakes and malts at jug wheeler s drive in on dickson street and was a janitor at the baptist student union he said during a 2008 interview with the david and barbara pryor center in fayetteville while he was a young lawyer at a springdale firm one of blair s major clients was tyson foods by 1980 he had become the company s in house attorney blair said he was often involved in politics but not as a candidate i never wanted to hold office he told the pryor center well i say i never wanted to hold office i mean i fantasized when i was young that the greatest job in the world would be to be a united states senator now as i got older i managed to be associated with so many united states senators i decided it wasn t a good job after all blair married margaret gibson in 1957 according to the pryor center interview they divorced in 1974 and he married diane divers kincaid in 1979 after diane died in 2000 blair married nancy beth horton a native of marshall

its new building blair library in honor of his late wife his grandmother and his aunt according to the library s website what little money i ve had most of it i ve made out of the stock market or the commodity market blair told the pryor center in 2008 and i got sittin down thinkin the other day that i ve made a little over 5 million out of the commodity market and i ve given all of that money away and i ve given a substantial part of what i ve made in the stock market away while there are plenty of things in the auction blair said he has already given a lot of stuff away much of his art

discussed end of life wishes he told me what he wanted on his headstone she said i said that s real good that speaks volumes about you i said you need to write it down for me he said i don t need to i
