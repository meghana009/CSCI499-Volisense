underneath venus acid clouds and crushing atmospheric pressure lies a rocky surface studded with geological mysteries sometimes called earth s sister planet because it s a similar size with a similar iron core molten mantle and rocky crust there s evidence that venus was once a watery world like ours and maybe even had life or maybe not but now it s a 900 degree fahrenheit hellscape in an atmosphere choked by carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid scientists are really curious how it got that way and whether it has anything to do with the fact that the volcanic plains covering most of the surface are relatively unblemished by impact craters as if they were laid down only a few hundred million years ago and since volcanoes are typically connected to tectonic activity scientists are pretty keen on figuring out how the latter worked on venus or perhaps still works now a new look at nearly 30 year old images of venus surface from the magellan mission has revealed that venus outer crust is broken up into a bunch of small platelike pieces they re not quite tectonic plates like we know them on earth but they do hint that venus is a lot more dynamic and a lot more interesting than we might have thought a few decades ago says paul byrne a planetary geologist at north carolina state university and co author of the study describing venus fragmented crust planetary scientists are eager for new data from the upcoming veritas and envision missions to give them a better view of the planet and its geological activity a 1 100 km wide false color radar view of lavinia planitia one of the lowland regions on venus where the lithosphere has fragmented into blocks purple delineated by belts of tectonic structures yellow credit nc state university based upon original nasa jpl imagery as if we needed another reason why venus is weird earth s crust is broken up into seven major and eight minor tectonic plates that are in constant motion relative to each other the motion is driven at least in part by convection in the mantle internal heat flow in the mantle causes it to churn slowly sort of like a lava lamp and some of the churning motion gets transferred to the plates the prevailing view among planetary scientists since magellan was that venus crust behaves more like mars rigid and immobile than earth s and that it had been that way for at least the past half a billion years but new analyses including byrne s work suggest that venus true to its penchant for being weird behaves differently than either mars or earth or at least it did millions of years ago magellan s radar mapped 98 percent of venus surface between 1990 and 1992 the images show that the flat volcanic lowlands that cover over 80 percent of the planet are striped with ridges and grooves evidence of geological pushing pulling and scraping that must have happened sometime after the lava fields were laid down byrne and co workers noticed that the ridges seemed to outline distinct chunks they identified 58 clearly defined crust blocks in lowlands all over the planet the largest of which is about the size of alaska some of the blocks appear connected laurent montesi a planetary geologist at the university of maryland who was not involved with the study says he wouldn t be surprised if there was a network of them covering the whole planet when tectonic plates on earth collide one will get shoved under the other in a process called subduction there s no evidence of subduction on venus which is why it can t truly be said to have tectonic plates what it seems to have montesi says are rigid fragments in a sea of more mushy stuff that enables them to jostle around pushed by the internal motion of the mantle when they bumped into each other the blocks crumpled at the edges to raise up the ridges that encircle them don t stop moving just because we re watching now the big question is whether venus crust is still moving or if it stopped millions of years ago the answer to that question will have major implications for scientists understanding of venus evolution into the strange world we now know was it resurfaced more or less all at once by a big volcanic cataclysm a few hundred million years ago or did a more gradual and maybe still ongoing series of smaller events shape the planet it s really hard to answer questions like that without rock samples or seismic data says joann stock a structural geologist at caltech and member of veritas science team unfortunately there s no technology yet that can weather the corrosive atmosphere and surface temperatures that it would take to put a rover on venus so scientists have to stick with what they can gather from orbiting spacecraft veritas one of two venus bound missions that nasa approved this year the other davinci will study the planet s atmosphere will use state of the art radar to create a high definition 3d map of venus surface and spectroscopy to analyze what it s made of it s planned to launch in 2026 part of veritas mission is to look for clues about how recent the tectonic and volcanic activity on venus is we have a feeling it s really young but we don t have numbers for that yet says stock she says that the patterns byrne and co workers describe are a great perspective of what we want to be looking for the european space agency s venus express which analyzed the planet s atmosphere from 2005 2014 found possible chemical hints of recent volcanic activity that scientists want to investigate further envision another european spacecraft launching in the early 2030s will also collect high resolution radar images and analyze venus atmosphere looking for signals of active volcanism if they get lucky veritas and envision might see evidence that the crust blocks have shifted in the years since magellan orbited the planet considering the slow march of geologic time a few decades might not be enough time to see a difference so it s a shot in the dark says montesi but you miss 100 percent of the shots you don t take so they have to at least try it s a really weird world next door says byrne we have lots more to explore and this is going to be an exciting decade because we are going to get some answers to our questions

william e barnhart was a chicago tribune reporter editor and columnist whose work over 29 years focused heavily on covering economics and the stock market he was the consummate professional who was very knowledgeable and very humble said mary jane grandinetti a former tribune business editor and a former south side neighbor he was the calm in the storm no matter what was going on around him but he was also a lot of fun barnhart 74 died of liver disease on july 3 at tidwell hospice in sarasota florida said his wife of almost 40 years kate a longtime resident of the south side s morgan park neighborhood barnhart also had a home in sarasota born in lancaster pennsylvania barnhart was the son of a salesman and the family moved frequently he attended three other high schools around the country before graduating in 1964 from glenbard west high school in glen ellyn barnhart received a bachelor s degree in english literature from knox college in 1968 and later earned master s degrees in business and education from the university of chicago barnhart taught elementary school for a short time but was attracted to journalism and in 1970 began working as a police reporter for the old city news bureau of chicago wire service he joined the tribune s suburban trib operation in 1972 then covered the state legislature in springfield from 1974 until 1976 i think that bill s greatest contribution to all the people who worked with him over the years was to instill in a lot of people to do the job the correct way said former suburban trib reporter tom witosky who later was a reporter for the des moines register barnhart took a job covering business for the chicago daily news in 1976 bill was unperturbed unhurried and always made his deadlines wrote former chicago daily news business reporter dan miller in an email he was a steadying influence when investors and readers needed clear accurate reporting after the daily news folded in 1978 barnhart moved to the chicago sun times in august 1979 barnhart joined the tribune as a business reporter and in 1983 he began writing a column titled the bottom line his reputation as an unflappable performer was maintained in all his roles i remember once he was on the phone with a source and had tapped his pipe into a wastebasket which started a small fire he never missed a beat and just kept questioning his source while stamping out the fire said pat widder a former colleague in the tribune s business section in 1987 barnhart was named associate financial editor in 1992 he started writing a daily column offering news and commentary on the stock bond and currency markets barnhart s aim was to provide a local voice on financial markets and to tap the expertise of market commentators based in the chicago area rather than those from wall street bill barnhart was a first rate journalist he was smart insightful and had an intellectual curiosity that served him and his readers well said retired tribune reporter gary washburn i m guessing bill was often the smartest guy in the room but you d never know it from the way he acted in 1997 barnhart added a column in the tribune s sunday business section focused on mutual fund investing barnhart also delivered a daily financial market report on the now defunct tribune owned cltv cable television channel that elevated his profile considerably and made him more recognizable to the public grandinetti recalled riding in a car once with barnhart and his wife when their car broke down on the expressway an emergency traffic patrol vehicle pulled over to help grandinetti said and the patrol worker got out to help the group and immediately asked barnhart are you the guy on cltv barnhart collaborated with former illinois state rep eugene schlickman to co author a biography of former illinois gov otto kerner titled kerner the conflict of intangible rights the book was published in 1999 barnhart retired from the tribune in march 2008 in his final column barnhart concluded that readers were engaged and sometimes enraged by the reports and interpretations presented in this space as to the column s sources the hypothesis that chicago area brainpower could enhance and occasionally counter the market s new york megaphone was validated barnhart wrote the process of putting readers and sources together through simple declarative sentences was rewarding in retirement barnhart again worked with schlickman to co author a 2010 biography of u s supreme court associate justice john paul stevens titled john paul stevens an independent life barnhart enjoyed playing golf playing the banjo and listening to bluegrass music he also was an active member of the chicago literary club and he wrote and presented a paper four score in 2009 commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of abraham lincoln in addition to his wife barnhart is survived by his sister jean romsted and his brother jim a memorial service is being planned bob

adding to beijing s resolve is the chinese public s growing concern over rising inequality at a major speech on his economic plans in october president xi jinping acknowledged that the country s development was unbalanced and said common prosperity should be the ultimate goal the upshot is a new era for the country s billionaires and the investors who back them gone are the days when tycoons like ma could confidently bend the rules to supercharge their companies growth and challenge entrenched interests like state owned banks outsized public personas long seen as an asset for tech company founders now look like a liability the new playbook for china s ultra rich calls for more deference to the communist party more charitable donations and more focus on the wellbeing of rank and file employees even if it hurts the bottom line beijing s motivations for the crackdown are varied they include concerns about anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry risks to financial stability from lightly regulated lending platforms and the rapid proliferation of sensitive personal information in the hands of large corporations credit ap some of the tech companies became larger than life said allan zeman a property tycoon who gave up his canadian passport to become a naturalised citizen of china in 2008 one big lesson from the crackdown don t get bigger than the government zeman said shortly after attending the communist party s 100th anniversary celebration in beijing on july 1 didi notwithstanding the message appears to be getting through ma who criticised chinese financial regulators in his last public speech before ant s ipo was abruptly suspended has since resurfaced only a handful of times in carefully choreographed appearances colin huang whose e commerce giant pinduoduo has come under scrutiny for its relentless working schedules has given up his roles as chairman and ceo and donated shares worth billions of dollars bytedance founder zhang yiming said in may he would step down as ceo and spend more time on educational charity loading wang xing the chairman of food delivery giant meituan has mostly steered clear of the public spotlight since he posted a 1100 year old poem in may that some regarded as an implicit criticism of the government wang who later issued a clarification saying the post had been targeted at the shortsightedness of his own industry was advised by beijing officials to keep a low profile according to people with knowledge of the matter the new environment will fundamentally change china s tech sector partly because investors will become more wary of funding entrepreneurs who could end up on a collision course with beijing said eric schiffer ceo of patriarch organisation a los angeles based private equity firm us president joe biden has also taken aim at the billionaire class calling for increased taxes on the rich and signing an executive order on friday that aims to weaken dominance of america s biggest companies the move echoed an ongoing antitrust campaign in china that has ensnared giants including alibaba group and arch rival tencent one key difference is that chinese authorities unrestrained by western style checks and balances can act more forcefully than their us counterparts said angela zhang director of the centre for chinese law at the university of hong kong and author of chinese antitrust exceptionalism zuckerberg s hydrofoil joyride came just a few days after a judge dismissed two monopoly lawsuits against facebook that had been filed by the us government and a coalition of states in the case of china the pendulum swings very quickly zhang said beijing has a variety of tools for reining in billionaires including detention in the most extreme cases an internal disciplinary process for party members known as shuanggui has been used for some tycoons in the past investigations by antitrust cybersecurity and other regulators are more common ways to influence the behaviour of tech giants the government also uses soft methods including state media campaigns zhang said while china s crackdown has been most visible in the tech industry the country s property billionaires have also come under increased pressure in recent years authorities have steadily restricted the industry s access to funding in an attempt to rein in home prices and reduce systemic risks to the financial system china evergrande group chairman hui ka yan has been among the biggest casualties of the campaign this year losing us6 7 billion or nearly 30 per cent of his fortune as evergrande s stock tumbled on concerns the company faces a liquidity crunch billionaire hui ka yan has seen his fortune plummet this year credit bloomberg a more subtle sign of billionaires waning influence can be seen in their shrinking share of political appointments data from the hurun report which produces wealth rankings shows that rich entrepreneurs accounted for 5 8 per cent of delegates in the chinese people s political consultative conference and the national people s congress the lowest in at least eight years and down from 15 3 per cent in 2013 there is an evolution in the thinking of which type of people should be within the mix said rupert hoogewerf the hurun report s chairman it s becoming much harder for entrepreneurs the big question is whether all of this will be good for china in the long run one risk is that the onslaught of regulatory probes and rule changes undermines investor confidence hku s zhang said that could make it less likely that the entrepreneurs behind the next potential alibaba or tencent get the funding they need to make their ideas a reality global venture capital firms will likely think twice about investing in chinese companies if beijing prevents them from listing overseas a crucial exit route for early international backers loading yet some of beijing s new policies may foster competition in the oligopolistic tech industry clearing the way for a new class of billionaires to rise stricter regulations on fintech firms will help reduce systemic risks even if they slow down innovation china s crackdown on ant won praise last month from berkshire hathaway vice chairman charlie munger who said in an interview with cnbc that the communists did the right thing by letting ma know he couldn t wade into banking and just do whatever he pleased

youtube youtube com frontline when covid 19 struck the federal reserve stepped in to avert economic crisis as the country s central bank continues to pump billions of dollars into the financial system daily building on an unprecedented strategy it began after the 2008 crash who is benefiting and at what cost frontline investigates the power of the fed and how the central bank s actions have played out over the years on wall street versus main street in a gripping new documentary premiering tuesday july 13 on pbs check local listings from the award winning investigative team behind amazon empire and the facebook dilemma the film traces how an experiment the fed began after the 2008 crash has been dramatically changing the american economy exploring criticisms that while well intentioned the fed s efforts have contributed to wealth inequality helped today s financial world grow far removed from the real world economy and prompted fears of growing inflation and an impending crash i feel as anxious today as i ve ever felt about the financial world because of my belief that the fed has been pumping up asset prices in a way that is creating a bit of an illusion peter fisher who spent years at the new york federal reserve tells correspondent james jacoby i think the odds are now sort of one in three very high that we will look at this as an epic mistake and one of the great financial calamities of all time a year in the making the power of the fed is an in depth investigation supported by the wnet group s chasing the dream a public media initiative that examines poverty justice and economic opportunity in america written and produced by jacoby and anya bourg the documentary draws on interviews with current and former fed officials economists and titans of finance the film goes back to the beginning of the fed s experiment to trace how after the 2008 economic collapse in which investors speculators and wall street bankers nearly brought down the global economy the fed lowered interest rates to almost zero and began quantitative easing creating new money and injecting it into the financial system buying up bank assets with the idea that it would stimulate economic growth so many of these tools had not been tried before says sarah bloom raskin who was on the fed s board of governors at the time they were definitely break the glass kind of tools like what are we going to do in order to restart the economy here the idea was that the fed was trying to get more credit and cheaper credit into the hands of the average american says andrew huszar who was called on to manage a large part of the unprecedented program there were millions of people losing their jobs millions of people in mortgages that they couldn t afford and how could the fed use its financial tools to actually help the average american instead fed insiders and experts tell jacoby that while the fed s actions had some benefits on main street the biggest ones went to those on wall street i was single handedly responsible for directing the deployment of 1 25 trillion of fed funds and we did not see the knock on benefits that we had hoped for the average american huszar says as much as we wanted to as much as we hoped that it would happen it wasn t happening nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz tells jacoby the immediate objective of saving the banking system was achieved but the broader objective which was helping the economy recovery quickly in a robust way in a way with shared prosperity total failure while the fed s impact on main street remains a source of debate the film finds that most agree it undeniably fueled the massive growth of the financial sector ushering in what some have called a golden age for wall street in a way we re like a giant bloodsucker and we have more than doubled in size and sucking more than twice the blood out of the rest of the economy legendary investor jeremy grantham says in the film the film examines how when covid hit the fed doubled down on its experiment once again infusing trillions of dollars into the financial system to stave off collapse and amping up quantitative easing and even taking the unprecedented step of buying up corporate debt we re lucky that the government was successful or we could be living through a true depression says lev menand a former economic advisor to the fed and treasury department but the moves also sent stock and bond prices soaring in a sustained bonanza for the wealthiest americans raising questions about whether the fed was rewarding the wrong people and providing a backstop for risky behavior in a wide ranging interview neel kashkari president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis defends the fed s actions and impacts on the economy the fed has been on a mission i ve been on a mission to put americans back to work and help them get their wages up especially for those lowest income americans kashkari says and if it s had some effect on wall street to me the tradeoff is well worth it if we can put americans back to work so that they can put food on the table they can take care of themselves that is profoundly beneficial to society jacoby pressed kashkari on whether the financial sector has come to expect bailouts well i completely agree that it is unacceptable that 12 years after 2008 we had to do this again kashkari says i am proud that we did what we did it was the right thing to do it was necessary but it is unacceptable as an american citizen that we have a financial system that is this risky and this vulnerable the fed insists the signs of inflation percolating through the economy are temporary but has signaled it may taper quantitative easing and raise interest rates as early as 2023 many observers are concerned that in the meantime the fed is helping to fuel a bubble in the markets that will inevitably pop they have the housing market the stock market and the bond market all overpriced at the same time and they will not be able to prevent sooner or later the asset prices coming back down grantham tells frontline so we are playing with fire because we have the three great asset classes moving into bubble territory

motorcycle racing in the united states of america was practically on life support as recently as five years ago i knew that motoamerica had a hit on its hands with the king of the baggers series when i attended a closed doors race last fall but had no idea how incredibly receptive the two wheeled community would be until this weekend s likely to be record crowd at laguna seca racing tech how formula e s new front powertrain extends battery life on its race cars cc share subtitles off english view video racing tech why formula e cars don t need rear hydraulic brakes anymore even top tier international series like motogp and world superbike couldn t justify travelling to world renowned laguna seca after 2015 anymore thanks to dwindling crowds and waning interest when motogp pulled up stakes in 2013 wsbk gave it a try for a while but a couple of years later it was also gone dire straits advertisement meanwhile the american regional feeder series ama superbikes was flatlining a quartet of enthusiasts lead by legendary racer wayne rainey founded motoamerica as the new superbikes promoter and vowed to bring the series back from the brink in spite of a global pandemic i can definitively say that they have all succeeded in doing just that bikes are back baby advertisement full disclosure motoamerica saw how much i loved the races last year and asked if i d like to attend again this year while i had to miss the saturday proceedings for radwood norcal i got up bright and early on sunday to check out the races in monterey the series organized my media passes i paid for my own food and fuel though i did get a few free beers on motul oil s dime advertisement i rocked on down to the track from san mateo on sunday morning bright and early running my new ambulance on its proper maiden voyage it served incredibly well despite the ride home from the track being hot as shit and not having functional air conditioning advertisement from the minute i arrived i knew the series had produced a winner last fall when i was here everything was empty thanks to covid closures the paddock was half full the parking lots were empty and there were a few campers parked in the track s various sites just nine months later and the whole track was packed to the gills i ve been to a few sports car races here which didn t attract this level of crowd advertisement not only were there the traditional european and asian sport bike riders on hand to check out the superbikes stock 1000s and twins cup pros take to the circuit but there was a level of leather clad neck and knuck tattooed v twin riders to fill an episode of sons of anarchy would a hells angels member have gone out of his way to attend an ama event in 2013 i won t speak for him but i doubt it throw some american potato potato racers on track however and he s interested in the whole shooting match advertisement king of the baggers was tested as a one off in late 2020 and it was immediately the most viewed video motoamerica had ever posted to its youtube channel okay so that s a hit then the series expanded the kotb championship to three rounds in 2021 and laguna seca was the final round of three following road atlanta and road america next year the series will likely expand again and the racers are hopeful that they ll be able to run these giant fairing bikes on the high banks at daytona i don t know about you but that sounds fucking amazing advertisement in addition to the kotb bangers motoamerica added another incredibly addictive class to the mix this time they tapped the marketing magic of roland sands hauling his super hooligans series up to the big leagues super hooligans was created as a multi disciplinary series for a wide variety of compact ish naked bikes to run with american flat track this series rips on dirt but it s even cooler at a big track like laguna seca some of the racers in this class had never set foot on a road course but it produced the typical bar banging fight that hooligans is known for sands built this gorgeous chief for super hooligans racing and i ll have a full rundown on the bike later this week advertisement down the paddock a little bit was something else that caught my attention the suicide machine co team running a pair of livewire one machines in super hooligans from what i can tell the bikes were largely stock save wheels and tires and a bit of tweaking this is another team that i will be chatting with later this week to get the full rundown they didn t go very fast finishing 20th and 22nd of 22 bikes but for a first time out it was really cool to see them blasting out of the corners more on these later the sport bike stuff was there too and the racing was great as usual not much to say about that though as it s been largely the same for over a decade advertisement i talked to a motoamerica representative on sunday who couldn t confirm exact numbers just yet but did say that this was a record breaking number of entries for a motoamerica weekend and a record breaking number of pre order tickets sold they didn t want to say definitively that this was a bigger crowd than world superbikes drew before they pulled out but he was pretty sure that it would be when the tallies were finally run based on what i saw with my own eyes a full paddock a full parking lot and a full camping area i believe every word advertisement the crowd was awesome as everyone there was having a great time cheering for bikes and riders outside their own riding discipline anything that motoamerica can do to bring riders together in common support of each other is excellent bike enthusiasm is definitely growing but instead of gatekeeping or discouraging riding we should all come together as a community to bring others into the fold we can only do that together and motoamerica seems to have uncovered exactly that advertisement it s clear to see that there was pent up demand for in person attendance after all of us have been cooped up in our homes for so long thankfully vaccine numbers continue to grow and people have plenty of room at laguna to spread out because this is just the shot in the arm pun absolutely intended that the series and motorcycling in general needed i had a thoroughly enjoyable sunday and i recommend everyone who can grab tickets for the next motoamerica event to head anywhere near you advertisement what a killer day even with the massive sunburn i got advertisement if you re interested in checking out the racing and i recommend you do watch these videos below the super hooligans race was incredible and while the ktms really ran away with it they hounded each other until the end it s worth mentioning that patricia fernandez finished an impressive fifth in class in this race on an indian ftr1200 jalopnik bump and the king of the baggers race was equally fun to watch with a huge grid it was all down to the start going well pole sitting indian challenger rider tyler o hara bobbled the start allowing harley s kyle wyman to get by into the lead and go streaking off into the distance with a plate in his arm from a shattered bone a few weeks ago wyman managed to turn faster laps during the race than he did in qualifying so it wasn t even a fair fight at the front but every position behind was tightly contested with a 1 31 1 lap during the race wyman was running similar times to the top ten twins cup sport bike racers heck his bagger was running times that would have qualified him for the superbikes grid this stop on the calendar will be on my list of visits for pretty much the next decade as long as they have big v twins on hand for my enjoyment i can only imagine how much faster the baggers will be in 2022
bloomberg after soaring during the first half of the year u s bank stocks have been under pressure ahead of second quarter earnings reports on speculation that the results won t be strong enough to justify the heady run up the s p 500 banks index which has been one of the best performing segments this year has slumped more than 6 over the past five weeks even as the broader market advanced the

fotheringham some of the cash may be freed up to make loans after setting aside 35 billion last year to cover possible losses triggered by the pandemic the lenders are expected to continue releasing

questions will follow today s presentation before beginning i would like to remind everyone that with the exception of historical information the matters discussed in this presentation are forward

the company s risk factors is contained in the company s quarterly and annual reports and filed with the securities and exchange commission with that said i would like to turn the call over to shawn o connor shawn shawn o connor chief executive officer thank you brian simulations plus delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth the quarter was highlighted by continued strong performance from our software solutions with growth exceeding 21 well above 10 to 15 historical growth rates accordingly we believe that going forward software revenues will contribute more heavily to our consolidated growth rates than they have in the past our service business encountered several project disruptions which impacted the quarter leading to an 18 service revenue decline this decline was due to an unusually high number of projects nine in total impacted by delays holds or drug development program cancellations all of which occurred during the latter part of the quarter despite these near term factors we remain confident in the mid to long term view on the service business as we saw solid bookings and backlog growth and overall pipeline expansion during the quarter given our strong software mix we were able to grow our bottom line faster than the top line as evidenced by our strong profitability in the quarter in fact our net income through nine months exceeded our total net income for all of fiscal 2020 these results reflect the accelerating growth of our software revenues and inherent leverage in our business model and the progress we have made in expanding our profit margin as i mentioned this was a strong quarter for our software solutions gastroplus and admet predictor continued to increase growth rates with drug drug interactions or ddi and high throughput pharmacokinetic or htpk module growth of 114 and 58 respectively we added five new customers to the 100 000 plus license club and had 23 upsells during the quarter demonstrating the strength of our product portfolio combined with our efforts to both cross sell and upsell monolix revenues continued to outperform our expectations with revenue up 64 from last year due to a combination of robust demand and early license renewals this growth is now entirely organic as we have passed the one year anniversary of our acquisition of last year we also completed the training of a new distributor in china during the quarter significantly expanding our addressable market our business development investments are paying off by increasing our sales pipeline and creating a cross selling opportunity and deeper relationship with customers we also continue to add new capabilities and extend our industry leadership position with the latest release of admet predictor which will allow for enhanced lead selection enhanced performance and accuracy improved automation and a better overall user experience additionally the newest version of the monolixsuite is on target for release in the fourth quarter and gpx 10 is on track for release by calendar year end turning to our service offerings our service revenue is non recurring and can therefore exhibit some measure of volatility during the quarter our pkpd and qsp qst services encountered project disruptions and mix changes that impacted the revenue growth pkpd projects are typically in the 100 000 to 200 000 range we see projects accelerate to meet the aggressive timelines or delayed by issues that are out of our control historically delays have been largely offset by new projects or projects pulled forward from backlog but this quarter several significant customer delays impacted our revenue and will continue to do so into the fourth quarter customers are quicker to cancel challenging drug development programs in this pandemic environment and we saw several drug development program cancellations our technology allows customers to make decisions more quickly on whether or not to proceed with development of a compound fail fast is an industry objective and this can contribute to our service project volatility we also saw delays with service projects sourced in israel this past quarter as well as from the tail end of the covid impact with respect to the latter projects are often initiated based on feedback from the fda requesting more research into specific elements of the compound during the pandemic the normal workflow of the fda and with other regulators has been somewhat disrupted and this has impacted the schedule for certain drugs to be submitted to the fda and the timeline for fda reviews as well as clinical trial time as a result we saw a large number of changes and many of these notifications came late in the quarter sales cycle had been somewhat elongated during covid already our backlog was not at the levels typical of this business limiting our ability to backfill and reallocate resources to make up for these changes on a positive note our bookings during the quarter were good and the backlog for service projects increased by approximately 5 despite the cancellation we also added five new clients during the quarter which reinforces our optimism on the qsp qst side these projects tend to be larger in terms of dollars making the revenue for this work more volatile qsp qst had three very large projects that concluded late in fiscal 2020 driving higher than normal revenue further smaller toxicology projects that are usually the result of feedback from the fda when regulators want a sponsor to provide additional data on potential liver issues with a compound and we have the gold standard of capabilities in this area as covid continues to rearview mirror we think the overall pharma development pipeline will normalize and we will see opportunities convert to backlog and ultimately revenue that said our sales pipeline remains large in fact larger than normal with significant opportunities separately we did add an additional member to the liver model consortium in the quarter furthering our integration with industry leaders finally our pdpk services reported solid performance in the quarter and our regulatory services resources are operating at capacity overall this was a challenging quarter for our service division but the trends are more encouraging than the results show our services continue to enjoy healthy demand and our sales pipeline is robust and growing the nature of these project based revenues result in some periods of over performance and some periods of underperformance our outlook for the services revenue in the long run remains unchanged in its ability to contribute to our overall revenue growth and with the accelerating growth of our software business we continue to minimize our exposure to service fluctuations and improve profitability based on the slowdown in our services revenue we are now expecting full year total revenue growth of 5 to 10 the service volatility encountered this quarter is not reflective of any market disruption or business executions that change our long term outlook for modeling and simulations adoption or our growth prospects as a company while we are not yet releasing fiscal 2022 guidance we believe that we will grow over the longer term by more than 15 annually breaking our fiscal year 21 full year guidance down we expect our software revenue to grow 20 to 25 for the full year this takes into account the 32 year to date growth and anticipated flat monolix revenue in q4 due to the renewals that were accelerated third quarter year to date our services revenue is down 6 and we re expecting full year to see a decline of 7 to 12 the timing of the delays holds and drug development program cancellations means that the fourth fiscal quarter is likely to see lower service revenues and we don t yet have the necessary visibility to predict when these projects will move forward again we view this situation as temporary and strictly related to the timing of customer project let me now turn the call to our cfo will frederick to discuss the financial results will fredrick chief financial officer thank you shawn as shawn mentioned our consolidated growth rate slowed to 4 in the quarter due to the challenges facing our services business when combined with an acceleration in our software revenue growth rate to 21 versus 18 last year we saw a mix shift toward software which accounted for 65 of revenue for the quarter these mix shift and growth rate changes also impacted our year to date revenue growth although the mix shift was not as pronounced with software making up 61 of revenue year to date as growth increased to 32 versus 15 last year as you would expect these revenue mix trends positively impacted our total gross margin for the quarter software and services gross margins were both consistent with last year at 90 and 63 respectively leading to an overall gross margin increase from 78 last year to 81 this year on a year to date basis the mix shift had a larger impact on gross margin expansion with software increasing from 86 last year to 89 while services were roughly flat at 63 leading to an overall gross margin increase from 75 to 79 we continue to enjoy a diverse mix of software revenue in the quarter with solid growth across our entire portfolio of products gastroplus represented 65 of software revenue for the quarter admet predictor represented 18 of q3 software revenue and monolixsuite was 11 with other software representing 6 of software revenue in the quarter year to date gastroplus represented 60 of software revenue admet predictor was 17 and the monolixsuite was 16 for the quarter our renewal rate was 91 based on fees we had one client renewal slip into the fourth fiscal quarter causing the dip in our historic level had this renewal occurred in this quarter our renewal rate by fees would have been 93 consistent with prior years our renewal rate was 83 based on customers this quarter due to the turnover of non profit and academic licenses we offer licenses to these groups at discounted prices or at no charge and they tend not to be renewed beyond the initial one year license term this turnover with the lower priced or no charge non profit and academic licenses is reflected in the difference between the fees and accounts based renewals we continue to see improvement in our average revenue per customer at around 98 000 for commercial customers and 71 000 for all customers including non profits and academics the average revenue per customer demonstrates the success we ve had in upselling and cross selling software solutions across our customer base year to date our renewal rate was also in line with historical rates at 91 based on fees and 84 based on customers had the late renewal i just mentioned occurred in this quarter the year to date renewal rate by fees would have been 92 we also continue to see improvement in our average revenue per customer at around 112 000 for commercial customers and 81 000 for all customers including non profits and academics let me shift now to our services business for the quarter our services revenue breakdown was as follows 43 from pkpd services 27 from qsp qst services 17 from pbpk services and 13 from other services year to date services revenues were similarly dispersed by type with regard to couple of key service metrics total service projects during the quarter decreased 4 compared with the same period last fiscal year due to the project disruptions and mix changes shawn previously mentioned we closed the quarter with 12 4 million in service backlog up 0 6 million compared to the same period last fiscal year turning to our consolidated income statement for the quarter sg a expense was 5 1 million or 40 of revenue compared to 5 million or 41 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year the modest increase in sg a expenses was primarily the result of higher payroll related expenses total r d costs for the quarter were 1 5 million or 11 of revenue compared to 1 4 million also 11 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year r d expenses for the quarter were 0 7 million or 5 of revenue compared to 0 8 million or 6 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year capitalized r d for the quarter was 0 8 million or 6 of revenue compared to 0 6 million or 5 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year income from operations was 4 5 million an increase of 18 compared to 3 9 million in the same period last in the same period last fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by a higher gross margin on increased revenue partially offset by a modest increase in operating expenses the provision for income taxes was 0 7 million for an effective tax rate of 16 compared 0 8 million in the same period last fiscal year which had an effective tax rate of 22 the lower effective tax rate was primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with disqualifying dispositions that we saw again this quarter similar to last quarter the effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with the 15 to 18 we mentioned on last quarter s earnings call and where we expect to end the year subject to factors including profitability and any additional disqualifying dispositions net income increased 29 to 3 8 million compared to 2 9 million for the same period last fiscal year and diluted earnings per share increased to 0 18 compared to 0 16 for the same period last fiscal year ebitda increased 15 to 5 3 million compared to 4 6 million for the same period last fiscal year when looking at our overall profitability metrics in q3 we demonstrated a significant amount of leverage in the model as the 2 overall gross margin expansion drove a 5 ebitda margin expansion and 13 growth in eps in summary these metrics demonstrate our ability to balance revenue growth and profitability to deliver continued increases in earnings per share to our shareholders even if quarter to quarter revenue fluctuates turning to our year to date consolidated income statement sg a expenses were 15 million or 41 of revenue compared to 12 6 million or 39 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year similar to last quarter the year to date increase in sg a expenses was primarily the result of higher payroll related expenses due to increased compensation and headcount as well as increases in contract labor insurance and professional fees total r d costs were 5 1 million or 14 of revenue compared to 3 7 million or 12 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year r d expenses were 2 8 million or 8 of revenue compared to 2 million or 6 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year capitalized r d for the year was 2 3 million or 6 of revenue compared to 1 7 million also 6 of revenue in the same period last fiscal year income from operations was 11 1 million an increase of 18 compared to 9 4 million in the same period last fiscal year similar to q3 this increase was primarily driven by a higher gross margin on increased revenue which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses net income increased 33 to 9 5 million compared to 7 1 million for the same period last fiscal year and diluted earnings per share increased to 0 46 compared to 0 39 for the same period last fiscal year ebitda increased 17 to 13 4 million compared to 11 5 million for the same period last fiscal year we continue to have a strong balance sheet at the end of the quarter our cash and short term investments balance was 119 8 million compared to 116 million at the end of last fiscal year reflecting significant cash reserves to support our continued expansion through internal investment and m a activity we also continue to have no debt on the balance sheet i ll now turn the call back to you shawn shawn o connor chief executive officer thank you will in conclusion accelerated software growth rates and richer mix of software revenues are enhancing profitability metrics but near term delays in our service revenue will slow our consolidated growth rate this is a short term phenomena and bookings and backlog improvements point to normalization of our service revenue and the associated growth rates putting us back in a position to deliver consistent growth in excess of 15 strategically we continue to reinforce our leadership in the pharmaceutical industries in a model based drug development tools and techniques we remain well integrated with both academia and regulatory agencies giving us scientific credibility as we look to the future our investments in business development are generating the expected results we have good market momentum with the close of new business renewal and growth of existing relationships key collaborations and grants finally i want to mention that we are embarking on a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the founding of simulations plus the company will host a series of exciting events throughout the year as part of our 25th anniversary including charitable contributions and exciting user conferences we have come a long way in the past 2 5 decades and it is encouraging to see that walt woltosz s vision of accelerating the drug development process through software and modeling be increasingly embraced by the industry with that i d be happy to take your question operator questions and answers operator thank you thank you our first question comes from matt hewitt with craig hallum capital group please proceed with your question matthew hewitt craig hallum capital group llc analyst good afternoon and thank you for taking our questions just a couple from me first on the service side thank you for providing the color i m just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more as far as what s you re seeing from customers you mentioned that the fail fast and move on to new projects early how has that changed over the past year in maybe pre pandemic and how quickly when they kind of move on to the next project are you able to kind of get things ramped back up for the various projects shawn o connor chief executive officer yeah matt fail fast has been a slogan and objective in the industry for some time and modeling and simulation the tools and services that we provide are very focused on achieving that objective so the objective and the occurrence of cancellation of projects has always been there we see that accelerating i think by the adoption modeling based techniques and i think in covid environment here there were changing priorities and changing focus delays in certain development programs that had things have started to settle down a bit those programs have returned to the spot line to maybe few more decisions to cancel those drug development programs have come to bear we ve been experiencing these sorts of phenomena always every quarter but not at this level nine projects in the latter part of the quarter got delayed or put on hold or canceled and our typical approach has been to reallocate resources to other projects either new projects that are being closed and have quick start dates or out of backlog resorting those project priorities and timing as best we can oftentimes projects are dictated by the delivery of data from the closure of the clinical trial in those situations while we know we re going to do that work if the trial hasn t been completed we can t start early will move that project forward so it s hampered a little bit in terms of our resourcing of project work but typically we ve been able to do that i think in this case while the backlog is rising it is just now reaching the level it was before covid and so our ability the number of projects that we could sort through in backlog and replace the delayed projects was somewhat hampered and so could not respond as we had in the past a because of the number of delays and b our portfolio of backlog projects to fill the gap is still growing but not as robust as it may have been in the past matthew hewitt craig hallum capital group llc analyst okay that s helpful and then you mentioned that you re obviously alluded to this with the guidance as well but it sounds like some of these disruptions are going to kind of continue here in the fourth quarter yeah i think a couple of times you mentioned that you expect this to be short lived are you expecting things to on the service side to pick back up in fiscal q1 or is it still a little bit uncertain on how quickly this business will start to ramp back up shawn o connor chief executive officer yeah fair enough yeah some of these projects were projects that weren t anticipated to be completed in the third quarter and were slotted in to continue into the fourth quarter and contribute revenue over the second half of the year so their delay or cancellation does impact the fourth quarter as well and while we re looking to do what we normally do which is identify other projects to slot in and utilize those resources and drive revenue our ability to do that is not in full at this point in time and so there will be some impact on as a result of some of those projects being canceled and some of the delayed projects the indication from the client is not yet firm in terms of this is a one month delay or is it a six month delay and so we re being cautious in terms of anticipating those delayed projects starting back up real quick and contribute into the fourth quarter so our fourth quarter will be disrupted as we look out in the longer term we re not in a position just yet to put out our fiscal 22 guidance as yet i can say in the long run i don t see anything in what s occurred over this past quarter that changes the outlook in terms of the use of consulting services by the industry in general those clients that we ve worked with over a long period of time the pipeline of activity that we re engaged in terms of open proposals and leads and our backlog has risen and so to the extent that the service business has contributed to our outlook of growing 15 to 20 organically no change from my perspective a difficult quarter in terms of the timing of a number of projects but expect that services will rebound in time here not as quick as the fourth quarter though will rebound and play its part its contribution in terms of our 15 to 20 growth objective on the positive side the need for it to rebound to some of its heights in the past is diminished as our software business has really performed well a software business that historically has grown 10 to 15 closer to the 10 in the past and today has stepped up and is growing in that 20 to 25 range contributing 60 higher percentage of revenues our focus has been in terms of being the tool supplier to the industry and enjoy the recurring revenue and the profitability of the software model and that side of our strategy is very successful today matthew hewitt craig hallum capital group llc analyst that s great and i guess that s perfect segue to you software obviously a fantastic quarter this is now several quarters in a row where you ve outperformed expectations sounds like that s going to continue how much of that is a contribution from lixoft and some of the new modules versus just a broader acceptance of simulation software and as we look out to next year i think at one point maybe last year you had talked about implementing some price increases given the pandemic those kinds of got put on hold is it your expectation now that we re kind of getting through the pandemic that you might be in a position to implement some of those price increases next year thank you shawn o connor chief executive officer in terms of the sourcing of the growth it has been across the board our three primary platforms gastroplus admet predictor and monolix are all performing very well and our historical platforms of gastroplus and admet predictor have accelerated their growth rates from the past yes in part as i pointed out in the earnings presentation the modules the ddi for gastroplus and htpk for admet predictor has driven some of that growth a good portion of that growth and it s either module sales to existing customers that are upgrading their platforms to include that new technology or it s motivating a new license holder to acquire the full suite the base product of gastroplus and the module and or the full admet predictor license and its module so that new technology which opens up new capabilities for clients is a good motivator for both upselling existing clients as well as bringing new clients into the fold as i mentioned we had five additional clients that exceeded the 100 000 mark in terms of our annual software sales that s indicative of the client that s either building number of seats in their company and or beefing up their instance of the seat by adding more modules to the platform monolix has performed very well throughout the course of the year and today it s entirely organic revenue growth in our reported numbers as well they have benefited from being part of the business development infrastructure of slp they benefited from their new releases both right at the time we acquired them a year ago and then earlier this year that has brought new functionality and attracted more eyeballs to their capability and we ve expanded distribution both in terms of monolix into a chinese distributor capability as well as on the gastroplus side admet predictor side down into south america with the new distributor in that direction so the software is growth is being contributed to across the board and is quite strong today on the pricing side we while we may not have been as aggressive as we might have due to the covid environment we did there is an element of a price increase in the numbers as we move forward we ll continue to do that annually we update the price list if you will and later this year with a significant release of gpx presents a larger new platform that would also price would be a consideration in its introduction as well so price is always going to be a contributor but from my perspective right now most importantly it s the expanding revenue growth of the products upon which that price increase that s on top of that is really very very pleasing to see the fruits of our labor in terms of business development investments over the last 6 to 12 months matthew hewitt craig hallum capital group llc analyst that s great thank you very much shawn o connor chief executive officer thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from francois brisebois with oppenheimer please proceed with your question francois brisebois oppenheimer analyst thanks for taking the questions just a quick one here just can you give any more color maybe some more granularity on the delays and cancellations you mentioned nine you break down how many of those are delays versus cancellations and any can you share anything as to why these would have happened shawn o connor chief executive officer well each francois it s anecdotal story i don t know that get the breakout between delays and holds and cancellations i think the cancellations were two or three in number gave you a little bit of a feel to this magnitude most of them were on the pk pd service side of our business where our project average projects are 1 to 200 000 in terms of the average size one of them into entered really enough was a deal that the contract had just been signed within 30 days the decision was made to discontinue the program so we were quite surprised by some of them and each of them has their own anecdotal story as to cause and the fact leading to their decision francois brisebois oppenheimer analyst understood and just because of that surprising factor can you just remind us what gives you the confidence and for the long term here and when you did kind of give guidance as to 25 30 growth on software for the year and now you ve adjusted your guidance can you just remind us what how that guidance comes about how is it for projects is it outbound interest inbound interest how do you guys get to your guidance shawn o connor chief executive officer on the service side i think you said software i think you meant to say francois brisebois oppenheimer analyst sorry i meant guidance shawn o connor chief executive officer guidance and there the guidance is built upon our backlog our pipeline our resources and all of those come together to project out revenue driven by the sequence of project completions this one it was difficult those nine in number projects that were impacted we ve always got one or two of those that happen on a quarterly basis but we ve never encountered nine i believe we don t see any commonality as i say each has its own story and i don t see any commonality in the details there several of them were from long term clients and they will be long term clients and have other projects that are being worked today and or in backlog so it s not reflective of any lost clients in any way we had disruption in terms of the project that was for an israeli client with the activity in the middle east so we had a number of number of early surprises that came together in their magnitude and lateness in the quarter impacted where we thought we would come out and so our guidance is built up along our outlook of the project flow what we see in the pipeline and as i say i don t see with the results that we ve had in terms of new contract closures backlog went up despite all those cancellations coming out of backlog and not going to revenue but the cancellations and deductions to backlog and so we ve gone through a similar process we re being a little bit more cautious in our guidance there having encountered this number this quarter and perhaps of way we can beat that sort of expectation but at this point in time let s be cautious it s near term next quarter and as i look beyond that and into the next year and beyond again don t see any changes in terms of the marketplace our ability to execute that would change our pretty consistent outlook for some time here in terms of service revenue growth francois brisebois oppenheimer analyst excellent and then i have to ask in terms of m a the pullback in valuations across the board has that made the potential m a a little more attractive or we still think in the same way there in terms of what could make sense for this geographical expansion any color there on the m a strategy shawn o connor chief executive officer yeah i think you re right i think it actually helps it s high valuation environment that we were in maybe over the last year less than a year certainly made that part of the discussion somewhat difficult i would say that there is a little delay factor will valuations overall go down in individual individual person or company there s a little delay factor when they watch the market go down before they realize that their company s value maybe falling in the same direction there but i think it is a positive in terms of the softening of valuations out there that have made some of those discussions little bit more easy easily undertaken but it s still a challenging environment out there was high expectations and the flow of money both from other potential acquirers as well as private equity venture capital sources for some of the types of companies that we target small private companies that have established a good software product or service out there that would fit into our portfolio they still are set with alternatives that make for challenging discussions there fully anticipate that will as we have been in the past successfully find the right target to bring into the simulations plus family and continue to work to that objective francois brisebois oppenheimer analyst okay great thank you very much that s it from me shawn o connor chief executive officer thanks frank operator thank you our next question comes from dane leone with raymond james please proceed with your question dane leone raymond james analyst hi thanks for taking my questions any chances that we can get granularity in terms of the difference in the growth rate if you could give us the revenues by division like how you ve historically broken out by lancaster simulations plus buffalo cognigen and north carolina and paris lixoft space today shawn o connor chief executive officer yeah dane i appreciate the question i don t think we ve ever given guidance at that sort of level and in fact as we ve been transitioning over the last or more than a year we re really managing the business on a consolidated basis in terms of our software business and our service business it fosters internally our ability to make progress in terms of sharing resources on the service side among divisions and things like that so no that s not a level of guidance that we ve historically handed out nor is it fully tracked internally known as we manage the business from a software terms basis dane leone raymond james analyst you guys not reporting that anymore you had it in your last quarter filings i was not given guidance by division but i was just asking for that the revenues for the current quarter you can see the year on year shawn o connor chief executive officer i think we still report that segment through to the queue and anticipate in the 10 k it s as we close the year it is one of those things that we re looking at as to whether we continue that segment breakdown after this fiscal year but that queue will be reported here soon will when does that go is that wednesday will fredrick chief financial officer yeah it will go out on wednesday dane leone raymond james analyst okay can you give us any granularity in terms of i guess the growth in actual software segments or service segments like that for example on like maybe slide 12 because you only gave the year to date and the q3 so we can t really do in the year on year in terms of like the revenue come the revenue generation shawn o connor chief executive officer yeah i think in each quarter we ve delivered that quarter s revenue breakout across the three major software platforms and the three primary sources of the service revenue we reported data on a each quarter for the quarter and year to date basis so the information is there may be will can follow up in terms of helping going back and tracking to those previous slide decks that are out there dane leone raymond james analyst okay will fredrick chief financial officer yeah i would as well i mean probably slide 8 and slide 9 as you re looking at those for year to date sort of breakdowns in q3 break between software and services those might be helpful dave dane leone raymond james analyst right ok yeah so i guess in terms of the was this just totally random and in terms of the contracts or projects that were canceled or get clustered in certain areas like nash or other areas that maybe experienced some software in terms of kind of softness in terms of development interests shawn o connor chief executive officer no dane they were really kind of random they did that doesn t demonstrate a pattern as i said it doesn t either by therapeutic area or by customer segment there was no consistency among them there was a covid program there were other therapeutic area programs geographically and international program and domestic program so again we seem to have run into the perfect storm of a number of our projects having the delays the holds or cancellations but no no pattern to be derived out of dane leone raymond james analyst last one from me how is the backlog actually calculated were these these projects came out of the were that backlog in the prior quarter or something or were they actually ongoing and not part of the backlog shawn o connor chief executive officer once the contracts closed it goes into backlog and i d say with the exception of the one deal that i mentioned that was a quick contract signing with a start date that was almost immediate got canceled within the first 30 days i believe the other eight programs would have been in backlog at the beginning of the quarter dane leone raymond james analyst okay and how long is your backlog realization of that one quarter or longer than that shawn o connor chief executive officer no backlog in total about 12 million and i would say that it is three to six months typically in terms of its planned timing although there is some component of that extends for up to 12 months in backlog dane leone raymond james analyst perfect very good thanks guys shawn o connor chief executive officer very good thanks dane operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to mr shawn o connor for any closing comments shawn o connor chief executive officer hi guys well i appreciate everyone s attention and i certainly look forward to speaking you again very soon at the end of our next quarter and appreciate your continued to support thank everyone operator duration 49 minutes call participants brian siegel investor relations shawn o connor chief executive

wall street s benchmark indexes finished at or near record highs again on monday wall street showed its resiliency once again on monday after opening the trading session weaker the major market benchmarks finished it with solid gains and the s p 500 gspc 0 95 and nasdaq composite ixic 0 84 hit all time records again the dow jones industrial average dji 1 09 fell just short of topping the 35 000 mark index percentage change point change dow 0 36 126 s p 500 0 35 15 nasdaq composite 0 21 31 on any given trading day there are almost always at least a few companies reporting their latest financial results but the number of earnings releases always starts to build around the second week of the quarter later this week banks and airlines will begin releasing their latest quarterly figures you can bet that investors around the world will be watching those reports closely for signs that the u s stock market can maintain its upward momentum in the second half of 2021 banking on a strong future bank stocks will dominate the beginning of earnings season this week goldman sachs gs 2 42 and jpmorgan chase jpm 0 85 start things off tuesday morning while bank of america bac 2 86 citigroup c 2 40 and wells fargo wfc 1 11 deliver their results wednesday morgan stanley ms 2 58 and u s bancorp usb 4 35 are among the financial institutions reporting on thursday most banks will post much better bottom line numbers than they did last year for instance analysts expect to see jpmorgan more than doubling its year ago earnings per share while goldman s quarterly earnings should return to near their pre pandemic norms after almost entirely disappearing in the second quarter of 2020 the biggest driver of those gains is that banks are not reserving funds against potential loan losses right now as they were this time last year and many institutions are even feeling comfortable enough to release some of their reserves which will bolster their results even further investors want to see banks share the wealth and many have already revealed their plans to return capital to shareholders through combinations of higher dividends and more extensive stock repurchases yet interest rates have recently moved lower after a prolonged upward trend throughout the first part of 2021 and that has some bank investors less excited about the future if banks can t convince shareholders they can get through an even more prolonged period of narrower net interest margins then the gains they ve seen so far in 2021 could evaporate and that would take away a key underpinning of this year s bull market learning to fly meanwhile airline investors will get a sneak peek at how earnings season might go when delta air lines dal 2 28 announces its results on wednesday other airlines aren t expected to share their numbers until next week the turnaround story for delta won t be nearly as quick as it will for big banks the atlanta based airline will almost certainly report that it lost money in the second quarter albeit at a much slower pace than it did a year ago those following the stock don t expect delta will return to profitability until 2022 at the earliest even as revenue soars compared to last year when the pandemic caused air travel to all but disappear in the spring investors will be watching a number of factors including the impact of the delta variant on domestic and international travel capacity and labor issues aircraft orders and purchases and fuel related costs airline stocks have pulled back from their highs of a few months ago but their direction from here will depend heavily on whether they can keep up their momentum or whether resurgences of covid 19 lead to further problems for the companies

adding to beijing s resolve is the chinese public s growing concern over rising inequality at a major speech on his economic plans in october president xi jinping acknowledged that the country s development was unbalanced and said common prosperity should be the ultimate goal the upshot is a new era for the country s billionaires and the investors who back them gone are the days when tycoons like ma could confidently bend the rules to supercharge their companies growth and challenge entrenched interests like state owned banks outsized public personas long seen as an asset for tech company founders now look like a liability the new playbook for china s ultra rich calls for more deference to the communist party more charitable donations and more focus on the wellbeing of rank and file employees even if it hurts the bottom line beijing s motivations for the crackdown are varied they include concerns about anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry risks to financial stability from lightly regulated lending platforms and the rapid proliferation of sensitive personal information in the hands of large corporations credit ap some of the tech companies became larger than life said allan zeman a property tycoon who gave up his canadian passport to become a naturalised citizen of china in 2008 one big lesson from the crackdown don t get bigger than the government zeman said shortly after attending the communist party s 100th anniversary celebration in beijing on july 1 didi notwithstanding the message appears to be getting through ma who criticised chinese financial regulators in his last public speech before ant s ipo was abruptly suspended has since resurfaced only a handful of times in carefully choreographed appearances colin huang whose e commerce giant pinduoduo has come under scrutiny for its relentless working schedules has given up his roles as chairman and ceo and donated shares worth billions of dollars bytedance founder zhang yiming said in may he would step down as ceo and spend more time on educational charity loading wang xing the chairman of food delivery giant meituan has mostly steered clear of the public spotlight since he posted a 1100 year old poem in may that some regarded as an implicit criticism of the government wang who later issued a clarification saying the post had been targeted at the shortsightedness of his own industry was advised by beijing officials to keep a low profile according to people with knowledge of the matter the new environment will fundamentally change china s tech sector partly because investors will become more wary of funding entrepreneurs who could end up on a collision course with beijing said eric schiffer ceo of patriarch organisation a los angeles based private equity firm us president joe biden has also taken aim at the billionaire class calling for increased taxes on the rich and signing an executive order on friday that aims to weaken dominance of america s biggest companies the move echoed an ongoing antitrust campaign in china that has ensnared giants including alibaba group and arch rival tencent one key difference is that chinese authorities unrestrained by western style checks and balances can act more forcefully than their us counterparts said angela zhang director of the centre for chinese law at the university of hong kong and author of chinese antitrust exceptionalism zuckerberg s hydrofoil joyride came just a few days after a judge dismissed two monopoly lawsuits against facebook that had been filed by the us government and a coalition of states in the case of china the pendulum swings very quickly zhang said beijing has a variety of tools for reining in billionaires including detention in the most extreme cases an internal disciplinary process for party members known as shuanggui has been used for some tycoons in the past investigations by antitrust cybersecurity and other regulators are more common ways to influence the behaviour of tech giants the government also uses soft methods including state media campaigns zhang said while china s crackdown has been most visible in the tech industry the country s property billionaires have also come under increased pressure in recent years authorities have steadily restricted the industry s access to funding in an attempt to rein in home prices and reduce systemic risks to the financial system china evergrande group chairman hui ka yan has been among the biggest casualties of the campaign this year losing us6 7 billion or nearly 30 per cent of his fortune as evergrande s stock tumbled on concerns the company faces a liquidity crunch billionaire hui ka yan has seen his fortune plummet this year credit bloomberg a more subtle sign of billionaires waning influence can be seen in their shrinking share of political appointments data from the hurun report which produces wealth rankings shows that rich entrepreneurs accounted for 5 8 per cent of delegates in the chinese people s political consultative conference and the national people s congress the lowest in at least eight years and down from 15 3 per cent in 2013 there is an evolution in the thinking of which type of people should be within the mix said rupert hoogewerf the hurun report s chairman it s becoming much harder for entrepreneurs the big question is whether all of this will be good for china in the long run one risk is that the onslaught of regulatory probes and rule changes undermines investor confidence hku s zhang said that could make it less likely that the entrepreneurs behind the next potential alibaba or tencent get the funding they need to make their ideas a reality global venture capital firms will likely think twice about investing in chinese companies if beijing prevents them from listing overseas a crucial exit route for early international backers loading yet some of beijing s new policies may foster competition in the oligopolistic tech industry clearing the way for a new class of billionaires to rise stricter regulations on fintech firms will help reduce systemic risks even if they slow down innovation china s crackdown on ant won praise last month from berkshire hathaway vice chairman charlie munger who said in an interview with cnbc that the communists did the right thing by letting ma know he couldn t wade into banking and just do whatever he pleased

we asked the experts how to organize a pantry for everyday cooking and extended use they walked us through the pantry organization process step by step start by taking stock of what you have stashed then follow these tips to sort decant and stack your way to a tidier pantry finding snacks dinner supplies and baking essentials just got easier do a big clean out we don t usually think of decluttering food but professional organizer shira gill says this is a key step in tidying the pantry especially when you want to make sure it s stocked with essentials take everything out and get real about what you re going to cook with she advises box up any unopened nonperishables and donate them to your local food pantry challenge yourself to spend a week incorporating all the little bits left over into soups stews pasta dishes and trail mixes declutter your pantry and consider boxing up unwanted unopened nonperishables to donate storm a shutterstock mostly disregard expiration dates according to the usda with the exception of infant formula expiration dates can largely be ignored canned and jarred foods dried beans and many sweeteners can last for years but discard cans with dents rust or swelling for things that go rancid more quickly like oils and whole grain flours use your nose as a guide says chef vivian howard author of this will make it taste good as long as it looks good and smells good it should be fine pour into clear containers the experts we spoke to agree that decanting boxes and bags of food into see through vessels is a must for a well organized pantry it saves space of course particularly when a package contains almost as much air as food but you can also quickly see how much you have making meal planning and grocery list writing easier as a bonus it reduces the visual clutter in your pantry and if you go with airtight containers decanting will keep your staples fresh longer use a matching collection this may feel fussy but gill says having uniform vessels is one of those little things that make a big difference your pantry will immediately appear more organized and you won t have to play find the matching lid it doesn t have to be expensive joe yonan author of cool beans uses mason jars and masking tape to manage his dry goods if there are cooking instructions you want to save cut off the label and tape it to the container stockpile only what you love when you think of filling a pantry for a rainy day or future shelter in place order you might think of canned vegetables and tuna but if your family doesn t enjoy those foods there s no sense in stocking up on them yonan says you should have things you like don t put something in your pantry that won t inspire you to cook shop for the space you have when trying to figure out how many staples to keep on hand it s easy to get worked up about preparedness these days some people say you need a week s supply others say a year s the short answer stock what your storage space allows to utilize every inch of space invest in a slide out drawer that makes even the back corners of the pantry more accessible designate a spot for extras if you prefer to shop in bulk you ll need a dedicated place for the excess says jacqueline darrow a design consultant at california closets get a basket or bin label it back stock and place it on an out of the way shelf so it doesn t take up space in your high traffic area for purchases like cases of pet food or six packs of tomato sauce gill recommends removing the individual items from their packaging so you can more easily see what you have and whenever you make your grocery list check your back stock you don t want yet another jar of cinnamon or can of chickpeas bring in flavor cooking from the pantry can be a dreary task if you re stuck with just the staples howard recommends also stocking flavor boosters try pickles sauerkraut pesto jams and spice blends like furikake a japanese mix that includes seaweed and sesame seeds and everything bagel seasoning homemade versions of many of these boosters are in howard s book these goodies add interest without a lot of extra work she says yonan suggests dried mushrooms nuts seeds dried fruits and his new favorite condiment jarred chinese chile crisp look beyond the kitchen when professional organizer tanisha porter owner of natural born organizers moved to los angeles her kitchen was seriously short on storage space so she took advantage of an underutilized wall in her dining area she purchased floor to ceiling bookshelves and wicker baskets that fit the shelves and she used the setup as a pantry it was functional organized and aesthetically pleasing she says build maintenance into your routine rotate your stock as you put away groceries says marissa hagmeyer co owner of neat method i take five minutes to decant and bring older items to the front yonan recommends rounding up as you cook to avoid remnants if making 2 cups of rice means just 1 2 cup remains in the pantry cook it all now and freeze the extra rather than leaving little bits

was a lot of smoke horrible horrible air quality we could see flames cooper the 64 year old director of hospitality and customer relations at the small behrens family winery in st helena fled with her colleagues as part of a large scale evacuation when they returned to the winery after the glass fire passed the scene was apocalyptic the main building the guest apartment and the case goods room storing thousands of bottles of wine were all gone along with the rest of the wine stock there cooper s personal collection of more than 1 500 bottles had literally gone up in smoke what did the epic blaze leave behind piles of glass charred barrels fermenting bins and rivers of wine mixed with plastic she recalls behrens was one of dozens of prestige wineries in napa and sonoma counties that were badly damaged or destroyed in 2020 i guess that s part of living in california these days cooper says the fires were hardly the only challenge last year you couldn t be indoors because of covid and outdoors because of the smoke recalls napa valley winery owner stephanie honig and it was in the middle of harvest and people were working in n95 masks it was she adds the most devastating year these are complicated times to make wine in california as 2021 s fire season gets underway winery managers and employees destabilized by the pandemic know they could face more wind fanned flames fire red skies and crop destruction meanwhile covid 19 battered vineyards took a huge financial hit leaving them vulnerable early in the covid shutdown napa s unemployment rate leapt to 16 tourism also tanked with hotel occupancy in the county plummeting just 41 of rooms were occupied in 2020 compared to more than 70 in a typical year then throughout last summer and fall vineyards and wineries were scorched and smoked many of the vintners whose wineries escaped the flames discovered that smoke and ash made their final product undrinkable and unsellable as california gradually emerges from the pandemic an economic hangover lingers over the industry raising a question what sort of wine world might we wake up to a service industry reborn of all our culinary hobbies wine tasting may well be the most intimate a customer traditionally stands close to tasting room staff and fellow tasters people lean into their wine glass sniff the wine swirl it about in their mouth and then spit it into an open container it is in short a covid era nightmare not surprisingly the pandemic has forced a fundamental rethink of how wineries operate in amador county the andis winery s tasting room manager shannon landis explains that ongoing discussions continue about how best to organize such experiences so that staff and customers feel safe we don t want to go back to shoulder to shoulder in the tasting room landis said where staff used to cram 70 people into the small tasting room they have recently been catering to just 20 or so at a time arranged at well spaced outdoor tables much of their business has also been channeled toward curbside pickup in recent months the tasting room at cooper vineyards was also transformed the artisanal family run winery also in amador county relied on wine club members to engage in drive by pickups we became a shipping business says tasting room manager jeri cooper swift the daughter of the owner initially the coopers tried to modernize for the covid 19 era installing plexiglass dividers segmented into panes by a local artist with wood from the vines the goal was to keep staff and customers as safe as possible but when pandemic restrictions tightened all indoor tastings and dining in the region was prohibited for months at a time the coopers then invested in outdoor tables and chairs but when the virus was spreading uncontrolled even outdoor tastings were prohibited during the complete service shutdown management invested to train tasting room staff for a future outdoor reopening that they hoped would come soon the idea was to make sure they knew how to serve wine to socially distanced clients as well as how to discourage them from congregating in close quarters inside the tasting room more recently when the wineries finally began to more fully open up again and welcome tasters back indoors in small numbers some inebriated anti mask customers argued with staff at places like the andis winery concerned about such a work environment landis says that management sought to discourage groups that might become problematic from coming we don t want busloads of bachelorettes she says we re trying to discourage the celebratory tastings but given the pent up thirst among californians itching to get out again restricting the number of visitors at california s 4 200 wineries most of them small family owned affairs may be easier said than done winery staff categorized as agricultural workers qualified for vaccinations early this year and wineries report very high vaccination rates among staff still the formal reopening of much of the state has come with public health unknowns and corresponding concerns from workers the pandemic has also sparked high turnover among winery staff and many of the new employees have never worked an indoor tasting before it s very overwhelming there s a lot of crowds it s exciting but it s an adjustment to be sure says 25 year old koko carmen a tasting room associate at villa toscano until recently carmen worked solely at a local starbucks but now does both jobs she notes that some customers mainly older people are either refusing to wear masks or are ineffectively wearing them only over their mouths i generally don t fight that battle carmen admits as long as they have it on i leave it to my manager the dream and the pandemic covid 19 came for marco buffa s previous job before the fires reached wine country i was working in a restaurant and lost my sommelier and server job with the shutdown says the 28 year old italian who migrated from florence to pursue his california wine dream two years ago in search of work buffa went from winery to winery dropping off copies of a re sume highlighting his years of study in the field before finally getting a job as a wine educator at the andis winery there he speaks to customers about the 8 000 cases of zinfandel barbera and other wines produced there in a typical year starting a job during the pandemic was to say the least strange everything was closed and we were just doing shipments because tasting wasn t allowed to while away his extra time he spent months reading drinking and studying in early may days after the county began to allow some indoor tastings again buffa sat in the spacious outdoor tasting area behind the winery s large modernist metal edifice in the sierra nevada foothills ecstatic i like to be outside in these beautiful vineyards and tell stories about the wine he said i went through the phase where i was a little bit scared about covid now i m less scared if people like buffa are truly safer that would be a good thing given the importance of wine production for the state the california wine institute calculates that the industry employs 325 000 people with 37 000 working in wineries the industry has an overall economic footprint of 57 6 billion in california of that 17 billion goes to pay workers including those who plant care for and harvest the grapes and others who make the wine the health and safety of some of those workers aren t always respected in september as mega fires devastated the region low paid grape pickers in sonoma county many of them undocumented were particularly hard hit by covid 19 that in some cases compromised their lungs farmworkers and food packers were among the most affected workers in the country on top of that the intercept reported that some were given evacuation area passes by the county agriculture commissioner that made it possible for their employers to keep them working in the smoke and ash filled environment even as their more affluent neighbors were ordered to flee the region for health and safety reasons similar exemptions had also been granted during the vast conflagrations that tore through the county in 2017 and again in 2019 looking ahead there are lessons from the almost biblical scale challenges that the wine country has endured in recent years during the most recent wave of pandemic shutdowns around the start of 2021 local wineries used the pause in business to prepare for fire season they cleared land of dead brush pruned back trees and in some cases bought sheep to eat down overgrown grass and weeds a few wineries including cooper vineyards bought old decommissioned fire trucks and retrofitted them for use on their properties such measures cost money making it that much harder for family run wineries already hammered by the pandemic and previous fires to stay viable these investments aimed at helping their businesses to survive come at a cost to such wineries bottom lines the same bottom lines that pay their employees and the seeds of an even bigger financial problem seem to be emerging insurance companies are in some cases unwilling to renew policies for property insurance due to the risk of wildfires in other cases such companies will offer insurance but at renewal rates that have soared up to 500 higher than in the recent past and they provide less insurance michelle novi director of industry relations for the trade association napa valley vintners says that insurance companies are doing something that is incredibly problematic by not taking a nuanced look at the risks and sometimes simply pulling out altogether even the state backed insurer of last resort fair plan has over the past six months begun to send notices to wineries declaring them potential farm risks which makes them ineligible for such coverage now as weekend visits and hotel stays in wine country have returned to pre pandemic weekend levels even if midweek visits still have a ways to go it seems likely to take a while for the industry to return to solid footing mary wilder who works as a tasting room supervisor at dillian says that the past year has changed every aspect of each of our lives we ve all been impacted beyond what we ve ever experienced before that s also true at behrens where despite the damage the tasting room somehow survived the inferno management reopened at limited capacity in 2021 after letting go of administrative staff it could no longer afford given its scaled down production the enduring impact of the flames and the pandemic is clear to robin cooper we were tiny to begin with she says and will be tinier in our new incarnation

the suborbital spaceships built by jeff bezos blue origin space venture and richard branson s virgin galactic spaceline may look totally different but financially speaking they have something in common they both have connections to seattle tech billionaires the connection is obvious in the case of blue origin s new shepard rocket ship bezos founded blue origin in 2000 about six years after he founded seattle based amazon and he has said he sells off a billion dollars in amazon stock annually to fund his privately held space company today the federal aviation administration said it has issued its formal approval for new shepard s launch on july 20 from blue origin s west texas spaceport with bezos and three crewmates seated on board it ll be the first crewed mission for the suborbital craft which has been put through 15 uncrewed test flights over the course of more than five years bezos trip is due to take place just days after branson took a ride on virgin galactic s spaceshiptwo rocket plane known as vss unity both trips are meant to blaze a trail for tourists and researchers to get a sample of the space environment including a few minutes of zero gravity and wide angle views of the curving earth beneath the black sky of space blue origin s headquarters has been in the seattle area from the company s inception but virgin galactic which is headquartered in new mexico has a less obvious connection to the seattle tech community vss unity the spaceshiptwo rocket plane that took branson and five crewmates beyond the 50 mile space milestone on sunday traces its technological roots to the spaceshipone rocket plane that was developed with a 28 million investment from microsoft co founder paul allen allen who passed away in 2018 said in his autobiography that he eventually came out ahead in the deal thanks to the 10 million ansari x prize that was won by spaceshipone s privately backed spaceflights in 2004 plus the licensing fees paid by virgin galactic and the tax break allen received from donating the rocket plane to the smithsonian in 2005 virgin galactic s spaceshiptwo flights should be counted among the returns on allen s investment according to ed lazowska a professor at the university of washington s paul g allen school of computer science and engineering in an email sent just hours after branson s flight lazowska said vss unity is a direct descendant of spaceshipone both were designed by burt rutan with unity employing the shuttlecock atmospheric re entry system pioneered by spaceshipone he said and the launch approach is the same with the spacecraft carried aloft by a huge mothership both motherships nestled their rocket planes beneath wide spreading wings spaceshipone s mothership was known as whiteknightone while the mothership for vss unity was christened vms eve in honor of richard branson s mother rutan s spaceshipone concept had to be scaled up significantly for spaceshiptwo and that s why it s taken 17 years for virgin galactic to bring the concept to the verge of commercialization spaceshipone was designed to carry a single pilot plus enough dead weight to substitute for two passengers paul s specific goal was to capture the x prize and the system was designed for that specific task lazowska said i remember emailing paul asking about the fact that the astronauts did not wear pressure suits he explained that the x prize specification required such a small period of time at apogee that it was possible to pressurize the spacecraft from the mothership stick a cork in it and avoid the weight of a pressurization system and spacesuits weight turned out to be a limiting factor for the development of spaceshiptwo virgin galactic started out with a design that would accommodate six passengers plus two pilots for a flight reaching spaceshipone s target altitude of 100 kilometers 62 miles but in the process of turning the design into reality virgin galactic trimmed back the seating capacity to two pilots plus four in the passenger cabin and went with a 50 mile target safety was another bugaboo three of the workers involved in developing spaceshiptwo died in 2007 when a tank of nitrous oxide exploded at scaled composites test site in mojave calif then in 2014 one test pilot died and the other was seriously injured when the first spaceshiptwo craft vss enterprise broke up during a test flight the accident and the investigation that followed led to changes in the rocket plane s design as well as pilot training procedures after years of testing virgin galactic s pilots successfully flew vss unity beyond the 50 mile mark at california s mojave air and space port in 2018 and 2019 and did it again in may after the company moved its base of operations to spaceport america in new mexico the string of successful flight tests should set the stage for paying passengers to step on board starting next year paul allen continued investing in spaceflight long after spaceshipone s retirement in 2011 he founded a space company called stratolaunch which built the world s largest airplane to serve as a flying launch pad for rocket propelled vehicles like virgin galactic stratolaunch uses a scaled up version of the spaceshipone concept stratolaunch s mammoth plane was put through its first flight test in mojave in april 2019 just months after allen s death and the second flight test took place this april under new management although the allen family s holding company vulcan inc is no longer directly involved in the ventures spawned by spaceshipone richard branson sounded as if he was channeling paul allen when he told an interviewer i promise i will do everything i can to protect the species on this beautiful earth lazowska said that allen considered that feeling of protectiveness toward earth known as the overview effect to be one of the biggest payoffs to be gained from investing in spaceflight he explained to me that nasa astronauts returned from space with a new appreciation for the importance of stewardship of planet earth but without the resources to do much about it lazowska recalled if wealthy influential individuals could have the same experience he felt it could be transformational for the planet s future bezos too has talked about how investments in space could pay dividends on our home planet earth can eventually be zoned residential and light industry and we can move all of our heavy industry off planet where it belongs he told me in 2016 lazowska said the connection between the aspirations of today s space billionaires and paul allen s vision for commercial spaceflight should be obvious anyone who looks at photos of unity next to spaceshipone or of eve next to white knight will immediately see that today we witnessed the fulfillment of paul s amazing vision he said blue origin plans to stream live coverage of the new shepard rocket ship s first crewed spaceflight with jeff bezos on board starting at 4 30 a m pt july 20 via its website liftoff is set for 6 a m pt but technical issues or weather concerns could delay launch the picture of spaceshipone and whiteknightone taken in 2005 by

this season the b r dairy bar in gray traded its frozen yogurt for 30 flavors of vegan soft serve including german chocolate cake peanut butter pistachio java frappe and blueberry and sales exploded the response has been pretty incredible according to tom murray who s owned the 50 year old business for the past five seasons with the yogurt i d order five to seven cases a season i ordered 16 cases of the dairy free and i sold it in a month murray predicts that by the end of this season half of his business could be vegan flavors i have people who haven t been able to have ice cream in 20 years and this tastes just like ice cream murray said b r stocks the most vegan ice cream flavors that i ve discovered in maine yet across the state vegan ice creams have multiplied at scoop shops this is a change from 2015 when i reported that more maine ice cream stands were providing vegan options but i noted most are technically sorbets and while sorbets are delicious and refreshing they are not the same as ice cream these new creamy vegan choices are made from plant based milks such as oat coconut or almond the state s best known vegan ice cream maker is sticky sweet which sells its pints wholesale and also operates an ice cream stand in portland they were joined earlier this summer by the all vegan curbside comforts food truck which sells vegan soft serve last year the national chain dairy queen launched its vegan dilly bar advertisement the wider availability of vegan flavors is driven both by a desire to appeal to people who avoid cow s milk and by the appetite of ice cream eaters for something new for scoop shop owners vegan ice cream is a solution to a situation that has become more obvious in recent years joe holland who has owned the jefferson scoop in jefferson for 22 years considers himself a problem solver one problem he s faced more often the last few seasons is customers who don t want traditional ice cream if someone in a family or group comes to our shop and can t order with their family i see that as a problem holland said more often than not the problem would be that they could not eat our premium line of ice cream the solution was to bring in the dairy free vegan ice cream the jefferson scoop added vegan ice cream in 2020 and now offers three flavors oreo chocolate chunk and vanilla holland said that finding a vegan ice cream wholesaler was difficult and its higher price has an impact on his bottom line since holland charges the same price for vegan and non vegan flavors it s not quite mainstream yet with distributors and large manufacturers across the board holland said it took some research and some help along the way to make it happen but the vegan ice cream helps attract customers offering the dairy free line has brought in enough customers to offset the smaller profit margins he said we have seen a bump in business with more new faces and returning customers who choose the dairy free vegan ice cream option the vegan flavors at hallowell ice cream shop the local scoop which opened this season under the new ownership of tom hanson and his daughters brittany and ashley hanson have also proven popular they include chocolate chip cookie dough coffee fudge swirl and cookies and cream advertisement we use planet oat pints and we keep four or five different flavors on hand so that our friends that have allergies and our friends that are vegan can have ice cream with their families said brittany hanson oat milk seems to be safest for people with allergies we go through the pints really fast there s a huge need for it hanson told me she d heard maine based gifford s where the shop buys its conventional ice cream was planning a vegan line hanson was excited because she expected that would make it easier to buy in large quantities i m sorry to break it to her but unfortunately it s a rumor gifford s spokesperson kelsey matheson said there s no vegan ice cream coming out too bad as it s clear a market for it exists bresca the honeybee located at outlet beach on sabbathday lake in new gloucester has been serving housemade vegan ice creams since 2015 but recently i have come up with a formula that is better than where we started said owner krista kern desjarlais so as of 2020 we have been offering a new and improved formula and more choice for vegan flavors desjarlais now uses a pea protein milk as a base and creates flavors that include rocky road mint chocolate chip fig leaf with raspberry swirl and coffee with crispy hazelnut praline all the flavors are also gluten free each day bresca the honeybee offers at least three vegan ice creams in addition the ice cream stand stocks vegan whipped cream vegan pizzelle cookies vegan dark chocolate shell and vegan sprinkles i have been working hard to make choices for everyone and have it be super tasty so no one feels they have just settled for a dairy free or vegan option that is less than what you can expect from traditional ice creams said desjarlais a professional pastry chef who is herself lactose intolerant advertisement the ice cream is also made by hand at the two downeast ice cream factory locations in boothbay harbor in 2020 they made their own vegan ice cream for the first time last year we did a coconut base and people said the flavor was too strong and it wasn t freezing well manager toni facciponti said over the winter i was comparing lots of things then i found this brand in chicago called temptation which makes a base meant for soft serve but we ve been using it as hard serve with add ins it s an oat milk base and it s more neutral the result is happy customers and a rotating selection of at least three vegan flavors each day such as birthday cake midnight moose tracks black raspberry and peanut butter wafer even among people who eat ordinary ice cream there s a lot of demand for dairy free downeast owner bob bua said people are looking for something a little more exciting and creative our ice cream makers tend to be on the younger side so they appreciate making the dairy free vegan flavors the staff have really embraced the new vegan line facciponti agreed since her own brother is allergic to cow s milk it s been exciting for me to look up flavor ideas she said i m aware of how dietary allergies can mess with a family gathering but with more and more maine scoop shops adding dairy free flavors the summer of 2021 will see fewer left out family members and a lot more smiles frosted with vegan ice cream avery yale kamila is a food writer who lives in portland she can be reached at

paula gold williams the president and ceo of cps energy said the days leading up to february s winter storm were nerve wracking as we were entering the week before we started seeing that it was going to cover the entire state which is extremely unusual for texas she remembered demand for electricity and heating would be huge to prepare gold williams said san antonio s city owned utility had to make sure it had enough electricity contracted and enough natural gas to supply its customers and fuel its own power plants but then something else started happening as demand grew and supply tightened natural gas prices started to rise gold williams said we started seeing a doubling and tripling of the prices as we were getting to the end of the week just before the storm she said by the time the state got hit by the freeze and the worst blackout in its history electric prices hit their market cap and some natural gas prices were 15 000 higher than they were before the storm gold williams said in many cases utilities had no choice but to buy it would be like you re going to fill up your gas tank during the storm and instead of paying fifty ish dollars to fill up your tank the register there reads give me 6 000 to 7 000 gold williams said but while jacking up the price of gasoline during a disaster is illegal in texas it s not clear whether the same is true for what happened to natural gas prices in texas deregulated energy market high prices during times of scarcity are not just expected they are often considered a sign that the market is working but cps energy says this was different the utility is calling it price gouging cps is one of several utilities and private companies suing natural gas suppliers and the electric reliability council of texas the state s grid operator over the price increases the state and the federal energy regulatory commission are also investigating what happened those investigations will be looking for signs that gas suppliers withheld their product from the market to inflate the price of gas during the crisis this is behavior that s taught in mba programs said ed hirs an energy economist at the university of houston who has long warned about such behavior in texas you want to push the market into a position where it s a short squeeze where sellers actually have market power hirs said that can be done by holding back the product itself in this case gas or electricity or by manipulating the contracts for those products on the financial markets when producers when generators can combine and withhold power from the market they can drive the price up he said that s what private electricity company vistra seems to be alleging in litigation against koch one of its gas suppliers vistra accuses koch of withholding natural gas supply according to its quarterly report the gas companies being sued and ercot deny any wrongdoing energy transfer partners is one of the companies in litigation with cps energy it is estimated that the company made about 2 4 billion selling gas at high prices during the storm in a statement in response to the lawsuit energy transfer partners says cps bought gas at higher prices during the blackout because it did not properly prepare in advance of the storm the gas that we sold to cps was at fully negotiated and transparent pricing they were not obligated to purchase any gas from us the statement reads in part proving any price gouging could be tricky energy analysts say a number of states have clearer laws and more oversight over what constitutes price gouging when it comes to natural gas but the texas gas market is largely one of private deals between buyers and sellers beth garza is a former independent market monitor for the state s electric grid who spent years investigating fraud she said the natural gas industry in texas doesn t have the rules against market manipulation that the electricity sector for example does if your market doesn t have any rules against withholding people will withhold because it s profitable garza said gold williams said that s all the more reason to sue this is why we re fighting a fight that has never been seen in texas before because the market didn t work she said gold williams hopes the lawsuits will lead the courts to establish a definition for what constitutes natural gas price gouging copyright 2021 kut 90 5 to see more visit kut 90 5
adding to beijing s resolve is the chinese public s growing concern over rising inequality at a major speech on his economic plans in october president xi jinping acknowledged that the country s development was unbalanced and said common prosperity should be the ultimate goal the upshot is a new era for the country s billionaires and the investors who back them gone are the days when tycoons like ma could confidently bend the rules to supercharge their companies growth and challenge entrenched interests like state owned banks outsized public personas long seen as an asset for tech company founders now look like a liability the new playbook for china s ultra rich calls for more deference to the communist party more charitable donations and more focus on the wellbeing of rank and file employees even if it hurts the bottom line beijing s motivations for the crackdown are varied they include concerns about anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry risks to financial stability from lightly regulated lending platforms and the rapid proliferation of sensitive personal information in the hands of large corporations credit ap some of the tech companies became larger than life said allan zeman a property tycoon who gave up his canadian passport to become a naturalised citizen of china in 2008 one big lesson from the crackdown don t get bigger than the government zeman said shortly after attending the communist party s 100th anniversary celebration in beijing on july 1 didi notwithstanding the message appears to be getting through ma who criticised chinese financial regulators in his last public speech before ant s ipo was abruptly suspended has since resurfaced only a handful of times in carefully choreographed appearances colin huang whose e commerce giant pinduoduo has come under scrutiny for its relentless working schedules has given up his roles as chairman and ceo and donated shares worth billions of dollars bytedance founder zhang yiming said in may he would step down as ceo and spend more time on educational charity loading wang xing the chairman of food delivery giant meituan has mostly steered clear of the public spotlight since he posted a 1100 year old poem in may that some regarded as an implicit criticism of the government wang who later issued a clarification saying the post had been targeted at the shortsightedness of his own industry was advised by beijing officials to keep a low profile according to people with knowledge of the matter the new environment will fundamentally change china s tech sector partly because investors will become more wary of funding entrepreneurs who could end up on a collision course with beijing said eric schiffer ceo of patriarch organisation a los angeles based private equity firm us president joe biden has also taken aim at the billionaire class calling for increased taxes on the rich and signing an executive order on friday that aims to weaken dominance of america s biggest companies the move echoed an ongoing antitrust campaign in china that has ensnared giants including alibaba group and arch rival tencent one key difference is that chinese authorities unrestrained by western style checks and balances can act more forcefully than their us counterparts said angela zhang director of the centre for chinese law at the university of hong kong and author of chinese antitrust exceptionalism zuckerberg s hydrofoil joyride came just a few days after a judge dismissed two monopoly lawsuits against facebook that had been filed by the us government and a coalition of states in the case of china the pendulum swings very quickly zhang said beijing has a variety of tools for reining in billionaires including detention in the most extreme cases an internal disciplinary process for party members known as shuanggui has been used for some tycoons in the past investigations by antitrust cybersecurity and other regulators are more common ways to influence the behaviour of tech giants the government also uses soft methods including state media campaigns zhang said while china s crackdown has been most visible in the tech industry the country s property billionaires have also come under increased pressure in recent years authorities have steadily restricted the industry s access to funding in an attempt to rein in home prices and reduce systemic risks to the financial system china evergrande group chairman hui ka yan has been among the biggest casualties of the campaign this year losing us6 7 billion or nearly 30 per cent of his fortune as evergrande s stock tumbled on concerns the company faces a liquidity crunch billionaire hui ka yan has seen his fortune plummet this year credit bloomberg a more subtle sign of billionaires waning influence can be seen in their shrinking share of political appointments data from the hurun report which produces wealth rankings shows that rich entrepreneurs accounted for 5 8 per cent of delegates in the chinese people s political consultative conference and the national people s congress the lowest in at least eight years and down from 15 3 per cent in 2013 there is an evolution in the thinking of which type of people should be within the mix said rupert hoogewerf the hurun report s chairman it s becoming much harder for entrepreneurs the big question is whether all of this will be good for china in the long run one risk is that the onslaught of regulatory probes and rule changes undermines investor confidence hku s zhang said that could make it less likely that the entrepreneurs behind the next potential alibaba or tencent get the funding they need to make their ideas a reality global venture capital firms will likely think twice about investing in chinese companies if beijing prevents them from listing overseas a crucial exit route for early international backers loading yet some of beijing s new policies may foster competition in the oligopolistic tech industry clearing the way for a new class of billionaires to rise stricter regulations on fintech firms will help reduce systemic risks even if they slow down innovation china s crackdown on ant won praise last month from berkshire hathaway vice chairman charlie munger who said in an interview with cnbc that the communists did the right thing by letting ma know he couldn t wade into banking
