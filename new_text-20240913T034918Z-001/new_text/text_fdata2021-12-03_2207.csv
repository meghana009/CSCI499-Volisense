santa clarita california amidst lower inventories this year the price of farm grown christmas trees rose significantly brent green owner of a santa clarita tree farm that has been in business for nearly 50 years said other factors have also contributed to this increase it has just been a little harder this year with drought being a major one it browned out a lot of the big trees we will not get those back until next year when they have re flushed from all the rains that they did get these last couple months he added the shortages of labor people just not wanting to work has spiked all the tree prices up north as well as gas prices have made all the freight charges bringing trees down south a lot more expensive he added so we still have great selection of trees we still have a lot of beautiful trees they have just gone up about 20 to 25 percent this year he said
canadian oil and gas companies have been hesitant to loosen the purse strings in spite of this fall s commodity price boom and the arrival of the new omicron covid 19 variant may help to explain why benchmark west texas intermediate crude closed at 65 67 us on wednesday more than 20 per cent lower than in early november prior to the arrival of the new strain of the virus last friday as news of omicron began to spread around the globe fears that the variant would affect economic recovery from the pandemic prompted a broad based sell off on the markets with energy stocks taking the brunt of the beating it was a reminder of just how much uncertainty there still is in the canadian oilpatch and why companies are being cautious in spite of impressive recent profits as oil prices this fall spiked to levels not seen in seven years according to statistics canada alberta oil production in october was 119 million barrels an all time monthly record at the same time however statistics canada says oil and gas capital spending over the first three quarters of 2021 was 8 5 billion still 32 per cent below the same period during 2019 pre pandemic the industry also spent less than a third of what it did during the same period of 2014 that year capital investment in the canadian oilpatch hit an all time record high of 81 billion pandemic worries remain high we re not expecting it to go back to 2014 levels when it broke all records said rob roach deputy chief economist for atb financial but we re not even back to where we were during the recession of 2015 16 roach said a number of factors are helping to keep the lid on capital spending not least of which are ongoing concerns about the trajectory of the pandemic and its impact on oil prices in addition he said the industry has other things to worry about including current and future pipeline capacity and transportation restraints as well as the risk that opec could change course and once again flood the market with oil the threat of climate change and the risk that government policy could limit future production and demand is also a factor roach said amid such uncertainty roach said it s not surprising that we re not seeing a boom in new projects and hiring even if the price of oil skyrockets next year some analysts have suggested global oil prices could go as high as 120 us next summer it s unlikely the boom time sentiment of 2014 is going to return even if we got those prices we would still face the same limitations roach said how long will it last will opec change its mind on a dime and down goes the price and what do we do long term about climate change instead of spending many canadian oil and gas producers have spent much of the last year paying down debt said wood mackenzie analyst scott norlin and after being forced to slash dividends in 2020 companies have also taken advantage of this year s high prices to return value back to shareholders suncor energy inc and cenovus energy inc are among the companies that doubled their dividend recently norlin said he thinks industry spending will increase in 2022 as companies hit their debt targets and start reallocating capital to new projects but he projects that total spending for 2022 will still only come in around the 31 billion range not to say there s not going to be growth but i don t think there s going to be those massive massive growth rates norlin said with rising prices there s always that knee jerk reaction to bring rigs on and try to drill as much as you can but operators have done a really good job this year of staying disciplined especially in canada they ve sort of learned to live within cash flow the canadian association of energy contractors said last week it is expecting 6 457 oil and gas wells to be drilled in 2022 a more than 25 per cent increase from 2021 and a return to pre pandemic levels

mangudya and minister of finance professor mthuli ncube prosper ndlovu in victoria falls the comprehensive economic reforms being championed under the second republic led by president mnangagwa have started bearing fruit as witnessed by growing local and foreign investor confidence in another key economic milestone president mnangagwa yesterday officially opened the victoria falls stock exchange vfex and presided over the first initial public offering to the stock exchange by the giant global investor caledonia mining corporation plc the parent company to gwanda based blanket mine one of the top gold producers in the country an initial public offering ipo refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance the listing of caledonia onto vfex marks the third listing on the new foreign currency denominated exchange in just over a year it is also the first new listing in the zimbabwean capital markets since 2016 the development buttresses government s drive to transform victoria falls into an offshore financial hub as well as a hub for tourism and financial services under the special economic zones sezs initiative the idea behind the initiative is to attract tourists while serving as a conduit for portfolio investments and foreign direct investments into the entire economy guided by the zimbabwe is open for business mantra and the drive to achieve an upper middle income economy by 2030 president mnangagwa expressed excitement over the positive responses by local and foreign investors towards driving economic transformation in the country this is indeed a sure sign of the confidence that investors are placing in the policies of the second republic especially considering that caledonia is also listed on the united states of america s new york stock exchange and united kingdom said the president in his keynote address it was under the second republic that this initiative was remoulded and implemented the victoria falls stock exchange is expected to drive domestic and international investments which are a key requirement for the attainment of our vision of a prosperous and empowered upper middle income economy by 2030 to buttress the drive government has already outlined a basket of incentives aimed at stimulating new listings including the recent increase in export retention for issuers that chose to list on the vfex the incremental export incentive scheme put in place through the reserve bank of zimbabwe seeks to boost production and productivity while accelerating sustainable growth of export revenue and encouraging listing and participation of firms on the vfex president mnangagwa who earlier toured the vfex premises in the tourism town s small cbd said the commencement of the new stock exchange also demonstrates government s commitment to the devolution and decentralisation agenda he stated that the offshore financial services centre status would catapult the city of victoria falls beyond being a tourist hub to an internationally recognisable emerging offshore financial hub it is my expectation that vfex will stand shoulder to shoulder with the world s best in providing a window of investment not just into zimbabwe but into the rest of africa said president mnangagwa this also includes offering an opportunity to our pension funds to invest in foreign currency denominated securities that way enhancing their ability to diversify currency risk and continue to grow sustainable value for the pensioners whose assets they manage as such the president said his government was committed to promoting growth of vfex into an integral part of the global financial architecture he applauded the recent signing of the memorandum of understanding mou between vfex and the dubai gold

value retention for small scale miners said president mnangagwa this is against the backdrop of continued illegal sanctions that have hampered out access to markets for the minerals produced in our great country it will further spur ongoing efforts towards attainment of the us 12 billion mining industry by 2023 he said the president also said that having caledonia publicly listed on vfex provides a good opportunity for locals to participate as investors either directly as individuals or indirectly through their fund managers and pension funds this creates a win win situation as the listing entity can raise the required capital for operations while local citizens are concurrently empowered he said president mnangagwa encouraged unlisted corporates in the mining manufacturing agriculture tourism and other key sector to also consider listing on the vfex and other capital markets he urged small to medium enterprises smes in particular to grab the opportunity to list on the

credit suisse durer s journeys travels of a renaissance artist at the national gallery albrecht dürer a self proclaimed genius was a master of self promotion and an innovative celebrity artist constantly seeking improvement in new mediums and experiences he revelled in his acclaim across the hapsburg empire and beyond employed by maximilian the holy roman emperor he was a giant of the northern renaissance hugely influential on his contemporaries and netherlandish art seven rooms profile his european travels and the extent his art was transformed by these experiences and how others adapted his incomparable style a fine selection of his celebrated engravings and woodcuts including the superb st eustace an allegory of christ as a wounded stag and the complex melancholia are presented in room three he also painted exceptional portraits and religious commissions although few of the latter survive intact exhibited alongside dürer s works are those masters that he was influenced by as well as those who drew inspiration from him most renaissance artists included themselves in religious commissions alongside donors dürer s ego was such that he painted himself as the face of christ he believed his genius to be god given and should be heralded as such dürer was born in nuremberg in 1471 to a hungarian immigrant goldsmith initially he was apprenticed in that trade but persuaded his father to apprentice him to artist martin schongaur the first room explores his early career after his first journey across the alps to italy in the 1490 s bellini s use of colour and landscaping profoundly influenced the young artist and he emulated his style in a striking cobalt blue clad madonna and child 1496 99 her eyes evoke great depth sorrow and strength she is the sturdy mother of peasant stock dürer grapples with the proportion of the baby here he went onto study form and proportion in his later travels on the reverse is a colourful depiction of lot and his daughters fleeing sodom his wife turned to a pillar of salt and the destruction of sodom in the background painted with looser brush strokes its freer style seems modern on loan from the national museum of washington it is the first time this remarkable double painting has been seen in the uk alongside it is the national gallery s small oil on pear wood of st jerome painted in 1496 depicting an italianate landscaped wilderness on the reverse is an extraordinary rarely seen image of a comet a polymath durer studied mathematics and the cosmos later travels include venice and the low countries he recounts his travels in a detailed journal of which only a single page survives and is exhibited two early copies were made one of which is shown dürer painted watercolours of what he saw along with numerous sketches some rare depictions are displayed including drawings of exotic creatures from menageries castles and indigenously dressed inhabitants from foreign lands a copy of an altarpiece for the german church in venice feast of the rose garlands is rather flat although definitive preparatory drawings shown alongside indicate how superior the original must have been the unfinished christ among the doctors 1506 has durer modelling the youthful christ s face on himself an inscription says it was the work of five days curator dr susan foister suggests dürer was influenced by martin luther in the lamentation of christ 1521 however catholic theology is here heightened by the oil of anointing of christ as priest prophet and king enforcing the sacrament of anointing as one of the seven sacraments rejected by luther he continued to apply himself to catholic themes in unparalleled engravings and pen and ink studies such as the virgin and child enthroned with saints and music playing angels during the 1520 s as well as a smiling st joseph intended for devout catholic margaret of austria dürer owned a list of the works of luther but as a humanist he and others explored new ideas as well as the liberal arts looking back to classical times he painted humanist erasmus and his final engraving in 1526 was of him but he never painted luther the exhibition concludes with an outstanding loan from lisbon of an aged st jerome painted in 1521 for his friend the catholic envoy of the king of portugal in antwerp dürer focuses on the gnarled and wizened features peering at the onlooker wearing the scarlet robe of a cardinal and a black doctor s cap a mass of curly hair tumbles into his profuse silky beard a crucifix is prominent on the wall three volumes are on his reading lectern symbolic of his translations of the catholic vulgate bible his right hand supports his head whilst his left points to the skull on his desk faith and reason are exemplified here but also the memento mori contemplating death durer writes of finding a ninety three year old model still sane and healthy a fine drawing of his head depicts him with eyes looking downwards contemplatively a lavishly illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition a complimentary exhibition is being held at aachen marking the 500th anniversary of dürer s memorable journey to

it s easy to chase high dividend stocks and even easier to lose money on them if they fall there s a better way to find high dividend yields you can count on to make you money which includes stocks like materials company rio tinto rio and financials like t rowe price trow plus federal agricultural mortgage agm x all things held equal when a stock falls the dividend yield rises in other words if you own a company with a massive yield that s rising you re likely losing money on the underlying stock that s not a successful long term strategy it s actually a common way to lose money what s an investor looking for high dividend stocks to do then find stocks with market beating yields and shares that at least keep pace with the market long term that way you get a rich dividend that isn t eroded by a faltering stock price to help you find such opportunities investor s business daily pinpoints high dividend stocks that yield at least 3 which is more than double the standard poor s 500 yielding roughly 1 3 but just as importantly they have a stock price that at least keeps up with the market high dividend stocks math distorts reality a rising dividend yield may simply be masking a money losing stock math and the way dividend yields are calculated is why this happens the formula for dividend yield is dividend yield annual dividend stock share price why does this equation matter a falling stock can make a dividend yield look great let s say you buy a 30 a share stock that pays 3 a year in dividends you might be initially thrilled with your impressive 10 annual dividend yield 3 dividend divided by 30 stock price the stock s yield is 500 larger than the s p 500 s roughly 1 3 yield now the stock crashes to 15 a share and the company holds the dividend the same applying the same dividend yield formula the stock s dividend yield doubles to 20 looks great but wait a second despite the higher yield you re worse off because you lost 15 a share on the stock it will take five years of 3 dividend payments just to break even on your stock loss this is why chasing yield is often a bad idea when looking for high dividend stocks high yields are often a mathematical distortion of a declining stock chasing yield can cost you money losing money on a dividend paying stock is not just a theory it s a common occurrence especially in a rough period for stocks when you re looking for stability in fact 405 stocks in the s p 500 paid a dividend going into 2020 says s p global market intelligence of those dividend paying stocks 167 or 40 saw their shares fall enough during the year to wipe out the entire year s dividend yield or worse and that s in a good market for the s p 500 nearly two thirds of dividend stocks dropped by more than their yield in a less bullish 2018 and in 2019 9 of s p 500 stocks that paid a dividend coming into the year are down more than that yield take occidental petroleum oxy one of warren buffett s high dividend stock darlings as an example the stock yielded 7 7 going into 2020 shares of the energy company dropped 50 though during the year additionally the company slashed its dividend that left investors with a net loss of more than 50 even with the remaining paltry 0 2 dividend keep in mind too companies paying high dividends can cut them when the business wanes occidental did that in 2020 ford f cut its storied dividend in the first quarter of 2020 to nothing down from the 15 cents a share it paid previously ford s dividend yield was 6 5 in early 2020 it s just 2 6 now high dividend stocks ibd s better approach so if chasing yield doesn t work what does one ibd strategy looks for high dividend stocks with signs of stability going for them specifically these stocks have high dividend yields of 3 plus that s more than 100 higher than the s p s 1 3 yield three and five year earnings growth of 10 plus earnings stability of 20 or better earnings stability is measured by looking at how much earnings per share swings from the five year trend a lower number indicates more stability no cuts to the dividend which will be harder to find after 2020 ibd also only looks at stocks that have at least kept pace with the s p 500 the past five years a 90 3 gain through early march 2022 that way owning the high dividend stocks at least didn t cost you in lost opportunity finally stocks also must have an ibd composite rating of 65 or higher out of a possible 99 this means the stock and fundamentals outperform 65 of all stocks in ibd s database you might think no stocks can clear all these hurdles actually eight did high dividend yield winner rio tinto when you ve narrowed down the list of high dividend stocks this much it s ok to look for the top dividend yields that title goes to rio tinto based in london rio tinto mines and processes materials ranging from aluminum to copper and diamonds and it yields a lucrative 9 7 additionally the company s yield is up more than 34 over the past five years but it s not just a high yield wonder the stock is up nearly 4 in the past 52 weeks commodity prices continue to swing as the economy slowly reopens and the stock has still outperformed the s p 500 by 107 over the past

are stable on top of this the company boosted its dividend by more than 27 the past five years now that s a reliable dividend financial firm flexes its dividend power historically financial firms show why durable earnings coupled with dividend yields can be a powerful combination federal agricultural mortgage is a case in point the washington d c based firm s 3 5 dividend yield calls out to income seeking investors but our analysis shows there s more to it than just a market beating payout roughly 16 earnings growth the past five years and 11 earnings growth the past three show the lender to

on supporting science journalism if you re enjoying this article consider supporting our award winning journalism by subscribing by purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today the hon cassius m clay late u s minister to russia has recently returned from st petersburg bringing with him some fine specimens of iron electrotypes done after the process of prof jacobi and klein we have before alluded to this important discovery by its use nearly all forms of electro plating such as engravings stereotypes medallions and ornaments may be done in iron with a fineness of texture which is really surprising its importance and value will be appreciated when we reflect that the iron electro plates are about five times more durable than the ordinary copper electro plates mr clay has presented us with an iron electro plate copy of a copperplate engraving of the prince imperial of russia this plate is six inches square and beautifully done it is one thirty second of an inch in thickness and has a color closely resembling that of zinc these iron electrotypes are now used by the russian government with complete success for the printing of bank notes the process was patented in this country through the scientific american patent agency sept 29 1868 and further information can be had by addressing c m clay co 45 liberty st new york the following description of the process we copy from the patent specification our invention consists in the application of a practical galvano plastic process as to the deposits of iron on molds or any other form for reproducing engravings stereotypes and for other useful or ornamental purposes the galvano plastic bath we use is composed of sulphate of iron combined with the sulphates of either ammonia potash or soda which form with sulphate of iron analagous double salts the sulphate of iron may also be used in combination with the chlorides of the said alkalies but we still prefer the use of sulphates the bath should be kept as neutral as possible though a small quantity of a weak organic acid may be added in order to prevent the precipitation of salts of peroxide of iron a small quantity of gelatin will improve the texture of the iron deposit as in all galvano plastic processes the elevation of the temperature of the bath contributes to the uniformity of the deposit of iron and accelerates its formation for keeping up the concentration of the bath we use as anodes large iron plates or bundles of wire of the same metal having observed that the spontaneous dissolution of the iron anode is in some cases insufcient to restore to the bath all the iron deposited on the cathode we found it useful to combine the iron anode with a plate of gas coal copper platinum or any other metal being electro negative toward iron and which we place in the bath itself as a matter of course this negative plate may also be placed in a separate porous cell filled with an exciting fluid as diluted nitric or sulphuric acid or the nitrates or sulphates of potash and soda for producing the current we usually take no more than one or two cells of daniels or smee s battery the size of which is proporlioned to the surface of the cathode it is indispensable that the current should be regulated and kept always uniform with the assistance of a galvanometer having but few coils and therefore offering only a small resistance the intensity of the current ought to be such as to admit only of a feeble evolution of gas bubbles at the cathode but it would become prejudicial to the beauty of the deposit if gas bubbles were allowed to adhere to its surface the same molds as employed for de positing copper may also be used for depositing iron only it is advisable in employing molds made of lead or gutta percha to cover them previously with quite a thin film of galvanic copper formed in a few minutes in the usual way and then oring them after having washed the molds with water immediately in the iron bath the film of copper may be removed from the deposit either by mechanical means or by immersion into strong nitric acid the deposited iron is very hard and rather brittle so that some precaution must be taken in separating it from the mold by annealing it acquires the malleability and softness of tempered condensed food experiments have recently been made with satisfactory results to test the practicability of supplying the north german army and navy with compressed or condensed food the principal object was to ascertain the best means of furnishing the soldier in the field with a three days stock of provisions reduced to a minimum of weight and bulk it has been found that a sort of meat bread is admirably adapted for this purpose as it may either be eaten dry in the form of cakes or can be converted with very little trouble into soup similar attempts have been made to compress hay and other provender for horses we find the above item in a recent number of the jjenin0 post the idea of using condensed food in the manner described was first patented in 1850 by ga il borden jr then a resident of galveston tex as since better known in connexion with borden s condensed milk an article of large consumption in this and other cities mr borden has devoted a great deal of attention to the preparation of condensed food and may be regarded as the pioneer in that branch his patent of 1850 consisted in the concentrated extract of alimentary ani mal substances combined with the vegetable flour and meal made into cakes and baked into bread and was readily converted into a wholesome food eds

here s a starter for 10 is rivian a a minor character in the hobbit b the name of gwyneth paltrow s youngest child c an electric vehicle maker that has taken wall street by storm as keen investors will already know rivian is a company being hailed as the biggest thing in electric vehicles since tesla despite the fact many people have never even heard of it the company floated on the nasdaq market in the us last month and is now valued at close to 100billion or 70billion out front rivian founder rj scaringe and the company s all electric r1s suv which starts at 70 000 that s still well below tesla which has a market value of nearly 1 1 trillion but phenomenal nonetheless so is the excitement justified should uk investors dive in or is rivian s rampant debut a sign that the mania for electric vehicles evs is about to go screeching into reverse the share sale in mid november was the largest since facebook came to market nearly a decade ago and put a higher value on rivian than on us auto giants general motors and ford which somewhat ironically is one of its backers this is despite the fact rivian has never made a profit and has delivered hardly any vehicles the company has one very big trump card however jeff bezos amazon which he founded is the largest investor with a stake of 22 4 per cent the online shopping giant was one of the earliest big backers it has placed an order for 100 000 vehicles and the hope is that with amazon as an anchor customer other lucrative orders will follow already it has been quite a journey for rivian since it was founded in 2009 by robert scaringe who likes to be known as rj and who is still only 38 one reason the shares have taken off is fomo or fear of missing out as investors who didn t manage to cash in on tesla see rivian as an opportunity to make up for lost ground russ mould investment director at stockbroker aj bell says there is a lot of money looking for a home now and many people think rivian is the new tesla remember though rivian has never made a profit and it has only sold a handful of trucks contrast that with ford which is forecast by analysts to generate more than 120billion in sales and nearly 6 billion in net profits in 2021 although the two are often compared entrepreneur scaringe who is an outdoorsy family man seems the antithesis of tesla s founder elon musk musk 50 has made a virtue of eccentricity and has a colourful private life a former beau of johnny depp s ex amber heard he recently semi separated from wife grimes 33 a canadian singer with whom he shares a young son named x ae a xii musk or baby x for short clark kent look a like scaringe who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering from massachusetts institute of technology seems almost preternaturally normal even rivian s 2 6m sq ft assembly plant is based in the town of normal illinois married to meagan with whom he has three sons since 2014 he is vegan is mad on mountain biking and rather than musk s incendiary tweets he posts wholesome pictures of himself camping with his family with a big yellow tent stowed on their rivian truck high voltage tesla has a market value of nearly 1 1 trillion its founder elon musk pictured has made a virtue of eccentricity and has a colourful private life scaringe presents himself as an eco evangelist this is a once in a planet situation where for the first time a single species has the potential to change the make up of the planet for all time forward he told investors in a less environmentally conscious age scaringe would have been called a petrolhead the son of an engineer he has been obsessed with cars since boyhood but says he felt conflicted by the damage they did ultimately i decided to focus my life on helping to drive our transportation system toward a future state that was sustainable and carbon neutral the fact this worthy goal could also be immensely profitable goes unsaid scaringe himself could make a personal fortune of up to 14billion from his shares and options if the company performs investors could be well rewarded too if it all goes to plan there is no doubt about the scale of the opportunity bloomberg new energy finance believes that by 2037 evs will be more than half of new vehicles sold janet mui of brewin dolphin points out this stock is not for everyone but you are buying the prospects of a huge potential market to look at rivian s website though you would barely grasp that it makes vehicles at all photographs of production lines or car plants are conspicuous by their absence you could easily assume the company was plugging exclusive family adventure holidays the site is big on saccharine tinged pictures of mountains forests deserted roads hip young parents and slightly icky claims it is building the kind of future our kids and our kids kids deserve at a price the vehicles made for the planet include the r1t electric truck with prices starting at 67 500 and the r1s suv starting at 70 000 and for all rivian s upscale eco warrior vibe competition in the ev market will be ferocious nissan which has put its sunderland plant at the heart of its 13billion push has unveiled a small electric suv and a cute pick up truck the surf out that looks quite similar to the r1t ford as well as being a top investor is likely to be a formidable rival so is tesla german car maker volkswagen is planning to spend 31billion on battery evs in the next five years and to launch 70 all electric models by 2030 and let s not forget china the world s biggest car market where home grown ev companies are springing up enthusiasm among shareholders however has not been dimmed by the fact that china s ev group nio was on the verge of bankruptcy last year and investors in nikola which makes electric lorries have had a nail biting journey since it floated on nasdaq in summer 2020 shares tanked following a report from short sellers hindenberg research alleging an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies the us markets watchdog the securities and exchange commission and the department of justice are investigating and the founder trevor milton 39 resigned though he has disputed the claims no one is suggesting any such problems at rivian but the episode is a warning to investors that it pays to be careful in this sector shares in rivian and others of its ilk could also fall out of favour if the tech and green share surge runs out of steam rewards at rivian could be rich but no one should invest in the ev market in the expectation of a smooth ride buckle up
santa clarita california amidst lower inventories this year the price of farm grown christmas trees rose significantly brent green owner of a santa clarita tree farm that has been in business for nearly 50 years said other factors have also contributed to this increase it has just been a little harder this year with drought being a major one it browned out a lot of the big trees we will not get those back until next year when they have re flushed from all the rains that they did get these last couple months he added the shortages of labor people just not wanting to work has spiked all the tree prices up north as well as gas prices have made all the freight charges bringing trees down south a lot more expensive he added so we still have great selection of trees we still have a lot of beautiful trees they have just gone up about 20 to 25 percent this year he said

executive officer good morning and thank you for joining us today i would like to welcome you to the culp quarterly conference call with analysts and investors with me on the call today are ken bowling our chief financial officer and boyd chumbley the president of our upholstery fabrics business for today i will begin the call with some opening comments and kim will then review the financial results for the quarter i will then update you on the strategic actions in each of our operating segments and after that ken will review our business outlook for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 we will then be happy to take some questions as previously announced our results for the second quarter reflected lower than expected sales primarily for our upholstery fabrics segment several external factors affected our sales results for the quarter particularly covid 19 related shutdowns in vietnam and customer supply chain constraints for non fabric components profitability also remained pressured in both of our businesses by the continued rapid rise in freight raw material and labor costs despite these challenging macroeconomic environment situations i m extremely proud of how our global platform and our associates have responded over the last 18 months to build a more robust supply chain that has kept pace with demand and met the delivery needs of our valued customers looking ahead we are pleased that the shutdowns in vietnam have been lifted but the rapidly rising cost and the disruption throughout the industry s supply chains do continue and many of our customers have delayed their previously planned rollout and their new product launches we also believe that many customers have excess inventory for fabric and cover products that were purchased to support their expanding backlogs as they wait for their supply chain issues to subside as a result we expect it could take some time for customers to work through their existing fabric and cover inventory levels we also have some concern that inflationary pressures are causing some slowing in new business from the peak levels of last year leading to some lower demand once customers fulfill their existing backlogs although the demand appears to remain high when comparing to pre covid levels based on these factors we expect that current headwinds will continue to pressure results during the second half of this fiscal year especially during the third quarter but we expect to see a meaningful rebound in our business beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing into next fiscal year we are positioned very well with stronger supply chains strategic inventory reserves and growing opportunities as a result of our innovation and strong delivery performance we also expect some improvement in customer supply chain disruption by the fourth quarter of this fiscal year which is traditionally a strong seasonal period notably if we meet our expectations for the third and fourth quarters and for the full fiscal 2022 year we will sustain significant sales gains as compared to pre covid levels of fiscal 2020 we are also implementing further pricing actions during the third quarter to help offset current inflationary pressures and we do expect to open our new haiti facility during this third quarter which will increase our capacity for cut and sewn upholstery kits our strong global platform together with our long term supplier relationships does continue to provide a distinct competitive advantage allowing us to quickly respond to the evolving needs of our customers we frequently hear positive feedback from our customers regarding the value of our supply chain and delivery record supporting our belief that we are continuing to outperform our competitors which will support our future growth we also remain focused on innovation and creative designs in both of our businesses and we are confident in our product driven strategy the recent opening of our new innovation campus in downtown high point north carolina has been extremely well received by our customers providing them with a hands on first class experience for viewing the scope of our products from fabric to sewn cover our balance sheet remains solid and i m extremely pleased that we have once again increased our annual dividend making this the ninth consecutive year of dividend increases importantly we have the financial strength to support our business in the current environment and we look forward to the opportunities to deliver value for our customers employees and shareholders in fiscal 2022 and beyond so with that i ll now turn the call over to ken who will review the financial results for the quarter kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks iv as mentioned earlier on the call we have posted slide presentations to our investor relations website that cover key performance measures we ve also posted our capital allocation strategy here are the financial highlights for the second quarter net sales were 74 6 million down 3 compared with the prior year period the company reported income from operations of 1 6 million compared with income from operations of 4 5 million from the period for the prior year period i ll comment in more detail on divisional sales and operating performance in a moment net income for the second quarter was 851 000 or 0 07 per diluted share compared with net income of 2 4 million or 0 19 per diluted share for the prior year period our overall operating performance was affected by several headwinds namely lower sales higher freight and raw material costs unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations and inefficiencies due to labor shortages in the us and canada among other factors these pressures were partially offset by lower total sg a expense for the quarter due primarily to lower accrued incentive compensation expense on a percent of sales basis total sg a came in at 12 2 compared to 12 7 for the same period a year ago trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda was 17 5 million or 5 5 of net sales compared to 11 2 million or 4 3 of net sales for the same period last year reflecting a year over year improvement of 56 consolidated return on capital for the trailing 12 month period was 11 8 the effective income tax rate for the second quarter of this fiscal year was 34 3 compared with 41 4 for the same period a year ago our effective income tax rates are affected over the fiscal year by the mix of taxable income that is mostly earned by our foreign subsidiaries located in china and canada which have higher income tax rates as compared to the us federal rate looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year we currently estimate that our consolidated effective income tax rate for the annual period will be in the 30 to 40 range based on the facts we know today the income tax rate for the third and fourth quarters could vary based on the facts and circumstances for those specific quarters additionally we are currently projecting cash income tax payments of approximately 3 6 million for fiscal 2022 importantly our estimated cash income tax payments for this fiscal year are management s current projections only and can be affected over the year by actual earnings from our foreign subsidiaries located in china and canada versus annual projections changes in the foreign exchange rates associated with our china operations in relation to the us dollar as well as the timing of when significant capital projects will be placed in the service which determines the deductibility of accelerated depreciation now let s take a look at our business segments for mattress fabrics segment sales were 40 9 million up 2 1 compared with last year s second quarter operating income for the quarter was 3 1 million compared with 4 4 million a year ago with an operating income margin of 7 7 compared with 10 9 a year ago operating performance for the second quarter as compared to the prior year period was negatively affected primarily by higher freight raw material and labor costs inefficiencies due to ongoing labor shortage in the us and canada and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in china and canada the price increase in freight surcharge implemented during the first half of fiscal 2022 have helped us offset a portion of the current inflationary pressures we are facing however the lag in price utilization as well as competitive market pressures that limit us from immediately passing on all of our cost increases are expected to continue affecting our operating performance in the near term and we may need to consider further pricing actions if operating costs continue to rise for upholstery fabrics segment sales for the second quarter were 33 7 million down 8 5 over the prior year operating income for this quarter was 1 million compared with 3 3 million a year ago with an operating income margin of 3 1 compared with 8 9 a year ago operating performance was primarily affected by lower sales in our residential business as well as higher freight costs start up costs for our new haiti facility unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation in china and lower contribution from our read window products business we implemented a freight surcharge during the second quarter to help offset rising freight cost but due to continued rapid increase in operating material costs we are instituting an additional price increase during the third quarter to help cover a portion of these inflationary pressure here are the balance sheet highlights we reported 36 6 million of total cash and investments and no outstanding borrowings as of the end of the quarter compared with 46 9 million in total cash and investments and no outstanding debt as of the end of last fiscal year cash flow from operations and free cash flow were negative 1 3 million and negative 5 8 million respectively for the first six months of the year as we continue to invest in our business our cash flow from operations and free cash flow during the first half of this fiscal year were affected by the following uses of cash increased inventory purchases to support our valued customers to get ahead of rising material rising raw material costs and to strategically improve our in stock position ahead of the chinese new year holiday 3 9 million investment in capital expenditures including expenditures for machinery equipment and it investments as well as expenditures related to our new innovation campus 1 4 million in payments for the new building lease and start up expenses associated with our haiti operation and upholstery and cut and sew operation and increased accounts payable payments related to our return to normal credit terms as opposed to the extended terms previously granted in response to the covid 19 pandemic additionally during the first six months of this fiscal year we paid 2 7 million in regular quarterly dividends and spent 1 8 million on share repurchases while we are pleased with our solid balance sheet going into the third quarter it is important to note that we will continue to utilize cash for strategic investments in working capital planned capital expenditures and investments in our operations located in haiti based on our current expected uses of cash and our business outlook for the second half of this fiscal year we expect total cash and investments to be lower at the end of the third quarter as compared to the end of the second quarter but to increase by the end of the fourth quarter the company repurchased approximately 73 000 shares of our common stock during the second quarter leaving approximately 3 2 million available under our current share repurchase program with that i ll turn the call back over to iv robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you ken i ll begin with the mattress fabrics business while mattress fabric sales for the second quarter were in line with our expectations revenue was somewhat affected by our customer supply chain constraints for non fabric components and existing inventory levels for mattress fabrics and covers this caused our customers to temporarily delay taking some orders and pushed some new product launches into subsequent quarters while working through those limitations however we expect these pressures will be alleviated over the medium term despite the challenging environment during the quarter we relied on our product driven strategy with a focus on design creativity and innovation supported by the utilization of our resilient manufacturing and sourcing platform to service the needs of our customers our onshore nearshore and offshore supply chain strategy as well as our fabric to cover model remains a preferred platform especially for our sewn mattress cover customers looking ahead our market position remains solid with strong new placements and product developments for fiscal 2023 rising costs continue to pressure our profitability but our team remains committed to ongoing efforts to control internal costs improve efficiencies and take reasonable pricing actions to mitigate and manage inflation over the long term we are well positioned to sustain our competitive advantage and leverage our compelling business model to further expand our market reach especially as our customer supply chain disruption and inventory positions begin to normalize now i make a few comments on the upholstery fabric segment our second quarter results were disappointing largely driven by lower sales in our residential business due to covid 19 related shutdowns of our sourcing partners and our customers in vietnam throughout most of the quarter these shutdowns were expected to be short term but instead lasted significantly longer than anticipated and limited our ability to ship orders both within and outside of asia residential sales were also pressured by our customers supply chain constraints and labor shortages at their us facilities which significantly reduced our ability to ship prepared fabric orders despite the headwinds in our residential business we were encouraged by the recovery in our hospitality business during the second quarter led by our hospitality contract fabric business we also saw a measurable improvement in our read window products business during the last month of the quarter we re pleased the shutdowns that affected our vietnam customers and sourcing partners during the quarter are now lifted and we have resumed shipping at normalized capacity additionally we expect to begin production at our new haiti facility during the third quarter which will expand our capacity for cuttings and upholstery kits and mitigate some risk with near shore capabilities that complement our strong asian platform looking ahead there are lingering near term challenges related to our customers supply chain constraints and existing levels of fabric inventory for the residential business also while we believe demand trends remain favorable for the home furnishings industry there is an expected slowdown in new business from the peak experienced during the post covid stay at home surge but despite these external conditions our business is well positioned for the long term with our product driven strategy and innovative product offerings including our popular portfolio of livesmart performance products as well as our flexible asian platform our long term supplier relationships and our expanded capacity in haiti we re also encouraged by the recent showtime fabric market where our products received favorable reaction and strong support from our customers above all we remain focused on meeting the changing needs of our valued customers in upholstery fabrics ken will now discuss the general outlook for the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year and we ll take some questions kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we continue to navigate uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment related to customer supply chain disruptions for non fabric components significant inflationary pressures a challenging labor market and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates although we are well positioned over the long term with our product driven strategy and flexible global platform the current headwinds are expected to continue pressure results throughout the second half of this fiscal year especially during the third quarter as a reminder the third and fourth quarters will also be affected by the timing of the chinese new year holiday which begins at the end of the third quarter and continues into the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the uncertain and rapidly changing inflationary environment the lack of visibility relating to the duration and magnitude of customers supply chain disruptions and uncertainly related to the impact of the new omicron environment or the coronavirus we have withdrawn our previously issued annual guidance for this fiscal year and have only provided a limited outlook for the third and fourth quarters until the current volatility stabilizes we expect our net sales and consolidated operating income for the third quarter this fiscal year to be sequentially comparable to the second quarter of this fiscal year we expect a strong improvement in net sales and operating income for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year as compared to both the sequential third quarter of this fiscal year and as compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year our confidence in this anticipated fourth quarter rebound comes from expected improvement in our customer supply chains and recognition of our customer placements and the scheduled timing for their release in a traditionally seasonal strong quarter as well as positioning with our solid supply chains strategic inventory levels and pricing actions that will cover us more adequately in the fourth quarter notably our expectations for the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year are based on information available at the time of this call and reflects certain assumptions by management regarding the company s business and trends and the projected impact of the ongoing headwinds additionally based on current expectations capital expenditures for this fiscal year are now expected to be in the 10 3 million to 10 7 million range our capital investments will focus on ongoing strategy of maintenance capex centered in our mattress fabrics business as well as spending in our upholstery fabrics business with investments in read windows and our new haiti start up at the corporate level capex spending will include investments in it infrastructure and security as well as our new innovation campus in high point north carolina depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately 7 4 million to 7 6 million for this fiscal year with that we will now take your questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question comes from anthony lebiedzinski with sidoti company please go ahead anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst yes good morning and thank you for taking the questions so i know you guys did a pretty good overview of the two different segments just wanted to see if we can get a better understanding of the timing shifts that basically of shipments it sounds like something is going on with new product launches some of it is just your customers are asking to hold off on shipments so just wanted to if you could just separate the two just give us a better understanding of the of just the timing issues that are surrounding the back half outlook robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes so anthony thank you for the question and good morning this is iv i ll start and certainly that boyd chime in too it is there are some nuances between the two businesses so your question is excellent in the upholstery fabrics business we ve built up strategically some product in advance of chinese new year but we also built up some inventory in preparation as our customers had planned to expand capacity to meet surge levels of demand so what we ve seen in some cases our supply chain has been fulfilling better and keeping up with market demand and our lead times are more normal today so we re prepared to deliver at what would normally be increased levels of capacity that in some cases of the customers haven t caught up to and boyd you may want to add to that to some degree is why we re seeing a little delay in some of that shipping there boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division no i think that very well covers what s happened on the fabric side of the business here and then additionally to that as we ve discussed we had the disruption on the cut and sew portion of our business from vietnam in the second quarter but with that now vietnam now being back fully restored with capacity there and with the haiti operation now coming on stream we certainly see more normalized shipping pattern for the second half of the year on our cut and sew business as well robert g culp iv chief executive officer i think anthony and then just to keep tacking onto that and spend in the mattress fabric some you should expect we would expect some sequential improvement in upholstery fabric from q2 to q3 and where when we talk about mattress fabrics especially mattress covers normally in the end of our q3 we will see strong ramp up of new product rollouts we often target around calendar year january because of some of the demand in the business and just dealing with supply chains and making sure current orders can be delivered a lot of those rollouts that we would expect normally for mattress fabrics in q3 are being pushed into q4 or later so that s why it s a slight different in both businesses we re able to deliver and in this case i guess it s because our customers can t pull it off goods that we ve prepared but it is a little different quarter to quarter upholsteries start to improve some in q3 while mattress fabrics may not feel that improvements till q4 anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay thanks for that explanation and then i guess just from an overall demand perspective it sounds like you expect maybe a little bit of a moderation versus a year ago at kind of peak levels but is it safe to assume that you guys are still seeing demand above pre pandemic levels robert g culp iv chief executive officer anthony this is iv again that s an excellent question too and it is an important nuance to think about when we speak about sales slowing when we say that we mean they re slowing as you pointed out from a very high peak that we were seeing last year at this time because everything we had was shipping quick and we were staying home response had boosted really the entire industry the business in our customers now we believe is still at a high level compared to pre covid levels and they re working through really strong backlogs it s just that the level has subsided somewhat on new orders as compared to that peak of last year we feel that s a little more acutely as in some cases our customers have ordered more fabric as we talked about to support increased production levels to work the backlog but the capacity is not fully in place so it s really a timing issue and again our supply chain has been solid and most of our backlogs are now at normal lead times so again it s just timing on when we can start to deliver it so generally we do see positive long term trend in the order level which does continue supporting our business anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay and the last question for me as far as the planned price increases is it both for the third and fourth quarter or are they just for the third quarter that you re planning and can you give us the magnitude of the price increase that you re planning to do kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes anthony this is ken yes if you look at q2 the impact kind of the cumulative impact of all the increases we ve done so far i d say that s around 3 or so of total income now or total sales and so when you look at the rest of the year i mean we do have more coming in but those are going to accumulate over the period of time so it s going to be higher of course than we are today but they come in at different times so they are going to be staggered but i think by the time the end of the third quarter guys that they will all be in place at that point robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst okay got it all right well thank you very much and best of luck going forward robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you anthony have a good day operator the next question comes from budd bugatch with water tower research please go ahead budd bugatch water tower research analyst good morning iv ken boyd robert g culp iv chief executive officer good morning budd budd bugatch water tower research analyst i guess i d like if you could you said that it would take i think iv i think your quote was some time for your customers to work through the additional problems that they had before they could get through to the your fabric inventory can you quantify that maybe it s different by segment it probably is and maybe give us an idea of what you think that time is robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes i mean budd we tried for sure a good question we re just trying to be a little hesitant when we talk about some time but we really obviously when we re seeing the strong rebound for q4 we think it starts then so it s not a long term thing it s we think it ll be q4 and then heading into next year in both businesses budd bugatch water tower research analyst i m sorry robert g culp iv chief executive officer in both businesses although the rebound for q4 will be first in mattress fabrics and then continuing strong for both through the rest of the year budd bugatch water tower research analyst i got you and let me put a maybe this is maybe i don t mean it to be unfair but it s probably a difficult question if haiti had been online during the second quarter for all of the second quarter what would that have done for your vietnam operation would you how what kind of impact would you have had boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yes budd this is boyd and certainly and of course the haiti operation is coming online as we had planned there really has been no delay in that facility coming on stream but if that facility had been in place earlier certainly we would have had an opportunity to shift some of the vietnam production that was being disrupted by covid we could have shipped some of that potentially to the haiti operation which would have helped in regards to the disruption that we saw in q2 we were able to shift some of the vietnam production back to china for a period of time so we weren t fully without capability of supplying cutting some kits during that time period but yes if haiti had been available sooner we certainly could have taken advantage of that situation as well robert g culp iv chief executive officer and from just for budd s analysis here boyd what the what you shifted back to china was an amazing statement to your supply chain but that came at a cost because of the tariffs and some of the impacts that had been is why we moved to vietnam in the first place boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division that is correct right there were some costs budd bugatch water tower research analyst okay that makes good sense one of the words that s now being apparently retired by the chairman of the fed was transitory and talking about inflation and i don t think anybody in the business world has believed transitory for some time but what is the status of what you re seeing in terms of inflation now are you seeing additional price increases in the last couple of weeks that are going on or is it are we seeing any moderation in the rate of increases or where they re coming from boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division budd this is boyd again i ll first speak in regards to the upholstery fabrics business and we certainly have continued to see additional increases from the inflationary environment we ve seen additional increases in the recent weeks so there are inflationary pressures that are continuing to emerge most recently related to energy costs and raw material costs so there are ongoing inflationary pressures other costs such as freight i think we ve seen those costs likely have peaked and but yes to answer your question we are continuing to see additional inflationary cost pressures budd bugatch water tower research analyst okay but they seem sounds like that if you re talking about energy that s in the kind of the factors of production so they if you ve seen freight peak this probably peaks and we re probably not too far away from a peak on that as well i would suspect i mean those things they have a way of factoring through of a supply chain and economy over a period of time so would that be the way right way to think about it or am i being too optimistic boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division i think we re just in an uncertain environment right now budd that there s been a lot of volatility that we ve seen from month to month and week to week so i m not sure there s a how to think about that just yet other than as we are seeing these cost pressures we are taking the necessary actions at the time and we ll continue to respond accordingly with whatever occurs robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes i think we re thinking about it like you re budd we do hope we re at the peak of some of those costs raw materials is probably the one that i worry about the most that might have more inflation on it hopefully you re right about freight and i know boyd we re not totally sure on the mattress side i ll just add in one more thing that s an impact is labor costs because of our strong north american production level in mattress fabrics we ve had an impact from labor and certainly we have higher labor rates but what s impacted us more in the past has been so much labor shortage and the inefficiency of being able to train and get new associates to operate efficiently the good news is we have significant improvement there and in are much better shape as we get to middle of q3 with a much stronger labor position so even at a somewhat higher rate having an efficient labor rate will be an efficient labor force will be a big help to us there as far as to limit some of the pressures and leasing that part of the business budd bugatch water tower research analyst yes we ve heard from a lot of people that they ve been shortage in terms of being able to get appropriate associates can you quantify are you at where you want to be in terms of your labor force or what s the shortage now versus maybe where it was two weeks ago four weeks ago six weeks ago robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes i mean it s we it is significantly drastically improved from where it was six weeks ago so for whatever reason we just had a nice we ve done a great job of recruiting a great job of engagement we found a lot of success replacing or refilling jobs that were open especially on our night and off shifts that was where the biggest problem area was we re not all the way filled but we re in a place now where we can operate our equipment which makes a big difference to our efficiency budd bugatch water tower research analyst i can understand that i guess last for me i noted that inventories are up like 16 million year over year and it s kind of the highest level that i ve seen since i guess the late 1990s when the company was being run with a different discipline not as an asset light company which have been over now for the last decade or more so is any of that inventory at risk and is it finished goods is it wip raw material i worry about that and i guess other investors might too kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes i budd this is ken i ll begin and iv you can jump in too i think as far as the buildup as i think i pointed this out i mean part of it has been the customer related customers pushing back getting ready for chinese new year all that s finished goods we have increased our raw materials on the mattress fabrics side to get ahead of the price increases so it is both sides of it but those have all been recent increases in preparation for these periods so iv i don t see any exposure there as far as robert g culp iv chief executive officer you know we don t believe there s any exposure in the upholstery side of the business it is more finished goods kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes robert g culp iv chief executive officer prepared to add a chinese new year and ready for the expanded capacity levels our customers expect to get to and on the mattress side yes it s a lot of raw materials that have been purchased in advance of pricing pressure that we can knit or weave or make a cover out of in any direction we get pulled so it feels like a positive position that s poised for an upturn in the market kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes and we ve a lot of companies these days are really focusing on higher inventory just because of the uncertainty so we feel good from that standpoint and expecting that to turn in the fourth quarter budd bugatch water tower research analyst okay and do you think inventories go back or i mean everybody is talking today about having more inventory than less inventory the era of just in time seems to be something now moving to the past because people are talking about having pockets of additional supply because they re worried about things like which we ve experienced now for the last two quarters supply chain so of that 16 million how much would you think that would draw down kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes i think again this is ken i think for the fourth quarter of course we think we can take a big a sizable chunk out of that and then from there you looked at over the past year i think it was in the mid 50s at one time i think last year the 40 million i think that 47 million was low so i think going forward it obviously depends on the uncertainty that we re looking at as far as what our customers are doing but i don t know boyd i think it would stay a little bit higher than normal boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yes i think certainly and we feel strongly budd that our service reputation and our reliability for service throughout this volatile time period has certainly been an advantage for us so yes i think as we look at our inventories strategically now versus what we did in a number of years past we certainly see it as a strategic advantage to be able to offer exceptional service continually to our customer base so yes i think budd bugatch water tower research analyst i think i understand that because i think that s that is the reputation of culp and with the stronger balance sheet then you have i think you ve got that strategic advantage so good luck on the third and the fourth quarters and look forward to talking to you again shortly robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you budd operator the next question comes from marco rodriguez with stonegate capital markets please go ahead marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst good morning guys thank you for taking my questions robert g culp iv chief executive officer good morning marco marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst hey guys i was wondering if you can maybe we can talk a little bit about the outlook that you had in your prepared remarks obviously you ve pulled out a few headwinds that are impacting the second half of the year inflation lowering demand high customer inventory levels supply chain issues at your customers so i understand the q3 guidance in light of that but maybe if you can talk a little bit about q4 your expectations there for a stronger improvement if inflationary pressures are less than temporary and supply chain issues don t seem to be rectified anytime soon what s sort of giving you the confidence for q4 for that strong improvement robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you marco good question and that s something we ve talked a lot about and as we ve touched on throughout it comes down to a timing question and then q4 also being traditionally a strong seasonal period historically and as we ve been saying internally and to anyone we ve spoken to investors or customers or suppliers it s not really a question of if it s going to come back strong it s when so we ve built a solid supply chain terrific production locations and as boyd mentioned a few times we re outperforming our competitors in delivery and we hear this all the time and we do think that s driving new opportunity so in q4 let s think about some of the good things we ll be fully operational in haiti for upholstery kits and we have both businesses then operating with some combination of onshore nearshore and offshore capabilities so really boosting and ramping up the supply chain even more we ll be much more covered to inflationary costs in our business in q4 with the price increases and the surcharges being in place and our labor situation as i touched on is stabilizing nicely now which helps quite a bit on the mattress fabrics side we ve strategically built some good inventory levels that we ve touched on in both finished goods and raw materials and we re positioned well as our customers start to increase their capacity levels and we think it will just be a strong pull through of that and we also are hearing about new strong placement conditions for both businesses and we just see expectations for when those customers are now scheduling to roll those new items and that all seems to be pointing much more toward q4 and then just a couple more quick things our new innovation campus has been a home run we had showtime there a couple of weeks ago and just great momentum coming from that showtime market and then we just think we re in a strong position with our market reach for medium to long term and just very much looking forward to what we think with our price actions finally to catch a little hold to some more normalized conditions in q4 so i hope that helps marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst very helpful thanks i appreciate that i also want to kind of follow up on a prior question as it relates to in your prepared remarks you discussed kind of the potential dampening demand due to prices and i understand the difficult year over year comps but is there and i heard your response that demand is a little bit better than pre covid levels i just want to make sure that the i guess what i m trying to get at is is whether or not inflation these price increases are really starting to impact the consumers ability or willingness rather to buy new stuff robert g culp iv chief executive officer i mean it s a great question marco and one we ve talked about a lot and we spoke about it and boyd sitting here beside me shaking his head we asked every customer we saw during our showtime market about that exact question and we just aren t hearing that concern yet fair boyd boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yes that s the feedback we ve received robert g culp iv chief executive officer we wonder same i know the increases we re passing on aren t going to be the kind of thing that would disrupt the market but we do know that some of our customers have done increases as high as the mid to higher teens i guess but we just we have not heard of a dampening of demand marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and last robert g culp iv chief executive officer i mean down from the peak but we re not here it s still at a high level so we re really trying to we re not really hearing that yet boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yes yes marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it got it okay and last question for me you guys in your prepared remarks also called out some competitive pressures potentially impacting your ability to push through cost increases or raise your prices in the mattress fabrics segment can you maybe expand a little bit more on that and what you re seeing robert g culp iv chief executive officer i think marco when it s a good question too and we tried to be smart in the way we talk about it the competitive pressures are not as much about us ultimately being able to pass it through it s the timing of when we can do it so we will get there we just lag on it so there s just always competitive pressure when we re dealing with customers and trying to think long term for developing big business with our most trusted partners sometimes we just can t pass it as quick as we want so we do it in chunks and do it over stage periods where ultimately we catch up to the full effect but just not immediately boyd do you want to add anything to that how you think about it from pricing boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yes i mean i would just agree with what you said there but there s typically a lag that will take place but yes i don t see any other significant impacts from that robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes so it s not much about passing it through marco it s just how quickly we can get it through marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it understood i appreciate your time guys robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes sir thank you boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division thank you marco marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst thanks operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the

kimco has an investment in grocery store albertsons which ipoed in 2020 and it could help fund the company s growth for years to come strip malls are a cornerstone of the american economy generally featuring a grocery store that s exactly what real estate investment trust reit kimco kim 0 89 specializes in owning and when tenant albertsons aci 1 40 ran into trouble some years ago the reit stepped in to help eventually ending up with an ownership stake albertsons is now public again and this stake is a huge hidden plus for kimco and its shareholders that s a lot of money at the end of the third quarter kimco estimated that its stake in albertsons was worth roughly 1 2 billion that s a nice chunk of change thanks to a big rally since the grocer s mid 2020 initial public offering ipo in truth the ipo was something of a dud as the company was hoping to price the stock between 18 and 20 per share but ended up pricing it at 16 today however it is worth around 34 per share up a hefty 115 or so in around 17 months clearly kimco has benefited greatly from that price advance given that its cost basis is in the 100 million range but the real benefit isn t in the asset itself it is in what kimco can do with the cash that would be generated by selling its stake in albertsons while the prospects of suddenly having 1 2 billion in cash sounds great it isn t actually a possibility there s a lock up period that won t end until later in 2022 and well there are some other complications given that kimco is a reit as a reit kimco is limited in how much income it can generate from non real estate activities management estimates that if it wanted to maximize the cash it could pull from the investment it could sell between 350 million and 400 million per year some simple math here leads to between three and four years of cash depending on how quickly the company sells it hasn t however said it would do that much selling or try to reduce its stake that quickly so albertsons could be a gift that keeps on giving for many years to come the options are open what s really important to recognize is that as a reit kimco has to pass most of its cash on to investors as dividends that leaves precious little money for other purposes like investing in redevelopment projects and acquiring new assets so reits usually end up tapping the bond and equity markets for growth capital that s not an inherently bad thing but kimco now has another lever for funding its growth one that doesn t add debt to its balance sheet or risk diluting current shareholders and spacing out the cash is no hardship given that spending 1 2 billion wouldn t be an easy task leaving it sitting on the balance sheet given the low interest rates today would be problematic too in fact if you look at the company s history the cash that s locked in albertsons stock could last a very long time between 2015 and 2021 the company redeveloped over 100 properties at a total cost of around 1 billion the company estimates that its return on investment was around 8 3 across all of these projects acquisitions which are unpredictable could be funded with the sale of albertsons stock as well which could increase the burn rate if you will but after a big recent deal another blockbuster acquisition is probably off the table for now so bolt on purchases which would be easier to fund with small sales of albertsons stock could be the norm the thing is it would be highly unlikely that kimco would use only the sale of albertsons stock to fund either of these efforts it would probably be a mixture of debt stock sales and cash that was put to work to maximize the company s returns the albertsons stake simply makes the math easier for kimco on the cash side of things perhaps equally important it gives the reit another avenue for raising cash should interest rates rise making debt more expensive or issuing stock become difficult for some reason such as a downturn in the reit market in other words kimco has optionality what comes next as it is kimco isn t telegraphing any imminent sales efforts when it comes to albertsons it is just explaining what it could do if it wanted so for now the grocery store stake is a backstop however it is one that investors should keep in the back of their minds because it is a valuable source of growth capital that kimco can use to expand its business over time how that will happen isn t clear right now but at some point it will happen and it should be a big win for investors when it does

goldeneye at clermont was south and inland for several years we have stressed the need to carefully examine mallards and mottled ducks to determine how many of these may be hybrids backcrosses or that cannot be identified specifically the identification of these ducks is so hopelessly confused that we now combine all mallards mottled ducks hybrids backcrosses mallard mottled duck and unknowns mallard mottled duck into a single muddled duck total which this season numbered 6990 individuals we are the opinion that florida cbcs in the central and southern peninsula that continue to report

documentation forms submitted by compilers my apologies bruce for not listing you as a coauthor of previous florida cbc summaries following this review we had intended to delete from the cbc database 53 reports of rare species accompanied by no or insufficient details but a review of ebird maps revealed that 28 of these reports could be verified based on photographs imbedded in ebird checklists in future seasons we will continue to examine ebird maps for potentially verifiable birds found on cbcs we cannot in good conscience allow such potentially legitimate sightings to be deleted from the cbc database simply because compilers failed to perform one of their primary duties but we ask florida s compilers to greatly reduce the amount of ebird data mining that we must perform we deleted 25

with little inventory available to local employees both those here seasonally and long term j 1 visa holders are having a difficult time locking up housing for the winter vail daily archive if you visit any of the sites used to hunt for housing craigslist facebook and nextdoor to name only a few you re sure to find a slew of seasonal employees pleading for leads on housing many of these employees seeking housing are j 1 visa holders with jobs already lined up at local ski resorts hotels and restaurants perusing just a sample of the posts from these international students on the eagle county classifieds facebook group include pleas such as it is very difficult to get housing because there is no place for employees and that is why we search by our means i m urgently looking for housing my trip is two weeks away and i can t find it we are a group of five friends who are going to work at beaver creek resort from december to march we are looking for housing options and it is being difficult to find support local journalism donate one j 1 visa holder that took to facebook in his housing search was giles ozolinš ozolinš first visited america from australia eight years ago on a tourist visa and fell in love with the people the culture and literally everything about it he said after this initial trip ozolinš immediately began trying to find ways to return to the country and discovered that in returning to college for a masters in business administration he qualified for a j 1 visa these visas are provided to international candidates participating in an exchange program to gain certain experiences or career training for a set amount of time ultimately through a long process a visa officer referred ozolinš to vail and after numerous interviews and offers he accepted a job with the lodge at vail one of numerous local properties owned by vail resorts hospitality i decided that the lodge at vail was the best place for me as i emphasized that i wasn t here for a flash in the pan job i wanted a career and to make america my home he said they said they might be able to help with that ozolinš then began the process of searching for housing i was super worried cautious and stressed ozolinš said of the process adding that he was cautious about the cost of rentals especially those that requested huge deposits his future employer had already warned ozolinš about the housing crisis telling him it would be his biggest challenge my employer couldn t have been more open and honest he said adding that they were willing to comp a few nights stay at the hotel through a number of avenues setting up a craigslist alert and joining a number of facebook groups ozolinš was finally able to find a place in gypsum he said that he was told he was one of over 30 people that applied for the room this housing suited ozolinš needs and allowed him to pursue his dreams and so far one week into the job he loves it i get to meet americans from all over the country that are just happy to be here he said the management and my co workers have also made me feel so welcome and i couldn t ask for a better crew a roof over your head and a warm bed however the experience of looking for housing had its challenges ozolinš in describing the process of searching for housing said that his posts on facebook received a lot of negative comments from locals and required him to be realistic about what he was looking for a roof over your head and a warm bed is literally all you need he said this process made him want to pay it forward and he s begun offering to help other j 1 visa holders find housing i would hate for someone to have all this optimism about living and working in america only to have to put their tail between their legs and return home he said adding that his advice to other visa applicants is to not give up to not let pride get in the way and to be smart throughout the process navigating the world of online posting does require seekers to be both diligent and careful the market is rife with scammers that s something that sophie yep also experienced a j 1 visa holder from peru she also ultimately found housing but only after an arduous process yep who has a job lined up at the lodge and has worked in vail for two prior seasons said the situation of searching for housing this season has been terrible she said the whole process has been stressful and caused a lot of anxiety because while living in peru it s difficult to check the place before moving and the rental market is full of scams i know a lot of j 1s get scammed yep said adding that she herself has been contacted by a couple of scammers trying to convince her to sign leases some even using photoshopped ids to do so yep said that her employer did not offer her any employee housing but she wished they had at least provided a contact list or recommendations of places to look while the struggle to find housing isn t unique to international employees there are challenges that are unique to their plight it includes not being able to check out housing in person having the time of their stay and place of employment tied to their visa and reliance on public transportation which makes housing options downvalley a challenge for some an integral part of the workforce seasonal employees including those with visas play an integral role in the local workforce chris dillmann vail daily archive in ski resort communities the seasonal workforce plays a critical role in providing services to guests when tourism and visitation is its highest winter and summer and of this seasonal workforce visa holders both those with j 1 and h 2b visas play a critical role we typically have more jobs available than we do people to fill them pre pandemic and post pandemic just many many more jobs than people especially the entry level typically lower paid jobs said chris romer the president and ceo of the vail valley partnership so the j 1s they re a really important part of our workforce because they fill high need low demand jobs in the winter these programs are even more critical as employers have higher demand and higher touch points with guests romer said j 1 visas were suspended last year due to covid 19 and many businesses were able to adapt simply due to the lower business volume romer said this winter j 1 visas are again allowed at a critical time when both businesses and visitation are ramping up at the same time employers are facing employee shortages right now we need the international workforce and we need the student visas because visitation is not going to be 20 down it will be 20 or more up romer said frankly where we re at right now with the labor situation and the job situation is that any increase in available labor supply especially for these front line positions helps the community we need to be able to provide a high level of service going into the winter season we need to be able to provide for the visitors that we know are coming so we need the international workforce in 2019 eagle county had 1 904 j 1 workers out of its total labor force of around 36 000 according to mark hoblitzell business services coordinator for northwest colorado for the colorado department of labor and employment overall j 1 workers are a relatively small percentage of eagle county s labor force but to employers in a shortage all workers are critical hoblitzell said bob boselli the owner of vail t shirt company vail style generation vail and the covered bridge store as well as a number of businesses in aspen relies heavily on these j 1 visa holders the international j 1 work and travel program makes up around 80 of our overall seasonal employee base boselli wrote in an email to the vail daily for more than 25 years we ve recruited university students from across the globe through this program the boselli family has operated retail stores in vail with additional locations in beaver creek aspen and snowmass for over 40 years and our company would not exist without the j 1 program vail resorts one of the county s largest employers according to its website hires hundreds of j 1 student visas each year john plack the senior communications manager for vail and beaver creek did not say how many j 1 visas the two resorts employ in a typical season writing in an email that each winter season is different and we re very excited to be welcoming back international employees to both vail mountain and beaver creek resort plack added that the resort s international employees bring great energy and enthusiasm and they help round out a wonderful workforce at these two destination resorts in addition to filling a significant need in the labor market they also bring an added value to the local resorts they bring value to an area s workforce both from the diversity they bring to an organization and what that means for the education and cultural experience of existing staff as well as the ability of an organization to attract workers who speak a different language and have a different cultural knowledge and experience which can be valuable to serving international guests hoblitzell said however this year even though the ban on j 1 visas has been lifted vaccine requirements and covid 19 challenges including the emergence of new variants have created certain limitations for the program boselli said covid 19 mandates have made this year s process very challenging he said adding that these include the government s mandates on which vaccines are required and remaining holds on certain countries ski resorts in colorado won t operate at normal capacities this season without our international j 1 staff these j 1 students are a vital part of our success boselli said balancing competing housing needs employers have long sought a variety of solutions to employee housing like the timber ridge apartments in vail which are owned by the town and leased to both individuals and business to fulfill seasonal workforce needs vail daily archive of course a significant part of the challenge in getting not only the j 1 employees but all seasonal employees to eagle county this winter season is housing while many employers have been proactive in securing workforce housing it s still clearly not enough i see the things online and i know how hard it is for anyone to find housing right now and i think it s exaggerated or it s that much harder for someone coming for four months instead of six or six months instead of 12 romer said as you move down to the shorter lease period it s even harder on the housing side we just don t have nearly enough housing inventory this challenge that seasonal employees need shorter leases could be perceived as at direct odds with the need for long term local employee housing both are needed and yet neither need is being fulfilled currently the housing crunch that exists and the other factors that are challenges for seasonal workers and our year round community with the shift from long term to short term rentals these things impact everybody romer said striking a balance between all the housing needs is a difficult challenge and it is not a new one either what the right balance of housing should be has long been a challenge to define in vail and other mountain communities said vail town manager scott robson opinions on the issue often vary greatly depending on an individuals personal experience and perspective what most do agree on is that finding a solution will require everyone coming together housing has clearly become one of the primary focus areas for the vail community and town council and therefore the town will continue to invest in a diverse array of housing stock for both year round and seasonal residents robson said to do so it will take partnerships with the municipality employers and many public and private entities to support housing the community s workforce the role of employers especially will be critically important with the idea of an employee housing shortage or an employer housing shortage a lot of employers are being proactive with that but it s near impossible to house all the seasonal workforce that we need in this community through the employer community they have a role to play employers romer said but we as a community have a role as well the town of vail has a unique vantage point in the housing crisis serving as both an employer and a policymaker obviously the town s seasonal workforce is an important part of the housing plans recognizing that many of these employees arrive in our community at a time when finding housing is the most challenging said krista miller the town s director of human resources the town has designated many of its own rental units for our internal seasonal workforce for its employees the town has 54 units for 62 town employees currently about 50 are rented to seasonal employees said the town s communications director suzanne silverthorn miller added that the town also supports the community seasonal workforce with the town owned timber ridge apartments which are leased to both individuals and businesses boselli is one of those employers that has been proactive in the solution my company set a goal four years ago to purchase enough real estate in east vail west vail and avon that would fulfill our seasonal employee housing needs for our stores in vail and beaver creek he said we currently have enough beds to offer housing to all of our seasonal staff vail resorts is another that has workforce housing available locally for both vail mountain and beaver creek resort according to plack those slots are associated with the role and the department and are used to house both domestic and international employees however there still isn t enough inventory for all its employees on its website vail resorts states that employee housing is extremely limited and usually only offered to first year employees and does not signify which departments and roles are made a priority for this housing the resort also warns that because housing fills up rapidly it s not available to all employees it has a page with local resources for employees to utilize in finding housing as with all housing challenges there s no simple solution however going forward romer hopes that solutions will include in addition to ongoing conversations about housing for long term employees the seasonal workforce and j 1 visa holders i think it s an essential part of our workforce romer

the company had a positive phase 3 trial for its therapy to fight a rare genetic skin disease krystal biotech krys 3 51 saw its shares climb more than 77 this week according to data provided by s p global market intelligence the stock was only at 39 81 at friday s close then opened at 91 20 on monday and climbed to as high as 102 99 while the stock has come down quite a bit on thursday it was still trading as high as 73 per share the stock s 52 week low is 38 86 what happened the clinical stage gene therapy company s stock got its bounce when krystal announced on monday that its lead program vyjuvek had gone through its successful phase 3 trial to treat dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa deb a rare inherited disease because of a defective gene deb patients skin becomes extremely fragile and blisters and tears from minor friction or trauma usually on the hands elbows and knees deb patients deal with frequent skin infections from open wounds and are at an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma in the trial the company said vyjuvek led to complete wound healing in 67 of the 31 subjects by six months krystal said the drug was well tolerated with no serious side effects the company added it was on track to submit a biologics license application bla with the food and drug administration in the first half of next year all of this was music to investors ears the company which had no revenue in its most recent third quarter report now has a clear path to cashing in and the market reacted however the enthusiasm regarding the stock waned a bit when the trial announcement was followed up by the news that the company was selling 200 million worth of stock to raise cash thus diluting the stock s value for current stockholders now what biotech stocks particularly clinical stage biotech stocks present a big risk reward opportunity but now krystal has something more concrete for investors to be excited about it s not just that vyjuvek has been shown to be effective in trials it s that the company s platform is unique in several ways according to krystal the therapy is the first topical gene therapy and it s the first gene therapy that can be repeated without triggering an immune response the reason for that is the company has been able to reconfigure the hsv 1 virus that causes herpes and use it as a delivery system because the herpes virus is so common to humans the re engineered virus using a noninfectious version doesn t cause immune reactions deb is rare affecting only between 11 and 19 children per 1 million live births in the united states according to a 2016 report in jama dermatology published by the american medical association however the success of krystal s hsv 1 delivery system is also being tested against cystic fibrosis and could also be used as an aesthetic treatment both of which would be more profitable for krystal the company is already testing its delivery system to see if it could be used to restore collagen and elastin proteins as their production declines with age

washington us president joe biden on thursday laid out his strategy to fight the omicron and delta coronavirus variants over the winter including free and insurer funded at home covid 19 testing and new requirements for international travellers the us government will require private health insurers to reimburse their 150 million customers for 100 per cent of the cost of over the counter at home covid 19 tests administration officials said and make 50 million more tests available free through rural clinics and health centers for the uninsured reimbursement for tests however will not kick in until january missing the crucial holiday period when many families and groups gather indoors we re going to fight this variant with science and speed not chaos and confusion biden said at the national institutes of health in maryland while warning that infections will rise this winter the actions i m announcing are ones that all americans can rally behind and should unite us in the fight against covid 19 he said the administration is urging all eligible americans to get vaccinated or booster shots to fight omicron which is spreading quickly around the world and will increase family vaccination sites and expand availability at pharmacies less than 60 per cent of the us population or 196 million people have been fully vaccinated one of the lowest rates among wealthy nations the administration says another 100 million are eligible for boosters the centres for disease control and prevention said all vaccinated adults should get a booster in light of waning protection over time and the emergence of omicron the united states also plans to require inbound international passengers to be tested for covid 19 within one day of departure regardless of vaccination status mask requirements on airplanes trains and public transportation vehicles will be extended to march 18 the new plan will also improve care for those who get covid 19 tripling the number of surge response teams that provide extra staff at hospitals that are overrun with patients to 60 from its current level biden said it will speed more medications recommended by real doctors not conspiracy theorists he added the efforts to expand testing and shots come as the world faces new threats from the omicron variant and the united states confronts a heavily entrenched politically fueled anti vaccination culture fears about the variant have pounded financial markets and created doubts about the speed of the global economic recovery as the pandemic rages on the white house is considering further restrictions and ways to boost testing and vaccinations that will depend on the severity of the variant white house press secretary jen psaki said insurers seek clarity psaki told reporters earlier on thursday that the biden administration would lay out details on whether private health insurance companies will get government money to reimburse customers for over the counter tests when it releases guidance on the issue by january 15 however a white house official late on thursday said the government will not reimburse private health insurers for the cost of at home tests additional free tests at healthcare clinics should be available as soon as this month psaki said the largest us employer based health insurers include cigna corp unitedhealth group and cvs health corp currently insurers are reimbursed a set amount by the government for most medically necessary covid 19 tests performed in labs and medical offices kristine grow spokesperson for insurance industry lobby ahip said the industry is working with the administration to make sure the impact of any testing plan is fully understood areas of concern include price gouging on these tests higher premiums and clear rules and guidance for implementation she said morningstar analyst julie utterback said she views the governments plan as a shift in the potential site of testing rather than a significant increase in costs for health insurers assuming at home tests can be accepted as valid to control the spread of the virus from a policy perspective i see the logic in trying to keep infected people at home instead of forcing them to interact with people outside their household when they are experiencing symptoms utterback said evercore isi analyst michael newshel said the strategy could come at a notable cost for health insurers with the coverage requirement possibly lasting through the first half of the year
disney provides new numbers for its on demand revenue walt disney s dis 2 68 annual report provides some additional details about how its direct to consumer streaming services generate revenue one area that disney experimented more with over the past year was its premier access premium video on demand offering which allows disney subscribers to watch some films the same day disney releases them in theaters disney says subscribers paid 933 million for its on demand releases last year which also include ufc pay per view ppv events on espn that s a 70 increase from the year before but investors need more context to determine whether they should be happy with that result how much is premier access bringing in disney s reported revenue from those on demand purchases was 933 million last year and 550 million the year before disney released four films via premier access in fiscal 2021 raya and the last dragon cruella black widow and jungle cruise it released just one film mulan in 2020 which didn t receive a theatrical release in many major markets including the united states disney also says it had 13 ufc events in 2021 versus 11 in 2020 a significant amount of revenue may actually be coming from ufc pay per view buys in 2020 ufc 246 featuring conor mcgregor and donald cerrone topped 1 million ppv buys on espn that generated over 65 million in revenue ufc 249 reportedly drew 700 000 buys on espn generating over 45 million espn had nine other events that year in 2021 disney raised the price for ufc ppv events by 5 and sold two extra events to make up for the one it missed in 2020 that included another mcgregor fight which topped 1 2 million buys generating 84 million in revenue ufc ppv could ve easily topped 300 million in revenue for disney in 2021 if the other 12 events averaged just 250 000 buys so the four premier access film releases in 2021 may have only generated an average of around 150 million in additional revenue for disney mulan may have generated more but demand was skewed as more consumers were stuck at home amid the pandemic and theaters weren t showing the film is that good enough to keep up releases the good thing about premier access releases is that disney gets to keep 100 of the revenue generated from on demand sales when it releases a film in theaters it receives about 60 of domestic box office revenue and around 40 of international ticket sales here s how the four premier access films performed in theaters title domestic gross in millions international gross in millions estimated take in millions raya and the last dragon 54 7 75 6 63 1 cruella 86 1 147 2 110 5 black widow 183 7 196 188 6 jungle cruise 117 102 4 111 2 as you can see box office revenue is pretty muted across the board compared to the pre pandemic billion dollar box office hits disney was used to in fact disney likely generated more net revenue from premier access than box office sales for the four films the question is whether premier access is the reason for the muted demand the best way to analyze this is to look at its marvel releases black widow shang chi and the legend of the ten rings and eternals the latter two were theater only releases in september and november black widow had a stronger opening weekend in the u s than did subsequent theater only marvel releases shang chi did however go on to outperform black widow in theaters and it s still selling a few million dollars worth of tickets every weekend eternals is set to surpass black widow ticket sales as well just four weeks after its release but black widow s additional revenue from premier access means it likely generated more net revenue for disney than either of the other marvel releases so while the release strategy may have muted demand at the box office slightly disney likely still saw a net benefit furthermore die hard fans still showed up in the theaters for opening weekend generating valuable buzz for the film there s an additional wild card for premier access it requires a disney subscription so the extent to which it drives new signups or retains existing subscribers is also a net benefit for the media company during the company s fourth quarter earnings call ceo bob chapek said he plans to remain flexible with disney s film release strategy in 2022 bigger action films that play well on the big screen like the marvel series are more likely to go exclusively to theaters while family films may perform better with the hybrid release we re going to do what s best for our shareholders ultimately he said and nobody has better insights into the performance of each film release than him and his team but it looks like premier access can still provide value in 2022 and beyond

advertisement the covid 19 pandemic has driven americans to hoard 1 6 trillion in excess savings amidst ongoing fears of an economic crisis despite the fact that experts are warning that the value of these rainy day funds are being slashed by surging inflation rates american households would not have put away the huge sum had the covid 19 crisis not changed the world over the last two years according to the federal reserve bank of new york the funds are far more than the usual three to six months of emergency savings financial advisors typically recommend saving rates have dipped to 2019 levels following four consecutive quarters of record high amounts of savings due to americans hoarding their savings money managers financial advisers and economists say according to the wall street journal but they forsee more cash stockpiling in the immediate future with the omicron variant likely to trigger americans to save yet more of their cash over fears of possible future chaos to make matters worse annual inflation rates in the united states have steadily increased since january 2021 and through august 2021 starting at just 1 4 percent in january 2021 all the way to 5 percent in august 2021 it has since surged to 6 1 per cent in october the most recent figure available and the highest level since 1990 this chart shows the percentage of disposable income saved by americans each month with the rate spiking close to 35 per cent as covid hit us shores the blue line on this chart from the bureau of economic analysis shows the amount of cash americans saved in billions of dollars each month with a covid spike in 2020 the red line on the right shows the amount economists think americans would have saved had it not been for the appearance of the virus pictured changes in inflation between october 2020 and october 2021 showing the cahnges in various regions of the us i have been one of the more optimistic ones but with this new variant now on the horizon i think we re in for more of the same of what we ve seen over the last six months says wendy edelberg director of the hamilton project at the brookings institution in reality economists say hoarding one s savings can actually hurt a persons long term finances if inflation continues to increase while causing bigger issues for the economy of which consumer spending accounts for over two thirds of its gross domestic product the wall street journal reports america s money hoarding began at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as the government issued three rounds of stimulus checks to qualified individuals as the pandemic nears it s second year and with no end in sign as the specter of the omicron variant continues to loom large americans many of whom have been largely housebound since the pandemic s onset have remained thriftier than ever jerome powell pictured speaks after biden announced that he will serve a second term as the federal reserve chair at the white house on november 22 2021 the result has been the highest personal savings rate since world war ii thanks in part to rising incomes and a healthy labor market according to the journal we see a lot of folks sitting on an incredibly high savings amount and it s really just a fear factor says nina o neal partner and investment adviser with aim advisors in 2021 they kind of felt like things were getting better we re going to get better from the pandemic and they did but also they didn t it is sort of like the same sideways winding road from last year and so i think people started to spend a little bit more but they continue to hold that cash however there has been a slight uptick in spending in recent months as experts say americans have started to use more credit cards to spend their money on smaller items with 27 percent of us consumers saying in october they had applied for a credit card over the last 12 months and while credit card balances have remained below pre pandemic levels the amount increased 17 billion to 800 billion in the third quarter of 2021 with the same sized increase in the second quarter according to the federal reserve bank of new york americans between the ages of 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 currently make up the lions share of the credit card debt and consumer spending on bigger purchases spiked 2 2 percent in october charlotte geletka managing partner and owner at the financial advisory firm silver penny financial planning outlined the disadvantages of hoarding savings as money in the bank only loses value geletka added that on the other hand cash affords people flexibility and is easier to access in the event of a personal financial crisis geletka told the journal that she recommends her clients to split their funds by putting one portion of their savings in the stock market while keeping the other liquid as in cash for easy access should an emergency arise meanwhile president joe biden recently said reversing rampant inflation is a top priority after cost of living increased to 6 2 percent its highest level in 31 years last month biden announced that jerome powell will serve a second term as the federal reserve chair

before the coronavirus pandemic before shelter in place orders there was the campus safe space students claimed that they needed protection from perceived threats to their emotional well being college administrators were only too happy to comply building up a vast edifice of services to respond to studentsâ alleged emotional trauma last year yale university created a safe space that will set the industry standard for years to come call it the college woke spa though its official title is the good life center featuring a sandbox essential oils massage and mental health workshops the center unites the most powerful forces in higher education today the feminization of the university therapeutic culture identity politics and the vast student services bureaucracy while other colleges may not yet have created as richly endowed a therapeutic space as the good life center theyâ re all being transformed by the currents that gave it birth currents visible even in the reaction to the coronavirus outbreak â i donâ t know anyone who hasnâ t had therapy itâ s a big culture on campus â says a rosy cheeked undergraduate in a pink sweatshirt she is nestled in a couch in the subsidized coffee shop adjacent to yaleâ s good life center where students can sip sustainably sourced espresso and 3 tea lattes â ninety percent of the people i know have at least tried â for every 20 of her friends this sophomore estimates four have bipolar disorderâ as does she she says another young woman scanning her computer at a sunlit table in the cafã says that all her friends â struggle with mental health here we talk a lot about therapy approaches to improve our mental health versus how much is out of your control like hormonal imbalances â yaleâ s dorm counselors readily refer freshmen to treatment she says because most have been in treatment themselves indeed they are selected because they have had an â adversity experienceâ at yale she asserts such voices represent what is universally deemed a mental health crisis on college campuses more than one in three students report having a mental health disorder student use of therapy nationally rose almost 40 percent from 2009 to 2015 while enrollment increased by only 5 percent according to the center for collegiate mental health at pennsylvania state university at smaller colleges 40 percent or more of the student body has gone for treatment at yale over 50 percent of undergraduates seek therapy yale psychology professor laurie santos created the good life center in response to this alleged mental health crisis she had just taught what is billed as the most popular course in yaleâ s history â psychology and the good life â which aimed to arm students with â scientifically validatedâ techniques for overcoming emotional distress and â living a more satisfying life â the course presented the findings of positive psychology a recent subfield that examines what makes humans happy rather than what makes them miserable â psychology and the good lifeâ was not just a disinterested overview however it was a semester long exercise in self help students were assigned better mental health practicesâ getting more sleep one week exercising a few minutes a day another meditating during the next week keeping a gratitude journal the following week for the final exam students designed their own personalized self help the â hack yoâ self project â the courseâ s target audience was by its own account in desperate need of emotional rescue â a lot of us are anxious stressed unhappy numb â a female freshman told the new york times â the fact that a class like this has such large interest speaks to how tired students are of numbing their emotionsâ both positive and negativeâ so they can focus on their work the next step the next accomplishment â the size of the turnout itself was therapeutic â being able to see that an entire giant concert hall full of people is struggling alongside you is huge â another student told the yale daily news apparently being a yale student was a massive burdenâ something that would have astounded yaleâ s legendary teachers such as art historian vincent scully and literary critic harold bloom who conveyed to students the excitement they should feel before the lure of beauty and knowledge the questions of what leads to happiness and how we should conduct our lives have deep philosophical roots in the west stretching back to the pre socratics the stoics and epicureans sought to inculcate in their followers a mental outlook that would steel them against fate and the fear of death only a virtuous life growing out of settled habits of character the ancients counseled led to happiness aristotle posited that the use of reason to attain truth would bring fulfillment since reason was manâ s highest faculty and truth was the telos of human existence the syllabus for â psychology and the good lifeâ contained no hint of this rich tradition instead it was relentlessly presentist consisting of online ted talks news articles on positive psychology lecture videos from other psychology courses short research papers and chapters from recent nonfiction books like cass sunstein and richard thalerâ s nudge the final recommended reading was dr seussâ s oh the places youâ ll go to get students â pumpedâ for each lecture santos played the black eyed peasâ â i gotta feelingâ â i gotta feeling that tonight that tonight that tonightâ s gonna be a good good good good good good good good good good good good good good goodâ platoâ s symposium this wasnâ t nearly a quarter of yaleâ s undergraduates signed up for â psychology and the good life â whose popularity may have been boosted by rumors of undemanding grading expectations courses that met at the same time experienced a sharp drop in enrollment a decision was taken not to reoffer the â good lifeâ course as it happened however santos had precious real estate at her disposal since she leads silliman college one of yaleâ s 14 undergraduate residential communities so she converted four rooms at the top of a landing in silliman into the good life center to â promote a campus culture that values wellness as a community responsibility â as the centerâ s mission statement reads or in less bureaucratic terms to â spread good vibes â as the glc website puts it a telling thing happened in the transition from â psychology and the good lifeâ to the good life center the project took on an overtly feminized new age cast the first thing a visitor encounters on the fourth floor landing of the glc is a mason jar containing folded paper slips and the suggestion to take or leave a message of support a suggestion to leave oneâ s sense of irony behind would have been equally appropriate the messages on the top three paper slips written in variously colored felt tip pins were â this too shall passâ â breathe 1 2 3 exhale that wasnâ t that hard right keep going â â place a hand over your heart take a deep breath and repeat â iâ m not aloneâ â i can do thisâ take time for yourself today you deserve it â such hallmark card sentiments are posted on blackboards whiteboards easels and fabric canvases throughout the center â you got this â â i am strong i am brave i am kind i am beautiful â â you is smart you is kind you is importantâ one can only conclude that yale students are so desperate for affirmation that they are willing to believe that a message written by an unknown sender to no one in particular applies to them such cheaply bought self esteem is a universe apart from what jonathan edwards say would have imbibed as a student at yale in 1716 before going on to lead the first great awakening with sermons about sin and an angry god it is equally remote from what generations of later yale matriculants would have encountered in their studies of classical languages science logic and mathematics yaleâ s founders and subsequent leaders would have been puzzled by the books in the glcâ s â studyâ as well lined up on a bookshelf among specially designed bottles of bubble solution â inhale deeply exhale bubbles â invites an adjacent sign they seem to have been imported from the inspirational reading section of an airport newsstand titles include 50 ways to feel happy aimed at seven to 11 year olds per the publisher your hidden superpowers positivity how to be happier healthier smarter and more prosperous and christopher robin the little book of pooh isms actually reading a a milne would expose students to one of the greatest voices of british childrenâ s literature whose gently ironic insights into human foibles and crystalline style belong squarely in the magnificent british novel tradition but christopher robin the little book of pooh isms is just another shallow self help book on to the sandbox where stressed out yalies can use tiny wooden rakes to rearrange fine white sand in a large circular receptacle sunk into the middle of the room talking is discouraged outside light filters through muslin curtains a white noise machine and an electrified wall fountain contribute to the soothing effect of the roomâ s moss green color scheme sleep masks hang on the wall apache blankets and yoga pads further beckon toward sleep a barista on a break from drawing cappuccinos in the adjacent coffee shop says that students frequent the sandbox at night â to calm down after a long dayâ â as if they were stock traders coming off a nasty rout on wall street yaleâ s woke spa also offers programmed activities to relieve student anxiety students can attend a four week koru mindfulness course that helps participants be â kinderâ to themselves a mental health empowerment series to â get in touch withâ their values a â combined vinyasa restorative yoga flow â massage mondays and a puppy study break with kiwi the wellness pup students can make their â very own meditation bracelet with a variety of beautiful beads â identity politics and the therapeutic agenda are intimately related at yale and elsewhere the good life center hosts a â wellness study breakâ exclusively for yaleâ s â pocsâ people of color where minority students can â come together and relax make some essential oils sip on some smoothies and enjoy the diy trail mix bar â yale like other schools had not previously been deficient in opportunities to self segregate the glc mission is perfectly encapsulated in a consumer survey on the centerâ s website do you â feel safe and supported at the glc â do you â come to the glc as a refuge â do the â aesthetics and atmosphere of the glcâ make you â feel calmer and less anxious â it asks poll respondents could win â cool wellness prizesâ a mandala travel yoga mat and an essential oil diffuser and oils here in a nutshell is the essence of the college woke spa an aesthetic and worldview built predominantly around what have been largely female interests concerns and fears the glcâ s self esteem bromides the self compassion ethic the yoga and mindfulness sessionsâ all would be at home in a beverly hills â healing space â where trophy wives can â center themselves in an atmosphere of calm â a visitor keeps expecting to encounter crystals and star charts this ethos characterizes the wellness crusade throughout academia the spring 2020 â mindfulness menuâ at bucknell university offers diy body scrubs diy eye masks diy lotion and diy chapsticks as part of â self care saturdays â beloit collegeâ s â de stress festâ features diy tea making as well as the inevitable therapy dogs senior andrew collins reports that â no manâ not even a beloit manâ would let himself be caught dead at a tea making â hamilton college students can soothe themselves in a massage chair under a weighted blanket a harvard counseling office suggested â self calming and self recharging activities â such as watch the sun rise or set â laugh â read a book of my favorite cartoons â listen to a book on tape cd â share a hug with a loved one â enjoy a long warm bath or shower â create a collage representing â the real me â â attend a support group underneath the essential oils and yoga mats the woke spa mental wellness crusade is accomplishing an even more profound transformation of university life the assumption that emotional threat and danger lie just beyond the spa is the product of an increasingly female dominated student body faculty and administration that assumption is undermining traditional academic values of rational discourse argumentation and free speech for the last 40 years men have been an underrepresented minority in higher education reports american enterprise institute scholar mark perry since 1982 females earned nearly 14 million more college degrees than men colleges began a â desperateâ search for women faculty in the 1970s that eroded the â intellectual rigor of elite higher education in the u s â says camille paglia the feminist professor and author â due to that sudden influx academeâ s entire internal culture changed â she says as the female presence has grown so have claims of a crisis of collegiate mental health nationally about two thirds of the students who sought treatment for mental health disorders in the 2018â 19 academic year were female according to the center for collegiate mental health at yale therapy use is heavily female and lgbtq according to students â there are few straight men using therapy â one self identified â queerâ girl in the glc said â itâ s stigmatized for straight cis men almost all my friends who go to therapy identify as gay or trans â the top conditions for which students seek treatmentâ anxiety and depressionâ are quintessentially female maladies on a widely used psychological typology of five major personality traits females on average score higher than males on â neuroticism â characterized by a susceptibility to stress and anxiety and by pronounced mood swings bucknell universityâ s counseling and student development center promotes zen meditation as an antidote to classic features of a neurotic personality stress fears self doubt anxiety and depressive symptoms â nationally about two thirds of students who sought treatment for mental health disorders were female â the counselors and therapists from whom these anxious students seek treatment are themselves overwhelmingly female harvardâ s counseling and mental health services department is nearly three to one female to male in its staffing fifteen percent of the 33 members of williams collegeâ s student health and wellness are male the psychology profession is dominated by females in the 2016â 17 academic year females received 78 percent of all bachelorâ s degrees in psychology ph d s were similarly lopsided at yale psychology does not even show up among the top ten most popular majors for male undergraduates for females it is the fourth most popular degree from 1991 to 2003 the american psychological association had 11 male presidents and two female presidents since 2004 it has had nine female presidents and seven male presidents as the sex balance shifted the nature of the apaâ s concerns became more political the current president a woman helped develop the apaâ s multicultural guidelines and chaired the apa task force on the world congress against racism report the previous president also a female sought to instruct the field about the myths of meritocracy and the â otheringâ of low income people in 2019 the apa defined traditional masculinity as a psychological disorder male stoicism self reliance and competitiveness injure men as well as society announced the apaâ s guidelines for psychological practice with boys and men one of the clearest markers of the masculinist disorder is an unwillingness to seek treatment for it the less males go to therapy the more they prove their psychological infirmity according to the apa effort must be trained on stamping out the ethic of self sufficiency and replacing it with an ethic of â self compassionâ and â self care â it is no surprise that males tend to shun this particular helping profession the stampede of an increasingly female student body into an overwhelmingly female mental health bureaucracy is creating service bottlenecks but efforts to ensure that students use their free therapy more responsibly produce a sharp backlash thanks to studentsâ consumerist self conception the vice president of campus life and inclusive excellence at american university sent a supplicating e mail to auâ s undergrads asking them to keep their mental health appointments rather than skipping out without notice thirty one percent of student therapy clients at the university donâ t show up for at least one of their sessions resulting in the equivalent of five unannounced no shows a day or one fifth of all counseling center appointments the â emotional well being of our communityâ is jeopardized by such behavior pled the vice president the student body did not take such a rebuke lying down â the e mail seems to be an unprompted episode of the university telling students what they are doing wrong â responded the student government executive board as reported by inside higher education obviously the administration had forgotten its place which was to cater to student whim the most hurtful thing about the vice presidentâ s request was the use of data statistics are just so unfeeling the administrationâ s e mail â seems to shift the blame for auâ s inadequate mental health resources onto students by listing statistics which we find an inherently limited approach â complained the executive board â simple metrics inadequately capture the context and personal circumstances of every individual student â students on other campuses backed up the outraged american university sufferers â the blame or responsibility should never be on the student especially a mentally ill student â a student advocate at brown university told inside higher education if a student doesnâ t show up to a counseling appointment itâ s the universityâ s responsibility to â work out the logistics â she said even if administrators remain mum about irresponsible student behavior they will still get blasted if they attempt to ration their finite resources at williams demand for therapy reached an all time high this school yearâ up 15 percent to 18 percentâ with a wait list of up to 55 students for appointments the school proposed decreasing therapy sessions from 45 minutes to 30 to accommodate growing demand while keeping uncapped the number of appointments students could have this reform was unacceptable â you could be in the middle of a session when something is triggered that you couldnâ t have prepared for and then you need that extra 15 minutes to talk through it you canâ t plan for those things â a trans student told the williams record another remedy for the wait list was also panned free video counseling sessions all year round in addition to unlimited text messaging with an off site therapist too impersonal a journalism student told the campus newspaper some students â donâ t like that they canâ t really establish a relationship with their therapist â of course free unlimited therapy of any sort is an unheard of luxury off campus at some schools students are instituting additional therapy resources themselves william and mary senior anu goel spearheaded the creation of safe spaces in the schoolâ s dormitories so that students could have their â crisesâ right where they live rather than having to â runâ to the counseling center or having to make an appointment â part of being in a crisis is that you canâ t predict that iâ ll be in a crisis in a week â when your counseling may be scheduled goel told the collegiate mental health innovation council â the crisis youâ re having now can get worse or it could become a different crisis â dormitory safe spaces send the message to students â this is where youâ ll have a lot of your crisesâ â in your â own home â goel said what do these incessant â crisesâ look like the chronicle of higher education collected some student reports â itâ s very physical for me it starts in my chest and then i kind of get short of breath maybe i get the chills a lot when i get anxiety itâ s hard for me to listen or understand i think itâ s really important to normalize the conversation around taking a day off for your mental health just as you would for your physical health â reported carly a student at emerson college â i panicked during a routine test i forgot to take my medication and i got the â deer in the headlightsâ feeling it was horrifying anxiety is not brought on just because we didnâ t study hard enough i had a teacher tell me that it boiled my blood â said kelly from pensacola state college a victorian neurasthenic would recognize these feelings socrates teaching his disciples history and art collection alamy stock photo mental health administrators have the same imperialistic ambitions as the rest of the student services bureaucracy they seek to extend their reach to the entire campus population through an open ended definition of â wellness â williamsâ s integrative wellbeing services for example â reimaginesâ mental health services to encompass â all students â thereâ s a service for everyone whether providing â healthy coping and self care skills â integrating â identities of all kinds â or offering an â ever expanding array of psychoeducational workshops groups special events and outreach activities â uwell at the university of wisconsin madison is a â collaborative effort to advance the well being of the entire campus community â it seeks â equitable outcomesâ through focusing on â safetyâ from physical and psychological harm uwell defines well being as an â active pursuit to understand and fulfill individual human needs â thus allowing people to â flourish and realize their full potential â not a word about the acquisition of knowledge as a route to realizing oneâ s potential george mason university has a chief well being officer who also directs the center for the advancement of well being well being at george mason is about social justice as well as about â building a life of vitality purpose resilience and engagement â the chief well being officer told the chronicle of higher education all those values require therapeutic assistance indeed everything that a student might contemplate doing has a mental health implication and a potential bureaucratic fix yaleâ s good life center sent out a university wide query in december 2019 asking whether students needed â guidance on riding the wave of uncertainty that winter break can bring â being in school creates anxiety so does being out of school students stressed out over the upcoming vacation could consult the studentâ s guide to mentally and mindfully surviving winter break or smart moves students can make over winter break suggested the glc neither of these guides mentioned reading a great book to overcome the boredom that students were predicted to experience without dorm organized pizza and movie nights conversation contains many mental health landmines making it too a fertile target for bureaucratic intervention harvard created 700 flash cards to guide student conversation in â structured settings â facilitators from the harvard administration would use the cards to â provide boundaries interventions and assistance for ensuring a safe and supportive context for communicationâ about â our thoughts and feelings â columbiaâ s vice president for student life organizes campus conversations where students â engage with issues of race and identityâ pursuant to a detailed manual drawn up by columbiaâ s race ethnicity and inclusion task force parents represent an exciting new growth opportunity the director of family engagement at barnard college instructs parents on how to help their children cope emotionally in college without parental intercession parents should write a â scriptâ that their student can use to complain to a professor about a bad grade suggested the family engagement director in the new york times the parent should also tell the student to transcribe the script into his phone or a readily accessible notebook to be read at the crucial moment apparently no step of any interaction may be reliably executed without a bureaucratic assist the irony of an administrative overseer tasked with detaching students from their parents was lost on the family engagement director given the overlap between the campus mental health and social justice bureaucracies it was inevitable that the election of donald trump to the presidency in 2016 would produce an explosion of mental health interventions at virginia tech the director of the intercultural engagement center wrote to students â i want you to hear clearly that you are loved you deserve wellness you deserve to thrive â the director recommended â spacesâ where students could grieve and receive counseling reported campus reform the vice chancellor for student affairs at the university of massachusetts boston announced the availability of counseling throughout the election week and a â coping and balanceâ workshop where students could play with â doggo the therapy dog â should trump be reelected this november the resulting mental health emergency could blow out the entire campus ecosystem the feminization of the university and the prominence of therapeutic culture have created a perfect storm directed at free speech and reason in a recent survey of college students females were twice as likely as males to say that a controversial speaker should be canceled if the majority of students â feel emotionally unsafe or uncomfortable with the speakerâ s content â males by contrast were more likely to support a controversial invitation in the name of academic freedom and the advancement of knowledge the enormous shift in basic values on college campuses over the last 50 years cannot be understood without taking gender into account concluded psychology researcher zachary rausch on the psychology today website the real crisis in academia is not mental health it is the breakdown of universitiesâ understanding of their core mission all other alleged crises follow from this one education exists for one main purpose to pass on an inheritance of human achievement as the philosopher michael oakeshott explained yet faculty have lost the language for celebrating that inheritance they have gone mute or worse when it comes to articulating the splendors of western civilization college is not even about the promotion of happiness that is too utilitarian a goal knowledge is an end in itself but even were student happiness a legitimate matter for colleges to concern themselves with a therapeutic approach is the wrong way to cultivate it the surest route to happiness is a passion for something outside the self the only thing that kept bertrand russell from committing suicide during his adolescence was his desire to learn more math he recounts in his 1930 book the pursuit of happiness as an adult his â diminishing preoccupationâ with himself led to growing contentment â every external interest inspires some activity which so long as the interest remains alive is a complete preventive of ennui â he wrote j s mill who also grappled with depression agreed â the only chance is to treat not happiness but some end external to it as the purpose of life â mill wrote in his autobiography what better antidote to ennui than a university library a student therapy client in the good life center coffee shop merely gave a hollow laugh however when asked if reading great literature provides emotional solace â i donâ t think so â she responded bitterly â going through yale itâ s easier not to think deeply books make me feel sadder make me feel things which can lead to other things â remarkably this world weary cynic was herself an english major but yale like virtually every other american college has been busily deconstructing any claim to sublimity that english literature and other western art forms may have in 2017 the english department faculty changed the course requirements for the english major in response to a student petition claiming that requiring the reading of john milton and edmund spenser created a culture â especially hostile to students of color â in 2019 yaleâ s art history department canceled a wholly optional introduction to western art course for fears that it uncritically â privilegedâ western art no wonder then that the majority of yale students â probably donâ t feel that the great books are worth reading â as senior paul han puts it a reporter for the yale daily news backs han up â many yale students would reject the study of western civilization as the core feature of a college education on the grounds that it is oppressive â says sophomore valerie pavilonis the student services bureaucracy has rushed into this vacuum created by the facultyâ s abdication of its intellectual responsibility â administrators most of them without teaching experience no longer regard the faculty as central or even necessary â says camille paglia our civilization is engaged in an unprecedented experiment turning on its own accomplishments with shame and contempt american students growing up today are given reason to be proud of their heritage only if they have had that rare nonconforming teacher who still honors the past otherwise students are taught to see in the monuments of western thought and imagination a thinly veiled power grab they themselves are either oppressors or the oppressed either category spirit killing adults may not be giving children reason for enthusiasm and elation but they are giving them the â language of pathology â as a dean of arts and sciences at a southern university put it in a recent interview if students have not already learned to interpret their intellectual and spiritual malaise as a function of mental illness before arriving on campus the mental health and wellness bureaucracy awaits to teach them how seventy five thousand dollars a year is quite a price tag for self help coaching however the entire corpus of inspirational books in the good life centerâ s study could be had for a few hundred dollars interpreting them requires no scholarly expertise the universityâ s comparative advantage over all other institutions should be the promise of real knowledge but as the therapeutic culture has spread throughout the university the language of reason and evidence has been replaced by claims of emotional hurt in any controversy the person who can express the deepest outrage or injury wins the day as williams sociologist james nolan put it in a 2017 interview â i feel likeâ substitutes for rational argument the united states is undergoing a test of national character brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the shutdown of the global economy in response massive social upheaval including the breakdown of civil order is possible colleges could have prepared the young for the emotional stresses that lie ahead by immersing them in the great works of the past by reading oedipus rex king lear

in kamikatsu on the japanese island of shikoku officials have set up an agricultural cooperative whose members log on to computers daily to check the fluctuating prices of the produce that they grow then they go out and pick whatever is fetching the best price that day unusual yes but what s truly surprising about this cooperative is the average age of its members 70 in a country where lots of folks retire at 60 kamikatsu s residents are working well into their senior years and they re doing so not only to buoy retirement earnings but also to energize the local economy with nearly half of the town s residents 65 and older the government realized that there simply wasn t enough of a traditional workforce available to build or staff most typical industries kamikatsu shows in microcosm what japan and several other nations now face and what others soon will for decades demographers and economists have watched the world s fertility rate plunge as countries grew wealthier and more urban these days fertility rates in much of the industrialized world are far below replacement levels that is the number of kids that parents must have to replace themselves and adults who remain childless though the steepest declines happened first in wealthy countries like japan italy germany and spain even many developing countries have seen their fertility rates head downward the demographic shift brings extraordinary new challenges economists are increasingly recognizing that the struggles of places like japan and italy to extricate themselves from economic slumps that began in the 1990s result in part from extreme birth dearths that have shrunk labor pools dried up consumer spending and made businesses staffed by older employees more risk averse decades of government efforts to reverse birth dearth have largely proved fruitless yet one industrialized country resists the trend america true the american fertility rate has also fallen in recent decades but it has surged of late and now stands at population replacement level about 2 07 children per woman that reality has led to projections of vigorous u s economic growth in the next half century what s behind the relative fecundity a good guess is american style free market capitalism which despite recent economic woes encourages long term optimism taxes less of parents income and affords them easier mobility into and out of the job market than they d find in more regulated economies with more than one in five japanese 65 or older the government is encouraging citizens like tsuneko hariki of kamikatsu to work well past traditional retirement age ap photo katsumi kasahara news of a population bust might come as a surprise to many americans more than two centuries after english scholar thomas malthus argued that population growth exceeded the earth s ability to feed us the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man he wrote the media continue to warn us about impending environmental catastrophe and mass starvation caused by an exploding human population these malthusian alarms persist even though the last 200 years have proved malthus completely wrong as the world s population shot up starting around the time of the industrial revolution worldwide standards of living rose in tandem people proved far more resourceful in expanding food production tapping new veins of natural resources and inventing technologies to accommodate a growing population than malthus dreamed possible when mass deprivation has occurred in modern times it has invariably resulted from political tyranny and social chaos not from an inability to derive enough resources from the earth even as modern societies became more productive something else happened that contemporary malthusians have ignored fertility rates began declining in england the number fell from an average of nearly six children per woman in 1775 to 3 35 in 1875 to 1 96 today in germany the rate slumped from more than five children per woman in 1850 earlier data aren t available to 1 4 today in italy from nearly five children in 1850 to 1 3 today the trend long went unnoticed because rising life expectancy kept populations expanding but by the 1960s and 1970s more and more countries started seeing their birthrates sink beneath replacement levels today women in more than 60 countries ranging from austria canada and poland to japan singapore and south korea don t bear enough children to keep the population growing in a handful of countries women average just one child over a lifetime less than half the replacement rate the fertility drop in many less developed countries hasn t dipped below replacement levels yet but it s heading there fast over the last few decades mexico s rate went from nearly seven children per woman to 2 3 egypt s from just under seven to 2 72 and india s from nearly six to about 2 7 what s behind the dwindling births the chief factor is urbanization starting in the industrial revolution households began migrating from rural areas where johnny and sally could work on the family farm to help make ends meet to cities where the modern economy made kids a financial burden requiring them to spend more and more years in school to become employable nowadays it costs between 170 000 and 300 000 to raise a child through high school in the united states or europe and as urbanization has proceeded rapidly in many less developed countries some 50 percent of the world s population now live in cities fertility rates are collapsing everywhere also putting downward pressure on fertility rates is women s desire to work which has delayed childbearing and thus narrowed their fertility window the resulting population dive will be breathtaking japan s population projections say will decline by about 21 percent over the next four decades south korea s population which swelled by two thirds over the last 40 years is estimated to shrink by nearly 10 percent in the next 40 europe s population will peak in about five years and contract by between 6 and 16 percent by 2050 led by big declines in germany down 14 percent italy 6 percent poland 16 percent and russia 22 percent plunging birthrates will significantly slow population growth in many less developed countries as well mexico which more than doubled to 110 million people over the last 40 years could see flat population growth in the next 40 thailand s population which has grown by two thirds since 1970 will probably increase by no more than 6 percent by 2050 demographers are scrambling to adjust their population projections with little notice in the press in the early 1990s united nations researchers projected that the world s population would reach a maximum of 10 to 12 billion people up from about 6 7 billion today they subsequently scaled back that projection to 9 5 billion and then to about 9 1 adding however that it might be as low as 7 9 but the truth is that no one knows how this massive reversal will end the un demographers optimistically claim that the world s fertility rate currently at 2 6 children per woman will decline to replacement level and then stabilize but there s no clear reason for that to happen dozens of countries have seen their rates sink far lower in his book fewer ben wattenberg estimates that if the rate were to stop at 1 85 births per woman the world s population could shrink to 2 3 billion by the year 2300 shrinking fertility rates are producing rapidly graying societies more than 20 percent of japan s population for instance is now 65 or older and by 2050 that figure will rise to an astonishing 40 percent germany s over 65 population has increased from 15 percent in 1980 to 20 percent today and is expected to reach one third of the population by 2050 the less developed countries are again following the pattern china s 65 and over population will rise from 8 percent today to nearly a quarter of the country by 2050 mexico s will increase from 7 percent to 22 percent in fact say demographers we re seeing something unprecedented in less developed countries populations getting old before they get rich places like iran and north korea where fertility rates have nose dived below replacement levels are aging even before they develop modern institutions to participate in the global economy since economic growth depends strongly on an expanding population something poorly understood until recently aging countries economies face serious problems as late as the 1960s malthus influenced neoclassical economists believed that population growth reduced a society s standard of living by dividing up the same pie into smaller and smaller slices economists have gradually come to understand however that in industrialized countries population growth spurs productivity growth this is partly because economies of scale and specialization of labor boost output per worker studies have found that an industrialized country whose population doubles can expect per worker output to increase by 20 percent fertility decline may initially boost economic performance in less developed countries because having fewer children frees up resources but over time the effects of a shrinking population will prevail everywhere further economists have recognized that what s essential to wealth creation is human creativity not natural resources famously disputing the neo malthusian warnings of paul ehrlich author of the 1968 bestseller the population bomb economist julian simon called people the ultimate resource human beings he observed discovered how to convert oil coal and uranium which had sat worthless in the earth for eons into energy the most important economic effect of population size is the contribution of additional people to our stock of useful knowledge simon noted a growing population streams young workers into the labor market and they are usually the most daring entrepreneurial and even knowledgeable and inventive successive generations of workers in industrial countries have typically been more educated than their predecessors those who fear overpopulation share a simple insight people use resources harvard economist greg mankiw wrote in 1998 summing up the argument the rebuttal to this argument is equally simple people create resources japan shows what happens when a country begins losing its ultimate resource the country s economic misfortunes which began in the early 1990s after decades of post world war ii growth and have persisted with little relief often get blamed on the bursting of the country s real estate bubble government support of banks laden with bad loans and a highly regulated and uncompetitive domestic economy but as years went by and the japanese economy failed to cycle out of its downturn observers gradually realized that something even deeper afflicted it not enough people japan was stuck in the world s first low birth recession in the words of sociologist yamada masahiro the size of japan s workforce population peaked in the mid 1990s since then it has been shrinking and aging at matsushita electric industrial now panasonic for example the age of an average worker increased from 31 in 1980 to 41 in 2002 this graying has caused a significant slump in japan s once vaunted productivity older workers experience can be valuable but they tend to be less productive than their younger counterparts because they generally work fewer hours are more costly to employ since their seniority based wages are higher and aren t as adaptable or as up to date technologically japanese productivity as measured by worker output per hour once the envy of the industrialized world is now just 70 percent of america s and below the average of the 32 countries that make up the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd as aging japanese workers poured ever more of their earnings into retirement accounts consumer spending suffered too between 1990 and 2000 average japanese household spending actually shrank once adjusted for inflation while savings can lift an economy by providing more capital for business investment japanese producers viewed the increasing savings and the falling consumption as a sign of population stagnation and they stopped investing at home instead expanding in overseas markets like the u s japan s economic doldrums seem semipermanent japan s economy grew by a paltry 10 percent in the 1990s or less than 1 percent a year after averaging inflation adjusted gains of 40 to 50 percent per decade during the 1970s and 1980s after a brief growth spurt from 2004 through 2007 japan s economy has again contracted is smaller today than it was a decade ago and will contract in size from now on japanese economist akihiko matsutani predicts italy is another country where a rapidly falling birthrate has helped undermine prosperity like most industrialized countries italy enjoyed a brief postwar baby boom with its population increasing by 15 percent from 1950 to 1970 despite occasional political turmoil and the stereotype of italians as desultory workers the economy ignited in the mid 1970s just as the first members of this baby boom were entering their adult years and grew fourfold between 1975 and 1990 in 1987 the country celebrated the sorpasso its economy s surpassing of the united kingdom s in size but the celebration was short lived for the early 1970s were also the beginning of a steep and persistent drop in the italian fertility rate which declined by 50 percent in just 20 years to 1 2 births per woman by 1990 not coincidentally the nineties saw italy fall into a long economic funk the birth dearth cut into italy s working age population and severe labor shortages ensued when franco tosi a manufacturing company tried opening an auto parts operation in legnano in northern italy in 2001 it couldn t find enough workers to staff the 1 500 person effort even though the economy had been drifting for several years and huge crates of supplies sat unopened italian officials estimated that the country faced a labor shortage of 100 000 to 160 000 workers throughout its northern industrial region a social security crisis also looms presaging similar problems in other industrialized countries a full 22 percent of italy s population is now on a pension one of the highest rates in the world and the country devotes 15 percent of its gross domestic product to pensions more than any european nation retirement not only robs the workforce of needed laborers but also depresses household consumption because retirees almost invariably spend less than workers do in italy the average adult 35 or younger spends the equivalent of 2 813 per month on living expenses an adult 65 or older spends only 1 924 the situation will only worsen by 2020 italy will have just two working adults for every retiree the economic impact of fertility decline is most noticeable in japan and italy but other countries are feeling it too sweden was one of the first wealthy nations to see births fall below replacement level where they ve stayed for four decades except for a brief resurgence in the early nineties as sweden s population has aged 18 percent of swedes today are over 65 and retired compared with 14 percent in 1970 the country s economic performance has languished with its once formidable growth rate falling well below the oecd average over the last two decades entrepreneurialism which is highest among workers aged 25 to 34 studies show has especially suffered only one of sweden s 50 largest companies was created after 1970 the country now has the lowest self employment rate in the oecd and the number of entrepreneurs has declined by almost 9 percent since 1995 notes johan norberg a senior fellow at the cato institute faced with the inescapable math of fertility decline many countries have tried to address its economic consequences the most common policy change has been to reduce the size of the welfare state especially through adjustments to pension systems which aren t sustainable as the ratio of workers to pensioners declines the european trend until recently was for workers to retire earlier and earlier even as life expectancy grew the labor force participation rate of people aged 55 to 64 in the european union is just 48 percent compared with 64 percent in the united states countries with some of the gravest population problems also have the lowest rates of participation in italy for instance only 36 percent of 55 to 64 year olds are in the labor force austria france germany and italy are among the countries that have already pushed back their average retirement ages and cut benefits for early retirees sweden has gone further revamping its pension system to resemble the partly privatized chilean model which bases a worker s retirement income on the contributions he makes to his pension account over a lifetime french and italian workers initially fought some of these changes but eventually accepted them the reality of fertility decline and aging populations has become unavoidable in europe demographer paul hewitt has even argued that it heralds the end of the postwar welfare state unfortunately getting people to work longer won t solve countries fertility related economic difficulties even if it will have a modest impact on pension spending the japanese for instance already boast a nearly 70 percent labor force participation rate for those aged 55 to 64 but because of the country s extreme birth dearth by mid century the average japanese would need to work until age 83 to keep a constant ratio of workers to retirees europeans would need to work until their late seventies that s why some nations have also sought to lift fertility levels through natalist policies after france s population stopped growing in the 1930s the country introduced the first such program regional associations that promoted traditional family values and the vichy government kept the effort going even under nazi occupation the worldwide fertility decline that began in the 1970s sparked new natalist experiments sweden introduced paid parental leave of one year in 1980 and then extended it to 15 months in 1989 austria offered yearlong maternal leave paying a woman up to 40 percent of her working earnings other governments have tried tax credits and even direct payments to parents at best these policies have had only a short term marginal effect on fertility rates sweden s fertility rate bounced back after the country introduced its aggressive natalist policies rising from 1 65 in 1984 to 2 1 in 1991 but the rate then slumped rapidly falling to 1 5 by the decade s end norway which introduced similar policies saw its fertility rate stay almost flat over a 20 year period austria s rate never rose in response to its policies and currently hovers at 1 4 the problem many observers believe is that countries can t afford to offer sufficient benefits to get families to have more babies one might say that 1 000 a year is not anywhere near enough to raise a child writes wattenberg how about 10 000 or a million dollars sooner or later it would work too bad there is not that kind of money around increased immigration doesn t seem to be the answer for starters immigration has a very small impact on long term population trends even in countries with relatively high levels of migration in a recent national bureau of economic research study four economists estimated that immigration over the last 40 years in austria whose population is 10 percent foreign born has added less than 1 percentage point to the share of the population that is working age many immigrants it turns out quickly adopt the fertility patterns of their new country there are exceptions such as france where north african muslim immigrants have retained high fertility rates a study of birthrates among the french in the 1990s found that immigrant women from morocco tunisia and other north african countries had a fertility rate of nearly three but the unemployment rate among the foreign born in france is twice the rate of native born french by contrast in the u s the foreign born unemployment rate is roughly the same as the native born rate nor have the children of the foreign born in france proved successful at integrating into the french economy in many north african neighborhoods in france 30 to 40 percent of 15 to 24 year olds are unemployed seeking solutions a few policy experts have begun looking more closely at the united states after a big drop in the mid 1970s america s fertility rate bounced back and has remained relatively stable near replacement level a 30 year plus pattern that astounds european observers for a time demographers explained the difference between the u s and other industrialized countries by observing that america s population was more diverse with more recent immigrants who had more children but fertility levels among native born white americans also remain higher than among native born europeans and the u s s overall fertility outpaces that of other countries with a high percentage of foreign born residents demographers have also speculated that the higher fertility rate is a function of america s being a more religious country reasoning that those who engage in organized religious activity favor larger families one survey found 46 percent of americans attending religious services regularly compared with just 4 percent of japanese 7 percent of swedes and 16 percent of germans yet fertility rates have remained stable in the u s even as they have plummeted in religious fundamentalist countries like iran and jordan as well as in developing countries like mexico where rates of religious attendance remain higher than in america faced with these contradictions some scholars are now positing the distinctive nature of the u s economy and its labor market as a principal reason why americans are having so many kids in general women and couples are deterred from having children when the economic cost in the form of lower lifetime wages is too high wrote economists francesco billari josé antonio ortega and hans peter kohler in a 2006 study compared to other high income countries this cost is diminished by an american labor market that allows more flexible work hours and makes it easier to leave and then reenter the labor force in japan and many european countries with low fertility rates government policies and cultural pressures on businesses make it difficult and expensive to lay off workers instead promoting virtual guarantees of lifetime employment and early retirement that in turn makes it harder to rehire those who have taken a break from work women are left with a difficult choice either work full time continuously and remain childless or take time off to raise children and derail future employment opportunities in japan 70 percent of women who leave the workforce to have a child never return in low fertility countries like italy spain and greece 40 to 50 percent of women are no longer working by 50 over 70 percent of american women are still in the workforce at that age in america employers and workers have also proved far more innovative in designing work schemes that afford parents better reentry into the job market including flex time arrangements one study found that in over 30 percent of families in america in which both parents work one parent is not working the traditional nine to five schedule some countries have tried to compensate for rigid labor markets by enforcing parental leave policies that require companies to rehire mothers and occasionally fathers who ve taken time off to have a child and by providing parents with state subsidized child care when their leave expires but while such policies do encourage women to work they re enormously expensive and hurt economic growth norway spends an astonishing 2 7 percent of its gross domestic product on subsidized day care partly as a result norway and other northern european countries with aggressive natalist policies are among the most heavily taxed in the developed world levies on the average worker amount to 44 percent of earnings in norway and 48 percent in sweden compared with 29 percent in america and high taxes put downward pressure on fertility by diminishing the disposable earnings that couples might choose to spend on child rearing one study of europe s plush pension systems which require payroll taxes of up to 20 percent of earnings in some countries found that the most expensive plans have probably diminished fertility rates by up to 1 6 children per couple the result of these disparities is a dramatically different demographic and economic future for the u s than for the rest of the industrialized world while other developed countries shrink and age america s population will grow by one third through 2050 projections say the working age population in america will expand by some 45 million people even as it contracts by 100 million people in europe and by 10 million in japan the economic boon to the u s could be significant population growth has accounted for one half to two thirds of annual gdp growth in the industrialized world since world war ii according to hewitt by contrast a shrinking population will cut japanese and european economic growth by an average of nearly 1 percent annually by 2020 economists estimate shifting demographic patterns could also sharpen the american edge in innovation and entrepreneurship as the pools of highly educated workers shrink in europe and japan and population growth shifts to areas of the world where education levels don t match america s there are a few worrying trends the massive debt that the u s has piled up during the current economic crisis and the lavish new entitlement programs that washington is considering could drive taxes much higher depressing economic growth and potentially sending fertility rates tumbling and a disturbing fact embedded in our high birthrate is that 35 percent of all american children are now born to single mothers and the percentage is growing extensive research shows that children raised in single parent households don t do as well in a range of areas from school to work and any sizable decrease in academic achievement or work participation rates would erode the advantages of a growing working age population nevertheless the united states faces a far less challenging task in maintaining its demographic balance in coming decades than most countries do and the likely benefits of that stability will far outweigh many of the short term economic concerns currently dominating headlines top photo by sean gallup getty images

said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york this could continue to occur in the coming weeks stocks on wall street were trading higher the dollar dipped against a basket of currencies us treasury prices fell eyes on payrolls the claims data has no bearing on the department s closely watched employment report for november scheduled to be published on friday december 3 as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed businesses and households for the nonfarm payrolls count and the unemployment rate claims declined between mid october and mid november according to a reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 550 000 jobs last month after rising 531 000 in october the unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 4 5 from 4 6 in october also arguing for continued improvement in the labor market the adp national employment report on wednesday december 1 showed private payrolls increased by 534 000 jobs last month a measure of manufacturing employment rose to a seven month high a survey from the institute for supply management showed the conference board s labor market differential derived from data on consumers views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get jumped to a record high in november the run of good news on the labor market continued with another report on thursday from global outplacement firm challenger gray christmas showing job cuts announced by us based employers dropped 34 8 in november to 14 875 the fewest since may 1993 but worker shortages are hindering faster job growth the fed s beige book on wednesday described employment growth ranging from modest to strong across the us central bank s districts during october and early november with contacts noting persistent difficulty in hiring and retaining employees there were 10 4 million job openings as of the end of september the workforce is down 3 million people from its pre pandemic level despite generous federal government funded benefits expiring schools reopening for in person learning and companies raising wages thursday s claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 107 000 to 1 956 million in the week ended november 20 the lowest level in the so called continuing claims since mid march 2020 likely reflected a combination of people exhausting their benefits as well as finding work a total 2 31 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in mid november still labor supply could remain tight a survey from the chamber of commerce on thursday showed no urgency to return to work among many americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic and remain unemployed it is increasingly clear that the workforce challenges facing our country extend beyond those induced by the pandemic and we cannot simply assume that people will return to the workforce said chamber of commerce president suzanne clark rappler com
washington post national correspondent philip bump wrote thursday that the state of the country has rarely been worse than it is under president biden s leadership and scolded the democratic congressional campaign committee dccc for what he called a shoddy attempt at defending the administration no one would argue that things are going perfectly for president biden bump wrote in a column thursday many in fact would point out that at least politically things have rarely been worse so it s safe to say that having his allies gin up defenses as shoddy as this won t really help much biden claims to have served as a liason during six day war despite still being in law school at the time bump referred to a wildly misleading chart posted on twitter by the dccc that praised biden for lowering gas prices in an effort to quell the widespread frustration over skyrocketing prices at the pump under his presidency thanks joebiden the dccc s official account posted along with a graph that had no start date showing gas prices going down by two cents from november 22 to november 29 critics immediately pounced on the graphic with several twitter users speculating whether it was satire bump called it possibly the worst defense of the biden administration yet pointing out that since biden took office the price of gas has risen more than a dollar on this same measure you re not helping dccc he said the dccc wants to not only give biden credit for a decline in the price of gas they want to give him credit for a tiny decline in the price of gas a decline that isn t even the largest decline we ve seen this year over a similar period in august the price of gas dropped more than 1 percent more than three cents he wrote bump acknowledged that it is possible the country will see a peak in the price of a gallon of gas click here to get the fox news app he continued if so that would certainly be good news and might even help turn biden s approval ratings around but the dccc might be advised to wait until that turnaround is a little more substantial than it currently is before boasting about how effective the president has been or at least he cautioned they might not want to try to prove their dubious point with a graph that makes obvious how modest the decrease has been

the recent ipo for rivian automotive inc the electric pick up truck manufacturer whose shares increased 29 on the day following the offering resulting in an enterprise valuation of more than 86 billion more than the market values of every other automaker except tesla toyota and volkswagen is evidence that investors may place a significant premium on certain companies that are at the forefront of addressing and potentially seizing opportunities resulting from climate change and related sustainability issues the fact that rivian has only produced 156 vehicles to date and has never demonstrated the ability to mass produce electric vehicles apparently did not faze investors the rivian ipo and investor enthusiasm generally for companies perceived to be at the forefront of the green economy provide strong incentives for companies to promote their sustainability bona fides but along with marketplace rewards there has been increasing investor and regulatory scrutiny of whether ostensibly or self proclaimed sustainable companies merit the designation as we have recently discussed there is significant momentum in the u s and abroad for companies to provide sustainability disclosure that is reliable consistent and comparable certain members of the securities and exchange commission sec or commission repeatedly have signaled the importance of clear consistent and accurate disclosure when it comes to climate related impacts although the sec has not updated its corporate disclosure guidance in more than a decade it has solicited comments regarding the possibility of a mandatory climate related disclosure regime and we expect the commission to pursue such an approach in the near term in the meantime the existing well established materiality standard applies whereby information is material and must be disclosed if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would view a particular fact as significantly alter the total mix of information made available but as commissioner herron lee and others have observed application of that standard in the esg context has resulted in significant variability in terms of the quality and quantity of disclosure provided by issuers yielding investor complaints regulatory scrutiny and issuer confusion these challenges are well illustrated in the context of recent issues involving some well known sustainable companies one such company is allbirds inc the sustainable footwear and attire company that recently filed for its initial public offering allbirds a certified b corporation and delaware public benefit corporation claims that it manufactures its products with approximately 30 percent less carbon impact than other shoe manufacturers in addition in its ipo registration statement allbirds emphasized its commitment to esg and committed to adhere to a novel sustainability principles and objectives framework referred to as a spo framework which included a commitment to report the company s climate impact and to reduce its impact on the environment by cutting emissions and requiring suppliers to address environmental issues according to the allbirds website as a delaware public benefit corporation and a certified b corporation we strive to prioritize positive outcomes not only for our stockholders but for all stakeholders including employees customers the community and the environment the business roundtable s august 2019 statement on the purpose of a corporation articulated that stakeholder based capitalism will shift from being the exception to the rule we believe that shift is already underway that is why we believe it is important that we clearly articulate for all stakeholders our performance against and commitment to a set of environmental social and governance or esg criteria which we call the sustainability principles and objectives framework or the spo framework we believe that stakeholders will benefit from knowing that we have been assessed by one or more independent third parties as having satisfied objective clearly defined esg criteria and that we are committed to meeting high esg standards across our business the spo framework was created in conjunction with and supported by an advisory council coordinated by bsr several cross sector thought leaders market participants and stakeholders from the private and public sectors but in an updated prospectus allbirds walked back its commitment to the spo framework references to spo framework in later sec filings were noticeably reduced and language that allbirds was conducting this offering while following the spo framework was removed the amended filings followed a lawsuit filed in the united states district for the southern district of new york by a consumer claiming violations of the new york consumer protection statute breaches of express warranties fraud and unjust enrichment based on allbirds alleged misleading environmental claims specifically the plaintiff alleged that allbirds advertising which is heavily based on its products environmental impact is false and deceptive because allbirds disclosures related to its environmental impact were insufficient and misleading allbirds has moved to dismiss the case arguing that many of the statements were non actionable puffery and that the plaintiff offered no factual support for her allegations allbirds began publicly trading on november 3 2021 allbirds was expected to be the first sustainable public equity offering but was forced to drop the label after the sec objected to the phrasing allbirds shares surged 90 when they hit the market resulting in a valuation of roughly 4 1 billion like allbirds beyond meat a plant based food company that went public in 2019 is facing increased scrutiny over its climate related disclosures beyond meat strives to positively affect the planet the environment the climate and even ourselves by facilitating a shift from animal to plant based food products critics have taken issue however with beyond meat s failure to disclose the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions across its operations supply chain and consumer waste researchers have observed that the plant based industry which purports to be sustainable and environmentally friendly is really a black box the challenges associated with measuring and then accurately reporting carbon emissions are by no means limited to beyond meat all companies most likely will have to confront having to measure and accurately disclose scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 emissions with the latter category posing possibly the most difficult issues in terms of the hurdles involved in accurately measuring emissions across any one company s supply chain companies like allbirds and beyond meat in touting their sustainability bona fides also become targets for challenges by investors and regulators to the accuracy of such statements their experiences therefore provide important lessons for companies navigating increased demand for and scrutiny of climate related disclosure end to end climate impact matters though u s regulators have not provided formal guidance on what esg related disclosures will be required going forward companies should be assessing their environmental impacts for a variety of purposes including risk management and disclosure in so doing as evidenced by the allbirds and beyond meat situations companies should be mindful that sustainability is an end to end concept emissions from manufacturing supply chains and consumer waste have a significant impact on the overall assessment of whether a company operates in a sustainable fashion and should be factored into climate related disclosures by most accounts allbirds has been a success story the company has consistently promoted long term sustainability and has been rewarded for it raising 300 million in its initial public offering but even well intentioned companies are not insulated from challenges and scrutiny for example the allbirds lawsuit alleges that allbirds while touting its sustainability and lower carbon footprint misleadingly failed to take into account the environmental impact of its supply chain as well as the wool it sources from sheep in new zealand which purportedly account for 90 of new zealand s methane emissions and although beyond meat s mission involves positively affect the planet the environment the climate and even ourselves and claims to use significantly less water land and energy and generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a beef burger it recently received a zero sustainability rating from one tracking agency which stated that e don t feel we have sufficient information to say beyond meat is fundamentally different from jbs an animal based protein company the criticism stems from the fact that beyond meat does not disclose the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions across all of its operations supply chains or consumer waste companies should consider their end to end operations when assessing and disclosing its environmental impact companies can and should take certain steps to mitigate the challenges and therefore risks arising from efforts to provide accurate and thorough disclosure companies should take precautions to ensure their climate related disclosures are sufficiently fulsome and accurate failure to do so may result in costly litigation while obviously important for b corporations like allbirds whose corporate purpose is to produce a public benefit the all encompassing nature of the risks and opportunities presented by climate change imply that certain disclosures in this area will be material for virtually all companies while there is no way to render climate disclosure risk free adhering to an established third party disclosure framework can mitigate risk by providing a rationale for and guidance in terms of the company s disclosure we previously discussed these frameworks but the guidance provided by the financial stability board s task force on climate related financial disclosure tcfd in particular has been gaining traction with regulators and investors the tcfd the mostly widely endorsed framework recommends that companies across all industries disclose i the organization s governance around climate related risks and opportunities ii the actual and potential impacts of climate related risks and opportunities on the organization s businesses strategy and financial planning where such information is material iii how the organization identifies assesses and manages climate related risks and iv the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate related risks and opportunities where such information is material for companies that tout themselves as sustainable the eu taxonomy also provides helpful guidance for u s companies considering how or what to disclose in connection with their activities to be considered an environmentally sustainable economic activity under the eu taxonomy the activity must among other things contribute to at least one of six environmental objectives climate change mitigation climate change adaptation sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control or the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and do no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives by defining what constitutes an environmentally sustainable activity the eu taxonomy necessarily requires companies if they claim to engage in such conduct to make associated disclosures supporting that claim in line with eu taxonomy s elements companies should monitor regulatory developments s regulators have made it clear that they intend to address esg disclosure issues securities regulators in the uk and eu already have provided guidance but continue to update and supplement that guidance given the rapidly evolving nature of climate related issues and analysis companies should continue to be vigilant in monitoring updated rules from regulators with respect to climate related disclosures to ensure their disclosures sufficiently detail the impact of their operations on the environment demand for esg products is soaring but so is scrutiny consumer demand for esg products is exponentially increasing despite criticisms concerning its supply chain sustainability allbirds closed its first day with its price up more than 90 percent after beyond meat went public in 2019 its shares surged 163 percent on its first day of trading the best performing large ipo in the u s in more than a decade but companies should not take excess comfort in the apparent unwavering public support for allbirds and beyond meat which have sustainability as part of their core mission regulators are keeping a close eye on so called greenwashing or branding something as eco friendly green or sustainable when this is not the case given heightened awareness around esg issues and the demand for sustainable products companies will find it increasingly difficult to make vague statements about sustainability without substantiating the claim regulators investors and even consumers are becoming increasingly wary of such exaggerated claims and holding companies accountable ostensibly sustainable companies are not immune from challenges to their esg bona fides companies or industries that often are viewed as green are not immune from challenges over their true environmental impact some contend that clean energy sources such as wind solar and nuclear power for instance have hidden carbon footprints associated with their construction and manufacture nuclear plants and wind turbines require concrete and steel for construction which in turn are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in a similar vein the batteries in electric vehicles charge on electric power which is often powered by fossil fuels the point is not that electric vehicles over their life are less environmentally friendly than combustion engine automobiles or that the operation of clean energy sources results in as much carbon emission as fossil fuels rather the issue is accurate assessment and disclosure of scopes 1 2 and 3 emissions even for sustainable companies and their products 1 peter eavis neal e boudette

experts discuss how the pandemic has changed the california economy but why there s reason for hope here are three key takeaways california usa this story was originally published by calmatters as the coronavirus pandemic shows no signs of ending california is still recovering from the most damaging recession since the great depression by october california had regained only about two thirds of the 2 7 million jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic the state lags behind the rebound rate in the rest of the u s and isn t likely to see a full recovery until the end of 2023 according to a recent report from the california center for jobs the economy one of the biggest challenges is getting people back to work especially as new coronavirus variants continue to emerge and cause uncertainty within a couple of hours after health officials confirmed that the first u s case of the omicron variant had been detected in san francisco calmatters and the milken institute co hosted a discussion wednesday moderated by calmatters economic reporter grace gedye and titled the post covid recovery california s lagging employment rate panelists discussed why the lag exists while california has always had a relatively high unemployment rate the state was also hit harder by the pandemic in part because its economy relies on the tourism and entertainment industries here are three key takeaways covid has changed everything maybe permanently the threats of covid 19 have necessitated a lot of adapting to new safety protocols as well as new consumer behaviors manuel pastor director of usc s equity research institute noted a few of those structural changes to the economy including the shift from services to goods as businesses ceased traditional in person services pastor described what he called an economy based more on mutuality one in which business owners have a heightened sense of the well being of their employees and he noted the rise of a just in case economy where business owners have become better prepared for supply shortages or workers needing to take time off perhaps the most lasting change the switch to remote work which pastor predicted will continue as companies try to grapple with the fact that many workers do not want to return to the office somjita mitra chief economist for california s department of finance said that the pandemic accelerated trends that were already in place such as less shopping at brick and mortar stores and the decline of manufacturing small business owners also saw those trends take hold noted reign free owner of the red door catering company in oakland people aren t having large events and coming out to dine so how can we service our clients where they are in a responsible way free said free also said the pandemic emphasized the need for business owners to own their own space instead of being at the mercy of your landlord there s reason to be optimistic while there s plenty of reason for concern there are also some points of optimism according to mitra while the recession has been the worst to hit the state since the 1930s and there s still a long way to go the economy has snapped back relatively quickly she also pointed to indications that residents are optimistic about the economy including another way to look at the great resignation people don t quit jobs if they think the economy is going to crash soon she said the fact that people are quitting and trying to find better employment or start their own businesses or move there s a lot of optimism that people have in terms of the recovery pastor said that while there certainly have been hardships especially among lower income californians and the most vulnerable the billions of dollars in state and federal relief and other actions were remarkable in preventing a recession that affected everyone instead there was more of a micro recession in addition to workers in some industries being able to work remotely rising housing prices and the stock market boom meant wealthy people cleaned up he said small business owners are still struggling pastor called the pandemic recovery a transformational moment for workers not so much a great resignation as a great awakening in which people are rethinking the role of work in their lives besides unemployment benefits there are a number of reasons why people may not return to work including child care needs or health risks free said but while large companies may be able to stay afloat through this transformation small business owners need more support julian cañete president and ceo of the california hispanic chambers of commerce said that grants and loan assistance provided a bridge for many small businesses but many still had to close their doors it wasn t just the pandemic that hit he said when you re hit with the wildfires in some of the areas of the state that also has an impact on everything on employment on recovery everything else

here s a starter for 10 is rivian a a minor character in the hobbit b the name of gwyneth paltrow s youngest child c an electric vehicle maker that has taken wall street by storm as keen investors will already know rivian is a company being hailed as the biggest thing in electric vehicles since tesla despite the fact many people have never even heard of it the company floated on the nasdaq market in the us last month and is now valued at close to 100billion or 70billion out front rivian founder rj scaringe and the company s all electric r1s suv which starts at 70 000 that s still well below tesla which has a market value of nearly 1 1 trillion but phenomenal nonetheless so is the excitement justified should uk investors dive in or is rivian s rampant debut a sign that the mania for electric vehicles evs is about to go screeching into reverse the share sale in mid november was the largest since facebook came to market nearly a decade ago and put a higher value on rivian than on us auto giants general motors and ford which somewhat ironically is one of its backers this is despite the fact rivian has never made a profit and has delivered hardly any vehicles the company has one very big trump card however jeff bezos amazon which he founded is the largest investor with a stake of 22 4 per cent the online shopping giant was one of the earliest big backers it has placed an order for 100 000 vehicles and the hope is that with amazon as an anchor customer other lucrative orders will follow already it has been quite a journey for rivian since it was founded in 2009 by robert scaringe who likes to be known as rj and who is still only 38 one reason the shares have taken off is fomo or fear of missing out as investors who didn t manage to cash in on tesla see rivian as an opportunity to make up for lost ground russ mould investment director at stockbroker aj bell says there is a lot of money looking for a home now and many people think rivian is the new tesla remember though rivian has never made a profit and it has only sold a handful of trucks contrast that with ford which is forecast by analysts to generate more than 120billion in sales and nearly 6 billion in net profits in 2021 although the two are often compared entrepreneur scaringe who is an outdoorsy family man seems the antithesis of tesla s founder elon musk musk 50 has made a virtue of eccentricity and has a colourful private life a former beau of johnny depp s ex amber heard he recently semi separated from wife grimes 33 a canadian singer with whom he shares a young son named x ae a xii musk or baby x for short clark kent look a like scaringe who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering from massachusetts institute of technology seems almost preternaturally normal even rivian s 2 6m sq ft assembly plant is based in the town of normal illinois married to meagan with whom he has three sons since 2014 he is vegan is mad on mountain biking and rather than musk s incendiary tweets he posts wholesome pictures of himself camping with his family with a big yellow tent stowed on their rivian truck high voltage tesla has a market value of nearly 1 1 trillion its founder elon musk pictured has made a virtue of eccentricity and has a colourful private life scaringe presents himself as an eco evangelist this is a once in a planet situation where for the first time a single species has the potential to change the make up of the planet for all time forward he told investors in a less environmentally conscious age scaringe would have been called a petrolhead the son of an engineer he has been obsessed with cars since boyhood but says he felt conflicted by the damage they did ultimately i decided to focus my life on helping to drive our transportation system toward a future state that was sustainable and carbon neutral the fact this worthy goal could also be immensely profitable goes unsaid scaringe himself could make a personal fortune of up to 14billion from his shares and options if the company performs investors could be well rewarded too if it all goes to plan there is no doubt about the scale of the opportunity bloomberg new energy finance believes that by 2037 evs will be more than half of new vehicles sold janet mui of brewin dolphin points out this stock is not for everyone but you are buying the prospects of a huge potential market to look at rivian s website though you would barely grasp that it makes vehicles at all photographs of production lines or car plants are conspicuous by their absence you could easily assume the company was plugging exclusive family adventure holidays the site is big on saccharine tinged pictures of mountains forests deserted roads hip young parents and slightly icky claims it is building the kind of future our kids and our kids kids deserve at a price the vehicles made for the planet include the r1t electric truck with prices starting at 67 500 and the r1s suv starting at 70 000 and for all rivian s upscale eco warrior vibe competition in the ev market will be ferocious nissan which has put its sunderland plant at the heart of its 13billion push has unveiled a small electric suv and a cute pick up truck the surf out that looks quite similar to the r1t ford as well as being a top investor is likely to be a formidable rival so is tesla german car maker volkswagen is planning to spend 31billion on battery evs in the next five years and to launch 70 all electric models by 2030 and let s not forget china the world s biggest car market where home grown ev companies are springing up enthusiasm among shareholders however has not been dimmed by the fact that china s ev group nio was on the verge of bankruptcy last year and investors in nikola which makes electric lorries have had a nail biting journey since it floated on nasdaq in summer 2020 shares tanked following a report from short sellers hindenberg research alleging an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies the us markets watchdog the securities and exchange commission and the department of justice are investigating and the founder trevor milton 39 resigned though he has disputed the claims no one is suggesting any such problems at rivian but the episode is a warning to investors that it pays to be careful in this sector shares in rivian and others of its ilk could also fall out of favour if the tech and green share surge runs out of steam rewards at rivian could be rich but no one should invest in the ev market in the expectation of a smooth ride buckle up
