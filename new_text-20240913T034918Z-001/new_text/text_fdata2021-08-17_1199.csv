spirit airlines lost 50million in revenue after canceling almost 3 000 flights over 11 day period spirit airlines announced that the cancellation of almost 3 000 flights within an 11 day period cost the company about 50million in lost revenue the company says the cancellations were due to bad weather airport staffing shortages and crews being stranded far from their assigned flights spirit will be reducing flights until september 30 ceo ted christie apologized for the inconvenience as he called it out of character for the airline spirit had the highest rate of customer complaints out of 16 airlines in 2019 spirit airlines revealed on august 16 that the cancellation of 2 800 flights that occurred over a 11 day period cost the company about 50million in lost revenue and caused spending to literally soar the airline said the service meltdown that started in late july and a rise in covid 19 cases are causing more last minute cancellations and softer bookings spirit said that it will reduce flights it called the moves tactical schedule reductions for the rest of the quarter which ends september 30 with all the cancellations and now fewer flights for the next six weeks spirit estimated that its third quarter revenue will range between 885million and 955million or 4 to 11 below the same quarter in pre pandemic 2019 spirit said the cancellation of more than 2 800 flights over an 11 day stretch this summer cost the budget airline about 50 million in lost revenue and caused spending to soar on august 16 spirit s cancellation numbers have returned to more normal levels however the airline said that recovering from the crisis caused expenses to climb the airline said it paid to put some stranded passengers on flights operated by other airlines and covered their hotel stays it also incurred higher labor costs such as overtime spirit forecast that its third quarter operating expenses will be slightly above 1billion an increase of up to 20 over the third quarter of

around the country while portraying them as out of character for the airline we believe the interruption was a singular event driven by an unprecedented confluence of factors and does not reflect systemic issues christie said he said spirit has made investments to be one of the most efficient and reliable airlines in the u s industry and is taking steps to make sure we maintain that standard spirit ceo ted christie apologized for the inconvenience the airline caused as it affected tens of thousands of people around the country in recent years spirit has scored in the middle of the pack or

complaints for many years in 2019 it had the highest rate of complaints among 16 airlines in rankings compiled by the transportation department however it improved to 12th out of 16 last year earlier this month spirit received a massive string of complaints after flights were being continuously canceled including some on social media one user tweeted so my spiritairlines cancelled my flight for tomorrow and with that those flights of my party of 9 passengers a youth team heading to ultimate frisbee nationals in minnesota there s something ironic that we won t be taking spirit to an ultimate tournament another user said jeffbezos please buy spirit airlines so i can get to my destinations as fast as i get my packages spiritairlines i had to borrow 700 00 i don t have for a flight all because you failed to let me know in time of the cancellation spirit airlines has received the highest number of complaints among 16 other airlines according to a 2019 ranking compiled by the transportation department angered customers took to social media to express their distaste for spirit after their flights were unexpectedly cancelled other horror stories include those of seven months pregnant robin wilson who on wednesday was left to fend for herself wilson s intended flight from cleveland to atlanta was rerouted to la she was told by spirit that she d have to wait four days for the next flight but wilson did not have the funds to book a hotel to stay in she faced spending four days living in the terminal of los angeles international airport and was only put up in a hotel when fox 11 reported her story and shamed spirit into providing the high risk passenger with accommodation i definitely don t have a flight out from lax to cleveland until thursday no accommodations at all i m seven months pregnant i m high risk wilson told the network before her issue was resolved brenda deleon told dailymail com how her family s eight day vacation to puerto rico had to be extended by two days at a cost of 1 000 because of spirit after receiving notification of a cancellation late tuesday night deleon tried to contact spirit customer service but wasn t able to speak with someone i called last night and was on hold for 42 minutes but figured they were closed this morning i went to the airport to talk to someone but the spirit kiosk was empty she said deleon called the airlines 1 800 again on wednesday and was able to rebooked their family s flights for friday at 2 50am but they still faced issues with accommodations our airbnb was booked tonight so we looked for another home for 478 41 and two days of car rental for 342 34 she said advertisement they will refund only half of what trip costs which is not an option since prices with other airlines skyrocketed we have to wait it out
china s economy slowed more than expected in july adding to signs that the global recovery is coming under pressure as the delta virus variant snarls supply chains and undermines consumer confidence retail sales were hit by tough new virus restrictions introduced toward the end of the month to contain fresh outbreaks flooding in central china and weak auto sales due to a chip shortage hurt manufacturing while a slowing property market and environmental policies reduced output of steel and cement hitting commodity demand alongside a slump in u s consumer confidence to an almost decade low and increasing supply chain pressures in southeast asia china s data underlined the potential havoc the more contagious delta virus variant could have on the global recovery a key container port in china was partially shut last week after a worker was infected there disrupting trade at a time when businesses are ramping up for the christmas holiday shopping season if china s economic growth loses steam amid covid 19 resurgence the rest of the world could see further head winds to growth momentum from supply chain disruption to slower than expected normalized consumption said bruce pang head of macro and strategy research at china renaissance securities hong kong china s slowdown also means weaker demand for global commodities oil prices sank for a third consecutive day with west texas intermediate slumping 1 5 copper futures in shanghai closed down 0 4 reversing an earlier 1 3 gain using a two year average growth to strip out the base effects caused by the pandemic the data showed a notable slowdown in retail sales to 3 6 in july industrial production was less affected by the consumer slowdown as a result of strong exports growing 5 6 by the two year measure down nearly one percentage point from the previous month growth in fixed asset investment was roughly stable july s data suggest the economy is losing steam very fast said raymond yeung chief economist for greater china at australia and new zealand banking group which downgraded its full year growth forecast to 8 3 the resurgence of delta also adds extra risk to august s activities china s outlook now depends on whether the covid restrictions can be relaxed this month and if beijing will increase monetary and fiscal stimulus to prevent a sharper slowdown the people s bank of china signaled a steady policy course on monday keeping its key interest rate unchanged while rolling over most of the policy loans coming due an imported case of the delta variant began to spread from the eastern city of nanjing in july causing authorities to close tourist sites and cancel cultural events and flights during the summer vacation period to contain outbreaks despite vaccinating more than half of its population china s ongoing tough covid elimination policy is hitting consumption spending in restaurants fell more than 4 in july from the previous month the government s aggressive covid strategy could prove economically costly financial institutions like nomura holdings inc goldman sachs group inc and jpmorgan chase co have already cut their growth projections for the third quarter and full year even with those revisions beijing will be on course to meet its relatively modest full year growth target of above 6 factory slowdown the production figures also reflect the impact of beijing s tightening regulations to curb pollution and property market risks steel production plunged in july to a 15 month low according to bloomberg calculations as the industry begins to make good on a pledge to reduce output below last year s record levels to restrain emissions cement production fell for a third consecutive month suggesting property and infrastructure investment which helped power china s rapid pandemic recovery will both remain subdued this year factories faced other constraints in july including disruptions from floods in the province of henan and a continued shortage of computer chips which caused a fourth consecutive month of falling car production we are seeing the stacked effect of china s decarbonization efforts and uncertainty from covid and global chip shortage said tommy xie head of greater china research at oversea chinese banking corp fu linghui a spokesman for the national bureau of statistics said china will maintain a stable recovery in the second half of the year with the main indicators staying within a reasonable range policy support in the second half is expected to be mainly on the fiscal side with the central bank likely to inject cash into the banking system to help banks absorb local government bonds the ruling communist party s elite politburo last month set out economic priorities for the second half of the year pledging stronger local government investment we continue to expect a notable growth slowdown in the second half as beijing leaves little space for dialing back its unprecedented tightening measures on the property sector said lu ting chief china economist at nomura holdings inc lu doesn t expect the people s bank of china to cut interest rates this year and sees a below 50 chance of another reduction this year in the amount of money banks have to keep in reserve

the stunning collapse of the afghanistan government and the country s takeover by the taliban sent investors scurrying into the safe haven of u s treasuries yields on the benchmark treasury note plunged below 1 23 after cruising above 1 35 over the past week the weekend news of chaos in kabul accelerated the decline that began on friday with a lower than expected report on u s the focus on the of the july meeting of the federal reserve s policymakers due out wednesday was upstaged by developments in afghanistan and the from president joe biden who interrupted his vacation stay at camp david to return to the white house monday and address the situation the immediate backlash to the u s withdrawal and subsequent chaos bridged the partisan divide as even those who favored the retreat criticized the abrupt and inept manner of its execution the tumultuous events threatened to permanently stain the biden presidency and even pro biden commentators said it creates a crisis of competency in his white house speech biden once again blamed afghanis for their failure to fight for their country arguing that the u s was never going to attain its objective of making the country a workable democracy some commentators are worried that afghanistan could once again become a haven for terrorists increasing the threat to u s national security however biden argued that washington is effectively countering terrorism around the world and will be able to do so in afghanistan as well the 10 year treasury yield bounced back to 1 27 as biden talked but his remarks are not likely to reassure allies regarding america s reliability the irony of the u s sending 6 000 troops to fix the problems caused by the withdrawal of 2 500 was not lost on many observers data showing and in china in july added to investors concerns about the economy and drove more of them into the safety of government bonds the treasury department announced earlier this month that it would start reducing its issuance in november nicely dovetailing with any reduction in fed purchases so that prices could remain firm and yields low the fomc minutes may provide some clues about just when the fed may start to taper those purchases however a by policymakers over the past two weeks has made it clear that this will come sooner rather than later hawks are pushing for an announcement in september and reductions as early as october but others may want to go slower european government bonds react in step the afghanistan turmoil and growth concerns also supported euro zone government bonds yield on germany s benchmark bond dipped to minus 0 489 before recovering to minus 0 467 on par with friday s close of minus 0 468 trading was thin as many investors were on vacation uk government bonds bounced around in a tight range as yield on the gilt dipped below 0 551 and peaked at 0 597 before settling at about 0 575 also in line with the friday close in canada prime minister justin trudeau called for a snap election on sept 20 hoping to gain a majority in parliament after getting good marks on his covid 19 response concern about trudeau s progressive agenda drove the yield on canada s bond down to 1 167 compared to friday s close of 1 184
according to a recent report more americans are planning to go on vacation this summer than in previous years and plan to spend more money when they go according to a recent report more americans are planning to go on vacation this summer than in previous years and plan to spend more money when they go and since fourth of july weekend is the most popular travel weekend of the summer now seems like a great time to figure out how this could impact your portfolio there are several industries that should benefit from this but the big winners could be the companies who focus on processing payments such as american express nyse axp visa nyse v and mastercard nyse ma more travel and more money to spend a clear sign that the economic recovery in the u s has made tremendous progress 75 of americans are planning a summer trip of some kind this is up from 69 last year and vastly improved from the 59 of americans who took a vacation in the summer of 2012 flickr neilsphotography not only are more people planning to travel but those travelers plan to spend more money the average traveler says they expect to spend nearly 1 250 per person during their vacation up 9 from just last year so between the higher number of travelers and the higher spending per traveler summer vacation spending could climb by more than 18 this year this means billions of dollars in extra spending will be up for grabs who could benefit there are several industries that should see a nice share of this extra spending the obvious beneficiary should be the travel industry especially airlines and hotels and don t forget companies who facilitate travel planning like priceline com the percentage of americans who say they will use online tools such as travel websites when booking their summer vacations rose from 56 to 63 this past year retailers could benefit especially clothing retailers a group which has struggled lately in fact one survey listed buying new clothes as a top pre travel activity this could provide a much needed boost to companies such as american eagle aeropostale and others however instead of trying to guess which industries will get a big chunk of travelers spending cash i d prefer to go with a sure bet the big winners the one group that is sure to be a winner here is the payment processing companies like visa mastercard and american express all of these companies pocket a fee every time someone swipes their credit card and many travelers prefer to use cards rather than carry lots of cash in unfamiliar places plus the most expensive parts of vacations are things like airfare and hotels and how often do people pay cash for those think beyond summer according to the u s travel association the travel industry generated about 2 1 trillion over the past year between direct and indirect spending if this turns out to be something more than just a summer trend and means the overall travel industry is improving this growth could mean big bucks for the payment processors using the same 18 increase in total amount spent as we stated earlier this could mean an increase of travel spending of about 380 billion per year even if the average payment processing fee is 2 which is a very low estimate this could mean an additional 7 5 billion in fee revenue for the payment processors while this is a generous estimate because people aren t going to charge 100 of travel expenses there is still pretty impressive potential here when you consider these companies total profits for the entire year of 2013 were 5 8 billion visa 3 1 billion mastercard and 5 2 billion american express it s easy to see how a sharp increase in travel spending could have a big impact on the companies bottom lines

pcr tests for travel are a rip off ex competition watchdog chair lord tyrie blasts exploitative practices of firms charging up to 136 for two swabs for returning double jabbed tourists lord tyrie blasted exploitative practices of firms charging up to 136 for swabs but he also slammed the competition regulator for being too slow to react to it travellers have been left livid after prices for tests rocketed despite poor service pcr tests for travel have turned into a predictable covid rip off the ex chair of the competition and markets authority has warned lord tyrie blasted exploitative practices of firms charging up to 136 for two swabs for returning double jabbed tourists but he also slammed the competition regulator which he left last summer for being too slow to react to complaints travellers have been left livid after prices for the tests rocketed despite poor service from many of the 400 plus government approved companies yesterday a planned crackdown on rogue firms descended into farce after one which left hundreds in the lurch was promoted to the top of the government s list last week sajid javid pledged to tackle cowboy private testing firms insisting they would start being purged from the gov uk site on saturday lord tyrie pictured blasted exploitative practices of firms charging up to 136 for two swabs for returning double jabbed tourists lord tyrie blasted the cma and said that it could and should have been better prepared the former mp for chichester told the bbc it should either be acting already directly using existing powers or if deemed inadequate for the job it should be advising the government on how to obtain a quick remedy whether by legislation or by other means this advice should already be with the government he pointed out his former employers had been quick to swoop on price inflation among hand sanitiser and other covid quelling products last year the peer said the cma has the ability to attack the swollen costs and needs to shake off the excess of caution at the highest levels a cma spokesman said these comments are inaccurate the cma gave advice to dhsc officials about the pcr testing market in april and we gave further advice to the secretary of state last week we continue to work closely with dhsc in reviewing the market and as we have made clear we will not hesitate to take enforcement action ourselves if there are breaches of consumer law since the start of the pandemic the cma has secured hundreds of millions of pounds in refunds for people who have been treated unfairly in sectors including holiday accommodation and package travel travellers are having to rely on reviews to find the best providers the table above shows the users ratings health secretary mr javid pledged to tackle cowboy private testing firms last week insisting they would start being purged from the gov uk site on saturday but on sunday 001 doctor which was removed from the portal in april following a flood of complaints was top of the list it remained there for most of yesterday leading to accusations that mr javid had launched a crackdown in name only according to companies house records the firm changed its trading name last month from 001 doctor uk ltd to european health technology ltd its name also changed from 001 doctor to 001 doctor it was unclear last night if the name changes allowed it to re join the government approved list of pcr test providers the firm founded last november was removed after dozens of complaints from travellers who did not receive home test kits they had paid 170 for others received no results or another person s customers told of being left confused and distressed with many forced to extend their self isolation period as a result of 821 reviews on consumer website trustpilot 98 per cent have rated it as bad health secretary sajid javid pledged to tackle cowboy testing firms as the government says it has removed 57 firms from its approved list while 82 have been issued final warnings yesterday 001 doctor was advertised on the portal as offering single and double test packages for 20 but when clicking through to the firm s official website its 20 home kits were out of stock in clinic swabs were available for the same price but only at one of five centres across the country and some were not available for weeks the real cost of a single swab test at home kit delivered via post was 54 and 119 for a two swab package the firm was contacted for comment yesterday a daily mail analysis found more than 30 private firms still listed on the government portal offering two swab testing packages for 20 but on their official websites yesterday many simply said they were out of stock only available to nhs workers or at in centre sites potentially hundreds of miles away the real cost was up to six times higher consumer groups say advertising unobtainable low prices allow firms to feature high on the list as it ranks them by cost the government has said it will crack down on private testing firms pictured a standard test companies are also sorted alphabetically meaning those with names starting with 0 or are elevated labour mp ben bradshaw who sits on the commons transport committee said the british public are fed up with empty promises from ministers to fix the testing rip off shambles they ve had all year to grip this but successive health ministers and boris johnson himself have failed lib dem transport spokesman sarah olney called for a cap on pcr test prices saying sajid javid s crackdown in name only has left the door wide open for greedy providers to continue exploiting families on friday mr javid said the nhs will cut its prices from 88 to 68 for a single test package and 170 to 136 for a two swab kit ministers hope private firms will follow bringing prices down under the government s traffic light system double jabbed people must book one pcr test before arriving from countries ranked green and

financial measures the company also uses certain non gaap financial measures in evaluating its business for example the company uses adjusted loss from operations adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per ordinary share as supplemental measures to review and assess its financial and operating performance the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap adjusted loss from operations is loss from operations excluding the impact of share based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition adjusted net loss is net loss excluding the impact of share based compensation expenses amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets and fair value change in warrant liabilities adjusted net loss per ordinary share is adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating net loss per ordinary share adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders is net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding the impact of share based compensation expenses amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets and fair value change in warrant liabilities the company presents non gaap financial measures because they are used by the company s management to evaluate the company s financial and operating performance and formulate business plans the company believes that adjusted loss from operations and adjusted net loss help identify underlying trends in the company s business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that are included in loss from operations and net loss the company also believes that the use of non gaap financial measures facilitates investors assessment of the company s operating performance the company believes that adjusted loss from operations and adjusted net loss provide useful information about the company s operating results enhance the overall understanding of the company s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the company s management in its financial and operational decision making the non gaap financial measures are not defined under u s gaap and are not presented in accordance with u s gaap the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools one of the key limitations of using non gaap financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company s operations share based compensation expenses amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets and fair value change in warrant liabilities have been and may continue to be incurred in the company s business and is not reflected in the presentation of non gaap financial measures further the non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap measures used by other companies including peer companies potentially limiting the comparability of their financial results to the company s in light of the foregoing limitations the non gaap financial measures for the period should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to loss from operations net loss and net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per share or other financial measures prepared in accordance with u s gaap the company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to the nearest u s gaap performance measures which should be considered when evaluating the company s performance for reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial

the deal amounts to a huge vote of confidence for the company he built after hitting on the idea when tasting yoghurt with a spoon made from a resin derived from potato and corn at a farmers market in san francisco since founding vegware in 2006 the company has grown into a 36 4 million turnover business that sells its wares in more than 70 countries employing about 80 people in edinburgh and as society works towards more sustainable ways of living novolex and indeed mr frankel himself clearly believe there is much more to come some acquisitions are about cost cutting or synergies this is not one of those mr frankel told the herald this is absolutely a growth play he added i m in the team s in read more crieff hydro rocked by auditor warning when the deal was announced last week it was stated that the company would continue to be headquartered in edinburgh and operate under the vegware brand stan bikulege chairman and chief executive of novolex said the acquisition was an exciting step that would help the company grow our global compostable products footprint but will novolex need to continue growing the vegware footprint from edinburgh after all vegware already uses firms around the world to manufacture its products why would novolex have to maintain an operation in scotland when in time it could conceivably make savings by consolidating operations elsewhere in the world novolex is backed by the private equity giant carlyle would carlyle resist any opportunities that may arise to save cash and increase the value of its investment just because of the historic connection between vegware and edinburgh vegware is far from the first scottish grown company to find itself in this situation in fact on the very day that the vegware deal was announced the acquisition of glasgow based smarter grid solutions by mitsubishi electric corporation of japan was unveiled the new owner of smarter grid solutions made similar noises about remaining committed to scotland and glasgow in particular where 55 of the company s 75 staff are based while operating as a subsidiary of mitsubishi read more sale of edinburgh eco packaging firm highlights its success we have also heard the same messaging around aggreko the glasgow based temporary power generator which on friday de listed from the stock exchange following its own private equity backed takeover aggreko s new owners tdr capital and i squared capital made similar pledges about retaining a commitment to scotland when the deal was announced but can such assurances be relied upon in the long term could anything stop say tdr and i squared from moving aggreko s scottish operations to somewhere that is more cash efficient elsewhere within their vast portfolios equally will mitsubishi be happy to maintain an operation in glasgow in the long run or will it relocate smarter grid solutions to somewhere more economically beneficial in time there are other questions that arise from deals such as these and the many more that have come before them including in the scotch whisky industry where there is a significant level of overseas based ownership why do owners sell out instead of carrying on the job of building businesses are there barriers in scotland perhaps access to growth finance that need to be removed to allow entrepreneurs to continue building their companies on these shores read more glasgow power giant agrees 2 3bn sale after years of shares decline of course there is no uniform experience for entrepreneurs and business owners who find themselves at such a crossroads some entrepreneurs may genuinely prefer the buzz of putting their ideas into practice rather than building huge enterprises and it is very often the case that selling a business to a bigger organisation with greater reach and deeper resources is the best option in order for it to continue growing and reach its full potential but it is hard sometimes to not view the sale of more promising businesses in scotland as something of a disappointment it can feel like a blow to prestige and leave one wondering if it really is the best course of action for scottish jobs and the economy this is a broad observation of course and is not meant in any way to be a direct criticism of individuals who make the decision to sell their business in many cases such individuals and their teams will have shown tremendous dedication and hard work over long periods to build their companies and deserve the returns they earn for their endeavours nor will many have sold out without doing as much diligence as possible on their new owners and ensuring as far as possible that jobs are safeguarded the comments from the leaders of vegware smarter grid solutions and aggreko following their respective takeovers underline that such assurances have been sought for those companies however there are no guarantees over what the future will hold perhaps the work of the newly assembled council for economic transformation which includes some of the biggest names on the scottish businesses scene will give us some steer on whether a strategy for building companies of scale in scotland and keeping them here will be forthcoming the 17 strong council obviously has a huge amount on its plate as it strives to come up with ideas that can help the scottish economy recover from the pandemic while ensuring that as many people benefit from the recovery as possible this must be done in the context of building towards net zero and dealing with the challenges of climate change not to mention the transformation that the pandemic has sparked in sectors such as retail the advisory council which is chaired by the economy secretary kate forbes is expected to publish its 10 year plan in the autumn it will be interesting to see if it includes any recommendations to help the many dynamic small and medium size businesses we have in scotland today become the large employers of tomorrow maybe then the steady flow of scottish businesses into overseas hands will slow a little and ensure the country holds on to its most promising companies for a few years longer

june michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk said there is little doubt that us consumer spending has been supported by the two fiscal packages that were delivered in january and march and continue to be so although an improving economy did see us consumer confidence in july back to levels last seen pre pandemic whether this translates into another positive month for us retail sales remains to be seen however the surprise rebound in june could well be tempered by a modest slowdown in july with expectations of a 0 2 decline as higher prices deter discretionary spending also on the agenda are us industrial production numbers which are expected to show a 0 5 rise investors will be interpreting the news in the light of what it could mean for the federal reserve s bond buying programme and the potential for movements in interest rates fed policymakers are moving toward an agreement to start scaling back their easy money policies in about three months if the economic

investment director russ mould said just 24 hours after it confirmed it was in talks over an exit from the oil and gas industry mining giant bhp takes the headlines again as it confirms its plans to merge its oil assets with woodside petroleum the market is clearly excited about the move and while investors are set to get shares in the combined venture rather than an immediate cash payout this will give them the option of selling the shares should they choose and realising value that way the news comes alongside results which encompass a big capital return to shareholders and a plan to tidy up the company s corporate structure with its main listing widely expected to be in australia and the green light on a new potash project bhp has a clear strategy now of focusing on future proofed commodities which are part of the transition away from fossil fuels or in other words being part of the solution rather than part of the problem and it s an approach which is winning favour from the market but covid 19 concerns are never far away and news that new zealand is to go into lockdown after its first case in eight months has revived fears the delta variant could derail the global

about already but the taliban taking control of afghanistan is another one to add to the list so far there has been little immediate impact but longer term the events in kabul could have repercussions nigel green chief executive of financial advisory group devere said despite the news coming out of afghanistan there is not likely to be an immediate shockwave rippling through global stock markets investors are currently more focused on other key factors that could impact returns these include the fallout from the delta variant of covid concerns about peak earnings disappointing chinese economic data slowing growth and this week s publication of the minutes of the federal reserve s latest meeting which could hint at a shift in policy however the major geopolitical turbulence triggered by the taliban s effective power grab will certainly be added to investors growing list of global issues to track as it could have longer term implications for markets there will be questions regarding stability in the middle east the global influence of the u s and the mounting pressure on biden the prospect of increasing international terror threats and the growing dominance of china s renminbi 9 11am just eat climbs on upbeat comments one of the key points from the jobs data is the rise in vacancies jennifer beckwith cbi head of employment said with employment up and unemployment down the labour market is showing further signs of recovery yet with vacancies at a record high employers are concerned that staff shortages are stalling their ability to grow and support the country s wider economic recovery recent changes to self isolation mean that firms can at last continue to operate more normally even if short term absences remain a concern for sectors reliant on younger workers awaiting their second vaccine a wider test and release scheme must be implemented so that self isolation remains properly targeted at those who risk spreading the virus back with the

100 drifted 27 points lower at 7 127 26 in the wake of the latest domestic jobs print which was slightly better than expected the uk s unemployment rate dipped to 4 7 in the last quarter from 4 8 previously compared with an expectation that the number would remain static according to the office for national statistics the number of people in employment rose again by 182 000 to 28 9mln but remained 201 000 below pre pandemic levels vacancies meanwhile rose to a record high of 953 000 the next reports will give an even stronger indication of where the economy stands as the government furlough scheme comes to an end although the current demand and supply imbalance for labour may take some of the strain said richard hunter head of markets at interactive investor the day s big mover

the red the ftse 100 is expected to extend its losses on tuesday as worries about china s slowdown override the rebound on wall street overnight london s main share index has been predicted to drop another 10 points according to the ig spread betting platform after closing down 64 points at 7 153 at the start of the week having initially carried on the negative vibe in asia and europe us stocks battled to reduce losses and ended with the dow jones climbing back into the green and the s p 500 marking another record high while the tech powered nasdaq retreated 0 2 with some disappointing chinese data having been the catalyst for the weak start to the week the main focus today will be on more macro numbers with uk unemployment figures and us retail sales providing today s tea leaves to pore over the overriding theme on the markets is caution says market analyst jeffrey halley at oanda but balanced by the irresistible urge to buy the dip with the net results that across multiple asset classes markets are nervously marching on the spot looking at the uk labour market as we will be this morning the unemployment rate is forecast to remain at 4 8 for july but the overall picture has been improving and the bank of england was optimistic about the labour market in its latest meeting adjusting its outlook for unemployment to 5 2 for this year and then down to 4 7 in the second quarter of 2022 the claimant count rate has recovered from march s 7 2 to 5 8 in june as businesses continue to reopen with monthly claims expected to fall by another 84k from the 115k seen in june however it s worth watching for wobbles in the numbers now that we have the furlough scheme starting to wind down and businesses having to contribute more to the scheme we could well start to see further convergence between the monthly claim s numbers and the ilo measure of unemployment this could see the ilo measure edge higher as struggling businesses decide to let any remaining employees go suggesting that the next few months could be difficult ones for the labour market says hewson as for us retail he says these could go either way these numbers have been quite difficult to predict this year up one month and down the next in june we were expected to see a decline of 0 5 and ended up with a gain of 0 6 the market reaction could also be interesting with hewson noting that wall street is able to shrug off most of the negative news but that recent data does appear to show that some parts of the us economy are suffering a crisis of confidence the reaction to friday s sharp drop in university of michigan confidence to a ten year low was in sharp contrast to the recent broader us consumer confidence levels which in july saw a return to levels last seen pre pandemic a number that

horrifying scenes of desperate afghans lunging for the wheels of a u s military aircraft as it taxied for takeoff from kabul airport monday were juxtaposed with an eerie tension in much of the rest of afghanistan s capital where many huddled behind closed doors as taliban militants patrolled the streets in washington president biden called the scenes gut wrenching but he defended his order last april to begin a full withdrawal of u s troops from afghanistan in forceful tones i stand squarely behind my decision biden said in an address from the white house after 20 years of u s combat in afghanistan he said i ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw u s forces the result he said would have been the same five or 15 years from now blaming afghan political and military leaders who gave up in the face of a taliban offensive that swept the country in little more than a week he acknowledged that the capitulation did unfold more quickly than we anticipated related kabul airport plunges into chaos as taliban patrols afghan capital i know my decision will be criticized but i would rather take all that criticism than violate a campaign pledge and pass on an unwinnable war to yet another u s president biden said the criticism was flowing freely by the time biden spoke after a weekend at camp david where one republican lawmaker charged he had cowered while the taliban are humiliating america sen ben sasse r neb wrote the critique for the conservative national review under a headline that read worse than saigon advertisement the white house distributed talking points to democrats through the office of house speaker nancy pelosi d calif some while expressing alarm over what many called the tragedy in kabul echoed biden s comments president joe biden is cleaning up a mess left by three presidents before him sen ben cardin d md said in a statement george w bush failed to complete the mission in afghanistan and diverted resources to a new mission in iraq unrelated to 9 11 president barack obama wanted to pull troops out but couldn t find a way president donald trump announced a withdrawal invited the taliban to camp david on the eve of the 9 11 anniversary and cut secret deals with them leading directly to what we are seeing in afghanistan today cardin s statement said in speeches and statements from world capitals and the united nations official reactions ranged from trepidation to warnings to the taliban to wait and see shrugs in berlin german chancellor angela merkel called the unfolding drama bitter dramatic and terrifying while british defense secretary ben wallace appeared close to tears as he told a london radio interviewer that the inability to quickly evacuate all afghans eligible to come to britain was a really deep part of regret for me a number of nato governments have sent their own aircraft and troops to pick up diplomats citizens and afghan employees while nearly all global powers had signed on last week to international statements warning against a taliban takeover and pledging to cut off the group from recognition and aid at least some referenced the militants apparent restraint thus far at least in kabul as a reason to reconsider according to our reports the taliban have already sought to bring public order and have also confirmed security guarantees for civilians and for the diplomatic missions and staffs russia s ambassador to the united nations vasily nebenzya told a special session of the security council on monday in these circumstances the russian embassy in kabul is continuing to operate normally he said advertisement state department spokesman ned price said monday that the united states was still taking stock of the taliban s takeover of afghanistan and would decide whether to recognize its rule only if the militant group demonstrated a willingness to govern inclusively and prohibit terrorists from operating on its soil u n secretary general antónio guterres who attended the security council session urged the international community not to abandon the people of afghanistan biden after finishing his midafternoon address returned to camp david whatever immediate credit the president might have earned for the all but completed withdrawal of u s forces based in afghanistan was diluted by last week s new authorization to deploy at least 6 000 troops to secure the airport and evacuate u s and allied diplomats and citizens as well as afghans whose work for the americans over the past two decades puts them at risk while troops continued to arrive monday the taliban now securely in charge of the rest of kabul continued to stay away from the airport where the u s force controlled both the civilian and military sides and took over air traffic control but the spontaneous arrival there beginning sunday of what appeared to be thousands of afghans seeking to escape the country severely complicated the evacuation mission commercial flights initially seen as a way to hasten the departures were canceled as the gathering crowds spilled onto the runway where military cargo planes were trying to land load evacuating passengers and take off advertisement at least seven people were killed at the airport the associated press reported although the causes of the deaths were unclear pentagon spokesman john kirby said u s troops came under fire twice at the airport monday with a preliminary report that one service member was wounded a second u s official speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue said the service member appeared to be in stable condition the two gunmen were killed a second u s official said the u s military made at least one flight out of kabul during the day but even that was harrowing in a video distributed widely online a hulking air force c 17 gathered speed as afghans ran along side the plane and its jet engines some people climbed on a second viral video appeared to show two afghans falling to their deaths from the airborne plane the first official said that the u s military was assessing the situation and that the fall absolutely happened it is believed that the afghans climbed aboard the landing gear of the plane and attempted to stow away as it took off kirby speaking at a pentagon briefing said that u s troops worked with turkish forces and some other international troops to secure the airport and clear the runway military flights resumed later in the day as the chaos unfolded defense secretary lloyd austin acting on biden s deployment order last week authorized an additional army battalion with the 82nd airborne division to join the americans on the ground adding to the 6 000 troops expected to be there later this week advertisement on monday kirby said only about 2 500 troops were currently in afghanistan underscoring how the military was still catching up to the crisis the situation was challenging in part because of the layout of the airport thousands of americans including a small group of diplomats remaining behind as more than 1 000 americans working in the embassy waited to board evacuation planes are operating from a secure military encampment on its northern side that u s troops call hkia short for hamid karzai international airport the runway is between the military outpost and the commercial airport terminal to the south and desperate afghans have breached the runway from that side kirby said just a short distance from the airport taliban commanders were sending armed insurgents to direct traffic prevent looting encourage fearful afghans to go back to work and monitor a 9 p m curfew in an apparent effort to demonstrate their governing capabilities and avoid an international backlash at least until foreigners depart when the taliban arrived in kabul on sunday with armed fighters suddenly appearing in the streets some residents panicked rushing to banks to withdraw their money shuttering their shops and gathering their families others according to numerous videos posted online and on social media crowded around the insurgents denouncing the government of ashraf ghani and taking selfies in other provincial towns and cities overtaken in recent days there were reports of a return to the brutal ideology of the taliban of the 1990s including harsh dictates shuttered schools orders to women and girls to stay at home and worse advertisement but in many parts of downtown kabul on monday the day passed largely peacefully a sharp contrast to the airport chaos stores were largely shuttered although a trickle of people were going about their business services such as banks and government offices also were closed taliban fighters wove through traffic in pickup trucks bearing the group s white flag some of the fighters set up checkpoints while others posed for photos at the capital s most well known landmarks on some streets it appeared that little had changed women were out in colorful fashionable clothing portraits of anti taliban hero ahmed shah massoud were left undefiled and afghan national flags remained in place but it was unclear to many whether the apparent restraint by the taliban was a tactical move to allow foreigners to exit and lull the international community or a longer term policy many kabul residents speaking to reporters by telephone or online reported a sense of tense anticipation tolo news afghanistan s biggest nationwide television broadcaster said monday that militants had entered its compound in kabul checked the weapons of the security staff collected government issued weapons and agreed to keep the compound safe there was no improper treatment of staff members the organization reported on its english language website advertisement the network has continued to broadcast and publish online on its homepage tolo reported the chaos at the airport along with statements by foreign leaders warning the taliban against violence in doha qatar where former president ashraf ghani s government had grudgingly participated in u s midwifed negotiations with the taliban until last week u s marine gen kenneth frank mckenzie the chief of u s central command met with taliban political leaders who remain there defense officials declined to provide many specifics about their conversation but kirby said the general conveyed that if the taliban attacks the airport it will be met with a swift response from u s forces in kabul meanwhile a coordination committee that includes former president hamid karzai and ghani s peace negotiator abdullah abdullah and was formed to communicate with the taliban leadership indicated that things were proceeding toward a formal handover of power we are in touch with the leaders of the respected islamic taliban movement karzai said in a video statement we have positive discussions with them we talked about necessary matters our ongoing cooperation is very good abdullah in his own video said that our main effort at this juncture is to make sure the people of the city live in peace without any bloodshed we know that with the new developments people have been going through difficult times we hope that the contacts and talks we have had about this issue and other important issues of the country turn out to be useful he said noting that we are also in touch

where does the us economy go from here there are two clear views and they are almost diametrically opposed to one another and we are seeing the data swing from supporting one view to the other on an almost daily basis one view is that too much money is being pumped into the economy that inflation is now embedded at worryingly high levels the federal reserve is behind the curve and we need interest rate hikes soon the other is growth has already peaked and the negative impact of the new delta variant is yet to be seen in economic forecasts and that we may be facing into a slowdown what are the facts inflation today is indeed well above target and has policy makers on edge data for june shows prices up over 5 per cent compared to 12 months ago the us central bank s target is 2 per cent on average even taking out some of the more volatile elements like food and energy we still have a 4 per cent inflation rate in the us today by contrast here in ireland we re looking at 2 2 per cent and price increases of about 2 per cent for the euro area as a whole the key question is it temporary that s certainly the view of the administration and the federal reserve they believe that over the coming months improving supply chain bottle necks and continued re opening will ease this price pressure and many of the price increases are simply recapturing ground lost during the pandemic this means that the federal reserve despite admitting to being somewhat surprised by the higher prices can stick with its low interest rate policy however the inflation debate is becoming increasingly politicised as republicans highlight the rising cost of living for ordinary americans and raise concerns over a stagflating economy we should expect inflation to move up the political agenda importantly though surveys show that while consumers do expect higher prices in the near term longer term expectations remain anchored at just over the 2 per cent mark and what about economic growth figures for the second quarter of this year showed a very robust 6 5 per cent rate of growth however this was actually lower than forecasters had pencilled in consensus was expecting the number to be over 8 per cent while the us economy is now back to its pre pandemic level it is also past its peak rate of growth for this cycle looking into the second half of 2021 we will see a waning of the fiscal package that has been supporting workers and businesses through the crisis there has also been a knock to consumer confidence from the current surge in prices this paints a less positive picture for consumer spending overall but now added into this is the impact of the delta variant and the roll back we are seeing in the reopening process hospitalisations are back to mid february levels we have seen some companies push back on when they would look for staff to return to the office and major events like the new york auto show being cancelled all with a knock on effect on businesses reintroduction of face masks in some areas is also unnerving consumers vaccine hesitancy and breakthrough cases are both plausible causes of concern policy makers are alive to the threat delta could be for the overall economy at the recent meeting of the us federal reserve chairman jerome powell noted how they were monitoring impacts on restaurants and workplaces the fed s current view is that this is a manageable risk but slow downs in vaccination rates are a worry generally most current economic forecasts don t factor in a delta variant knock to the 2021 picture so if we see a continued upward drift in cases we could see a wave of economic downgrades it s clear we will see a loss of momentum in the us economy in the second half of this year the question is how much financial markets naturally are very focussed on whether the outlook is more towards fire surging inflation higher interest rates or ice slowing growth undermining profit forecasts economists seem quite divided however the general population is more clear on where the risks are a survey by monmouth university in new jersey last week pointed to inflation being the key concern for only 5 per cent of households while covid and the overall economy were the biggest concern for nearly 30 per cent of us households and in terms of where the real risks lay this seems about right

by lee min hyung the bank of korea bok is expected to raise its key interest rate in late august in a preemptive move to cushion the blow from snowballing household debt and surging home prices despite fears of the surging delta variant of covid 19 according to experts tuesday even though korea has continued to report four digit new infection cases over the past few weeks my view is that it is inevitable for the central bank to raise the key rate in august said korea university economist kim jin ill the central bank may freeze the rate if it is convinced that the coronavirus spread will come to an end soon but the reality shows otherwise according to kim this uncertainty is an uncontrollable external factor so it appears to be desirable for the bok to raise the rate this month to deal with concerns on a financial imbalance induced by the post pandemic near zero interest rate he said u s investment bank jpmorgan also forecast the bok will increase its benchmark rate to 0 75 percent at its upcoming aug 26 rate setting meeting we confirmed from the july monetary policy committee meeting minutes that the median view of the committee prefers an initiation of policy normalization in the near term which should imply hike action in august the bank s park seok gil said data from the financial services commission fsc show the country s household debt soared by 10 percent in july compared to the previous month this was primarily due to an unceasing craze for leveraged investing here industry observers noted citing the widening financial imbalance the central bank and financial authorities have in recent months sent repeated signals of a rate hike in july bok governor lee ju yeol said the monetary policy board would start discussing a possible adjustment in its year long monetary easing stance as early as august five out of six monetary board members at the bok excluding lee also underscored the need for monetary tightening during their latest meeting july 15 bank of korea governor lee ju yeol bangs a gavel during the last rate setting meeting at its headquarters in seoul july 15 yonhap

at an incredible cost the national assembly is again holding public hearing for a further amendment of the 1999 constitution of nigeria a scratch of the detail of nigeria s trauma since 2015 is necessary the country has long wobbled on the precipice of failure a few weeks ago the council on foreign relations cfr and the harvard kennedy school in the united states said in a report that nigeria as a nation is at the point of no return having showed all the signs of a failed nation upon giving examples of other failed states in the world the report added each lacks security is unsafe has weak rules of law is corrupt limits political participation and voice discriminates within its borders against various classes and kinds of citizens and provides educational and medical services sparingly most of all failed states are violent all failed states harbor some form of violent internal strife such as civil war or insurgency nigeria now confronts six or more internal insurrections and the inability of the nigerian state to provide peace and stability to its people has tipped a hitherto very weak state into failure the experience of nigerians since 2015 has been piercing before then nigeria was the third fastest growing economy in the world next to china and india with a growth rate of close to seven per cent the economy contracted immediately after the swearing in of president buhari who took more than six months to constitute his cabinet growth rate slumped to less than two per cent there have been two economic recessions since then the dollar value of the naira dipped as inflation and cost of living went to the blues inability of government to arrest the decline has led to loss of confidence in the government which has been overpowered by an unprecedented security challenges that made insurgency kidnapping bloodletting and sophisticated criminal activities daily characteristics of terribly beleaguered nation the retrogression could not be halted in 2019 in fact the economy slid into its second recession in 2020 this 2021 nigeria is ranked the third worst governed nation in new global good governance index the index uses 34 indicators which are organized into seven pillars leadership and foresight robust laws and policies strong institutions financial stewardship attractive marketplace global influence and reputation and helping people rise mali which is undergoing some political cataclysm and turmoil is currently ranked as being better governed than nigeria mauritius at number 38 on the log is africa s best performer the report noted that countries that have done well under this pillar are all market economies with sound property rights and stable business regulations it added that the ability to effectively tackle corruption is the indicator with the strongest correlation with overall good government rankings the good governance index said the ranking comes amid the covid 19 pandemic which has revealed strengths and weaknesses in institutions laws and leadership adding that governance is the deciding factor in whether countries succeed or not all these are not direct constitutional issues it is disturbing to note that nigeria is the third most terrorized country in the world next to afghanistan and iraq federal government actions presently are centered on cows cows are more secure in nigeria than nigerians and cow care givers are armed to the teeth to the knowledge of government authorities meanwhile apostles of cow liberty have not been able to show nigerians the value cows add to the economy as per how much tax is generated from cow business in nigeria employment opportunities they provide export platforms enhanced by cow rearing and its overall contribution to nigeria s gdp security challenges have gotten to the highest level in nigeria with bloodletting becoming normal insurgency kidnapping and sophisticated criminal activities are daily features of terribly beleaguered citizenry in the past few months about 2000 christian lives have been lost in various theatres of war in the country between december 2020 and march 2021 gangs of bandits seeking lucrative ransom kidnapped a total of 769 students from their boarding schools and other educational facilities across northern nigeria in at least five separate incidents leaders take sides with cows than with nigerians all these are not direct constitutional issues nigeria s public debt stock has reached 84billion with debt service costs gulping about 80 percent of entire government s revenue nigeria s external debt increased by 117 4 per cent from 12 6 billion in 2015 to 27 4 billion by the end of 2019 further between march and june 2020 a total of 10 26 billion new debt was approved by the national assembly other approvals for more loans were also given this 2021 these have ominous economic implications particularly with intangible evidence of what these funds are being invested in with low productivity of the nigerian workforce the federal government has no repayment plan will not be very hurtful to the unborn the burden is already very heavy the just published 2021 budget implementation report states that the federal government spent a total of n1 8 trillion on debt servicing in the first five months of the year representing about 98 per cent of the total revenue generated in the same period all these are not direct constitutional issues of the four presidents who have led nigeria since it returned to democracy in 1999 buhari holds the worst record in terms of economic growth olusegun obasanjo s regime from 1999 to 2007 had an average growth rate of 6 9 per cent his immediate successor umaru musa yar adua did even better in his two years with an average growth rate of 7 6 per cent while goodluck jonathan delivered 5 per cent growth rate in his six year term as president that ended in 2015 nigeria s gdp per capita declined by 0 02 per cent 4 16 per cent and 1 78 per cent in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2018 2019 and 2020 it declined by 0 68 per cent 0 38 per cent and 4 57 per cent six years of contracting per capita has wrecked grievous pain on businesses and households about 272 firms were forced out of business in 2016 alone and 50 of them were manufacturing companies all these are not direct constitutional issues even though the 1999 constitution of nigeria is a concoction and far from being a perfect one a candid analysis of the foregoing points would lead to an inescapable conclusion that the most vicious challenge plaguing nigeria is leadership deficit and it worsened under the buhari dispensation the 1999 constitution which is now twenty one years old requires a fundamental tinkering no doubt it is not responsible for the woes and disaster brought upon nigeria by the incompetence ineptitude insensitivity high handedness and nepotism of mohammad buhari he lacks the leadership acumen by which previous leaders managed to effectively conceal the deficiencies in the constitution to blame the 1999 constitution for all the agony and misfortune that president buhari brought upon nigerians is most improper president buhari must be congratulated because he has set a new guinness world record he became the first elected president of a country to become resident of another nation while still in power when he spent months in london on medical vacation according to the us job report from the united states department of labour the us economy added 1 074 000 under president trump while according to the nigerian bureau of statistics the nigerian economy lost 4 58 million jobs in president buhari s first year at no point in its 60 year history has nigeria s economy expanded slower than its population for a longer period than between 2015 and 2020 data from the national bureau of statistics nbs shows a 1 9 per cent contraction in 2020 while none of the three previous presidents had nothing less five percent growth rate buhari achieved 0 28 percent nigeria s woes under buhari are not constitutional issues he is simply a harbinger of disaster and appears to be in a mission to liquidate nigeria it is important to note that one of the most outstanding superpowers in the world today and one of the five permanent members of the security council of the united nations great britain which has attained dignified economic and political heights of greatness and colonized fifty four countries of the world has no written constitution up to now the population of great britain by 2011 estimate is 60 8million apart from the world wars which that country fought gallantly and won they have not experienced the nature of political upheavals nigeria has faced or is presently confronted with two other countries that go by unwritten constitutions are new zealand and israel these three countries have not suffered suffocating development impediments because there are no codified documents they can call their constitutions they are amongst the most prosperous countries of the world fairly peaceful and politically stable they are not cursed with looters who parade as leaders and tribesman who borrow the garments of national patriots neither has any straggler polluted the streams of their governance to unleash backwardness penury insecurity and bloodletting as reward to their ignorant voters china with the world s largest population of 1 4 billion is a marxist leninist one party socialist republic her constitution is the fifth and current constitution of the republic of china ratified on december 25 1946 and adopted on december 25 1947 the additional articles of the constitution of the republic of china are the revisions and constitutional amendments to the original constitution to meet the requisites of the nation and the political status of taiwan the additional articles are usually attached after the original constitution as a separate document it also has its own preamble and article ordering different from the original constitution the additional articles are the fundamental law of the present government of the republic of china on taiwan since 1991 last amended in 2005 between 1947 and april 30 1991 there were only temporary provisions against communist rebellion up to 1978 china s annual growth rate was a modest 2 percent and her leaders considered it imperative to reform the economy not amending the constitution thus underlining the need for dynamic leadership the reform centred on opening up the economy the reforms were launched by reformists within the chinese communist party ccp on december 18 1978 the reforms went into stagnation after the military crackdown on 1989 tiananmen square protests but were revived after deng xiaoping s southern tour in 1992 in 2010 china overtook japan as the world s second largest economy before the reforms the chinese economy was dominated by state ownership and central planning from 1950 to 1973 chinese real gdp per capita grew at a rate of 2 9 per cent yearly on average albeit with major fluctuations stemming from the great leap forward and the cultural revolution this placed it near the middle of the asian nations during the same period with neighboring capitalist countries such as japan south korea and rival chiang kai shek s republic of china outstripping the prc s rate of growth starting in 1970 the economy entered into a period of stagnation and after the death of ccp chairman mao zedong the communist party leadership turned to market oriented reforms to salvage the failing economy the communist party authorities executed two stage market reforms the first stage in the late 1970s and early 1980s involved the de collectivization of agriculture the opening up of the country to foreign investment and permission for entrepreneurs to start businesses however a large percentage of industries remained state owned the second stage of reform in the late 1980s and 1990s involved the privatization and contracting out of much state owned industry the 1985 lifting of price controls was a major reform and the lifting of protectionist policies and regulations soon followed although state monopolies in sectors such as banking and petroleum remained in 2001 china joined the world trade organization wto the private sector grew remarkably accounting for as much as 70 percent of china s gross domestic product by 2005 from 1978 until 2013 unprecedented growth occurred with the economy increasing by 9 5 per cent a year these elements of growth are the outcomes of quality transformational leadership not constitutional amendment olehi is an owerri based legal practitioner after economic reforms in 1978 and her entry into the world trade organization in 2001 china s economy became the second largest country by nominal gdp in 2010 and grew to the largest in the world by ppp in 2014 china is the world s fastest growing major economy the second wealthiest nation in the world and the world s largest manufacturer and exporter the nation has the second largest defense budget and is a recognized nuclear weapons state china has been characterized as an emerging superpower due to its large economy foreign trade became a major new focus leading to the creation of special economic zones inefficient state owned enterprises were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright modern day china is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism that country s astonishing economic growth and development with terrific global impact are outcomes of technology innovation and entrepreneurship not constitutional amendment president buhari s lack of capacity to manage of nigeria s diversity his incompetence in handling the complexity of modern governance his clumsiness in grappling with the sophisticated challenges of development and his feeble approach to complex dynamics of global politics plunged nigeria to her current abyss and are strictly speaking not constitutional issues his abysmal poor performance does not arise from defects in the 1999 constitution after all former presidents obasanjo yar adua and jonathan served under the same constitution the pains of buhari s sordid misgovernance is the root of agitations from various regions in nigeria and the unnecessary protraction and indeed escalation of insecurity challenges in nigeria three other presidents have been there and they did not bring so much calamity backwardness and shame to nigeria as the citizen s face currently nigeria is certainly too big and complex for him to manage indeed president buhari s inglorious leadership has brought to the fore certain inadequacies in the 1999 constitution but what aggravates the pain nigerians are going through under buhari is the attitude of state governors for instance section 7 of the constitution creates democratically elected local government councils and gives the state governments the mandate to ensure their existence but the local governments have become moribund and their headquarters overgrown with weeds even when each of the 774 local government councils receive monthly allocations from the federal government through their state governors who cannot give account what the funds are being utilized for each local government council can generate enough income and employ not less than five hundred additional staff if the governors allow them to perform their functions in clearly spelt out in schedule iv of the same constitution the 1999 constitution expects that people will elect honest persons as governors who will not misappropriate local government funds if we nigerian elect thieves who will kill the councils so that their funds will be available for looting it will be wrong to blame the said constitution with the nexus between sustainable economic development and the rule of law each state government is in a position to attract foreign direct investment and industrialize his state if the funds meant for the judiciary are not misappropriated by the governors private sector can flourish in the states if there is an environment of accountability transparency and rule of law because these attract the confidence of investors in the economy and open up same to the vibrancy of entrepreneurship innovations and technology governors play to the gallery as they do not bother about real sector economic growth they are averse to the development axiom that that the key to stability is jobs the key to jobs is investment and the key to investment is rule of law the governors disregard the interconnectedness amongst humans in the global village and what the villages they govern can bring to the global market square there are no significant constitutional impediments to transformational and sustainable economic development by state governments their stand against democracy was strongly shooting when it took them more than two months to sign agreements with judiciary staff union of nigeria to apply provisions of the constitution they swore to uphold in ensuring autonomy for the judiciary during the just suspended industrial action all these point to the assertion that leadership must be addressed before restructuring which from all indications requires a fundamental constitutional amendment the question has come up severally whether it should be further amending the 1999 constitution or getting a brand new constitution in responding to this many have opined that the 1999 constitution is the product of a military decree not the peoples constitution and accordingly the falsehood it declares in its preamble that we the people of the federal republic nigeria having firmly and solemnly resolved to lie in unity and harmony justifies throwing it into the refuse bin according to the proponents of that view the people of nigeria never met anywhere to make any resolution it must be stressed that the validity or otherwise of the constitution of a nation raises a jurisprudential question and makes it imperative to re examine the legality of coups which brought the military that eventually gave birth to the said 1999 constitution upon the success of a coup its organizers metamorphose into the federal military government which makes a decree suspending and or modifying the provisions of the constitution that are inconsistent with the military political structure the federal military government performs both the legislative and executive powers of government thus the federal military government shall have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of nigeria or any part thereof with respect to any matter whatsoever the power of the federal military government to promulgate decrees shall be exercised by means of decrees signed by the head of the federal military government the federal government is legislatively omnipotent it can promulgate with unexpected swiftness any decree at pleasure amend abrogate or replace current ones thus its authority is supreme where a formal constitution is established it is subject to the absolute and supreme power of the military government the military government is the source from which such constitution drives its authority and at whose sufferance it must therefore operate having gotten to this stage the constitutionality is no longer questionable a coup d etat is a forcible overthrow of a government duly established by a constitution it is a preternatural occurrence a detestable socio political aberration a constitutional anathema its only claim to legitimacy lies in the bayonet and bullet but ironically it is termed a revolution if it succeeds achike also sees a revolution or a coup d etat as a violent or unlawful change of government a coup is therefore the antithesis of a constitutional change of government however violence or peacefulness of a take over has no juristic significance just as whether the change was prompted by highly patriotic impulse or by most sordid of ends is legally irrelevant in their crave for legitimacy organizers of coups or revolutions overthrow the government and replace the supreme law of the land that is the constitution which is the suprema lex with their decree to establish a new framework it must be noted that coups or revolutions not being consistent or authorized secured or regulated by the constitution but conflicts with say section 1 2 of the 1979 constitution as amended which provided that the federal republic of nigeria shall not be governed nor shall any person or group of persons take control of the government of nigeria or any part thereof except in accordance with the provisions of this constitution but the point is there no constitution to relate the legality of a successful coup or revolution to its own legality is judged not by reference to the annulled constitution but by reference to its own success according to hans kelson this is because if in this they are successful if that is the old government ceases and the new begins to be effective in that the behavior of the men and women for whom the order claims to be valid conforms in the main no longer to the old but the new order then this latter is operated as a legal order the acts which it performed are declared legal the condition which it proscribes illegal precisely it is the success of the coup that establishes its legality and the test of its validity is its efficacy the effect of such uncontemplated change is the birth of a new legal order predicated upon a fresh grundnorm or basic norm which destroys the suprema lex and the validity of the pre existing national legal order the grundnorm in any legal system is a grand indispensable postulate to which all the roads of the law lead by however devious routes this fortifies the view that in revolutionary situation the law is not to be sought for in the books but in the events that surround us the constitution is the basic norm not the grundnorm in kelson s view which majority of the scholars agree with the basic norm constitutes the unity in diversity of all norms which make up the system it is the fundamental condition of law making conferring validity on other inferior norms ipso facto a grundnorm cannot be a visible or tangible object like a constitution hans kelson posits that the grundnorm is not created by a real act of will of a legal organ but is presupposed in juristic thinking it is meta legal and has hypothetical character the validity of the grundnorm is presupposed because without this presupposition no human act could be interpreted as legal especially as norm creating act kelson admits and we cannot hold a contrary opinion that under a military dispensation it is force success and efficacy that are the conditio sine qua non for the validity of every norm and therefore constitute the grundnorm 32 efficacy is the assent or support of the people which is manifested by popular conformance to the new order that is to say that it is the conformance of the people that lends efficacy to the organizers of the coup or revolution and this is the grundnorm that confers validity to the first legislative act of the organizers of the coup or revolution the function of this grundnorm is to confer law creating power on the first act that is decree no 1 of 1984 for instance and any other law that it saves success of a coup or revolution and conformance to their orders constitute the grundnorm which confers legitimacy to their legislative actions once their first legislative act decree 1 is unchallenged every other decree that follows is valid and legitimate indeed the 1999 constitution is a schedule to constitution of the federal republic of nigeria promulgation decree no 24 of 1999 section 1 thereof provides 1 there shall be for nigeria a constitution which shall be set out in the schedule to this decree 2 the constitution set out in the schedule to this decree shall come into force on may 29 1999 3 whenever it may be hereafter be necessary for the constitution to be printed it shall be lawful for the federal government printer to omit all parts of this decree apart from the schedule and the constitution so printed shall have the force of law notwithstanding the omission nigerians have since been conforming to all decrees from the military since 1984 and that lent legitimacy to military s actions judging by the foregoing jurisprudential analysis it is too late to contend otherwise this could precipitate an unprecedented constitutional crisis if all activities of governance from 1999 till date are annulled because there was no valid constitution this grundnorm is always adapted to the prevailing state of affairs and only imparted validity and legitimacy to decree no 1 and the unsuspended provisions of the 1979 constitution and the validity and legitimacy flowed through to decree no 24 of 1999 which is the current constitution and all other norms derived from them it does not dictate their content section 14 2 a of the 1999 constitution as amended provides that sovereignty belongs to the people of nigeria from whom government through this constitution derives all its powers and authority the constitution does not donate sovereignty to the people rather the people donate a part of their sovereign rights to the government for their security and welfare the constitution cannot and does not prescribe how the rest of their sovereign power can be exercised when the people exercise their sovereign rights negatively and in being docile or conforming to an aberration they bear the consequences civic tameness and passivity are other aspects of negative exercise of sovereign power a people can stand strongly against what they detest the people cannot stand aloof and watch nigeria decapitated and expect an automatic reversal of the evil a good example of the sovereign power of the people is the 1991 soviet failed coup or revolution the 1991 soviet coup d état was an attempt to take control of the country from soviet president and general secretary mikhail gorbachev they were opposed by an effective campaign of civil resistance by the people the coup collapsed in only two days and mikhail gorbachev returned to power armour units of the tamanskaya division and the kantemirovskaya tank division rolled into moscow along with paratroops but the citizens began to gather around the white house russia s parliament building and to erect barricades around it the defenders of the white house prepared themselves most of them being unarmed against the military assault on the white house and its environs which as planned would gather elite special force units with the support of the paratroopers moscow omon other internal troops three tank companies and a helicopter squadron white house trolleybuses and street cleaning machines barricaded a tunnel against oncoming taman guards infantry fighting vehicles ifvs only three of these gallant citizens were killed in the incident as the troops escaped that was how the people used their sovereign power to stop the national embarrassment that the coup represented this speaks volumes of the great lessons on support and conformance of the people as the inevitable condition for the success of a coup or revolution demonstrated by their civil resistance civil disobedience achieves similar results the foregoing underlines the critical but unwritten and unprohibited sovereign power of the people by which they re engineer the socio economic and political wrongs that incompetence ignorance and nepotism can inflict on a population buhari s team spent four years of their tenure blaming pdp during which time economy plunged to abyss unwittingly nigerians are unwholesomely blaming the 1999 constitution some have alleged that the said constitution was written by one person and foisted on nigerians by a military government first hans kelson afore mentioned is the principal author of the 1920 austrian constitution which to a very large degree is still valid till today hans kelson had a jewish ancestry and even after writing the said constitution he subsequently left austria to acquire the citizenship of another country these circumstances did not affect the validity of that constitution austria today is one of the most industrialized countries of the world with a gdp per capita of 50 277 secondly from the jurisprudential analysis above nigerians cannot begin now to challenge the 1999 constitution after wholehearted conformance to its provisions under the presidencies obasanjo yar adua and jonathan the truth is that if the country is to remain an indivisible and indissoluble sovereign nation a new nigeria must emerge from the rubbles of the present to engender a nation that is inter alia productive competitive and self dependent underlying any constitutional step in this regard is entrenching true federalism nigeria may not survive if this is not achieved now president buhari has always given low price of crude oil and the effect of covid 19 as reasons for his abysmal performance as if every economy in the world infested with the pandemic crashed the way nigeria system did the global competiveness index varies between 1 and 100 higher average score means higher degree of competitiveness nigeria as usual is at the rear with the 2018 edition the world economic forum introduced a new methodology aiming to integrate the notion of the 4th industrial revolution into the definition of competitiveness it emphasizes the role of human capital innovation resilience and agility as not only drivers but also defining features of economic success in the 4th industrial revolution the speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent when compared with previous industrial revolutions the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than linear pace moreover it is disrupting almost every industry in every country and the breadth and the depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production management and governance buhari has no idea of what to do in spite of the dormant national digital economy policy and strategy 2020 2030 the emptiness and ineptitude of the buhari administration is more baffling upon a comparative budget analysis of some countries usually nigeria has a smaller national budget than algeria angola egypt libya morocco and south africa all these countries have fewer citizens yet significantly spend more money on them nigeria s 2019 budget amounted to 29 billion at the then exchange rate that hovered around 1 to n400 naira but south africa with a population of almost four times smaller budgeted 130 billion for the same period egypt had a 90 billion budget with 100 million even countries like pakistan bangladesh and vietnam had larger budgets than nigeria lagos nigeria s richest city had a modest budget of n485 billion which was less than 2 4 billion to spend on 15 to 20 million residents johannesburg has double that budget for fewer than 5 million people buhari has no plan to generate the momentum that will drive nigeria to this height ghana was reputed to be the world s fastest growing economy in 2018 with her real gdp growth at market prices at 8 3 per cent cote d ivoire with 7 2 per cent and senegal with 6 9 per cent are two other countries from west africa in the first ten fastest growing economies in the world ghana s economy represents a rising digital based hybrid economy driven by manufacturing and export of various digital tech goodies as well as assembly and export of ships and automobiles moreover that country is also rich in industrial minerals and even exports massive quantity of hydrocarbons the booming real estate sector there is another major factor behind ghana s high growth in the economic sector extreme leadership deficit and therefore appalling governance have consigned nigeria to the waste bin of life as she lags behind in all development indices evidenced by her 2017 accolade as the world s poverty capital the country s leaders are not bothered that they have dragged the nation to economic doom as tribal and religious considerations make them focus on cow economy nigerians are gasping for breath and time is running out as the leadership continually shows an embarrassing ineptitude and arrant insensitivity economic prospects at the continental level as have been predicted by international financial and development agencies are expected to be high but buhari does not care that nigeria is nowhere to be found as per the market reports the continent is forecasted to witness a rise in gdp by 6 per cent annually between 2013 and 2023 the recent growth in the economic sphere of the continent can be credited to the increasing youth populace here as well as enhanced sales in services commodity and manufacturing africa has six of the world s ten fastest growing economies in 2018 according to the world bank nigeria was not among them and she was simply dismissed as still experiencing negative per capita income growth weak investment and a decline in productivity growth many foreign companies operating in nigeria either drastically reduced staff strength or relocated to attractive economies where those governments cared for their citizens buhari s lame excuse of fluidity of oil prices and covid 19 as the cause of the disaster he has brought to nigeria cannot be acceptable in the light of the foregoing in a 2005 study the world bank said the totality of the wealth of a nation has three key inputs the nation s produced wealth e g infrastructure natural wealth e g oil and gas and intangible wealth e g human capital and quality of institutions the bank declared further that worldwide natural capital accounts for five per cent of total wealth while produced capital and intangible capital account for 18 per cent and 77 per cent of total wealth respectively making intangible capital in fact the true wealth component of wealthy nations it discovered that the total economic value of natural assets was 44 trillion worldwide or 7 000 per person on average while intangible capital accounted for the greatest component of total wealth worth a massive 540 trillion worldwide it is worthy of note that the richest countries of the oecd are characterized by high intangible capital and low natural capital while the poorest countries of sub sahara africa are characterized by high natural capital and lower intangible capital the study underlined human capital development strong institutions and rule of law as the driving tools for optimizing access to intangible capital these are the keys that triggered switzerland a landlocked country with no single natural resource to the peak of global wealth to buhari human capital is cow and that is why he is working hard to make cows live in every home in the south of nigeria therefore he has no plans for strong institutions and rule of law buhari s lame excuse of the fluidity of oil prices and covid 19 as the cause of the disaster he has brought to nigeria cannot be acceptable in the light of the foregoing these are outcomes of good leadership and accountable governance there are no constitutional impediments today in nigeria why nigeria cannot be set on the path to glory and the clamor for constitutional amendment all over nigeria is simply giving buhari and escape route the numerous calls for self determination in nigeria are essentially reactions against buhari s grave abysmal failure president buhari not the 1999 constitution as amended has put nigeria on a keg of gunpowder and the consequences are catastrophic olehi is an owerri based legal practitioner

after 1 trillion in green bonds have moved through the world s development banks bond markets and corporate balance sheets since 2008 the united states treasury and european union have discussed issuing new green bonds to finance recovery from the covid 19 pandemic you are perhaps asking yourself why do green bonds matter it is not as if i am investing in the world bank or european investment bank how does this financial innovation affect me or my company one answer is that as they gain volume green bonds are entering most climate finance scenarios many private and public companies are issuing their own green bonds to raise capital for climate mitigation and attract new shareholders several countries such as germany france and the netherlands have recently issued sovereign green bonds as well additionally many energy or utility companies around the world have issued their own green bonds in order to build renewable energy projects still many investors are wary of investing in green bonds because of the opaque ways entities can spend their raised capital without proper government regulations any private or public entities in the united states of america can raise capital through green bonds and not be penalized if they do not spend their raised funds in environmentally friendly projects this relative paucity of standards for value legitimacy and structure should give novice investors and issuers some pause many countries too are issuing green bonds before they have finalized what makes a bond green or what makes a green investment bondable india became the first country in south asia to introduce green bonds in 2015 through yes bank a private banking institution yes bank issued its first series of green bonds to finance environmentally friendly projects worth about 67 million additionally it issued 81 million worth of green bonds for china light and power clp in india one of the largest utility companies in the world clp india raised 81 million to construct the rampur hydropower project which provides electricity to northern india currently it produces about 2 gigawatts annually soon after these endeavors the indian government implemented green bond guidelines based on the green bond principles created by the international market association icma the relative paucity of standards for value legitimacy and structure should give novice investors and issuers some pause china is the largest green bond market in the world because the government is subsidizing or financially assisting private companies the climate bonds initiative has studied this support in contrast with the lack of regulations and oversight by the american government in the green bond market china has created a set of regulations through its national development and reform commission to regulate the green bond market the regulations are loosely based on the green bond principles from international capital market association several experts agree that china s regulations are cumbersome due to layers of bureaucracy and administrative work that needed to be completed before a private green bond is launched yet it can seem as though the prevalent alternative provides no oversight according to moody s sustainable bond issuance hit a record of 650 billion in 2021 after doubling in 2020 the global estimation of all the green bonds that have been issued has shot past 1 trillion aside from basic anti fraud regulations such as rule 10b 5 issued by the united states securities and exchange commission for all bonds there are no specific guidelines nor oversight for green bonds in the u s to earn the trust of investors several public and private companies that are issuing green bonds have enlisted third party verification in november 2019 apple launched its first green bond aimed at financing projects that have positive environmental impacts with the goal of reducing the carbon footprint associated with apple s own operations and more broadly across its entire value chain in december apple engaged sustainalytics to review the projects funded through the issued green bonds to date and provide an assessment as to whether the projects met the use of proceeds criteria and the reporting commitments outlined in the apple green bond framework this is boilerplate language that the ratings firm has used in other clients reports too with the support of sustainalytics apple created a set of guidelines for allocating capital collected from the issuance of green bonds to low carbon design and engineering energy efficiency renewable energy carbon mitigation and carbon sequestration the increasing pressure from consumers for becoming carbon neutral is causing international corporations such as apple to use green bonds in order to hedge the risks inherent in adopting components of a circular economy into their business models local government agencies such as new york state s metropolitan transportation authority have tried similar disclosure but do templates from for profit and locally accountable issuers translate to a national green bond standard at least in green minded eu agencies decision makers are crafting new standards the eu s technical expert group on sustainable finance has drafted green bond policies and the eu may pass those regulations as part of their 2021 green economic recovery according to bloomberg the green bond guidelines finalized by the eu may not be mandatory thus raising concerns of greenwashing occurring in public and corporate green bonds in 2020 china released its latest green bond catalogue in which it removed clean coal use coal fired powerplants coal mining and coal washing from their green bond standards thus bringing china into closer alignment with international standards yet aside from the basic protections offered by the sec there is no special oversight or regulations for the global green bond market that may change according to william sokol product manager of etfs at vaneck overarching regulation is needed for green bonds in order for the investor and issuer to feel safe even a few regulations from the sec about green bonds would give investors confidence because they will feel that it is a legitimate source of investment and that it is overseen by the government proper definitions from the sec about what green bond means and what activities constitute as green for green bonds will greatly help issuers to grow the market without sparking concerns of greenwashing sokol also argues that in order to truly boost confidence in green bonds the u s treasury has to issue its own sovereign green bonds thus signaling to the world that america is serious about mitigating climate change others argue that it s time for the market to gain stricter rules than the nonbinding guidelines currently in force robert fernandez director of esg research at breckinridge capital advisors said social and sustainability bonds similar to green bonds are being issued with a greenium with that price increase he adds that the lack of federal guidelines for use of proceeds from the issuance of green bond creates an issue if an issuer does not follow through on commitments investors have no recourse to the issuer except for selling the security if the investor has lost confidence in the issuer he sees sustainability linked bonds as a type of instrument that can be used to penalize issuers and further compensate investors if preset goals such as a reduction in ghg emissions are not reached during the term of the bond the green bond market will grow rapidly with or without government guidelines though u s treasury secretary janet yellen is hinting that treasury will issue its own sovereign green bonds leading me to consider green bond issuance and trading as a promising long term sector currently the green bond market is only 1 percent to 2 percent share of the overall global bond market but with proper non cumbersome regulations the number of issuers of green bonds and the number of investors investing in green bonds will increase rapidly with the hottest summer on record again green bonds have emerged as a popular method of financing standards and disclosure can make them a more effective bank for a pathway into a sustainable future

since november the chinese regime has taken several steps to restrict the operations of some of the country s largest private tech companies such as alibaba and tencent hitting the fortunes of the multi billionaire magnates that control them last week china s state council and the chinese communist party s ccp central committee issued a joint policy statement calling for legislation to codify the measures it declared there was an urgent need for additional laws to regulate the digital economy and internet finance to ensure new business models develop in a healthy manner the measures have provoked growing concern in the western press because of plunges in share values of tech companies in which global managed funds and other foreign companies have heavily invested bloomberg calculated that the combined share values of the giant tech corporations at the beginning of july had fallen by a massive us823 billion since their february peaks according to the financial times since the start of july beijing s regulatory assault on china s technology industry had lopped 87 billion off the net worth of the sector s wealthiest tycoons moves against the tech giants began when the chinese regulators cancelled what was set to be the worlds largest ever initial public offering ipo for alibaba s financial services subsidiary ant group on the shanghai and hong kong stock exchanges in november the ipo was about to raise 34 billion eclipsing the 29 4 billion listing of the energy giant saudi aramco in 2019 at the same time an anti monopoly cause was launched against alibaba that resulted in a 2 8 billion fine in april its founder jack ma at the time china s richest billionaire who had made remarks critical of chinese financial regulation went to ground for weeks it has become clear this year that the government was not just engaged in a vendetta against ma the online food delivery company meituan lost 40 billion of its market value after the state regulators opened an investigation into its suspected monopolistic practices alleging that it was forcing restaurants to use its app exclusively to the detriment of its rivals last month its shares plunged further after authorities instituted rules to provide limited protection to the notoriously exploited delivery workers the internet ride hailing company didi china s equivalent to uber proceeded with its ipo in new york in june despite a request by chinese regulators to call it off days later authorities ordered a security review of the firm amid concerns that the us listing could provide foreign access to its vast store of personal data it was banned from taking new customers and mobile phone stores were ordered to remove its apps the regulatory targets have not been just tech companies the chinese government announced new regulations on july 23 for the online education industry banning ipos and forcing companies to operate as non profit bodies shares in the three largest us listed chinese companies tal education new oriental and gaotu techedu fell precipitously in late july chinese anti trust authorities ordered the giant internet corporation tencent to give up its exclusive music licencing rights and fined it over its acquisition of china music in 2016 the purchase gave tencent exclusive control of more than 80 percent of music library resources placing rivals at unfair advantage according to regulators the response in the financial media has been increasingly frantic an article this month in the new york magazine declared the ccp s brand of capitalism had never been milton friedman s but it had been decades since the party had displayed such communist characteristics an opinion piece by financial speculator george soros in the wall street journal last friday denounced chinese president xi jinping as a dictator whose regulatory campaign threatens to destroy the geese that lay the golden eggs xi is not about to overturn chinese capitalism nor is the regime implementing communist measure it is not out to destroy the super wealthy oligarchs such as jack ma and tencent s pony ma whom it helped to create and with whom it has had close relations rather the regulatory efforts to rein in the sprawling tech empires reflect fears in ruling circles in beijing about the country s extreme social tensions and mounting economic and financial crisis these concerns found expression late last year when xi announced that 2021 would mark the beginning of a new development phase that would prioritise common prosperity national security and social stability over unrestrained growth fears in beijing over social stability stem from the widening gulf between rich and poor that has resulted from decades of capitalist restoration at one extreme are the billionaires and multi billionaires who in some cases are members of the ccp or have been delegates to the annual national people s congress at the other extreme are large sections of working people struggling to survive last year premier li keqiang told a press conference that some 600 million people exist on a monthly income of just 1 000 yuan 154 which is not enough to rent a home in a mid sized city let alone cover other expenses social distress which has been compounded by the measures necessary to control the covid 19 pandemic is among the factors fuelling a political radicalisation particularly among young people in a comment last month hailing to mark the centenary of the ccp s founding chinese academic and venture capitalist eric li noted that unlike his generation that focussed on getting rich china s youth today are increasingly critical of capitalism li wrote significant signs show that chinese young people s perception of capital and market have turned negative and their support for socialism and communism have increased markedly for example on bilibili china s leading video social media for young people content with communism marxism capital and labor became most popular in 2020 with increases greater than any other content even in the extraordinarily entrepreneurial tech sector calls by young people for stopping excessive exploitations both of lowly paid delivery workers and more highly compensated but overworked technical and professional workforces are becoming louder li who is an enthusiastic supporter of the ccp maintained that the party was capable of responding to these concerns no doubt the targeting of high profile billionaires is calculated to appeal to widespread hostility to widening social inequality as are the moves to limit the gross exploitation of casual delivery workers the transformation of the giant private education corporations into non profit organisations is likely to be popular among parents concerned to ensure the best for their children in the highly competitive education system the ccp regime however is not reining in the thousand or so chinese billionaires spawned by capitalist restoration across the board manufacturers have increased in value the richest man in china is zhong shanshan who controls the bottled water company nongfu spring and whose wealth stands at more than 70 billion up by 5 billion since june the country s nine richest auto magnates have increased their collective wealth by 22 billion since july while the eight billionaires who dominate the renewable energy sector saw their collective riches rise by 13 6 billion during the same period through their internet payment systems and provision of credit the tech corporations however had become huge financial operations that function without the restraints maintained on the large state owned banks in 2020 alibaba tencent and ant had a combined market capitalisation of nearly 2 trillion far greater that the state owned banks such as the industrial commercial bank of china in his public criticisms last october at the bund summit in shanghai jack ma lashed out at the strong pawnshop mentality of chinese banks that demanded collateral and guarantees before lending he called for reform to create a new inclusive and universal banking system for small businesses and individuals through the various arms of alibaba ma had created a massive financial empire and was effectively demanding a further removal of regulatory restraints alibaba established alipay as an online payment platform in 2004 by 2018 it had an estimated 870 million users accounted for about 60 percent of the third party payment market in china and provided some 300 billion in credit for business and consumer loans as well as alipay alibaba s ant financial services provided micro financial services at high interest rates through various operations such as yu ebao ant credit pay ant cash now and sesame credit in some cases in league with provincial governments seeking ways to circumvent central financial controls amid fears about the already high levels of debt and the potential for financial instability the ccp apparatus took action against alibaba and ma the moves were also driven by political concerns that ma and other tech magnates were closely associated with foreign capital and could use their resources including their vast accumulations of data to undermine or challenge ccp rule according a list published late last year by the chinese financial magazine caixin overseas shareholders in ant held 52 percent of shares of which financial groups on wall street and in london accounted for half in march ma was ordered to divest himself of various media outlets such as the south china morning post the unregulated financial operations of the tech corporations also threatened to generate social instability in an essay entitled china s economic reckoning the price of failed reforms in foreign affairs daniel rosen explained in the early 2010s these firms were given a free hand by party technocrats who hoped that financial innovations would force ossified state owned banks to become more productive this succeeded at least in fits and starts the new firms made the financial system work for previously underserved customers but innovation also came with new risks such as peer to peer lending platforms that offered high rates to depositors and even higher rates to borrowers when many of the borrowers defaulted investors protested believing erroneously that the platforms were guaranteed by the government in august 2018 thousands of people showed up in the heart of beijing s financial district to demand compensation a regulatory crackdown on peer to peer lenders commenced in a prelude to this year s scrutiny of ant group the ccp s attempt to rein in the free wheeling operations of some of the country s largest corporations is not a sign of strength rather it points to the extent of the economic social and political crisis building up in china that will erupt in the not too distant future

manila philippines the proposed measure which seeks to reinstitute absolute divorce as an alternative mode of dissolution of marriage is now up for plenary debates in the house of representatives this developed after the house committee on population and family relations unanimously approved the still unnumbered substitute bill during its meeting on tuesday advertisement albay rep edcel lagman one of the measure s authors said the bill states that justifications for legal separation annulment of marriage and nullification of marriage based on psychological incapacity under the family code of the philippines are included as grounds for absolute divorce other bases for divorce include the following separation in fact for at least five years at the time the petition for absolute divorce is filed when one of the spouses undergoes a gender reassignment surgery or transitions from one sex to another irreconcilable marital differences as defined in the bill domestic or marital abuse valid foreign divorce secured by either the alien or filipino spouse and a marriage nullified by a recognized religious tribunal lagman said absolute divorce would void the marital union of a couple and allow them to re marry this bill reinstates absolute divorce because absolute divorce was already practiced during the pre spanish times the american colonial period and during the japanese occupation he said in his sponsorship speech further lagman pointed out that the philippines is the only country in the world that outlaws absolute divorce aside from the vatican city state it is hard to believe that all the other countries collectively erred in instituting absolute divorce in varying degrees of liberality and limitations he said an en masse blunder is beyond comprehension an erroneous unanimity on such a crucial familial institution defies reason and experience obviously the rest of the world cannot be mistaken on the universality of absolute divorce he added kga
recent economic data suggests that us consumers are starting to pull away from the types of buying spending activities we saw after the covid virus event that shifted the us economy away from travel office and towards work from home solutions the deep decline in the us and global economic indicators as a result of the covid 19 shutdown prompted an incredible recovery rally phase in the markets that had everyone chasing the uptrend in stocks housing prices and other assets now that we are beyond 15 months after the march 2020 covid lows a new dynamic may be setting up in the markets consumers trends may shift expectations over the next 6 months consumers services make up nearly 70 of gdp activity any shift in how consumers feel about the us global economy may translate into extended market trends and reflect in other economic data going forward in recent research articles we ve highlighted how the extended rally phase in the markets continues to push higher in a melt up type of trend yet current data is starting to show a shift in how consumers are reacting to this extended trend the us global markets may be setting up for a big shift away from this continued rally phase one concept i want to remind traders of is the continuing normalization of market trends indicators as the post covid 19 recovery continues the extreme rally phase that has taken place after the extreme lows resulting from the covid 19 global shutdowns is likely to transition into more normalized trending through a process called a dampening sine wave this process may prompt a fairly big downward economic trend resulting from month over month and year over year data trending lower for the next 6 to 12 months as the data shifts throughout the sine wave process as time progresses forward we will see the trends roll over the june july peak in this sine wave process and begin to move downward this will shift how consumers perceive global market trends and will shift how economic data is being reported what was very strong growth inflation and economic data will shift into weaker trends and an eventual downtrend as the month over month and year over year data shifts forward consumers have already started reacting to these extreme highs consumers and consumer activity should always be one of the top economic indicators traders investors follow additionally the transportation index is another key indicator that leads the us global markets by 3 to 6 months in most cases consumers and consumer activity make up nearly 70 of the us gdp and account for a very large portion of the us global economy if consumers constrict spending and economic engagement activity over the next few months because of new covid restrictions perceptions that the economy has become super heated and or any other issues related to us world affairs it is likely that the shifting dampening sine wave process may see an accelerated amplitude range related to the normal dampening process compounded by the shifting consumer sentiment currently the michigan consumer sentiment data has collapsed 13 55 based on the august 13 2021 posting from a level of 81 2 to 70 2 this comes after consumer sentiment has been above 71 since january 2012 this new low data point for consumer sentiment may represent a big shift in how consumers are reacting to the global market trends and the us federal reserve pushing the envelope related to interest rates and economic activities source if we stop to consider how important the consumer is and the psychological aspects of a shifting economy as we have described above one must stop and ask two simple questions what happened the last time consumers pulled away from economic activities and how long did it take them to re engage in normal spending activities the answer to that question is that this type of consumer reaction has only happened once in the past 10 years based on data sourced from investing com using the michigan consumer sentiment data april 9 2020 20 31 and april 24 2020 19 42 right at the peak of the covid 19 global shutdown crisis prior to those dates we have to go all the way back to 2010 2011 just after the housing market crash where the markets were struggling to regain upward momentum and the consumer sentiment levels bottomed out at 56 2 in part ii of this research article we ll continue to explore the shifting tides of the us and global markets in relation to our belief that the dampening sine wave process is continuing to unfold this means traders and investors need to be prepared for extreme volatility events over the next 12 to 24 months and be ever cautious of any new external economic crisis events these external events may prompt an increase in the amplitude and structure of the dampening sine wave process and could completely disrupt the global market recovery process taking place right now more than ever right now traders need to move away from risk functions and start using common sense there will still be endless opportunities for profits from these extended price rotations but the volatility and leverage factors will increase risk levels for

bloom executive vice president finance chief financial officer and treasurer all right thank you very much grace and good afternoon everyone welcome to this conference call to discuss updates on our ongoing imetelstat phase 3 clinical trials as well as second quarter financial results i am joined today by dr john scarlett geron s chairman and chief executive officer dr aleksandra rizo geron s executive vice president and chief medical officer and anil kapur geron s executive vice president of corporate strategy and chief commercial officer after the market closed today we announced updates on our imerge phase 3 clinical trial and financial results for our second quarter via press release which is available on our website in addition an archive of this webcast will be available on our website for 30 days including the slides being presented today 10 stocks we like better than geron when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and geron wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 before we begin please note that during the course of this presentation and question and answer session we will make forward looking statements regarding future events performance plans expectations and other projections including those relating to the therapeutic potential of and potential regulatory approval of imetelstat anticipated clinical and commercial events and related timelines the sufficiency of geron s financial resources and other statements that are not historical fact actual events or results could differ materially we refer you to the discussions under the heading risk factors in geron s quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended june 30 2021 which contains and identifies important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements we undertake no duty or obligation to update our forward looking statements and now i will turn the call over to dr scarlett chip john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer thanks olivia and good afternoon everyone i m very happy to say we ve made a lot of progress since last quarter particularly with regard to our ongoing imerge phase 3 trial in lower risk mds first in that trial we ve reached 91 of the planned enrollment we currently expect to complete enrollment in the fourth quarter of this year in addition we ve accelerated the timing of top line results in imerge phase 3 by three months we ve done this by shortening the follow up period after the last patient has been enrolled from 15 months to 12 months for the primary analysis as a result we now expect top line results in the first quarter of 2023 and finally we expect that our current and projected financial resources will be sufficient to get us to those top line results olivia will expand on this in her section of the call today aleksandra our chief medical officer will comment on the progress we ve made in both our ongoing phase 3 trials and finally anil our executive vice president of corporate strategy and chief commercial officer will discuss the market opportunity in lower risk mds so let s get started olivia bloom executive vice president finance chief financial officer and treasurer thanks chip the increase in operating expenses for the second quarter and year to date period of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily driven by higher development expenses this increase in r d expenses include higher clinical development costs associated with our two ongoing phase 3 clinical trials higher personnel related costs for additional headcount as well as the conduct of long lead times manufacturing and quality activities such as manufacturing validation batches of imetelstat the increase in general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and year to date periods of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily reflects new costs in connection with pre commercial activities including modernizing the internal infrastructure to support a commercial launch and higher legal costs previously we provided guidance that our financial resources were sufficient to fund our operations through the end of 2022 as of june 30 2021 we had 239 1 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we now project these financial resources combined with expected future nondilutive funding from the second tranche under our current debt facility will fund our operations through the end of the first quarter of 2023 by which time top line results from imerge phase 3 are expected with that i will now turn the call over to aleksandra who will review the progress in our phase 3 clinical trial aleksandra aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer thank you olivia and good afternoon everyone let me start with two important updates related to our imerge phase 3 clinical trial for which i m so pleased that we are nearing completion of enrollment as chip commented in his introduction we have achieved 91 of the planned enrollment as of last week and we now expect to complete enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2021 moving on to another important update about this study we have determined that the clinical cutoff date for the primary analysis could occur three months earlier by shortening the follow up period from 15 months to 12 months after the last patient has been enrolled this change is due to the significantly longer enrollment period caused by the covid 19 pandemic which has allowed enrolled patients on the study to have longer follow up than initially planned in shortening the follow up period we estimate that the overall median follow up in the phase 3 trial will be similar to the overall median follow up in the phase 2 trial which as you might remember was 24 months thus even with a shorter follow up we continue to expect to have mature dataset that will allow us to assess the safety and efficacy of imetelstat including durability of transfusion independence furthermore since we ve already enrolled more than 90 of the patients we believe the impact of this change on our efficacy results will be minimal if at all accordingly we submitted a protocol amendment to the fda and have not received any comments on the proposed change we plan to distribute the final protocol amendment to all clinical sites shortly with the revised 12 month follow up period for the primary analysis we now project that the top line results for imerge phase 3 will be available in the first quarter of 2023 also in july a regularly scheduled meeting of the independent data monitoring committee for this study occurred and the committee recommended the trial continue without modification in conclusion we are making good progress with this study and i look forward to our announcement when we achieve full enrollment of the trial turning to impactmf our second ongoing phase 3 trial the focus for this trial has been on opening sites which as you know is one of the key factors for patient enrollment as of last week 55 sites were opened for enrollment we plan to engage over 180 sites in 30 countries across north south america europe australia and asia we continue to expect the interim analysis to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025 just as a reminder the number of events required to conduct the interim analysis for this study could occur before the enrollment is complete as these events will accrue throughout the enrollment period with that i ll turn the call over to anil anil anil kapur executive vice president of corporate strategy and chief commercial officer thanks aleks and good afternoon everyone in my prepared remarks today i ll provide our perspective regarding two topics unmet needs and the market dynamics in lower risk mds that we believe make for an exciting commercial potential for imetelstat lower risk mds as many of you know represents approximately 70 of the total mds patient population this is an attractive market to a large addressable patient opportunity there is a significant unmet need for new therapeutics in this setting as patients are typically elderly present with chronic anemia are dependent on frequent red blood cell transfusions have poor quality of life heightened risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and shortened survival if you look here we have a schematic of the lower risk mds landscape you will see that erythropoiesis stimulating agents or esa are the mainstay of treatment for the approximately 90 of patients who have symptomatic anemia and do not have deletion 5q not all patients respond to or are eligible for esa and among responders responses typically last for between 18 and 24 months treatment options are limited for patients who have failed esas or are ineligible for esas and may include hypomethylating agents or hmas and as of recently luspatercept wanted to also quickly note that hmas are not a preferred option given their limited benefits also they are not broadly approved across the eu for this indication luspatercept was recently approved in 2020 for esa failed ring sideroblast positive patients this rs positive segment covers only approximately 25 of patients leaving a significant unmet need for effective therapies for the remaining approximately 75 of lower risk mds patients who are rs negative the expected broad imetelstat opportunity is shown by the orange dotted line on this slide moving on to imetelstat expected target product profile in our recent market surveys community and academic hematologists reaffirms the unmet needs in lower risk mds and highlighted how the strengths of imetelstat can address those needs key aspects of imetelstat s profile that resonated more strongly with these hematologists are shown on this slide in particular i would like to point out that the hematologists appreciated having the ability to treat rs negative patients where there is no approved treatment in addition they pointed to the durability of transfusion independence the 24 week and the one year red blood cell transfusion independent data from the imerge phase 2 trial resonated particularly well with physicians as they felt these outcomes to be more clinically relevant than eight week transfusion independence in europe both regulators and payers have requested to see 24 week ti data as well in addition the potential for disease modification was also very well received we expect to achieve broad label coverage for imetelstat in esa relapse refractory nondeletion 5q lower risk mds that includes not only both rs positive and rs negative patients but also first line patients who are esa ineligible this sets up imetelstat well for reimbursement across the broader population therefore we expect a highly differentiated position for imetelstat at launch as well as the ability to significantly penetrate this attractive market eventually becoming part of the standard of care in lower risk mds this next slide describes the potential market segmentation in more depth we expect imetelstat patients to come from four main groups all of whom are eligible to be enrolled in our ongoing imerge phase 3 trial the first group and our key focus is the esa relapsed and refractory rs negative patients this is the largest opportunity of about 22 000 addressable patients in the u s and the five largest european markets these patients currently do not have effective approved therapy available to them if imerge phase 3 is positive we expect imetelstat will become the standard of care in this segment the second group is the esa relapse and refractory rs positive patients this group has an addressable patient opportunity of approximately 7 000 patients in the u s and the five largest european markets note also that this is where luspatercept is currently approved we expect imetelstat to compete favorably with luspatercept in this setting especially in patients with higher baseline transfusion burdens such as greater than four units per eight weeks which is more than 50 of the population in this segment according to our analysis the third group is drawn from the first line lower risk mds patients with high endogenous serum epo levels greater than 500 million units per ml who are ineligible for esas this group has an addressable patient opportunity of approximately 3 700 patients in the u s and the five largest european markets finally the fourth group of patients for imetelstat will come from those who have been previously treated with luspatercept the ultimate size of this segment is yet to be determined and we expect it to grow over time just to also point out as many of you may know both luspatercept and esa stimulate production of the normal red blood cell via the epo receptor although at different points in the red blood life cycle based on the fact that we have encouraging data in patients who have failed esas we expect that imetelstat will likely be effective in luspatercept treated patients as a reminder these patients are eligible to be enrolled in our imerge phase 3 trial based on our current commercial assumptions and assuming regulatory and payer access to the four patient populations i just described we expect imetelstat to exceed 1 2 billion in potential peak revenue across the u s and the five largest european markets in lower risk mds lastly as shown on this slide i would like to provide a brief update on our commercialization efforts with top line results expected in the first quarter 2023 and assuming priority review we could potentially launch in the u s market in the first half of 2024 as an early preparation for launch we recently hired senior highly experienced industry professionals to lead our medical affairs and market access functions with this team we will be refining our value proposition across all stakeholders building a deep understanding of the customer base and executing on our medical affair plans to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the potential for imetelstat within the lower risk mds treatment community as we do this we are applying a stage gated milestone driven investment mindset which will result in the bulk of our commercial investments coming after top line results are available we believe imetelstat has the qualities that s strongly differentiated from other drugs currently being marketed or in development today for lower risk mds and we are excited about the progress we are making to bring this potentially transformational product to the market with that i will now hand over the call to chip chip john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer thanks very much anil when i turned the call over to olivia i said we had a lot to cover today now you can see one of the reasons i said that anil just commented that imetelstat is a potentially transformative product i d like to add that with imetelstat we expect to transform geron into a dynamic commercial company over the next several years and to become a leader in the treatment of hematologic malignancies by modifying the course of these diseases in order to improve and extend the lives of patients as we conclude our call today shown on this slide we d like you to know that we plan to host a virtual event for investors and analysts in november when management and key opinion leaders will discuss several broad topics the first is imetelstat s potential for disease modification in lower risk mds and refractory mf the next is our expected path to commercializing imetelstat third is an expansion of imetelstat s development plans including new studies and additional indications and the fourth will at least briefly cover our early discovery program in second generation telomerase inhibitors so please look for further details about this event that will probably come in october of this year so with that operator let s please open the call to questions questions answers operator absolutely your first question comes from the line of charles duncan from cantor fitzgerald your line is open charles duncan cantor fitzgerald analyst yes good afternoon john and team thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the enrollment progress in imerge so yes so i had just a couple of questions and aleksandra i guess kind of alluded to this but with regard to the primary analysis chip and fda response i think she said no comment from fda so you take that as agreement from them that the analysis you ve done to allow for a shorter follow up is copacetic for it with them john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer go ahead aleks aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer sure so charles we submitted a protocol amendment to the fda over 30 days ago and we have not received any comments on the proposed change as you know this is kind of a regular procedure if you don t hear from the agency within 30 days you go ahead and issue a protocol amendment and move forward so we are at this stage the 30 days have passed and no comments received so are moving ahead charles duncan cantor fitzgerald analyst ok very good and then with regard to the enrollment thus far yes nearly complete again congrats any geographic concentration or any color that you can provide on the enrollment pattern relative to the criteria aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer i don t think so i don t think there s any geographic pattern here we ve put so much time and effort in all the enrollment boosting activities we also believe that the rollout of the vaccines especially for the elderly patients that are enrolled in our trial has helped so with that the enrollment has really picked up very well but no to go back to your question i don t think there s any pattern there charles duncan cantor fitzgerald analyst ok and then regarding the blinded efficacy or blinded interim look the idmc look in july was there any criteria for trial i guess changes any efficacy criteria or anything else that really could have come out of that meeting besides safety aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer right so all we hear from the idmc for all of the documents for the charters is whether the study should continue with or without modifications so just like last time they this time they said continue without modification so that s as much as we know charles duncan cantor fitzgerald analyst ok last question is and i ll probably have to wait until november to get the answer to this but when you contemplate commercialization of imetelstat across the globe do you think that you ll end up working with a partner for ex u s i mean what is your preferred strategy there john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer charles this is chip yeah we re actually deep in consideration of that question doing a lot of analyses a lot of background work a lot of work specifically with regard to the drug and the market and so i think today we re not ready to make that have that comment comment on it but that s kind of our plan and stay tuned as they say charles duncan cantor fitzgerald analyst ok thanks for taking my questions congrats on the progress john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer thanks so much operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of justin walsh from b riley securities your line is open justin walsh b riley securities analyst hi thanks for taking the questions i m sure we ll hear more details in november but maybe you could provide some color on why now is a good time to expand imetelstat s development plans and how the second generation telomerase inhibitors are expected to fit into the geron story john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer i ll let aleks take the first part and i ll take the second part so additional development plans do you want to just comment about that aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer i think that at this point justin we are certainly considering to expand in areas where we have a good preclinical data we believe in our data we believe it s a strong data and there s always it s always a good time to expand in traditional indications if you have good data john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer yes i think i d add to that justin if you look back at a consistent theme that we ve had for quite some time has been the exploration of the effect of imetelstat on the molecular basis of disease and in particular on malignant stem and progenitor cells and i think we ve put together an amazing cascade of data that s really strongly supported that what s going on is that we re selectively targeting and killing malignant stem and progenitor cells in the marrow and these are the cells and the clones that are responsible for the disease so when we see in both of our big phase 2 programs really good evidence that there is a significant and selective killing of these malignant stem and progenitor cells and ultimately the marrow will populate with more normal cells i think that really encourages us to look at additional indications in heme malignancies this is kind of what s really needed right and so now that we ve got both of these phase 3 studies up running one almost completed in terms of enrollment i think it s the right time to look at other opportunities and of course as aleksandra says we have preclinical data nonclinical data some of which is public some of which is not yet public that really encourage us so stay tuned for november i think we re excited to tell you about some of this justin walsh b riley securities analyst got it and how about the second generation inhibitors how do those sit in john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer well i think it s a fair statement to say that imetelstat is really a first generation telomerase inhibitor it s the only one that we re really aware of that is in the clinic today and has advanced this far there are a lot of things we would love to do that you can imagine that would incorporate an even more attractive profile and i think we won t get into that today i want to save a little bit of the powder for november but we decided some time ago that it was really the right time to go off and begin the early stages of a medicinal chemistry effort to identify other scaffolds that would be potentially attractive and we ll go into that in a little more detail obviously a lot of it remains proprietary but we did want people to know that we re not just sitting back with imetelstat is our only idea toward telomerase inhibition we think that the data really strongly supports going forward in multiple different areas and having a new drug new indication our new ip new everything would be very potentially attractive justin walsh b riley securities analyst got it well i m looking forward to hearing more in november next question so what if anything do you guys think that the recent acquisition of constellation could tell us about the deal appetite and continued interest in the ms space john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer well whenever you see one of your colleagues who is involved in similar areas that you are get acquired and at a very nice premium i don t think that it makes any of us feel anything but good right i mean that s just a shareholder a broad shareholder perspective and one that i d be hard for anybody to argue against i think that it s an interesting deal we won t go into how we view various elements of the deal itself but i will say that it was a healthy price it was still a relatively early asset and i d just say more opportunities will come the way for patients to get better therapy as more resources are put into any of these drugs so good for them and good for the business and most of all good for patients justin walsh b riley securities analyst got it now last question for me now that we have patients enrolling in impactmf do you have a sense if most of these patients have seen treatment with fedratinib as well as ruxolitinib and how that could possibly affect any read through from imbark aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer so i can take that question i think that at the moment i mean it s a randomized study it s meant for registration and we re really not looking into the data patient disposition or anything like that so i think it s very early for us to give a comment on that justin john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would agree i would make a separate comment our perception is that fedratinib does not have a huge uptake in the market but that s really not for us to make comments about and as aleks said it s a blinded big blinded study and hands off for most of this aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer not blinded but it s randomized john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer randomized aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer and then phase 3 registration so we should not be looking at any of that john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer exactly justin walsh b riley securities analyst got it sounds good thanks for taking the questions operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of stephen willey from stifel your line is open stephen willey stifel nicolaus analyst yeah good afternoon thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the enrollment progress was wondering so i know that you re speaking to i guess this subgroup of potentially frontline patients that are esa ineligible and i know that they were i think a fractional component of the phase 2 patient population i m not sure if we re ever seeing activity or clinical data broken out on the as a function of esa eligibility or ineligibility but just wondering if you ve had any regulatory conversations around your ability to procure a label that would be in the subgroup based upon the phase 3 imerge data specifically in the context of the distribution of esa ineligible patients looking similar to the phase 2 experience john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer yes it s a great question a very thoughtful question thank you aleks will start aleksandra rizo executive vice president and chief medical officer yes so this is actually data that s published in the jco and also in a couple of our abstracts or conference presentation where we ve been reporting data with in different subgroups so patients with lower or higher than 500 microunits per ml of epo and what we ve shown is that actually you can achieve transfusion in the eight week transfusion independence or hie irrespective in which subgroup you belong right so you re talking specifically for those that are the high epo right so the refractory to epa patients that have never seen an epo before they ve never seen any treatment so far so based on our data i believe that this patient population can be included in our label and we had a good proportion of patients even in our phase 2 study that were in this bucket i would say i don t know chip if you want to add something to that john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer yeah we don t usually get into conversations that we ve had or haven t had with regulators and it s always speculative right how this works out but i think the critical element is that there is a small but meaningful percentage of patients who never respond to esas and those patients were included in the medalist study as i recall and we ve seen some patients in our phase 2 so i think we feel pretty comfortable with the idea that we ll be able to access that patient population how it actually comes out and whether it gets labeled whether it s via nccn guidelines there are a lot of different ways this can play out but the most important thing is to have data so we would expect to have data that would bear on your question steve stephen willey stifel nicolaus analyst ok and then maybe just i guess a follow up from one of the earlier questions with respect to next gen telomerase inhibitors and again maybe this is a november investor day topic but are some of these next gen compounds that you re looking at are they also i guess oligo based in terms of structure or is there a way i guess from a med chem perspective that we should think about next gen telomerase inhibitors as being i think a little bit maybe more in the traditional small molecule mold thanks john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer well you re right i m going to just tease you on this and not tell you anything more but we will talk about a little bit more in november we wanted to make sure people had a good reason to come to that call and that was one of them was we thought this would have some real interest let it suffice to say right now that we would like to see a whole host of things that obviously if you start a discovery program many years after your initial discovery was started there are lots of things that you would change and we ll talk about some of those and some of the scaffolds and what they look like so it s a de novo medicinal chemistry work that we re doing let s put it that way stephen willey stifel nicolaus analyst ok very interesting thanks for taking the questions john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you this concludes the q a session of the call i would now like to turn the conference back to dr john scarlett for any closing remarks john scarlett chairman and chief executive officer thanks everybody for joining us today we really appreciate you taking the time to dial in and participate and we do expect to present at three healthcare conferences in september and webcast details for these events will be available at the beginning of next month so keep an eye out for that and we also obviously look forward to virtually seeing many of you at our

most consumers don t need to be persuaded to pick up a box of cookies during a weeknight trip to trader joe s but the efforts partake is making outside of cookie sales provides another reason to stock up denise woodard founder and ceo of partake felt a responsibility to not only run a successful company but to help other people of color do the same in 2020 she established the black futures in food and beverage fellowship program to drive and support more black and brown voices within the food and beverage space from fundraising to food insecurity woodard answered our questions so we all could do more to amplify this message partake foods making history by making cookies woodard worked in corporate america in new york city prior to launching partake she had no intention of starting a food business let alone a food and beverage fellowship until her daughter vivienne was diagnosed with several severe food allergies unable to find healthy yet also fun foods for vivienne to enjoy woodard set to work her first attempts were not successful creating a cookie without gluten nuts or soy was beyond her culinary scope she sought some outside help and worked closely with a third party recipe development company and after a few attempts they nailed it woodard launched the cookies and has since expanded the flavor lineup and sweet offerings available in both crunchy and soft baked the bite sized cookies include chocolate chip cookie butter carrot cake birthday cake double chocolate and many more for more hands on baking fun the company launched a general baking mix a brownie mix and a blondie mix all are vegan and allergen friendly partake foods finding funding like most small businesses woodard had to make financial sacrifices to keep partake afloat the company was originally self funded as the company started out i maxed out my credit cards emptied my 401k and sold my engagement ring to launch the brand until we were able to secure funding in late 2018 from the support of friends and family she explained woodard has worked hard to ensure she doesn t have to rely on the self funded model again she s grateful for the support she s received from investors interested in funding black and brown owned businesses she specifically cites marcy venture partners rihanna and h e r and states that more than half of the 7 5 million raised came from black and brown investors during her fundraising efforts woodard made it clear that she did not experience overt racism and she acknowledges the good fortune she experienced many of her family s friends and co workers contributed to the funding rounds however she explains there is often an opportunity gap for budding entrepreneurs of color limiting factors such as the racial wealth gap can make it much more challenging as often these engrained inequalities can make it harder to get a company off the ground because there aren t as many friends and family to lean on we were fortunate enough to have people such as former coworkers who were willing and able to help fund our business at the earliest of days partake foods closing the gap though successful woodard realizes she is the exception being the first woman of color to raise 1 million for a cpg consumer packaged goods food startup is an accomplishment but it s one that comes with a great responsibility to increase the number and quality of career opportunities for black and brown people seeking to build their careers in the industry she explains this is why woodard created the black futures in food and beverage fellowship the first iteration launched in 2020 and offered fellows extensive networking opportunities a practical capstone project and a competitive edge for placement in an internship or full time position at a leading cpg food and beverage company such as beyond meat a dozen cousins pipcorn and once upon a farm among others applicants must be a junior or higher at an accredited historically black college when asked if she had attended one of the nation s 100 plus historically black colleges woodard said she had not but the question caused her to reflect on her time spent at the university of north carolina at chapel hill thinking back to my college experience one thing that i now realize is that often when i thought about working with or for cpg companies i didn t fully understand the potential career opportunities within the industry i thought my only option would be to explore a brand manager position i hope that through our fellowship program students are exposed to different departments and functional areas whether it s food science legal accounting or ecommerce to get a well rounded understanding of their opportunities something i wasn t afforded as a college student she said partake foods making vegan food accessible living in new york city woodard states she and her family have full access to a wide range of vegan friendly foods and restaurants she reminded us that 13 million children experience food insecurity in america and she s hoping to see that number plummet in the future to address this massive issue woodard wants to see price points drop category wide she is also pushing for vegan and allergen friendly foods to become more available it s important to our brand to not only be available in metropolitan areas and retailers but accessible nationwide at a price point that most consumers can afford there is a gap that needs to be addressed there and as our business continues to grow we are always thinking of ways to provide meal options and other food items besides sweet snacks for more of the country for food insecure people we do our best to support organizations that can help in getting our products into the hands of people who need and deserve them she explained this effort is particularly important in regards to severe food allergies low income families spend 2 5 times more on food allergy related hospitalizations compared to high income families this number could drop if more allergen friendly foods were more accessible to all woodard cited several resources for low income families dealing with food allergies including food equality initiative garden of health food bank and s a f e food pantry the black futures in food and beverage fellowship program is accepting applications until september 3 click here to apply tanya flink is a digital editor at vegnews as well as a writer and runner living in orange county ca
over the past 20 years chinese authorities have engaged in a gradual but determined campaign to promote the use of the renminbi rmb as an international currency with the aim of usurping the us dollar s dominance in 2009 the people s bank of china allowed cross border trade to be settled in rmb on a trial basis in shanghai and beijing which was arguably the starting point for the currency s internationalisation since then a number of additional initiatives have been deployed to help bolster trust in rmb and increase its usage this has included currency swaps and clearing centres undoubtedly the biggest breakthrough came in 2015 when the international monetary fund chose to include rmb within its special drawing rights basket it was a signal to the rest of the world that china had well and truly established itself on the global financial stage however china s rmb internationalisation programme stalled following the 2015 16 chinese stock market turbulence the crisis forced chinese authorities to deploy tight capital control restrictions to stabilise capital outflows but confidence was dented and the acceptance of rmb stagnated the trade war that ensued between china and the us at the end of the decade negatively impacted acceptance even more and was exacerbated following the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 a change could be on the horizon however over the past half decade central banks worldwide have begun investigating the viability of central bank digital currencies cbdcs an electronic form of fiat money some market participants believe the potential widespread use of cbdcs could promote the use of some currencies over others central banks that do not introduce their own digital currencies could see the demand for their currencies drop substantially in some cases says thanos vamvakidis global head of g10 fx strategy at bank of america and securities bofa securities for the us dollar and the euro in particular avoiding the digital era could eventually even diminish their global role china would not be the first to issue a cbdc but it would be the first major economy and the first country with a global reserve currency to do so the people s bank of china began researching a digital rmb e cny in 2014 six years later in april 2020 the central bank said its cbdc dubbed the digital currency electronic payment dc ep was ready to launch pilot programmes were then established in four cities challenges to internationalisation cbdcs and digital currencies more generally have multiple benefits they provide financial inclusion for those who do not have access to bank accounts and have the potential to lower the cost and increase the speed of domestic and international payments little is known about how china s cbdc operates in october 2020 the people s bank of china published a draft law laying out the legal foundations of the dc ep which gives the cbdc the same legal status as rmb as a result it is deemed legal tender and refusing it as a means of payment is therefore illegal currently the dc ep is being issued through a two tier system whereby the people s bank of china has authorised eight banks including the six largest state owned banks to distribute it the reason for this is that not all banks in china have the technical capabilities to interface directly with the central bank but there are murmurings the central bank could authorise additional institutions in the future banks participating in the pilots distribute the cbdc to members of the public via mobile e wallets the hope is the dc ep as pilots accelerate in scope and size will help bolster rmb s international usage one key milestone will be the winter olympics to be held in beijing in 2022 during which overseas visitors will be granted access to the cbdc without having to open a local bank account whether the cbdc is a success in international markets more broadly however will depend on how the people s bank of china and other chinese authorities resolve underlying market issues the launch of the digital rmb might marginally increase the chinese currency s international popularity says maximilian kaernfelt expert at the mercator institute for china studies however he says it will not lead to an overnight surge in rmb usage control is one challenge china will need to overcome if e cny is going to be widely used traditionally chinese authorities have exerted strict control over the economic and financial system through capital controls this contrasts sharply with us markets which are far more open and where there is substantial legal protection for investors in addition the us dollar floats in fx markets and is allowed to fluctuate in value rmb meanwhile is managed with a view towards maintaining the stability of the currency is not fully convertible and there are few signs chinese authorities will let rmb float one issue of immediate concern is the impact the issuance of dc ep may have on china s exchange rate kaernfelt is mindful that a surge in rmb usage digital or otherwise could lead to an appreciation against the us dollar this could pose a risk for domestic employment as nice as launching the first central bank backed digital currency would be there are also some good reasons to wait he says research from the carnegie endowment for international peace agrees that an e cny network hastily launched under political pressure could destabilise china s banking system which as the world s largest on some measures could in turn lead to spillover effects internationally usage beyond borders notably the dc ep will need to be available beyond china s borders if it is going to increase global rmb usage yet on paper the dc ep has been designed for domestic retail payments within china small day to day payments involving consumers businesses and public organisations in november 2020 the central bank reported just 4 million e cny transactions equating to more than cny2 billion in value had been completed in comparison in 2018 tenpay and alipay two of china s payments giants reportedly processed 1 2 billion transactions and 500 million transactions on average per day respectively digitising rmb could increase the international usage of rmb especially for trade partners that do not have a strong preference in favour of non chinese currencies such as the us dollar or the euro says jonas gross project manager at the frankfurt blockchain centre however reading and interpreting central bank comments it seems unlikely that rmb will indeed be available for non chinese citizens in substantial amounts there are plans to encourage the use of the dc ep for international cross border payments according to wang zin a senior people s bank of china official however chinese authorities are yet to make an announcement as to whether it will be available outside the country even if traditionally china has closed off access to its currency and markets there are signs things could be different in the long term a retail dc ep for small cross border recurring payments is currently being tested in hong kong in addition in april 2021 the people s bank of china partnered with a number of other central banks and the bank for international settlements on an m cbdc bridge a multi cbdc network for cross border payments this initiative could enhance china s regional influence over time says ardarsh sinha a currency strategist at bofa securities ultimately this is likely to be the actual and more realistic objective for china than any serious attempt to displace the us dollar s status as the global reserve currency inner workings according to david zhou the former vice president of the china investment corporation foreign individuals or institutions wold need only to set up dc ep wallets in order to participate in rmb cross border payments under the current issuer model in this way they establish a direct debtor creditor relationship with the people s bank of china without involving any domestic or foreign banks as intermediaries he says given the openness of dc ep system by design it will be much easier for to own dc ep wallets than rmb bank accounts thus enabling more foreign individuals and institutions to own and use dc ep under the people s bank of china s current framework dc ep transactions are not reliant on accounts in the traditional sense deposit accounts at commercial banks are not required as a result zhou argues peer to peer transactions can occur between two wallets without the need to differentiate onshore offshore or cross border flows this is similar to the case of any two people in the world being able to communicate via email without knowing where the email servers are located he says swift getaway one way the dc ep could benefit chinese authorities in the short term if used outside its borders is to circumvent us restrictions it is possible the people s bank of china will allow chinese based firms to use its cbdc for transactions with people businesses and entities that are subject to us sanctions us authorities currently have the power to dramatically restrict us sanctioned chinese companies and people access to financial services and to limit transactions with non chinese sanctioned individuals in addition most international transactions denominated in rmb generally rely on correspondent banking relationships and messaging through the swift network in 2020 escalating tensions between the us and china threatened to exclude the asian giant from the swift network the reliance of rmb cross border infrastructure on swift still has profound implications to china s monetary sovereignty says zhou challenge to the dollar in the short term if issued e cny is unlikely to unsettle the us dollar s dominance if anything it would act as a complement to its current cross border infrastructure rmb is already used for settlement in china s international trade at this early stage the dc ep is more likely to be applied to smaller value trade settlements those in wholesale markets will likely continue to be settled in dollars in addition there is still a need for dc ep to prove its robustness so far user adoption has been low and there are no obvious benefits to using the instrument over other payment methods following the pilot trials what the people s bank of china s efforts are likely to do however is ruffle some feathers the us federal reserve is yet to make a move into the cbdc space unlike its peers in china the uk and europe the us central bank has been slower to investigate digital assets a joint project between the federal reserve bank of boston and the massachusetts institute of technology has been whirring under the radar for a number of years but so far no concrete decisions have been made on whether to take the project further than its current research stage in may 2021 the fed announced it would publish a paper later this year nevertheless fed chairman jerome powell has said the central bank will not embark further into the cbdc space without congressional approval global payments processor ripple recently published a report encouraging us authorities to move forward on cbdc projects among other things ripple noted emergency payments to people during the early stages of the pandemic would have been much easier with a cbdc now is the time for central banks to explore these issues develop common solutions and ensure that the next evolution of money benefits more people and businesses and makes the world better the report said martin chorzempa a senior fellow at the peterson institute recently testified before the us china economic security review commission about some of the challenges e cny would face perhaps more pessimistic than most chorzempa believes hype has far outpaced the reality with regard to cbdcs china s e cny efforts have yet to prove they will be any cheaper more efficient more private or more convenient than the existing domestic and international payments systems he said during his testimony it is unlikely to represent any more a threat to the dollar s international dominance than the current forms of rmb at least over the short and medium terms nevertheless he warned nothing was certain over the long term and urged us authorities to carefully monitor china s cbdc efforts and other digital currency innovations in the years ahead this feature forms part of the central banking focus report the renminbi s rise to prominence

fifth on the previous 12 months with another breakthrough to nearly 11bn next year these are impressive numbers coming on the back of a long record of mostly solid organic growth this is the type of expansion that is home grown rather than created by buying other businesses to boost the numbers so it is highly prized by the market investors are optimistic because more and more people need to do tax returns and they re getting more complex workers are increasingly running small businesses on the side in the burgeoning gig economy while people are always tempted to become self employed during covid 19 moreover there has been a sharp rise in new companies being registered as far afield as the us uk france germany and japan food delivery and stock trading are just two growth areas covid 19 has accelerated the shift towards self employment but digitisation is the underlying cause until a few years ago only big businesses could afford to build a fully functioning sales presence online but now anyone has access to apps and sites such as marketplaces to be used as shopfronts shopify is an example meanwhile advertising and influencers pull in customers while the rapid rise in couriers to deliver goods has also helped start ups can now acquire credibility and the means to build scale quickly and cheaply they need help with book keeping budget management invoice production bill paying payment tracking and stock management intuit presents its services as an ecosystem offering everyone a one stop shop keeping customers close intuit arguably knows more about people s tax and business affairs than anyone else which means plenty of cross selling opportunities the company has what it takes to maintain its strong position in this growth sector and should see off rivals a winner to buy on the dips image credit intuit share price chart intuit has always enjoyed a strong and loyal shareholder fan base and they had plenty to smile about after the group s latest quarterly figures were released in may quarterly sales of 4 2bn and earnings per share of 6 07 met the group s own forecasts performance was strong across the board with the credit karma credit reference division achieving record quarterly revenues of 316m of the two dozen analysts covering intuit almost all recommend buying the shares and see them continuing to beat the broader market the consensus forecast is for sales to hit 10 9bn in 2022 up from 7 7bn in the last full year reported operating cash flow should reach 4 3bn up from 2 4bn i see nothing to disrupt the ongoing trend of more small businesses freelancers and the self employed as people eschew corporate life in favour of going it alone there is plenty of official data to support this in the uk for example since 1980 the number of individual self employed workers has nearly tripled according to the institute for fiscal studies intuit has demonstrated that it knows how to serve these users and its competitors look highly unlikely to catch up with it note too that only 5 of sales currently take place outside the us so there are big opportunities to build a presence in foreign markets entrepreneurialism is everywhere the stock should therefore keep outperforming the shares don t look cheap on a forward price earnings p e multiple of around 50 but the short and long term record vindicate confidence in the management and the

we heard in 2020 how joe biden would walk into the presidency as a man well versed in foreign policy the media repeated this over and over again as we remember biden has been blasted by even liberal media outlets for the scenes of chaos unfolding in the war torn nation as the taliban seized power in kabul and the afghan government quickly collapsed amid the u s troop departure the president has been accused of being caught flat footed looking incompetent betraying allies and emboldening american adversaries yet part of biden s appeal to the press in 2020 was his supposed foreign policy chops after decades in the u s senate and eight years as vice president although obama secretary of defense robert gates once remarked biden had been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades the new york times wrote in its endorsement editorial that biden would stock his administration with competent qualified principled individuals and said he had the necessary chops to restore the country s global reputation to say the least the wise ones left their chops at home this is on biden 100 but he clearly got some very bad information about the situation in afghanistan back in july he painted a picture of afghanistan that just did not work out who gave biden those facts or was this another one of those biden moments when he just spoke out loud without any information it s one thing to gaffe about this or that but this was a president assuring a nation that things were under control in afghanistan you d be fired in a private company for making such a grave mistake biden would go a long way toward recovering his credibility by accepting blame and firing a few of his advisers ps you can listen to my show canto talk image us gov to comment you can find the mewe post for this article here
a new anti sanctions law planned for hong kong could put some of the city s biggest financial institutions squarely in the middle of a rapidly escalating rivalry between beijing and washington one that threatens a potentially lucrative windfall for firms betting big on china s growth according to legal and sanctions experts the law first adopted for mainland china in june forms part of beijing s answer to the us government s use of the american financial system and the us dollar as the world s dominant trade currency to achieve political goals internationally through financial sanctions it gives the chinese government as well as private citizens and businesses the legal basis to take countermeasures against foreign individuals and entities involved in discriminatory restrictive measures that beijing says violate international laws and basic norms do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world get the answers with scmp knowledge our new platform of curated content with explainers faqs analyses and infographics brought to you by our award winning team the question for banks and other financial institutions in hong kong is can they still split the difference and not short circuit their access to the world s two biggest economies it s meant as a deterrent to prevent both the us and the european union going after more chinese state actors and chinese companies with for example sanctions on xinjiang and hong kong said katja drinhausen a senior analyst at the mercator institute for china studies a european think tank the biggest risk is that once such a system is in place there is a high likelihood it is going to be used especially if the relations don t fundamentally change which is kind of hard to imagine in light of current political relations story continues the standing committee of the national people s congress china s top legislative body is expected to adopt the law into the mini constitutions of hong kong and macau at its next four day meeting beginning on tuesday bringing them in line with mainland law last month the us state department cited the anti foreign sanctions law as it is known in china as one of several recent developments that present clear operational financial legal and reputational risks to american companies operating in the city the policies which the prc government and the government of hong kong have implemented undermine the legal and regulatory environment that is critical for individuals and businesses to operate freely and with legal certainty in hong kong the state department said in its july 16 advisory those risks are overblown and the anti sanctions law will provide more clarity for businesses in the city a hong kong government official said after the introduction of the anti sanctions law in hong kong individuals and companies will have certainty on how to respond to the us sanction regulation for example banks can no longer use us sanctions as a reason not to provide banking services to individuals under the sanction lists the official who asked not to be identified told the post the us enacted sanctions against 11 hong kong and mainland officials including hong kong chief executive carrie lam cheng yuet ngor last august in response to beijing s adoption of a controversial national security law for the city the new law comes at a time when banks insurers and asset managers in hong kong are wagering on rising incomes in the greater bay area and ploughing billions of dollars into the mainland to bolster their capabilities as beijing further opens up the country s financial sector for example jpmorgan chase won permission to take full control of its mainland securities joint venture on august 6 just days after citibank won approval to open a securities investment fund custody services business onshore goldman sachs morgan stanley and credit suisse are among several big wall street banks seeking to take full control of their onshore securities operations banks insurers and asset managers were reluctant to publicly discuss what preparations they were making ahead of the anti sanctions mandate being added to the basic law hong kong s mini constitution most financial institutions contacted for this story declined to comment however top executives at hsbc and standard chartered two of the city s three currency issuing lenders said they were prepared to overcome any obstacles presented by the potential conflicts in us actions and the chinese law bank of china hong kong is the third of the city s lenders authorised to print banknotes as a global international bank in fact any global international bank not just hsbc you have to navigate the laws and regulations of all of the countries you operate in at times those laws are complicated and complex to deal with noel quinn the hsbc ceo said during the bank s half year results this month i m not pretending it s easy we ve navigated that in the past and we ll continue to do so going forward standard chartered ceo bill winters photo xiaomei chen alt standard chartered ceo bill winters photo xiaomei chen both hsbc and standard chartered have spent billions of dollars to bolster their compliance functions after paying multibillion dollar penalties to american authorities related to failures in their anti money laundering controls and compliance functions we comply with local law everywhere we go bill winters the standard chartered ceo said in an interview last week if we have to respond by divesting an entity the macro fundamentals of that particular country involved would deteriorate said law but we could also argue that a lot of these risks are already priced in for example during the trump administration sanctions and verbal conflicts were part of our lives so nothing new one solution for international companies may be setting up a local entity to serve just their hong kong and mainland businesses allowing them to comply with the new anti sanctions rules the government official said however it might not be such a straightforward decision for multinational companies particularly financial firms that need to regularly access the us financial system legal experts said if i m a company that has significant ties to both spheres i m trying to decide if it s possible for me as a company to say that the us sanctions don t apply to some of the business that i m doing in asia and therefore i don t have to implement or be required to implement the us sanctions when i m dealing in hong kong said scott flicker the chair of paul hastings s washington office and leader of the law firm s global trade controls practice i don t see how a business can slice things that finely one example of the dilemma facing international financial companies operating in hong kong is state street global advisors the manager of the city s tracker fund which mirrors the benchmark hang seng index hong kong is reviewing the process for selecting a manager for the tracker fund photo afp alt hong kong is reviewing the process for selecting a manager for the tracker fund photo afp in january the hong kong arm of boston based state street initially said it would exclude the stocks of three hang seng companies blacklisted by the us only to back down as it faced criticism from hong kong heavyweights such as former hong kong monetary authority ceo joseph yam chi kwong state street s hong kong arm relented and warned that the fund with hk 90 billion us 11 6 billion in assets under management was not an appropriate investment for us persons it later barred americans from buying the tracker fund as of august 2 to comply with a us executive order hong kong officials are now reviewing the process for choosing a manager for the fund including potentially switching to a manager without us ties it would be unrealistic to expect banks and businesses in hong kong to simply ignore us sanctions said tamer soliman global head of export control and sanctions practice at mayer brown s washington office the chinese and hong kong governments are likely to factor in what kind of signals they are sending to the broader financial markets when it comes to how the anti sanctions law would be implemented he said the reality is that we have not seen any hong kong financial institutions being sanctioned by the us or penalised under chinese anti foreign sanctions measures to date and this likely reflects recognition by both governments of the broader implications for their financial systems said soliman there are reasons we have seen both governments take a measured approached so far as tensions between the us and china increased last year over the adoption of the national security law many lenders quietly reviewed their client lists and distanced themselves from so called politically exposed persons in the city and their families closing accounts or cancelling credit cards after the us enacted sanctions in august 2020 lam said she was having trouble using her credit cards and was being paid in cash another challenge for international businesses the anti sanctions law opens up the possibility for private litigation against companies that comply with us measures such as western firms that have cut ties with mainland companies over allegations of forced labour in china s xinjiang uygur autonomous region financial secretary paul chan mo po and other city officials have tried to reassure international businesses about the anti sanctions law photo jonathan wong alt financial secretary paul chan mo po and other city officials have tried to reassure international businesses about the anti sanctions law photo jonathan wong whereas before foreign businesses could be solely focused on ensuring that they do not have raw cotton sourced from xinjiang in their exports to the us they must now also assess whether they could be subject to lawsuits in chinese courts if their decision to end a supplier s contract to comply with foreign sanctions could be considered discriminatory restrictive measures said ben kostrzewa a foreign legal consultant at the law firm hogan lovells one party that may benefit from the introduction of the law is local brokers and asset managers it may make it easier for them to invest freely in mainland companies without worrying about us sanctions according to tom chan pak lam chairman of the institute of securities dealers of hong kong an industry body for instance many local brokers stopped serving us customers in 2014 after the introduction of the foreign account tax compliance act in 2014 which instituted greater reporting requirements for overseas holdings by american citizens they also do not have many us clients as a result after the anti sanctions law is introduced financial firms will need to choose how to comply with the new regime for the local firms that do not have us exposure they will simply follow the hong kong law and regulation he said for their part hong kong officials have tried to reassure the international business community in recent weeks with justice secretary teresa cheng yeuk wah saying that the anti sanctions law will be used sparingly and only in retaliation for punitive actions taken by foreign governments we are sensitive to preserving hong kong s ifc status financial secretary paul chan mo po said in his blog on sunday chan said the city had a constitutional obligation to implement the law on august 10 lam said the law would not be immediately implemented but go through the local legislative process to allow it to be adapted to suit the city s circumstances confirming an earlier post report it would be better for hong kong to introduce the anti sanctions legislation locally as the local version of the legislation can add in provisions that can address the hong kong based us or other international financial firms concerns and special needs said lawmaker christopher cheung wah fung who represents the financial services sector and is also ceo of christfund securities without local legislation hong kong has to follow the mainland chinese version of the anti sanctions law and that may not be suitable for hong kong hong kong is an international financial centre with many us companies they will face difficulties on how to follow both the us and mainland sanctions laws we need to take care of their needs and concerns cheung said justice secretary teresa cheng yeuk wah said the anti sanctions law would be used sparingly and only in retaliation to punitive actions by foreign governments photo may tse alt justice secretary teresa cheng yeuk wah said the anti sanctions law would be used sparingly and only in retaliation to punitive actions by foreign governments photo may tse i am very certain that there will be foreign forces such as governments and media outlets that will hype the issue up and use it as an excuse to weaken the city s status as a financial centre or others confidence in the city lam said the big question lingering for executives at global financial institutions and other international companies operating in hong kong is how much of the law is a signal to the us to back off and how much of it is a signal that beijing intends to crack down hard on companies that comply with american sanctions the risk reward if you move too fast on multinational corporations or international financial services is you could have blowback on china said julia friedlander deputy director of the atlantic council and a former

cities are receiving an unprecedented amount of federal aid how should they determine how to spend it this is your first of three free stories this month become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles webinars and ebooks starting from ferry circle on buffalo s west side take a walk southwest down massachusetts avenue and you ll notice the community gardens rain gardens growing green urban farm a park that was once a broken down unkempt and dangerous eyesore and shimmering solar panel arrays here and there each bright spot has at least one story behind it of someone who lives in that neighborhood who helped build it you re in buffalo s green development zone it s a far cry today from the vacant or abandoned properties that pockmarked the 25 block area more than 15 years ago that s when push buffalo started buying up the first of more than a hundred vacant lots in the neighborhood including many that were caught up in the financial crisis of 2008 2009 push stands for people united for sustainable housing over the past 15 plus years push buffalo estimates it has brought in more than 60 million of investment to those hundred plus lots most of which became permanent low income housing the organization is now developing new low income housing in the area as well as a new community facility to house a workforce training program focused on green jobs residents around the neighborhood have invested even more into their own homes and businesses says rahwa ghirmatzion who has been with the organization since 2013 and became its executive director in 2018 it s a natural response she says when you give residents real power to decide what investments their neighborhood needs and include them in the jobs that development brings as push buffalo has been doing all along there s successes and pride that comes back to a community having been part of the decision making to address the challenges in the community by bringing resources there says ghirmatzion people are reinvesting in little ways into their homes planting gardens and other little actions that kind of pride you can t put a price on with the city of buffalo receiving 331 million in direct funding from the american rescue plan act ghirmatzion believes the city has an opportunity to take that lesson to heart and support other neighborhoods in to go through the same community led process push buffalo went through for the green development zone but she says that s not even close to what s happening and across the country so far similar stories are playing out in other cities that are figuring out what to do with arpa relief dollars what i think is happening right now is business as usual which is an administration that lacks creativity imagination boldness and courage to address what s happening in buffalo ghirmatzion says and it s not strategic at all toward addressing any of our historical systemic issues passed in march the american rescue plan included 130 2 billion in fiscal recovery aid for more than 30 000 local governments across the country it s an unprecedented amount of federal aid going directly to local governments in terms of the size of a one time allocation the number of eligible governments and the discretion given to those governments for how to spend those dollars says amanda kass associate director of the government finance research center university of illinois at chicago it s so unprecedented kass says that one of the challenges for smaller governments in particular has been their own in house capacity to determine exactly where the line is between what counts as eligible spending and what doesn t count a lot of the smaller governments don t have much experience working with federal dollars and the federal dollars they ve received in the past usually come with pretty clear and established rules around what they can spend it on what is the capacity within a government to figure those things out says kass we re talking about communities of various sizes do they have lawyers to review this what is their process to figure that out how are they making decisions about how to use this money and how are they getting information about treasury s rules around this money the rules around arpa fiscal recovery aid aren t even finalized yet the department of treasury has already disbursed around half of those fiscal recovery aid dollars under an interim final rule that may still change based on comments received over the summer the comment deadline was july 16 at least one fortunate bit of clarity has come from treasury local governments can t use fiscal recovery aid to pay off any municipal bonds or other debt back in april chicago s chief financial officer urged the city to take nearly half the city s 1 billion in fiscal recovery aid to repay debt owed to jpmorgan chase that can t happen now under treasury s interim final rule beyond that of the five broad categories some are more concrete than others on the more concrete end of the spectrum there s support public health expenditures by for example funding covid 19 mitigation efforts medical expenses behavioral healthcare and certain public health and safety staff or premium pay for essential workers or invest in water sewer or broadband infrastructure at the less concrete end is address negative economic impacts caused by the public health emergency including economic harms to workers households small businesses impacted industries and the public sector somewhere in the middle is replace lost public sector revenue while it seems concrete enough at face value kass says it would be interesting albeit difficult to look back later and gauge what cuts might have been avoided thanks to these dollars in other words if a city uses fiscal recovery aid dollars to make up for declines in sales or income tax due to the economic fallout from the pandemic does that make it less likely to cut budgets for parks or social services relative to pre pandemic local government spending levels on those areas unlike the federal government local and state governments have to cut back spending when revenues fall unexpectedly below expenditures those cuts in turn worsen the recession that caused them marquette university political scientist philip rocco calls it a death trap kass who co authored a recent blog post with rocco on arpa believes this program because of its reach and flexibility has the potential to set a precedent for an ongoing program of automatic federal aid for state and local governments during a recession once all these thousands of local governments have a bit of experience under their belt with navigating this degree of flexibility with federal aid dollars kass says they would all be a bit more comfortable doing it every time there s a recession they re building this plane while they re flying it building this program during an ongoing crisis things like how to report to treasury about their spending it s not optimal to be thinking about how to do that in a crisis but maybe the experience creates infrastructure for having a permanent program like this says kass it would be optimal to have a permanent program that turns on during a crisis rather than having to depend on congress every time back in buffalo ghirmatzion would like that precedent to include more public input on how to spend relief dollars when they come so far there has been one public meeting of the buffalo common council s finance committee where the general public has had a chance to weigh in on buffalo s 331 million in arpa aid in late july mayor byron brown s office did release a preliminary draft plan featuring 28 different proposals across all of the federal spending categories including a two year guaranteed income pilot program according to the preliminary draft plan city policymakers met with housing services providers community advocates public health advocates and neighborhood leaders to shape the proposals but ghirmatzion was not impressed with the city s overall process of buffalo common council members not a single one of them has done an in district meeting to discuss arpa dollars she says in other cities too there s been unrequited demand for broader and deeper public participation in determining how to spend arpa fiscal recovery aid the city of detroit touts having hosted 65 public meetings between may and june with 3 838 meeting participants and 739 responses to an online survey that helped it craft a plan to spend its 826 million in fiscal recovery aid from arpa but not everyone in detroit was satisfied with the city s community engagement i ve been extremely concerned about the speed of the process says chase cantrell community developer and founder of building community value a nonprofit that trains detroit residents to become community developers public input was only accepted for six weeks and even the meeting and survey process wasn t open ended cantrell adds residents were only given the choice of selecting priorities within predetermined buckets city council has already approved 50 million in spending within a month 30 of which were large contracts for questionable compliance services we re just moving at lightning speed and i fear that our political leaders aren t providing enough time for resident input or their own proper due diligence there is a certain urgency to get aid dollars out to those who are facing dire situations like evictions foreclosures or closing local businesses but for some of the most urgent needs there are other dedicated federal funding sources like the emergency rental assistance program only a fraction of which has been disbursed to tenants and landlords due to various stumbling blocks at the state and local levels local governments have until 2024 to decide how to spend fiscal recovery aid money and two more years after that to actually spend it that means there is time to be more deliberate and participatory with allocating at least some of those dollars milwaukee county s task force to decide how to spend its 183 6 million just had its first meeting last week ghirmatzion would like to see buffalo take a more deliberate open approach put that money aside for a couple of years and be able to dream a little bit bigger and with a real life example like the green development zone other neighborhoods could do even bigger things ghirmatzion says and it wouldn t take you 15 years because you d have a cheat sheet from the way we ve done it and we have a whole curriculum designed around the strategies and framework for how to do this there s also the prospect of going through a neighborhood by neighborhood process under a new mayor in buffalo who comes from the world of grassroots organizing around development india walton shocked many observers with her victory in last summer s democratic primary election against 15 year incumbent byron brown who is now running a write in campaign as a last ditch effort to stay in office the final showdown will be this november s general election in buffalo prior to running for mayor walton co founded and served as the first executive director of fruit belt community land trust which has been acquiring city owned vacant lots for development in a historically black neighborhood facing gentrification on the east side of buffalo i feel the likelihood that an incoming walton administration would very much have a better way of dispersing these dollars ghirmatzion says

mumbai maharashtra august 17 ani businesswire india nearing the end of his master s degree in 2017 nisant mohta observed several peers seeking opportunities beyond university courses to enhance their profiles through his interactions with them he noticed that many struggled to acquire relevant work experience that would make their profiles stand out to potential employers these interactions became the genesis of mumbai based startup finlatics where the core objective is to provide learners an opportunity to give their resumes a boost via live projects and work experience programs although i had seen that this need gap existed through my interactions with my peers i needed to ensure that we create an offering that adds maximum value while crafting our offering i would appear for interviews at leading companies in the finance space with the purpose of understanding their experience with interviewing candidates once my interview was over i would give interviewers my business card and request whether i could ask them some questions though they were surprised by my approach most were happy to answer my questions that s how i understood exactly what firms look for when they hire using this knowledge we crafted finlatics live projects and experience programs explains nisant relevant work experience makes a big difference when it comes to getting a job or even when looking to pursue higher education addressing that need through technology and relevant projects is our primary aim which has been delivering tremendous impact on student careers says nisant finlatics also comes with the benefit of continuous mentorship throughout its programs we quickly realized how important it was to have a mentoring team designated to guide students through the process of getting industry ready our mentors conduct regular check ins to ensure students obtain full value from our programs adds nisant the cherry on the cake is an added layer of flexibility to ensure that the courses are manageable within students time constraints be it any work or college commitments finlatics currently offers two flagship programs the financial markets experience program fmep that helps students gain experience in indian equity markets and the investment banking experience program ibep for those wanting to get a head start in the world of private equity and venture capital the fmep is akin to an internship i could implement what i was learning in theory in real time as the program allowed me to manage a portfolio interact with a mentor and keep learning as i went forward having completed it i feel more equipped says arpan chattopadhyay a finlatics student from bits pilani the team was very responsive throughout the program the mentors instantly clarified any doubts i had and helped me progress ahead says mridul harit a finlatics student from iim indore the program also provides an advantage to international students aspiring to work at large firms with offices across the globe by enhancing their knowledge of financial markets around the world i hope to work in companies like goldman sachs in the future says guilherme padez a management student from portugal i know more about american and european stocks but fmep helped me broaden my knowledge of financial markets in india and the kind of variables and ratios that are used here when investing i found it very interesting maybe i ll work in india in the future he adds the investment banking experience program a hybrid between finance and management consulting aims to help students understand how to assess investment proposals and deepen their understanding of private equity pe right from the set up of a pe fund to the various stages of pe investing investment banking ib is commonly considered a good career trajectory for finance students frankly most of us don t necessarily understand what it means to be working in ib however the ibep gives you a basic knowledge of what a role in investment banking means in the real world it also saves you from spending time going through multiple resources and still assuming the risk of not entirely understanding what ib actually entails ibep has even helped me grasp my mba coursework better explains saurav agarwal a finlatics learner from iim raipur now that the knowledge gap is addressed i feel more prepared for ib interviews he adds with over 13 000 students the programs have students from top universities across the country and the world from iims iifts fms delhi bits pilani iit bombay nmims mumbai jbims mumbai to international universities such as the university of warwick university of illinois university of michigan nanyang technological university among others both programs have been instrumental in helping students get into top corporates like citi bank goldman sachs crisil worldquant kpmg morningstar hdfc ernst young among others going ahead we look forward to having more such success stories coming out of finlatics adds
