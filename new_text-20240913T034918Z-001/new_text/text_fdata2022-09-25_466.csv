the thinnest spare capacity cushion in years is supportive of oil prices and will continue to be a bullish factor on the market the post covid rebound in economies and oil demand have left global spare oil production capacity at very low levels with a very small cushion to absorb possible supply side shocks in the near term despite the economic slowdown already underway in many parts of the world and fears of recessions in europe and the united states oil prices haven t fallen too far below 90 per barrel fears of supply disruptions have increased as much as fears of recessions that could slow oil demand growth the thinnest spare capacity cushion in years is supportive of oil prices and will continue to be a bullish factor on the market at least in the short term considering that no forecaster or analyst can be certain how much global oil supply will be lost in just three months when the eu embargo on russian oil imports by sea enters into force certainly there is one sure fire way for the world to see rising spare capacity and oil inventories rebuilding from multi year lows to more comfortable levels recession a serious slowdown in economic activity or an outright recession would be needed to bring global oil stocks up to five year average levels as reuters senior market analyst john kemp notes and right now it looks like a recession is the only way to rebuild global oil inventories on the supply side neither opec nor the u s can materially boost supply in the short term opec is estimated to be a massive 3 6 million barrels per day bpd below its targeted oil production moreover global spare capacity is in the hands of just two opec producers saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae the saudis themselves admitted this week that the next rebound in economies would wipe out the spare capacity oil inventories are low and effective global spare capacity is now about one and a half percent of global demand saudi aramco s ceo amin nasser said this week but when the global economy recovers we can expect demand to rebound further eliminating the little spare oil production capacity out there and by the time the world wakes up to these blind spots it may be too late to change course he added reiterating the warning that years of underinvestment in oil and gas have brought about the current low spare capacity and tight markets at the same time american oil executives say that the u s cannot come to the rescue for europe this winter as oil and gas producers can t ramp up current production levels too much to offset an expected drop in russian oil supply when the eu embargo enters into force all this leaves the demand side to rebalance the market if a severe recession with significantly slower oil demand growth or even a demand drop materializes spare capacity and inventories could rise from multi year lows related gazprom slashes natural gas deliveries to french utility giant a recession may be coming for the world in 2023 as central banks aggressively hike interest rates to tame inflation the world bank said last week just this week the fed raised the key rate by another 75 basis points for a third consecutive time and the bank of england raised rates by 50 basis points to 2 25 the highest rate since the start of the 2008 financial crisis despite the decisively tightening monetary policy in major economies both opec and the international energy agency iea continue to see global oil demand growing annually both in 2022 and 2023 despite the deteriorating economic environment and concerns over chinese demand due to covid lockdowns the iea expects world oil demand to grow by 2 million bpd in 2022 and by another 2 1 million bpd next year opec for its part still sees global economic growth staying robust at 3 1 this year and another 3 1 next year in its latest forecast suggesting that the cartel still expects healthy oil demand growth despite market fears of recession moreover analysts and forecasters say that gas to oil switching this winter and tight product markets especially diesel in europe could also support oil demand even in a mildly recessionary environment then there is the expected supply shock from russian exports and the still unclear mechanism under which the west is seeking to keep russian oil flowing by applying a price cap on russian oil which putin may simply refuse to sell as he has already threatened advertisement a global recession would normally rebuild inventories and capacity buffers but with the war in ukraine which russia the world s second largest crude oil exporter has just escalated with the mobilization of 300 000 men all bets are off by tsvetana paraskova for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

beer makers are facing many challenges as inflation and supply chain issues raise cost of brewing and shipping shortages in aluminum cans and carbon dioxide used in brewing have hampered some brewers for consumers beer prices are rising up 5 so far this year but not as fast as on other goods including food which rose about 11 we have endured no shortage of shortages recently there was toilet paper and computer chips followed by tampons and baby formula could the next shortage involve beer the potential arises as beer makers big and small are under pressure from a confluence of inflation and several supply chain issues some breweries have found it challenging to get carbon dioxide co2 which is used to clean tanks and carbonate beer when they do get it the price is often higher sometimes twice what they used to pay also rising the price of other ingredients such as malted barley and the cost to ship that and other products all this could lead to higher beer prices and it could result in some of your favorite beers being out of stock or not on tap i don t know if i can think of a scenario where there d be no beer from a brewery but i can understand a scenario where there would be a limited or smaller offering as beer has a short shelf life said chuck aaron owner and founder of jersey girl brewing in hackettstown n j the environment is challenging enough that it could force some breweries to close this could certainly be a factor in closures bart watson chief economist for the brewers association told usa today in a mid year survey of the association s membership about 5 600 u s small and independent breweries some brewers sentiments amounted to we re selling as much beer as we were pre pandemic but making far less on that beer and we re unsure how long that is sustainable watson said gas prices go up after declines here s where gas is cheapest and most expensive what s it mean for you fed hikes interest rate 0 75 percentage point to tame inflation why could there be a beer shortage because breweries which are accustomed to some supply chain struggles face a growing list of headaches the price and availability of aluminum cans became increasingly volatile as cans became critical to breweries survival many had pivoted to curbside pickup and offsite distribution during the national shutdown brought on by covid 19 similarly the supply of co2 has remained tight since the shortages in the spring of 2020 watson said in a recent report breweries have often got less than they ordered or worse not had promised amounts delivered at all now inflation has driven up the entire cost of breweries shopping list just as it has for all americans that means breweries are likely paying more for co2 cans paper goods malt grains needed for making beer and hops what s unprecedented is the number of areas where we are seeing challenges watson told usa today inflation no more steak ordering out less here s how inflation is squeezing american diets settle down easy brewing co in falls church virginia hasn t been hit hard by co2 price increases but is paying an additional two cents per can for its canning line purchased during the pandemic said co owner frank kuhns but other price increases have hit harder including 150 300 gas travel fees for each delivery from suppliers and labor and equipment costs of 30 to 40 more than originally budgeted for the construction of a second northern virginia location a few miles away in oakton virginia so far we have made the decision to hold and not pass these increases onto the customer and instead look for new suppliers or cutting costs without sacrificing quality kuhns said despite the dilemma the nation s beer taps won t likely run dry but they could be tempered he said i m not sure i d go so far as to say there will be shortages individual producers may have issues but this isn t so widespread that you re going to see empty beer shelves watson said i think the beer brand that consumers want occasionally being out of stock is closer to accurate and brewers might make different or fewer beers why is carbon dioxide needed to make beer most beer lovers know that brewers use co2 to carbonate beer but co2 also is used to clean fermentation tanks and keep oxygen out before they are refilled oxygen is the devil of beer and will kill a beer if you have oxygen in it aaron said but many breweries have had a devil of a time getting the co2 they need a main contributor is that a natural source of co2 the jackson dome an extinct volcano in mississippi is facing a contamination issue with the raw gas from the mine creating a significant decrease in available food grade co watson told brewers in a july report high demand and some shutdowns at ammonia plants which create and capture co2 to sell to other industries has compounded the shortage so have rail disputes which have disrupted deliveries wrote forbes columnist richard howells a supply chain executive yes you heard right howells wrote in this era of trying to reduce emissions of co2 into the atmosphere we are actually going to have a shortage of the co2 that provides the carbonation so loved by millions of concerned beer drinkers how are breweries coping with the co2 shortage most have had to pay more for co2 while many have had to find alternate suppliers and if a brewer cannot get enough that could lead to some beers not getting made said tomme arthur co founder and chief operating owner of port brewing and the lost abbey in san diego county california i don t expect the grocery aisles to be missing 18 packs of lager he said but your local craft brewer is certainly at risk for having to adjust brewing schedules and deliverables based on this lack of co2 and the need for it in so many of the brewing practices at jersey girl brewing the cost has doubled over the the past year from about 20 cents a pound to 44 cents aaron said he has been watching the invoice price creep up and up and up as we fill the brewery s bulk tanks capable of holding 1 500 pounds of the gas aaron has also had to decide not to make some beers such as a helles lager because the german grains needed were too costly with increased shipping prices and some beers needing new zealand international hops have not been produced hopefully once the prices come back in line we ll be able to reintroduce those into the market he said earlier this week axios reported that a u s beer shortage looms with gap in carbon dioxide supply it also noted that some breweries have equipment to capture the co2 emitted in the brewing process but it is very expensive also vying for co2 other industries including carbonated beverage makers and food manufacturers as we have learned brewers are a relatively small user of co2 in the grand scheme of things watson said what s everyone talking about sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day could beer become more expensive it already has the makers of miller lite and coors light and bud light as well as stella artois have all raised prices recently but beer prices are up far less than the cost of production the price of beer purchased to drink at home had risen about 5 as of august 2022 compared to august 2021 according to the consumer price index that s higher than whiskey 3 wine 2 5 and other spirits 1 2 another barometer of pricing the average cost to consumers for beer has risen 3 4 over the past year for the equivalent of a 24 pack of 12 oz cans based on prices for the week ending sept 10 2022 according to nielsen iq beer price increases have also remained below that of other consumer goods overall prices increased 8 3 compared to a year ago and food rose 11 4 price hikes have not stopped consumers from trading up to craft beers imported beers or canned cocktails and seltzers said bump williams a beverage industry consultant consumers have also been buying more 12 packs and single serving cans as they have been changing their purchase behavior with inflation going up interest rates going up gas prices going up and a declining stock market turning 401k s into 201k s williams said so folks are managing their affordable luxury expenditures a bit differently today could the price of cans also affect beer supply probably indirectly since aluminum prices are just one of several costs brewers see increasing costs of cans are still much higher than they were and i believe once prices go up the way we ve experienced them you tend not to see them come back down aaron said while there has been less volatility recently some breweries had to find a new supplier when ball corp one of the nation s largest can manufacturers earlier this year raised its minimum requirements for customers citing unprecedented demand we were sent scrambling to find an alternative supplier which charges 1 5 cents more per unit arthur said a truck load of cans is approximately 156 000 units so the pennies add up he said i have never seen this level of inflationary pressures combined with outright shortages it s bonkers to put it mildly arthur said i suspect that nearly every brewery in town is being jammed on the same fronts

on saturday joe biden departed for yet another vacation to their delaware beach house that marks 242 days spent on rest and pleasure since the president took office less than two years ago advertisement the evening before his departure the white house hosted a massive party to mark the passage of 6 billion in taxpayer money on aids and hiv research and prevention all the stops were pulled out with a large glass and metal awning being erected lined with state of the art sound equipment so elton john could perform live the crowd cheered and the champagne flowed as the smart set partook in the spoils of the beltway elton john sings rocketman at the white house pic twitter com yc1yivwqrf jeff mason jeffmason1 september 24 2022 that stood in stark contrast to the events of the day including a stock market crash that dropped the dow jones industrial average well below where it stood the day biden took office with it went trillions in retirement savings that people had spent years and in many cases decades growing to date most retirement accounts are about 25 percent off their highs under biden meanwhile the economic fundamentals look horrific as inflation continues to run historically hot wages decrease and interest rates skyrocket short of a miracle it is just a matter of time before the jobs market begins to decline as well eliminating the last excuse used by the administration to claim the nation isn t in a recession on the border over two million illegal immigrant apprehensions have occurred in 2022 alone and that s not counting the nearly a million estimated got a ways that were never taken into custody a humanitarian crisis has reached its pique both for those making the dangerous journey to cross and for those overdosing on fentanyl brought over by the drug cartels advertisement and you know what joe biden couldn t care less like nero in 64 a d as rome burned the president is too busy having a good time to care about the welfare of those he ostensibly leads he s living the dream having finally conned enough people to send him to the white house after decades of failed campaigns if he wants to go to delaware he s going to go if he wants to spend your money on a bloated white house party complete with an appearance by elton john then that s what he ll do all the while you struggle to pay your rent and afford groceries for your children the optics of it all are terrible but why would biden worry about that he s got a compliant press ready to spin everything in his favor accountability don t make the president laugh sure the nation is crumbling on his watch largely due to his chosen policies but that s not important what s important is that biden is enjoying himself so the fiddling will continue

from peter reagan at birch gold group we already know from last week that powell s fed pledged to keep raising interest rates to combat inflation that s a problem for the stock market stocks and corporate bonds have been supported for the last 14 years by near zero interest rates and endless quantitative easing qe the entire financial market has adapted to this new normal which supports otherwise unthinkable valuations of stocks paired with shockingly high levels of both corporate and sovereign debt if powell s plan works like it should it ll be the equivalent of yanking the rug out from under the financial markets markets will plunge without their easy money lifelines exactly the opposite of the pivot wall street optimists were hoping for just last week it finally looks like wall street is waking up to reality while i m writing the u s stock markets have hit their lowest point of the year so far the investment grade bond market has lost more than 12 the traditionally conservative 60 40 stock bond portfolio recommended for decades as the gold standard for those of us saving for retirement is having its worst year since 1936 i don t think the carnage is over because if we look where the smart money is going we can see that hedge funds and institutional investors are bracing for a crash and by crash i don t mean a bad day or an off week i mean a replay of september 2008 when the federal government was taking over mortgage companies and lehman brothers failed and the wheels completely came off the global financial system here s a quick look at the smart money trail historic amount of crash protection purchased sometimes it s a good idea to review what the big hedge funds and institutional investors are doing with their capital we call it watching the smart money after all if billions of dollars are moving into or out of a specific industry or nation there s a reason and that reason is informed by countless numbers of ph d holding certified market wizards who work for international banks and hedge funds like all investors the smart money wants to do things make more money avoid losing money jim rickards who has enough connections in the investing world to qualify as an insider recently received a warning from one of his sources a colleague informs me that institutional traders not mom and pop retail investors have recently taken out over 8 billion in crash protection oh by the way that s a record high he says the last time we saw such a surge in crash protection was just prior to the collapse of lehman bros in 2008 the biggest investors the smart money are spending record amounts on a type of trade called option puts which pay off when the market goes down relative to bets in the opposite direction again these guys are the smart money rickards emphasizes they must know something the average investor doesn t while it s entirely possible they all know something we don t i find it much more likely they re simply realizing what so many of us already know asset bubbles are bad enough but superbubbles are catastrophic most of the time say 85 or so markets behave rationally assets are priced based on their fundamental value we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us when assets are bid up to irrational levels they usually come back down that s what we think of as an asset bubble about 10 12 of the time financial markets are either in an asset bubble or recovering from one then there s the other times maybe only 3 of the total throughout history those other times when multiple sectors of the economy are all bid up to astronomical valuations simultaneously we call that a superbubble they re very rare and incredibly destructive this theory mostly comes from gmo co founder jeremy grantham and he s certain the u s is entering the final act of a historic superbubble right now the current superbubble features an unprecedentedly dangerous mix of cross asset overvaluation with bonds housing and stocks all critically overpriced and now rapidly losing momentum commodity shock and fed hawkishness each cycle is different and unique but every historical parallel suggests that the worst is yet to come as i ve written about before this type of speculative frenzy has historically followed the same pattern grantham comes to a similar conclusion again based on history in the u s the three near perfect markets with crazy investor behavior and 2 5 sigma overvaluation have always been followed by big market declines of 50 now here we are having experienced the first leg down of the bubble bursting and a substantial bear market rally and we find the fundamentals are far worse than expected so what s this sigma grantham talks about it s shorthand from statistics given a standard distribution of data we express how close a given value is to the normal range using the lowercase greek letter sigma σ most of the time things are normal it s when things are abnormal that prudent people take notice a 2 5 sigma event should happen about 2 of the time now it seems to me that grantham s fundamentals are far worse than expected is a perfectly plausible explanation for institutional investors to defend themselves with record levels of crash protection for comparison grantham says the u s is in the final act of a similarly catastrophic event on par with the 2001 dot com bubble the 2008 great financial crisis and the 1929 collapse that preceded the great depression is it a good idea for everyday american families to do what the smart money is doing taking steps to protect their hard earned retirement savings from another massive financial collapse personally i believe in hoping for the best and planning for the worst even mom and pop investors can take precautions grantham warns us only a few market events in an investor s career really matter and among the most important of all are superbubbles when superbubbles collapse fortunes are lost companies go bankrupt sometimes entire industries disappear unemployment surges financial security feels like a fairy tale unless you ve prepared in advance with the ongoing collapse of both stocks and bonds

flotations have been in short supply this year in the first nine months of 2021 86 companies floated on the stock market raising almost 14billion this year there have been just 34 deals raising less than 1 2billion now there are signs of change two new companies are hoping to join the market in the next few weeks both slightly unusual but offering generous dividends a hedge against inflation and the chance of long term growth as well cash crop sustainable farmland trust has amassed 160 000 acres of farmland valued at around 2billion sustainable farmland trust farming is in charlie mcnairy s blood his family has been involved in agriculture since 1827 and mcnairy grew up helping out on the farm in north carolina following an mba from harvard and a stint as an investment banker he decided to combine financial expertise with his agricultural heritage setting up international farming corporation ifc in 2009 just after the financial crisis today the business has more than 160 000 acres of farmland collectively valued at almost 2billion and growing crops from corn and soya to apples and almonds now mcnairy and his team are floating a new company in london sustainable farmland trust will start with a portfolio of farms from ifc supplemented with investments of its own the company is hoping to raise 200million on the stock market offering shares at 1 apiece applications can be made via intermediaries including hargreaves lansdown aj bell and interactive investor and the deadline is october 7 in the first year shareholders should expect a dividend of around 2p as the trust carefully acquires farmland and related assets including storage sheds for grain greenhouses and packing facilities from the end of next year sustainable farmland trust is targeting annual returns of 7 to 9 per cent including a dividend yield of 4 5 per cent equivalent to 4 5p a share at the 1 offer price from the start however sustainable farmland trust is not just about making money it is also about taking care of the land that the group acquires agronomists are a core part of the team ensuring that water use is responsible and efficient and that soil is healthy with all the nutrients required for successful growing around a dozen assets are already earmarked for the trust from wheat and sunflowers in colorado to alfalfa and potatoes in idaho and hazelnuts in oregon other deals are in sight including an almond and pistachio farm in california and two slightly neglected apple orchards in washington which need expert help such as blossom management to encourage the growth of healthy fruit the us is one of the biggest farming markets in the world with 335 million acres of crop land and some three million farmers this gives sustainable farmland trust a wealth of opportunities but the group will be highly selective in the acquisitions it makes through ifc the trust has developed relationships with a network of farmers primarily from agricultural stock but with an interest in modern farming methods and responsible stewardship this network gives ifc access to high quality farming deals before they come on to the open market such that almost 90 per cent of the firm s purchases to date have been concluded privately sustainable farmland trust will benefit from the same dynamic allowing the team to invest in farms that grow crops from basic commodities to top end fruit and nuts the trust should also profit from a generational shift in the us farming market more than 40 per cent of american agricultural land worth around 1trillion 880billion is owned by farmers over the age of 65 many would like to retire but their offspring are reluctant to take up the farming mantle sustainable farmland trust can offer these families a way out allowing them to sell their land secure in the knowledge that the new owners will look after it properly from an investor perspective sustainable farmland trust makes sense too the war in ukraine has focused attention on the value of food security like never before america is the largest exporter of agricultural produce in the world and its farms are increasingly highly prized as producers of food not just for us citizens but for the rest of us too this should mean that sustainable farmland trust s land becomes increasingly valuable over time especially as farmland tends to rise in price when inflation is high midas verdict sustainable farmland trust offers uk investors access to the vast us agricultural market where returns are rising and should continue in that vein for some time with generations of farming expertise

result from winning a case typically settlements involve a one time lump sum followed by regular payments these payments are distributed through an annuity but i m not referring to those examples instead i m referring to the insurance product unconvinced you ve probably encountered annuities in the following instances but i m not referring to those examples instead i m referring to the insurance product why because annuities are rising in popularity limra reports that total u s annuity sales increased 22 percent to 77 5 billion in the second quarter of 2022 since limra began tracking annuity sales in 2014 these figures represent the highest quarterly sales since the fourth quarter of 2008 so if you want to jump onboard here s an introduction to annuity types and examples what is an annuity annuities are financial contracts between annuity companies like life insurance companies brokerages or investment companies and annuitants the holders and recipients typically annuitants purchase annuities from issuers either as lump sum payments or regularly over time in the meantime the annuitant s money is invested by the annuitant this is called a premium or purchase payment and eventually payments are made according to the annuity type in the united states annuities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission sec and by the financial industry regulatory authority finra a private self regulatory agency annuities usually form part of a retirement program and provide a steady income stream for as long as the annuitant lives the annuitant should however make it part of his or her long term retirement planning if he or she plans to use it as retirement income it is possible to lose the value of the additional benefits called riders if the annuity is withdrawn before a certain age usually 59 ½ riders may be purchased to enhance an annuity such as death benefits which allow beneficiaries to inherit assets it is also common for annuities to have a surrender period usually during the first five to ten years after purchase during this time period if the annuitant withdraws funds or cancels surrender charges will apply in addition to income tax early withdrawals are subject to a 10 percent tax penalty from the internal revenue service irs types of annuities there are a lot of ways an annuity can be structured like how long payments are guaranteed to continue in addition to lifetime payments annuities can be set up so that they keep paying as long as the annuitant or their spouse if a survivorship benefit is selected lives immediate and deferred annuities when you deposit a lump sum annuities start right away or they can be structured as deferred benefits as an alternative annuities can be arranged to pay out funds for a predetermined amount of time such as 20 years when you deposit a lump sum annuities start right away or they can be structured as deferred benefits in the case of an immediate payment annuity you start getting paid right away after you make the deposit for example an immediate annuity is when an individual pays a single premium say 200 000 to an insurance company and receives monthly payments say 5 000 for a specified period of time depending on interest rates and market conditions immediate annuities pay out varying amounts on the other hand deferred income annuities don t start paying out until a future date in fact you often can choose when you want to start receiving payments if you want you can hold off annuitizing the 200 000 or take action on the annuity until you re 85 for example fixed and variable annuities in general annuities can be fixed or variable fixed annuities based on the annuitant s contributions over a certain period a fixed annuity pays a fixed rate accounts are tax deferred during the accumulation phase and fees are largely limited to surrender charges the main advantage of fixed annuities is that they offer a predictable and steady income variable annuities there s no guaranteed rate with a variable annuity rather its value changes based on the stock market index performance of its sub accounts which are like mutual funds fees associated with this type of annuity often exceed 2 percent including fund management costs administrative costs and surrender penalties unlike fixed annuities you can make more money with variable annuities however there is more risk involved it should be noted that there s another option known as indexed annuities their value like variable annuities is determined by the stock market index when the index gains value the company credits a portion to the account and if it loses value the account remains unchanged an account s allocation can however be limited by rate and yield caps annuities that offer both a fixed rate of interest and a stock market component are referred to as fixed indexed annuities the type of annuity you choose will determine whether some of your principal investment can be recovered with a straight lifetime payout the beneficiary won t receive a refund the payments will simply continue until they die any remaining principal in an annuity that is set for a fixed period of time may be refunded to the recipient or to their heirs if the annuitant has passed away in general annuities can be fixed or variable it should be noted that there s another option known as indexed annuities their value like variable annuities is determined by the stock market index when the index gains value the company credits a portion to the account and if it loses value the account remains unchanged an account s allocation can however be limited by rate and yield caps annuities that offer both a fixed rate of interest and a stock market component are referred to as fixed indexed

lifestyle in retirement in general annuities work in several steps annuities can be used to accumulate funds for a goal such as living a comfortable lifestyle in retirement the first example is our good friend the fixed annuity remember that when you purchase a fixed annuity you will know the interest rate up front you ll also know how long you will have to hold your money before withdrawing it for those who want to know what will happen in the future and have peace of mind fixed annuities are clutch another type of annuity that accumulates value over time is the variable annuity an variable annuity differs from its fixed cousin in that you can select subaccounts there are usually a variety of choices in the subaccounts including money market funds bond funds and investments linked to the market you can increase your wealth over time by investing in this type of annuity rather than a fixed one however it could also lose value including its principal if you plan on turning your accumulated funds into retirement income using a variable annuity can be an efficient way to take advantage of market based investment growth in order to get certainty you should ask about the cost of any guarantees offered by a variable annuity just be aware that the fees for certain variable annuities may be high depending on whether you need guarantees on the flip side some offer lower fees that are comparable to those associated with managed investment accounts over time when you have an accumulation annuity you can eventually withdraw your money and use it for whatever you want alternatively it could be adapted into an income plan that will provide guaranteed income for life or a limited period of time income annuity example in exchange for an up front payment to an insurance company a lifetime annuity ensures you a paycheck for a set period of time no matter how long you live your payments will continue as a result income annuities are a reliable tool for reducing the risk of outliving your retirement savings additionally many income annuities offer what is called a period certain guarantee even if you die within that timeframe say 10 or 20 years the beneficiary will receive payments for a minimum number of years what s the key difference between an accumulation annuity and an income annuity you cannot withdraw the principal from an income annuity at the same time you get your money back through guaranteed payments let s now take a closer look at a few examples of income annuities after you pay the insurance company an immediate income annuity begins paying income shortly afterward in most cases immediate income annuities are the best choice when you re looking to convert a lump sum into income as soon as possible usually after retirement you can purchase a deferred income annuity today for income that will start arriving several years later it is also possible to earn dividends from a few companies which can increase your future income significantly when you re looking to lock in future income perhaps from recent investment gains deferred income annuities are usually the best choice you may be interested in a deferred income annuity if you re in your 50s and want to lock in a guaranteed income that will be available in your 60s when you retire whenever your income annuity pays dividends your guaranteed income will grow

beer makers are facing many challenges as inflation and supply chain issues raise cost of brewing and shipping shortages in aluminum cans and carbon dioxide used in brewing have hampered some brewers for consumers beer prices are rising up 5 so far this year but not as fast as on other goods including food which rose about 11 we have endured no shortage of shortages recently there was toilet paper and computer chips followed by tampons and baby formula could the next shortage involve beer the potential arises as beer makers big and small are under pressure from a confluence of inflation and several supply chain issues some breweries have found it challenging to get carbon dioxide co2 which is used to clean tanks and carbonate beer when they do get it the price is often higher sometimes twice what they used to pay also rising the price of other ingredients such as malted barley and the cost to ship that and other products all this could lead to higher beer prices and it could result in some of your favorite beers being out of stock or not on tap i don t know if i can think of a scenario where there d be no beer from a brewery but i can understand a scenario where there would be a limited or smaller offering as beer has a short shelf life said chuck aaron owner and founder of jersey girl brewing in hackettstown n j the environment is challenging enough that it could force some breweries to close this could certainly be a factor in closures bart watson chief economist for the brewers association told usa today in a mid year survey of the association s membership about 5 600 u s small and independent breweries some brewers sentiments amounted to we re selling as much beer as we were pre pandemic but making far less on that beer and we re unsure how long that is sustainable watson said gas prices go up after declines here s where gas is cheapest and most expensive what s it mean for you fed hikes interest rate 0 75 percentage point to tame inflation why could there be a beer shortage because breweries which are accustomed to some supply chain struggles face a growing list of headaches the price and availability of aluminum cans became increasingly volatile as cans became critical to breweries survival many had pivoted to curbside pickup and offsite distribution during the national shutdown brought on by covid 19 similarly the supply of co2 has remained tight since the shortages in the spring of 2020 watson said in a recent report breweries have often got less than they ordered or worse not had promised amounts delivered at all now inflation has driven up the entire cost of breweries shopping list just as it has for all americans that means breweries are likely paying more for co2 cans paper goods malt grains needed for making beer and hops what s unprecedented is the number of areas where we are seeing challenges watson told usa today inflation no more steak ordering out less here s how inflation is squeezing american diets settle down easy brewing co in falls church virginia hasn t been hit hard by co2 price increases but is paying an additional two cents per can for its canning line purchased during the pandemic said co owner frank kuhns but other price increases have hit harder including 150 300 gas travel fees for each delivery from suppliers and labor and equipment costs of 30 to 40 more than originally budgeted for the construction of a second northern virginia location a few miles away in oakton virginia so far we have made the decision to hold and not pass these increases onto the customer and instead look for new suppliers or cutting costs without sacrificing quality kuhns said despite the dilemma the nation s beer taps won t likely run dry but they could be tempered he said i m not sure i d go so far as to say there will be shortages individual producers may have issues but this isn t so widespread that you re going to see empty beer shelves watson said i think the beer brand that consumers want occasionally being out of stock is closer to accurate and brewers might make different or fewer beers why is carbon dioxide needed to make beer most beer lovers know that brewers use co2 to carbonate beer but co2 also is used to clean fermentation tanks and keep oxygen out before they are refilled oxygen is the devil of beer and will kill a beer if you have oxygen in it aaron said but many breweries have had a devil of a time getting the co2 they need a main contributor is that a natural source of co2 the jackson dome an extinct volcano in mississippi is facing a contamination issue with the raw gas from the mine creating a significant decrease in available food grade co watson told brewers in a july report high demand and some shutdowns at ammonia plants which create and capture co2 to sell to other industries has compounded the shortage so have rail disputes which have disrupted deliveries wrote forbes columnist richard howells a supply chain executive yes you heard right howells wrote in this era of trying to reduce emissions of co2 into the atmosphere we are actually going to have a shortage of the co2 that provides the carbonation so loved by millions of concerned beer drinkers how are breweries coping with the co2 shortage most have had to pay more for co2 while many have had to find alternate suppliers and if a brewer cannot get enough that could lead to some beers not getting made said tomme arthur co founder and chief operating owner of port brewing and the lost abbey in san diego county california i don t expect the grocery aisles to be missing 18 packs of lager he said but your local craft brewer is certainly at risk for having to adjust brewing schedules and deliverables based on this lack of co2 and the need for it in so many of the brewing practices at jersey girl brewing the cost has doubled over the the past year from about 20 cents a pound to 44 cents aaron said he has been watching the invoice price creep up and up and up as we fill the brewery s bulk tanks capable of holding 1 500 pounds of the gas aaron has also had to decide not to make some beers such as a helles lager because the german grains needed were too costly with increased shipping prices and some beers needing new zealand international hops have not been produced hopefully once the prices come back in line we ll be able to reintroduce those into the market he said earlier this week axios reported that a u s beer shortage looms with gap in carbon dioxide supply it also noted that some breweries have equipment to capture the co2 emitted in the brewing process but it is very expensive also vying for co2 other industries including carbonated beverage makers and food manufacturers as we have learned brewers are a relatively small user of co2 in the grand scheme of things watson said what s everyone talking about sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day could beer become more expensive it already has the makers of miller lite and coors light and bud light as well as stella artois have all raised prices recently but beer prices are up far less than the cost of production the price of beer purchased to drink at home had risen about 5 as of august 2022 compared to august 2021 according to the consumer price index that s higher than whiskey 3 wine 2 5 and other spirits 1 2 another barometer of pricing the average cost to consumers for beer has risen 3 4 over the past year for the equivalent of a 24 pack of 12 oz cans based on prices for the week ending sept 10 2022 according to nielsen iq beer price increases have also remained below that of other consumer goods overall prices increased 8 3 compared to a year ago and food rose 11 4 price hikes have not stopped consumers from trading up to craft beers imported beers or canned cocktails and seltzers said bump williams a beverage industry consultant consumers have also been buying more 12 packs and single serving cans as they have been changing their purchase behavior with inflation going up interest rates going up gas prices going up and a declining stock market turning 401k s into 201k s williams said so folks are managing their affordable luxury expenditures a bit differently today could the price of cans also affect beer supply probably indirectly since aluminum prices are just one of several costs brewers see increasing costs of cans are still much higher than they were and i believe once prices go up the way we ve experienced them you tend not to see them come back down aaron said while there has been less volatility recently some breweries had to find a new supplier when ball corp one of the nation s largest can manufacturers earlier this year raised its minimum requirements for customers citing unprecedented demand we were sent scrambling to find an alternative supplier which charges 1 5 cents more per unit arthur said a truck load of cans is approximately 156 000 units so the pennies add up he said i have never seen this level of inflationary pressures combined with outright shortages it s bonkers to put it mildly arthur said i suspect that nearly every brewery in town is being jammed on the same fronts

it s clear the uk s abject ruling class injected the nation with a malignant american virus from which the country still shows few signs of recovery and the fiction of choice in the bankrupt political duopoly also shadows the hypocritical american model with britain s economy grinding on the rocks of recession the metrics of the conservative party s forty year special relationship with america prove that this relationship has been an infection borne by yet another engineered american virus today s terminal decline mirrors america s economic political social and moral decay the ravages of a wartime winter have returned to britain with the bank of england similarly stricken by this special relationship it has disastrously emulated the us federal reserve step by step dying economies are the precursor to the degradation of society as britain prepares to endure another desperate holiday season it is time to recall that when margaret thatcher became pm in 1979 before she imported reaganomics to britain in 1980 sterling s value was 2 33 to the pound three years later 1 57 now 1 16 special relationship you say the metamorphosis crisis by crisis of american financial chicanery continually stoked the global economic pyramid scheme of deficit spending this was greeted wholesale by the exchequer and without opposition from elected officials at white hall however during those four decades britain s gross domestic product gdp averaged less than a 1 increase per year with negative gdp in twenty one of forty two years in 1981 uk manufacturing as a percentage of national gdp was nearly 20 and jobs in this sector made up 21 8 ttoday just 7 6 trade union membership is down from 13 million in 1980 to just over 6 million members the average home price adjusted for inflation increased from 103 237 to 271 100 while home rentals increased 8 86 per year from a median monthly rent of 357 in 1980 to more than 1400 today in 1980 53 000 families were listed as homeless then more than doubling to 126 000 by 1989 and over 219 000 as reported in 2020 britain s terminal symptoms have metastasized from america s malignancies such as its ongoing increases from 1980 to 2019 in crime and murder rates poverty 7 vs 22 personal debt 42 5 of gdp vs 1 7 trillion 105 gdp and student loan debt 460billion total 45 800 per student personal and business bankruptcies and suicide obesity and diabetes costs follow the american waistline too and add 10 7 billion in direct nhs costs and another 33 4 in related government subsidies yearly prioritizing the ever burgeoning war annuity was however routine each year and increased from 24 5 billion during thatcher s first term to 43 3 billion this annum these massive sums have been an increasing unnecessary and unsustainable burden on a treasury already suffering from decades of conservative tax cuts the american economic affliction began under ronald reagan and quickly changed from a promise of fiscal responsibility featuring financial deregulation to tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and the snipping of the great society s social safety net what this reaganomics also cut was the tax base called trickle down economics this injection failed to course through the arteries of society for very long failing somewhere along the way of the wealthy purchasing super yachts private jets and increased political influence conservatives hypocritically next embraced deficit spending as prescribed by economic mythologist john maynard keynes as the panacea of each crisis thus began the yearly increases in national budget deficits and the selling of government bonds debt to pay for it all the while squeezing social programs with interest rates approaching zero and bank depositors receiving a similar return despite record bank profits and rarely punished with convictions for criminal behavior the mantra of too big to fail by the bank of england and the us federal reserve rationalized injecting manufactured money repeatedly into the economy in a trick called quantitative easing qe qe is the creation of money by printing it digitally after the us uk over budgets billions more than its tax annual base the treasury issues more debt bonds to sell to cover the deficit next the bofe or fed prints currency out of thin air to buy that debt sovereign uk debt is currently in excess of 2 69 trillion it was less than 200 billion in 1980 interestingly today there are one hundred and seventy one british billionaires in 1980 there was zero that s inflation mark carney a canadian who was governor of the bofe deliberately lowered interest rates to historic lows thus making new home mortgages and equity refinancing so cheap as to transfuse 100 s of billions more in cash out of thin air as house prices soared this was again merely a delay before the crash during this economic descent too few politicians opposed this keynesian snake oil while an increasingly complicit media dutifully back paged it tony blair and the vaporous gordon brown after a decade of demonizing and privatizing the remaining vestiges of british social infrastructure in per usual tory fashion proved to be american lackeys rather than representatives of uk popular interests such treachery was highlighted in the recent article when your bank fails don t walk run with blair began britain s slide into american style monocracy neither us democrat nor republican any longer provides sincere opposition although britain has yet to suffer an american style rigged national election the uk has been similarly stripped of opposition leadership the shameful and inaccurate demonization of jeremy corbyn by british media was designed to sever forever the spinal cord of the labour party it worked as went corbyn so went british socialism s last dedicated champion instead labour offered up a blairite member of the anti labour tri lateral commission sir keir starmer a man whose prefix nicely explains his lack of effective leadership monocracy is hidden by the media which instead of balanced reporting promotes one sided censorship using journalistic tyranny to manipulate intellectual freedom like america rather than budgeting for improving national interests britain finds it more cost effective to tighten social liberties parliament s quietly pending online safety bill makes only the lies of the media safe but does exemplify the compliant corruption of politicians and the media with 87 of all us media owned by six corporations that have the same agenda as the three companies controlling all of uk print media this censorship has been uniform self serving and effective the surreptitious privatization of britain s national health service nhs once the example to the developing socialist world would make aneurin bevan roll in his grave thankfully halted in 2019 here the american trick of using privately financed instruments pfi to provide private loans that use each hospital as collateral but under draconian terms forced dilapidated hospitals deliberately into the arms of us hedge funds this still costs the nhs 2 billion per year in ongoing pay offs before 1998 higher education was free since then uk students have racked up 460 billion in student loan debt with a per student average of 45 800 acting on american changes in 2012 the uk made student debt one of the very few non dischargeable debts in bankruptcy this forever saddled each student with a huge debt service and usually without a job within their discipline universities are now also heavily indebted based on the promise of these anticipated student fees recently diluting the a level tests assured an increase and continuance of this vital college revenue and a drop in standards the parallels to america continue from obesity caused by an adulterated us style food supply immigrants arriving by the thousands unchecked into cities already rotting from neglect and them also drawing on already depleted social services and or the absurd mental aberration the young call woke that demands the human mind now believe that hard facts are merely discretionary or that a uterus is of no consequence whatsoever in biologically defining a woman the biggest and most threatening similarity however is apathy like america britain can blame itself for watching passively while divorcing itself from political reality and leaving that job to a corrupt media and political system a dying nation begins its decline by debasing its economy when the process is irreversible the nation instead of turning to the people s needs begins to turn on the people themselves it is time for voters to inoculate their countries at the ballot box to elect representatives of true not alleged character who prioritize populism not the profits of war those who reject american hegemony and its many bastardizations of trickle down economics politicians who will stop feeding the american virus on the blood and treasure of their own country and who prioritize food before guns society before tyranny family before party and education before ignorance if britain is to survive it must now devote its full attention to its singular most important national emergency britain the end

the u s government must end the venomous nativism of ordinary patriotic americans by flooding it with tens of millions of immigrants according to two immigrants indian born deepak bhargava and south korean born rich stolz americans politics of fear and racism must be drowned by even more poor immigrants say the two democratic aligned progressive activist authors under our proposal the us would admit 75 million immigrants over the next decade which would double the foreign born population from 15 to over 30 giving it the largest share of any developed nation admitting 7 5 million people a year would be a dramatic increase compared with recent history in the obama years the us admitted 1 million immigrants a year and that number shrank dramatically under trump the two authors statue of liberty plan would force americans to accept an annual inflow of 7 5 million migrants or two migrants for each american newborn the progressive plan would require the federal government to suppress and trash the much polled preferences and the economic self interest of 330 million varied americans the plan would be a massive three sided elite smack to ordinary americans that massive migration would reduce the labor market power and cut wages for tens of millions of american employees by flooding the blue collar and white collar labor markets with a massive wave of perhaps 50 million low wage and compliant workers the inflow would also drive up prices by adding 75 million consumers and renters to the u s market the migrants also would dramatically increase the purchase of autos and gasoline and spike the cost of homes and apartments that would put a middle class life out of reach for tens of millions more americans the flood would also wreck americans ability to locally govern their society schools and civic support programs by injecting more chaotic diversity into their already fractured society the economic and civic chaos enforced by the migration would help the business backed progressives seize more power over ordinary americans the two foreign born authors justify the wholesale replacement of american culture and people as the righteous progressive answer to americans beneficial solidarity with each other and their society which they deride as nativism in a september 23 article in the guardian the two authors call for the flood to help to wash away the sins and crimes of u s businesses invasions annexations coups and mercenary wars are a bloody throughline in the history of us relations with latin america us corporations profit from extreme exploitation while us trade and sanctions policies have increased poverty notably in venezuela where sanctions have increased extreme hardship the climate crisis is also a growing cause of migration in central america and the caribbean nearly a third of migrants in hard hit areas cite climate induced lack of food as the main reason for becoming migrants the number of climate migrants will surely grow the world bank estimates that 216 million people worldwide will be forced to migrate by 2050 in reality americans free market economy has enormously helped the developing world especially the countries that focus on trade for example the nations of south korea china vietnam and india have become far richer in a few decades after spending thousands of years mired in poverty autocracy and caste culture moreover wall street likely will support the progressive plan the progressives plan would extract vast human resources from developing countries and deliver the migrants to u s businesses and wall street to serve as 75 million more workers consumers and renters in the relatively low corruption united states if the u s is going to be a place where people want to migrate for economic reasons let s have an immigration system that recognizes and takes advantage of that a top business lobbyist said in november 2021 that i think is something that will be true five years now 10 years from now 15 years from now said douglas holtz eakin a pro migration economist who formerly worked for president george w bush when he was pushing the open borders any willing worker claim billionaire investors routinely call for more migration for example cnn reported on september 23 bill ackman the billionaire hedge fund manager and activist investor has an alternative idea to fight inflation increase immigration inflation can be mitigated by reducing demand and or by increasing supply tweeted ackman of pershing square capital doesn t it make more sense to moderate wage inflation with increased immigration than by raising rates destroying demand putting people out of work and causing a recession business groups already are applauding the semi open border policies enforced by president joe biden and his cuban born homeland security chief alejandro mayorkas this unpopular policy is on track to extract roughly 2 million southern economic migrants in 2022 from poor countries alongside another roughly 2 million legal immigrants visa workers visa overstayers and workers who arrive on tourist visas the 2022 inflow is delivering at least three migrants for every four american newborns the progressives pro migration groups are already funded by business backed progressives such as the west coast investor billionaires at fwd us this extraction migration economic strategy is enthusiastically pushed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into an economic empire of jealous identity groups overseen by progressive hall monitors we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted in september 2022 khanna called for a revival of president george w bush s any willing worker guest worker plan that would pressure employers to replace millions of american employees with low wage indians and other foreigners progressives who want more migration also argue that is a good counter to china we probably need to grow the country threefold to one billion americans said author matthew yglesias an elite leftist progressive founder of vox com the nation changing plan is backed by the democrats progressive establishment at the roosevelt institute which published the plan the institute s board includes a roster of establishment names managers and union leaders such as james hoffa and randi weingarten some of the pro migration progressives come from poor countries whose histories cultures and status are subordinate to americans colossal accomplishments since 1776 stolz for example was born in south korea before he began working for the far left center for community change he now runs oneamerica a pro migration lobby in washington state his co author deepak bhargava was an activist at the far left acorn group and is now a distinguished lecturer at the school of labor and urban studies at the city university of new york similarly jia lynn yang is the top editor for domestic news at the new york times she is the child of chinese immigrants and the progressive author of a 2020 pro migration book titled one mighty and irresistible tide where she argues that immigration should sever america from its cultural roots in europe for those americans who want ethnic pluralism to be a foundation value of their nation there is unfinished work the current generation of immigrants and children of immigrants like those who came before us must articulate a new vision for the current era one that embraces rather than elides how far america has drifted from its european roots if do not their opponents can simply point out to the america of the last fifty years as a demographic aberration and they would not be wrong the two authors also build their statue of liberty plan on the long standing false narrative that insists the statue of liberty is merely a greeter at the doorway to a claimed nation of immigrants the fake and misleading narrative is also pushed by the new york times lynn the image of the statue of liberty the emma lazarus poem at the statue s base the notion of america as an eternal nation of immigrants these make up an intoxicating part of this country s mythology set against all the sins of america s past from slavery to the removal and genocide of american indians the arrival of open hearted immigrants grateful for a chance at a new life on our shores serves as a constant renewal of hope in the american project if there is salvation for this country it very well may lie in the underlying gratitude of a refugee whose life has been saved by the granting of a visa in reality the state of liberty was built by a french artist to display the success of the u s constitution in the 1880s in subsequent years a pr campaign by pro migration advocates portrayed it as a beacon to foreign migrants but that success has been lost by many americans since u s economic elites boosted international migration in 1965 and 1990 extraction migration government officials want to grow the economy and immigration is an easier tool than gradually raising exports productivity or the birth rate so the federal governments extract millions of migrants from poor countries and use them as extra workers consumers and renters this extraction migration policy grows the national economy but also skews it towards employers and investors for example migration tends to ensure employers do not run short of labor the lack of tight labor markets ensures that the migration shifts vast wealth from employees to investors billionaires and wall street in turn that makes it difficult for ordinary americans to advance in their careers get married raise families or buy homes extraction migration also slows innovation and shrinks americans productivity this happens because it encourages employers to boost stock prices by relying on disposable workers instead of uncapturable american professionals and technology this migration policy also reduces exports by minimizing economic pressure on u s companies to build up complementary trade with people in poor countries migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional economic gaps between the democrats cheap labor coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states an economy fueled by extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites it alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it gives an excuse for wealthy elites and progressives to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society such as drug addicts this progressive backed colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits the poverty of migrants and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors progressives hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding narratives and theatrical border security programs for example they claim the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration helps migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations similarly establishment republicans corporate media and major gop donors hide the skew caused by migration they suppress any recognition of the pocketbook impact and instead tout border chaos welfare spending migrant crime and drug smuggling many polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but the polls also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into the good jobs u s graduates need to raise families

death and decomposition in the university the odour of death and decomposition permeates our entire university system the smell of chrysanthemum the flower of death mixes freely with the wild

off this columnist in a once in a blue moon widely referenced interview with channels television had warned about the imminent collapse of the university system urging the staff to embark on critical self interrogation and institutional retrieval while asking the government to do the needful that will be the day two developments led to this current intervention first was a brief off the chance telephone conversation with pa dr michael omolayole the distinguished industrialist veteran technocrat and exemplary public servant the ninety six year old titan lamented the progressive decay and corruption in the public sector which is exemplified by the protracted industrial dispute between asuu and the federal authorities according to him it was unthinkable in an earlier era that asuu would go on a strike for more than a week without the entire nation quaking with consequences the old man aligned with the columnist in bemoaning the sharp deterioration and decay of the entire university system which has resulted in the collapse of standardization and quality control and a proliferating professoriate which is only a national and global laughing stock in pa omolayole s time no british or american university would dare scorn a locally produced nigeria professor or even lecturer nigerian academics could hold their own anywhere in the world this is because they have been put through their pace and have gone through the grueling grind of arduous initiation snooper cited the example of a certain christopher heywood who was a visiting professor and head of the department of english at the then university of ife in the sixties when heywood returned to his native department of english at the prestigious university of sheffield england he reverted to his substantive post as a senior lecturer in the department this was the same department that threw up the great sir william empson aka empson of the seven types of ambiguity arguably the most influential english literary critic of his age a decade and half later when yours sincerely as a visiting graduate scholar in the same department caught up with the selfsame christopher heywood the lordly and imperious specialist of african literature was still manning his post as a senior lecturer after the first seminar christopher heywood pulled one aside and told yours sincerely that he had nothing to teach him heywood promptly recommended that one should be made a honorary visiting lecturer in the famous department this was while still technically an assistant lecturer back at ife the second development is even more horrifying in the past one week one has received terrible reports of death and decomposition from ife first was oko atai our former student who was a professor in the department of theatre arts in the university from all accounts oko had been dead for several days before his decomposing remains were discovered by curious sympathizers like all artists the late talented playwright had his eccentricities and was living alone in a cavernous mansion together with our friend chidi amuta who was later to leave for the university of port harcourt yours sincerely had taught oko politics and ideology in african literature as a final year student in 1980 81 session both of us amuta and oneself were still assistant lecturers the two senior people on the course were the then dr biodun jeyifo and dr desmond hamlett a conservative guyanese born scholar who famously and presciently proclaimed in the course of a fierce exchange with his marxist interlocutors that after all revolutions do revolve up till this moment and forty years after the eardrums still burst with the thunderous artillery of countervailing ideologies read also still on the protracted asuu strike but if by some gruesome irony oko atai could be considered lucky not so professor odebode a retired professor of geology whose bones were found on his bed about a year and half after his death on the outskirts of the town he was living alone without any family or siblings if one s memory serves him right several decades earlier professor ola rotimi body was also discovered on the floor of his living room he was apparently crawling towards his medication in the dead of the night let these grisly discoveries contextualize the current ghastly conditions of our university system it is a vast decaying morgue of the dead the dying and the barely alive it has been long in coming only the stone deaf and the pitiably sightless would not have experienced the progressive decay of our university system over the decades this is no longer the globally acclaimed sanctuary of higher knowledge production bequeathed to us by our ancestors and the legendary visionaries who pioneered the university system in nigeria the obafemi awolowo university is still widely acknowledged as one of the most vibrant institutions in the nation but if h a oluwasanmi aka high altitude were to come back he would have broken down in tears let us not mince words or equivocate in the symbiotic malevolence associated with dysfunctional societies asuu and the entire university system have also contributed to the national rot and decay most of the best and the brightest have long fled depleted of its intellectual arsenal and the wisdom of the old academic protectorate that would have risen in umbrage asuu could only resort to the relentless weaponization of the strike option to combat the deepening siege against education there are two worrisome consequences of this reflex resort to what should normally be a weapon of last resort first it accelerates the erosion of public sympathy for asuu in its legitimate struggle for better funding of the education sector whatever that is now worth a distraught and disoriented public battered by kleptocratic assault on its sensibility no longer cares about how it is done as long as its wards are in school pretending to learn while teachers are pretending to teach them the universities are regarded as mere warehouses and havens from the increasing brutalization of the society the second consequence of the protracted industrial dispute is that it has made asuu to look like a rip van winkle stirring from a prolonged catatonic stupor if the stalling and stonewalling authorities manage to turn the tide of public opinion against it asuu may find itself cast in the mold of a postcolonial incarnation of arthur scargill and the ancient british miners union before margaret thatcher delivered the killer blow couched in the mantra of national interest the ruling by the industrial court that the striking lecturers should return to work is an unenforceable order reminiscent of the despotic writs of military tyrannies rather than douse the tension it can only serve to further inflame aroused passions asuu has already crossed a particular bridge and no amount of threat or intimidation is likely to force it to retreat no matter the outcome of its appeal at the industrial court the teachers are unlikely to budge it would appear that in its haste and panic to get the students to return to the campuses because of the fear of having them turn into equal opportunity disruptors as the electoral cycle approaches the government is liable to commit more strategic errors one would have thought that a strategically minded government truly anxious to put this nasty face off behind us would have seized the opportunity of the industrial sledgehammer by cutting asuu some slack it could have followed swiftly by offering asuu some softeners and sweeteners for example it could have relented on its threat to withhold salaries and emoluments for the period of the strike this could have been followed by a promise to raise a powerful neutral team to examine the grievances of the university teachers in the context of national economic decline provided they return to work immediately the government appears to be tired disoriented and completely bereft of workable solutions to the dire emergency facing the nation in the educational sector in the current global ranking no public sector university in the country made the rank of the first thousand yet there was a time when the college of medicine in ibadan was adjudged as being one of the ranking medical institutions in the entire commonwealth at a point in the seventies and eighties the health sciences and pharmacy complex at the then university of ife boasted of at least five potential nobel laureates in their various fields conducting original ground breaking research but soon thereafter they all fled the rapidly encircling academic holocaust induced by military predation in all its annihilating prospects on the road to rasputin like academic mystification and jujunization the national superintending authorities of the university system came up with the idea that it was time to produce multiple nobel laureates in various fields within the shortest possible time frame in the benumbing inanity of it all it did not occur to them that they were putting the cart before the horse and that you need to induce massively funded original cutting edge research first but they were undaunted by the daunting prospects they even imported from america a mountebank and academic charlatan of nigerian extraction to come and lecture on how to go about it but shortly thereafter the crank received his long due comeuppance in the american system and was never heard of again almost two decades later so much for alfred nobel and his laureates as it is at the moment and if a way is not immediately found out of the asuu imbroglio the fate of apocalyptic social and political disruption that the authorities fear most from restive students and the hordes of the unemployed unleashing murder and mayhem on the society will overtake the nation much sooner than later it may well be that the government has decided to pass on the problems of asuu to the incoming administration if that is the case and with six potentially turbulent months to go it may well be a bridge too far but if our legendary luck manages to hold it behooves on all the leading presidential candidates to begin work on a comprehensive blueprint to rescue nigeria from the jaws of educational collapse let us end this piece with a bittersweet anecdote sometimes in 1991 yours sincerely was summoned to the campus residence of akinwunmi isola the great yoruba novelist raconteur and dramatist isola wasted no time in announcing his immediate retirement from the university system when he was asked the reason for this apparently precipitate decision the notable thespian aka honest man looked wistfully at the darkening sky and then opened up you see i can no longer see my friends and peers in the system i cannot see olabiyi yai i cannot see sope oyelaran i cannot see wande abimbola and bade ajuwon is about to leave too you see when you tarry too long on a mound of fecal matter you are likely to play host to a swarm of monstrous flies a rather dispirited snooper asked him whether this was the end of the great nigerian university system as we know it the urbane circumspect yoruba cognoscenti quietly demurred no no no you see it is like a column of ants in an orderly procession suddenly disrupted by a big splash very soon you will see the column reassembling again and resuming its orderly march may our universities find the strength and spirit to resume the orderly procession
is this as bad as it gets or is the worst yet to come in last week s td notes i declared expectations of more fed tightening is the most important thing for financial markets that was after risk assets took a swan dive following tuesday s cpi data this week the swan dive continued especially after the fed raised rates by 75bps on wednesday and indicated that the terminal rate the level where s t rates might peak was expected to be 4 6 and occur in early 2023 the expectation of more fed tightening caused stocks bonds and commodities to fall while the us dollar soared against nearly all other currencies the answer to the is this as bad as it gets question depends on your time frame the short term rate of change across asset classes has been extreme and market sentiment is highly risk averse a classic bear market rally is probably overdue but from a longer term perspective it s easy to believe that the worst is yet to come most of my trading is short term for instance catching a 1 000 point move in the djia these days is worth my time and attention but after trading markets for 50 years i can t ignore the risks and opportunities that come from big cycle moves so with that in mind i ll look to scalp short term reversals in negative risk sentiment but i won t overstay my welcome if negative sentiment intensifies over the past few months my big picture view has been that inflation will remain higher for longer than the market has been pricing one of the reasons for that view is that i think working people believe they have been left behind by income inequality and the soaring cost of food energy and shelter and they will push for higher pay to try to catch up companies will also try to catch up to soaring costs note that fedex just announced an average price increase of 6 9 for shipping rates effective jan 2023 despite their september 15 forecast of a substantial decline in shipping volumes charging more for less is also happening in consumer goods check out this link to shrinkflation where companies keep prices the same but reduce the quantity sold the cereal box looks as big as before but it is thinner and holds less cereal after decades of the fed put markets have been slow to realize that the fed doesn t have their back some observers might think that the fed is purposefully stabbing investors in the back as richard clarida the vice chair of the federal reserve from 2018 to 2022 recently explained until inflation comes down a lot the fed is really a single mandate central bank the single mandate is stable prices i e 2 inflation forget about the other full employment mandate the fed has different priorities now currency markets this week the us dollar index surged to a new 20 year high and short term volatility was amazing emerging market currencies were especially weak for over 40 years i ve had two fx mantras 1 capital flows to the usa for safety and opportunity and 2 trends in the fx markets seem to run far longer than makes any sense and then they turn on a dime and go the other way the japanese yen fell to a new 24 year low after the fed raised rates on wednesday and then the japanese authorities intervened in the market for the first time in 24 years buying yen and selling usd markets may have also priced in that the japanese will be selling us treasuries as part of their intervention adding to pressure on the already weak us bond market the swiss franc fell sharply on thursday when the snb raised s t interest rates by only 75bps the british pound tumbled to a new 37 year low vs the usd and uk bonds cratered after the boe raised s t rates by 50bps and the new government introduced their plan to boost the economy the dramatic tumble in uk guilt prices had to have negatively impacted us bond prices the chinese rmb fell to a 27 month low on this chart higher prices means that it takes more rmb to buy one usd the canadian dollar has dropped 3 5 cents in eight days falling to a 27 month low interest rates interest rates across the curve lurched higher following the wednesday fed meeting the 10 year futures contract traded to a 14 year low trading lower for eight consecutive weeks the 10 year cash market yield touched a high of 3 8 while real yields on the 10 year reached an 11 year high equity markets tumbled the djia dropped 3 250 points 10 in the ten days from the september 12 high the day before the cpi report to friday s lows the friday low was the lowest price since november 2020 when biden won the election and pfizer announced the covid vaccine private equity many major pension funds have been increasing their allotment to private equity over the past several years to diversify their investments and increase overall returns the time horizon of these investments may suit the time horizon of their payout liabilities but there is always the question of how to value non mark to market assets this private equity etf may provide a glimpse into the performance of some parts of the private equity world which has had its problems lately with soaring interest rates vis a vis high leverage note that the etf is down 50 from the ath made late last year the bloomberg 60 40 stock bond index is down 20 ytd a steeper fall than during the covid panic of march 2020 risk parity taking a big hit risk parity is essentially a strategy to hold a stock bond portfolio but to jazz it up with risk weighted leverage and no surprise this risk parity etf is down more ytd than a plain vanilla 60 40 portfolio h t to kevin muir for this chart commodities front month wti crude oil futures dropped to 78 the lowest price since early january down 42 35 from the highs made following the russian invasion of ukraine the energy heavy goldman sachs commodity index also fell to its lowest since early january down 29 from the post invasion highs gold fell to a 30 month low this week the surging usd and sharply higher real interest rates continue to be toxic for gold despite high inflation market sentiment is exceptionally risk off the speed of the increase in interest rates has been the most important thing driving negative financial market sentiment but putin s decision to ramp up the war against ukraine and to use all available means to defend russia added to geopolitical stress my short term trading i started this week long t note futures that i bought late last week but i was stopped for a slight loss in the sunday overnight session i was trying to bottom pick a market that has traded sharply lower every week since july so i was dealing with small sizes with tight stops i continued my bottom picking approach this week in stock indices gold t notes and the canadian dollar with mixed results some profits but small net losses at the end of the week i m long otm calls on the t notes on my radar i ll repeat what i wrote last week market sentiment is very bearish for a good reason there are lots of things to worry about with an aggressive fed and the consequences that may come from that topping the list but the question always is how much is already in the price and what s your time frame in a short term time frame i think there is a lot of negativity in the price and risk assets could rally in a longer term time frame i can imagine both the market being much lower and much higher i don t want to let my feelings of where the market might be months from now to interfere with my observations of short term price action quote of the week this quote is another steal from my friend kevin muir the macrotourist jack schwager featured marty schwartz in his first market wizards book in 1989 marty went on to make and occasionally lose millions of dollars the barney report barney and i usually go for a 30 minute walk at sunrise it gives him a chance to stretch his legs do his business and earn a few treats by finding golf balls for me my wife and i take turns taking him out for a long mid day walk she usually keeps him on a leash but i like to allow him to run off leash he loves doing that and then i take him out for another 30 minute special after dinner he s been wolfing down his breakfast and dinner the past few weeks now that the summer heat wave is over i ll have to weigh him again soon because i think he s gaining weight after levelling out around 60 pounds this summer he s just over one year old now and he has learned some good behaviour but every once in a while he goes crazy for about a minute has a zoomie as one of my friends calls it and then settles down again i love the little guy here s barney keeping an eye

owner publisher donations can be made through cash app venmo la standard newspaper paypal and gofundme checks can be mailed to 2415 w martin luther king jr blvd los angeles ca 90008 by jason lewis los angeles is having a housing crisis typically when this issue is discussed it s more about the homelessness issue which is one of the most pressing issues in the city but many people who are employed are struggling to afford the rising rents and they are being priced out of buying a house jan perry who is running for california s 37th congressional district in november against california state senator sydney kamlager discussed the homelessness issue in the august edition of the los angeles standard newspaper this month she discusses the housing crisis our current housing crisis has been decades in the making and responding to it has been my top priority perry said i have aggressively worked with non profit housing developers to build housing and to develop policies to expedite construction if you re serious about helping people and achieving true social justice we have to meet people s basic needs while working as a los angeles city councilmember perry served south los angeles s 9th district she is also the executive director of a non profit organization that engages in infrastructure and economic development projects perry has a 30 year old daughter who has a college degree and is employed but she is having similar struggles that other millennials are having it s very hard for these millennials perry said i m a big believer and historically have supported first time home buyers programs and programs geared to create new housing stock that is affordable to encourage young people and also people on fixed incomes to be able to rent to own which is something that people don t talk a lot about it s another pathway to homeownership the price for homes in many of los angeles predominantly black communities are topping 1 million sparking outcries of gentrification gentrification is a very loaded word perry said it s most often identified with people coming from other places to take advantage of an area where they can come in at a lower price some of it has to do with redlining and financing small businesses in areas that have been left behind when people begin to move from the west to the east the prices start to go up i saw a listing on 7th avenue that sold for 795 000 it was a three bedroom two bath the square footage was about 1 500 square feet it s a beautiful house but my god one issue that leads to gentrification is people inheriting homes and then quickly selling the property instead of holding onto the house as a member of congress perry plans to address this in south los angeles so many people s parents and grandparents acquired their properties initially after world war ii with the g i bill she said they ve had the homes for many years and they ve been able to build up quite a bit of equity instead of walking away from those properties so that speculators can come in and take your single family home or your duplex or triplex and then put two boxes on it that are actually not affordable and are market rate so it doesn t do anything to solve the affordability crisis i would say that it s much wiser to hang on to the equity that your family has built and pass it from one generation the next those are programs that i would seek to build out and bulk up and to create more aggressive educational policies on generational wealth so that people can not only stay in their community but build up their community it s a process of educating people and then creating incentives through legislation to try to make sure that people can stay in their communities i as an elected official a legislator and a public servant have to also be mindful that we have to continue to build for the future and for younger people to create those opportunities through support and through subsidies so that we can continue to grow the housing stock for the generations coming online now so that they ll have a place to live it s entirely possible to create those opportunities within those communities without destroying the character of a single family neighborhood you run the risk of diminishing the equity in people s homes especially those whose parents got it right after the war if you start tearing down single family homes and put in three units in the front three units in the back perry would also have to deal with developers who are transforming residential neighborhoods she pointed out one street just south of washington boulevard and east la brea avenue where a developer has built multiple family housing on a street that has single family homes it looks like one developer went through there and must have bought up a lot of property because the architecture is nearly identical from one spot to the next she said it s a box in front box in back when i spoke to some of the property owners over there they said that the kids came in after their parents passed away and they just didn t want to deal with it so i have to be very thoughtful looking forward to see what incentives that we can create for people to stabilize and not diminish the value of what their parents and grandparents were able to acquire for more information about perry s campaign and to find out her stance on

conclave in the indonesian city of bali and when lavrov was in new delhi earlier this year in response to a question on his meeting with ukraine s prime minister denys shmyhal this week on the unga margins and what were the concerns articulated by the leader jaishankar said a big concern was the conflict itself he gave me his perception his assessment of what was happening in ukraine in terms of india we had a discussion on what was our position and my sense is that he clearly appreciated the fact that we were against the continuation of the conflict and for the return for dialogue and diplomacy jaishankar said adding that shmyhal had his own views on why this was not happening the humanitarian assistance issue was also discussed and shmyhal brought up some specific aspects of the ground situation which he believed were concerns for the international community as a whole including discussion on the progress on the grain issue the concern about fertilizers nuclear power plant issue with the months long ukraine conflict raging on india told the un general assembly that it is on the side of peace and on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out as the ukraine conflict continues to rage we are often asked whose side we are on and our answer each time is straight and honest jaishankar said in his address to the high level un general assembly session here saturday he underlined that it is in the collective interest of the international community to work constructively both within the united nations and outside in finding an early resolution to this conflict delivering the national statement he said in this conflict india is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there we are on the side that respects the un charter and its founding principles we are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out he said we are on the side of those struggling to make ends meet even as they stare at escalating costs of food fuel and fertilizers at various un platforms like the un security council and the general assembly india has mostly abstained on resolutions on the ukraine conflict in his address jaishankar voiced concern over the sharp deterioration in the international landscape the world is already struggling with challenges of post pandemic economic recovery the debt situation of the developing is precarious to this is now added the rising costs and shrinking availability of fuel food and fertilizers these along with trade disruptions and diversions are among the many consequences of the ukraine conflict he added that the repercussions of the ongoing ukraine conflict have further heightened economic stresses especially on food and energy with inputs from pti also read india to work with g20 members to address issues of debt food and energy security dr s jaishankar
september 25 2022 09 35 am updated 06 40 pm ist new york external affairs minister s jaishankar has said that there has been a shift on the issue of un reforms among the international community in respect of un reform every general assembly session you revisit that issue but this time something has shifted you can see that you can sense that mr jaishankar told reporters in new york on september 24 2022 as he wrapped up the new york leg of his visit to the u s with his address to the unga high level session mr jaishankar said it is not that only he has sensed a shift on the issue of un reforms i think everybody sensed a shift and it s something which others actually brought up with me he noted that this was articulated by u s president joe biden who had said in his address to the general debate earlier this week that the united states supports increasing the number of both permanent and non permanent representatives of the council including permanent seats for those nations washington has long supported and permanent seats for countries in africa latin america and the caribbean mr jaishankar added that russian foreign minister sergey lavrov explicitly mentioned india from the general assembly podium a number of countries also referred to india in their statements president of the 77th session of the un general assembly csaba korosi also spoke fairly strongly and explicitly on the issue of un reforms in his address to the general assembly just an hour before mr jaishankar s speech mr lavrov said that the u n and security council have to be aligned to contemporary realties he said moscow sees the prospect of making the security council more democratic exclusively through broadening the representation of countries from africa asia and latin america we note india and brazil in particular as key international actors and worthy candidates for permanent membership within the council whilst at the same time unilaterally and mandatorily raising the profile of africa lavrov said mr jaishankar added that it is not usual in a general assembly for presidents prime ministers or foreign ministers of a country to refer to another country but you saw that on a number of occasions vis a vis us and to my mind it had a relevance to the reform of the un reaffirmed that india mattered more and underlined the global south relevance that india has we ve got some tailwind behind us now we have to see what we can make of it i think it s a welcome development as someone who s been coming here for many years i do believe that it s more than a subtle shift and i welcome it he said he was asked a question on unsc reform the u s position on it india s position on the veto and whether it is separate from permanent membership mr jaishankar said the starting point is the need to accept that there should be reform and then the need to develop a kind of practical path towards it he added that it is not like people have fixed positions and final concepts everybody has ideas the ideas will go into a melting pot and then one has to see what comes out of it he said adding that it will be very premature to comment either on india s own positions or other people s positions at this stage but what is most important is that a negotiation between countries has some practical tangible basis to it or there is a text it s incredible that after so many years there s actually no text so how does the negotiation advance if there is no text and no progress and no stock taking and no end of the year where are we kind of assessment he said in the absence of a text it just goes round and round he said he noted that a lot of the discussions with other people was that if the inter governmental negotiations process has to get serious then we must move it towards text based negotiation and there s a growing appreciation of the need for that in his address to the general assembly mr jaishankar underlined that india believes that multipolarity rebalancing fair globalisation and reformed multilateralism cannot be kept in abeyance he said the call for reformed multilateralism with reforms of the security council at its core enjoys considerable support among un members it does so because of the widespread recognition that the current architecture is anachronistic and ineffective it is also perceived as deeply unfair denying entire continents and regions a voice in a forum that deliberates their future he said he emphasized that new delhi s call is to allow serious negotiations on such a critical matter to proceed sincerely they must not be blocked by procedural tactics naysayers cannot hold the ign process hostage in perpetuity

earl smokey maude yet to be named 65 build afternoon new member here to this forum been an avid forum guy since bbs s in the late 90 s and honestly a few things have happened that pissed me off about forums photobucket getting greedy and alot of my old builds are no longer showing up social media move so it s so much harder to find threads with pics and searches aren t as functional as they used to be seems we have some good guys here and i found my way here doing research for my new to me 65 f100 short bed i have built alot of vehicles it s an addiction and i fully own it all told every major brand but seem to always end up back in a mustang as my toy i traded a fully built 83 notchback that i was just tired of honestly as the 4 years i was working on it i was fixing what previous owners had screwed up and not making it go fast most of the time i did however build a mexican block 347 with forged eagle crank scat rods and keith black forged pistons topped with edelbrock single plane i had it coupled to afr renegade 205 s and ran the vaccum secondary 850 holley it had alot more in it as i built the fuel system for boost with ptfe 8an feed and 6an return and was running a stock modified baffle sump and return i welded in and sealed tank i just fell out of love with the car over the years best i ran it was a 6 02 in the 8th but i was at a point with it i needed a block to add the boost i was looking for and had decided the suspension was getting pulled and re worked i traded straight across for my new 65 f100 i believe i came out ahead on everything but the heads i really wish i would have grabbed some gt40p s and put them on and tinkered to get it running right before i traded mainly because i m cheap lol anyway this will be covered in my rants in my build thread that i will start soon just wanted to get registered and say hello plan is to build this to my desire and keep but i have an issue of keeping them once i finish them or get to a point where it takes more the 302 that is in the truck was a sears motor that was bought from elk or something and have the receipt from 1987 has less than 7k i have put 1500 on it in last few months on the truck since it was done will be pulling intake manifold to see if it s a roller motor if it s not then i m going 4 6 or 5 4 build more than likely but will stay ford radiator was just redone and has a new in cab tank the tank is getting out of the cab asap and the only thing i have ordered so far is the intellitronic gauges for the stock dash i can t drive without oil pressure tach water temp accurate speedometer trip meter and i have a brand new cowl mount autometer fuel pressure gauge for carbed if i switch will just get the proper gouge for fi as this one only goes to 15psi anyway hello and i ll stop for now why not reuse ran out of gas mid way through so welds are not the best went with maude for the nameoriginal thought was earl youngest daughter only one that still lives with us 7 now loves smokey and wife and i love maude because it s old school name and i ll be modding the truck can t seem to name it no hurry though as i believe in the next few weeks will be finishing up the first round of mod s and have bck to daily driving duties while i build funds and parts for next winter truck is a 1965 f100 i did a post in the new members area shortly after i purchased it but decided i m going to do a build thread here and post the updates to this area so let me consolidate here i did the trade in late september and drove it completely as i received it since then last weekend i got out to get some baseline s on the 302 and c4 it was pretty pathetic best was a 1 42 at 64 mph with absolutely perfect conditions no worries for tire slip but i m fighting myself on just doing the cv front end and keeping the f100 frame but this will be a daily with curvy roads and autocross in mind so the cv frame swap to have power steering power brakes disk all the way around abs cruise a c and heat are kinda winning me over would do the firewall grafting and weld up my own mounts if i go that way the only sticking point at this time is the bed i don t really want to chop the bed but would love to have the watts link in the rear and i already have a rebuild 31 spline track lock to throw in that i had just finished for the stang i also have a full set of authentic saleens from my saleen i had in the past in 18x9 front and 18x10 rear they are what it will start with once i get the suspension or frame swap figured out was my first post above hoping the pic works this portion was from november 24th well had some time so got to work first i ll put my findings in here on what i have rear is wdm c 9 3 70 gears open 28 spline will be measuring to see if i have big ends as i have a torino style big end cobra brake setup i can use i believe it will be big end but not torino style will have wheels off soon and measure can t get engine block info yet will remove starter or intake manifold and verify it but did get the heads info and doesn t make me feel good about this being a roller blockd80e heads one positive is i do have a timing pointer above my crank i was not able to see it till yesterday now i have all the bolts off the bed and will be taking it off today reason is i did the flip kit in the rear and only have around 1 2 inches before i bang frame front i cut 1 then 2 then 3 coils off as i wanted it to set around the height i expected with the cv front so when i set my pinion angle it was done now i don t have to think about iti have taken the exhaust off and fabbed an x pipe out of the part that went over the axle and willl be throwing it back together temporarily with these tiny pipes hoping it last for a while at least and will be turned out just in front of the rear tires i started installing my intellitronics cluster as well and pulled out the older carbs to i can build my 650 mech secondary will be doing advancing the timing etc soon just to tweak and will probably do the 70 mustang tank holley blue pump i have and fpr all next month sometime i will edit in pics momentarily and garage is dirty as i m making some shelving so dumped everything in the other side of it will be presentable soon bed will be off so need room to rest it for a few days is under the drivers side cab support beam on both sides and very little at the front of the bed also considering selling this hitch and rear bumper undecided at this point but it could speed up the build want a roll pan eventually and probably no hitch at all decision will be made when i remove the rear crossbar to prep for rear tank i am not sure the hitch will work once i do that that gets everything in one place from here on is new well updates to catch us up since i made post about it in late november the good news is i have parts i m going to post this then reread it all and go from there no need to repeat information that i already put out adding in current pic as of 19 sept 2023

ken leung doesn t know what he s talking about in industry the razor sharp series about young graduates competing for permanent positions in the cutthroat world of finance requires its actors to deliver arcane terminology at such a speed you might think they understood the meaning behind what they were saying you d be wrong i just can t grasp the mathematics of it says the 52 year star of lost and rush hour it took me a long time to get what a short is and i still can t say i understand it now you borrow something you sell it then you buy it back and return the thing i have to try and picture it as a concrete thing like a loaf of bread but it doesn t always work that way in finance because of the minutiae of it shorting a stock google will tell you is when a trader borrows shares from a broker and immediately sells them expecting the stock price to plummet imminently ie when they have to pay for them so they can pocket the difference or something like that thankfully enjoying industry does not necessitate a ba in macroeconomics industry created by former finance boys mickey down and konrad kay is proof that good writing performed by good actors is all that s really needed to make a series immensely watchable that and the odd coked up sex scene backed by a jittery techno infused score this is tv by way of cardiac arrest a millennial mad men is how the independent s five star review of the first season put it the show returns to bbc one for its second run on tuesday and the new episodes have even more anxiety inducing thrills than the first the palpitating heart of the office bullpen is leung s hot headed character eric tao eric is the kind of boss who will offer sage advice and acceptance on your way into the office but will harshly admonish you in front of everyone 10 minutes later leung plays him like an amiable pet that ll bare its teeth without warning certainly it s a staggering contrast to the actor in front of me today leung is laidback and tranquil he has a voice suited to asmr videos despite eric s volatility it s he who asks his protégée harper stern myha la herrold in the first episode of the new season to visit an in house service for issues mood the more mental side of your health when harper bemused asks if he himself has ever paid these experts a visit eric brushes off the question the scene s unspoken context suggests that certain people feel a hesitancy in addressing their mental health and merely view it to be in eric s own words corporate diktat leung who was born to chinese parents in new york city agrees there s a block surrounding the usefulness of therapy among people of a certain age but does not think it s simply a generational issue sometimes it s a cultural thing he says like my parents for the longest time i have tried to cleverly get my mom to talk to somebody but it can t come from me it has to come from her i think there s a stigma among people of her generation and maybe her immigrant mentality that says there has to be something wrong with you like you re acknowledging that you re sick that you can t be an ordinary person and need a therapist there s most definitely that point of view leung is open about not having much of a relationship with his parents in the past he s spoken about their initial opposition to his job of choice and i wonder if they re now impressed with his career after all leung has been in the profession for 24 years he made his debut as the villain opposite jackie chan and chris tucker in 1998 buddy action film rush hour and since then he s traversed genres playing a wily electronics store owner in edward norton comedy keeping the faith 2000 a committed police detective in horror film saw 2004 and the abrasive sarcastic miles straume in lost a character who became as adored as the originals despite joining the show in its fourth season 2008 given leung s success you d think his parents might have softened to his chosen career he tells me they have never asked him questions about his job my dad is retired now but he was a high school teacher and a lot of his students would know me and ask him to get them an autograph and that was the only time that we even broached the subject of me being an actor he says maybe they watch stuff i have no evidence of them doing that he smiles wistfully although i had a lost action figure and they did get a kick out of that leung s life has undergone several changes in the past decade first in 2015 he became a father something he says has considerably changed his outlook on his job when was very little we used to go where i was shooting together leung who is based in brooklyn with his wife explains but then he started school which means he can t follow me that is now always a consideration my first questions whenever i m approached for a potential job are where is it how long is it and are they going to let me travel back and forth ken leung stars as the volatile hot headed eric tao in industry bbc bad wolf hbo and then in 2019 leung s younger brother kevin tragically drowned in thailand that year while waiting to film scenes for an unsuccessful pilot leung began writing an essay about his brother and the tumultuous struggle he endured to bring his body home the result was published on gq last year leung tells me he started jotting his thoughts down after thinking one day my son is going to ask about it and what am i going to remember it took him two years to write i remember that that period was so beautiful because it went with me wherever i went i wasn t alone leung says of the essay i miss that did the act of writing about the experience bring him closure you know i don t want closure with it i wish i wasn t done with it here leung s thoughts drift to his childhood he mentions a memory of playing in the back garden with his best friend gerard he says that like most youngsters they would pretend to be batman and superman characters leung recalls thinking didn t make sense for him a young chinese american boy to play now in a time rife with superhero films characters like black panther and shang chi who didn t get their own films when leung was growing up are fronting their own blockbusters in turn finally the spotlight is being placed on different cultures leung while happy with the change is also ambivalent about the extent of its success we live in an age where companies and my kid s school now have a diversity programme whether that is sincere or not is a whole other question my kid gets to see shang chi and instead of batman and superman he can pretend to be him which is a dream come true but i have mixed views he says it s gratifying to a degree but i m weary of it what we re talking about is undoing centuries of a mindset and that takes doing we live in an age where companies and my kid s school now have a diversity programme whether that is sincere or not is a whole other question he wonders whether these diversity programmes do anything or whether they re simply lip service designed to avoid getting people in trouble part of leung s weariness stems from the fact that a quarter of a century into his career he s still getting offered projects associated with martial arts purely because of his asian heritage will the world ever see us as something that doesn t have anything to do with martial arts he asks defeatedly why is that still happening why am i a non martial artist still periodically getting approached for things where it s just assumed that i know it so yeah there s a lot more internal work to do i know that we do it out in public but that s not where the work needs to happen one credit that stands out for leung is the aforementioned miles in lost the role was specifically created for him after showrunners damon lindelof and carlton cuse saw his memorable guest role in the sopranos leung appeared in the season six episode remember when as carter chong a patient with anger issues who junior played by dominic chianese befriends at a psychiatric centre they immediately dreamt up the role of miles and contacted leung s agent a year later in 2008 he made his debut in the show s fourth season and remained a part of the series right up until its finale in 2010 rumours of a lost reboot surface periodically and considering spoiler alert miles makes it out alive leung would probably get the call should that ever happen it would be a welcome call joining the fourth series of lost as miles in 2014 ken leung became a fan favourite star of the franchise abc youtube i would love to go back to hawaii he says visibly excited by the prospect when i think of lost i don t think of the show as much as i think of hawaii but i guess it depends on where they wanted to take it and who was coming back i know there was an idea being kicked around where miles and sawyer would have a true detective style spin off but that would be so much its own thing that it wouldn t feel like continuing lost but on the face of it sure there s nothing about lost where it s like i never wanna do that again so yeah maybe in the extremely unlikely case the acting dries up would leung be up for channelling his inner eric tao to pursue a career in finance no no no i would get killed he laughs after season one some journalists would ask me for financial advice and would not believe me when i told them they were literally asking the wrong person if they followed my advice they would have lost a lot of money industry returns to bbc one at 10 40pm on 27 september all episodes of the second season will be added to bbc iplayer on the same day

photo courtesy of flickr was there then no essential difference between the ruler and the ruled salman rushdie the enchantress of florence sri lanka unravelled and unravelling is mesmerised by a new wonder the lotus tower when that monumental symbol of rajapaksa folly was opened to the public last week people thronged to pay the entrance fee ride to the top and gaze down a monk enthused that he felt close to the highest of buddhist heavens women thanked mahinda rajapaksa for enabling them to have this wondrous experience it was as if economic ruin and social collapse was happening in another country to another people according to a survey conducted by a group of doctors 80 of children in sooriyawewa in the rajapaksa home district of hambantota are malnourished unlike the international cricket stadium the rajapaksas built in that water starved locality that gets the water the people are denied that distressing statistic alone suffices to bare the vacuity of the rajapaksa brand of infrastructure led development in a 2007 cable american ambassador robert blake wrote an empty port an empty airport and an empty vast convention centre would not generate the benefits that hambantota needs one percent of the money spent on these vanity projects could have provided the people of hambantota with every possible creature comfort for generations to come hambantota was poor when mahinda rajapaksa first became president in 2005 and is still poor 17 years later untouched by rajapaksa development yet solidly pro rajapaksa at every election infrastructure led development was a key pillar of rajapaksa economics build airports ports stadia expressways and prosperity will follow the strategy enabled corruption on unprecedented scale satisfied mahinda rajapaksa s colossal vanity and against all reason increased the family s popularity the projects productive or not often not were tabula rasa on which dreams of national glory and illusions of popular prosperity could be inscribed an actor playing the role of historian once created for the rajapaksas a lineage going back to the buddha via king dutugemunu the massive physical infrastructure projects were depicted as modern variants of the infrastructure projects of ancient kings a historical continuum sandahiru seya the descendent of runwanweli seya and hambantota port the descendent of parakrama samudraya people were invited to come and admire a breakwater a runway and a walking path masquerading as a marina in that way an illusion of ownership was created people came they admired and they voted the habit is so ingrained that even without the full effect of the rajapaksa propaganda machine the lotus tower looks like a shortcut to heaven to some sri lankans not in the same overwhelming numbers as in the past not enough for the slpp to win the next election but enough for every single contesting rajapaksa father son uncle nephew and cousin to be re elected perhaps even enough for the slpp with its consignment of deplorables to hold the balance of power in the next parliament basil rajapaksa can see this future and he is readying the slpp for it the party s new political academy will hone the next generation of rajapaksa devotee activists sinhala buddhist supremacism will be re burnished with the usual talk of motherland being in danger lotus tower undead tiger and encroaching muslim in combination can dazzle enough eyes and twist enough minds and the rajapaksas will have their path back to national relevance kingmakers if not kings absurd faith in an interview with a private tv channel during the run up to the 2019 presidential poll udaya gammanpila called gotabaya rajapaksa a composite of the managerial skills of mahathir mohammad farsightedness of lee kuan yew bravery of vladimir putin spiritual approach of jawaharlal nehru and patriotism of fidel castro the words seem grotesque now and should have seemed embarrassingly funny even then yet the interviewer didn t laugh or even roll his eyes the audience would have lapped it up an electorate that is predisposed to believe any absurdity sans proof sans fact that was what the rajapaksas needed and that was what they created with their propaganda illusions and delusions were their stock of trade in august 2005 an outburst of mass hysteria about buddha statues emanating luminous rays coincided with the mavilaru operation and shored up support in the sinhala south for the fourth eelam war an elephant calf was said to have been born on the very day high king mahinda won the war a lie that was believed until it was inadvertently exposed in 2013 credulity was nursed and fostered turned into a political weapon and election winning strategy to quote the late great hilary mantel did the enlightenment really occur or was it just someone by the styx lighting a cigarette is it still yesterday children of the revolution london review of books in a recent you tube interview journalist tharindu jayawardana chronicled the anti dr shafi conspiracy that helped set the stage for gotabaya rajapaksa s 2019 victory a gynaecologist singlehandedly sterilising 4000 sinhala buddhist mothers by squeezing their fallopian tubes during caesarean operations a claim that seems too preposterous to rate even a denial yet it was believed by millions of people as nothing but the truth the story of a terrorist muslim doctor working to annihilate the sinhala nation was published just a month after the easter sunday massacre channa jayasumana blessed the tale with his seal of approval wimal weerawansa called it the war of the wombs respected gynaecologists stated that women couldn t be sterilised by squeezing their fallopian tubes but most of the public and a large section of media preferred to believe a dentist who insisted it could be done the cid investigated the issue and dismissed it as a non issue the police arrested dr shafi on no evidence recorded statements afterwards and backdated them the confluence of the absurd and the illegal advanced gotabaya rajapaksa s saviour pretension in holy bones holy dust charles freeman argues that most medieval europeans lived in a community of the supernatural and points out that to shift one s consciousness to the supernatural the space between heaven and earth is to lessen one s attention to the immediacy of the natural world rajapaksa politics too operate in a similar politico psychological space which ignores denies reality delusions of divine signs illusions of grandeur and phobia of enemies are used to make voters forget their ordinary day to day earthly problems the kelani cobra story was not a singularity but the final landmark in this road of lies not even national bankruptcy has been able to end that mindset as the adoration of the lotus tower demonstrates facts have no role in this spectacle it never did in a functioning democracy people too bear a share of responsibility for outcomes be they positive or negative the culpability of 6 9 million of our fellow citizens in our national plight should not be denied the people are not innocent or blameless this is not a fairytale in which the monster holds a land in thrall forcibly in this story most people invited the monster to take over their land and their lives even where leaders are forward looking progressive projects can suffer defeat if a majority of people are not in tandem the outcome of chile s referendum is an excellent case in point such dangers are particularly acute in times of economic and social anxiety when everything solid melts into air past or an imaginary version of it could seem the only mooring left in italy an extreme rightwing party which traces its lineage back to mussolini s fascist party is expected to gain power this sunday the new march on rome is electoral a democracy is shaped not just by its leaders but also by its people a system change is impossible if enough people remain unchanged the absurdity is obvious or should be a people cannot vote in the corrupt and expect an honest government vote in the inept and expect an efficient government vote in the stupid and expect an intelligent government holding leaders to account is not enough those who vote for them too should be held accountable the people are suffering but many of them brought this disaster on themselves they were deceived but they allowed themselves to be deceived that is why an election however necessary can easily become a part of the problem rather than its solution let alone the panacea that some claim it will be haunted by old mistakes yatharoopa was a highly popular late night magazine programme aired on rupavahini from august 2016 to march 2018 the programme aimed at debunking myths and superstitions and promoting reason and rational thinking in its second season it was suddenly taken off the air media reports claimed that president maithripala sirisena banned the programme at the request of a group of astrologers astrophysicist kavan ratnatunga made the same claim subsequently president sirisena reportedly said that as a state institution the remit of the rupavahini was to promote and not debunk astrology little wonder he made mahinda rajapaksa the prime minister seven months later in 2018 the 19th amendment was in force president sirisena did not have the constitutional right to make unilateral decisions regarding a ministry that was not under him yet neither prime minister ranil wickremesinghe nor media minister mangala samaraweera objected publicly the reason for their public silence is not hard to fathom president sirisena was going off the rails already the unp tried to avert disaster by alternately ignoring and humouring his antics it didn t save the government the anti constitutional coup was defeated not via accommodation but through resistance winning elections is another matter the pragmatic would argue one must confirm be what people want their leaders to be so sajith premadasa distanced himself from the government he had been a part of for almost five years and adopted a rajapaksa lite approach characterised by temple hopping and a refusal to do or say anything remotely controversial the only exception was his courageous stance on menstrual products in vain mangala samaraweera felt that he had to leave electoral politics in order to be able to speak his mind truth has become a costly mistake in sri lanka by then telling truth to power could be dangerous telling truth to people could be disastrous the electorate s unparalleled credulity in 2019 was the result of a presence and an absence the rajapaksas occupied the propaganda arena promoting irrationality and absurdity anti rajapaksa forces avoided such propaganda battles or fled them when the cost was deemed too high as demonstrated by the banning of yatharoopa their evasion and disengagement backfired how could voters be weaned away from rajapaksa politics if they were subjected to only one kind of propaganda diet a no holds barred resistance might have worked better the present is becoming overshadowed by the shades of those past errors the appointment of 38 state ministers the same month indirect taxes were hiked is reminiscent of the unp s failed attempt to contain maithripala sirisena through appeasement the ongoing repression smacks of rajapaksa flavour from the use of pta to the prosecution of lawyer dushmantha weeraratne on september 9 for tooting his car horn to the tune of kaputu kak near galle face the rajapaksas too arrested a young motorist for tooting his horn against a road closure the difference lies in the judicial response in 2021 the young motorist was lambasted for exercising his constitutional right to peaceful protest in 2022 the magistrate threw out the case against the lawyer and warned the police to study the law before taking legal action against a person in geneva the government opted to reject the resolution on sri lanka in toto this is not the wickremesinghe samaraweera foreign policy of 2015 19 when sri lanka was open to the world and willing to take on legitimate concerns of the international community this is a reversion to the medamulana foreign policy of the rajapaksas the rajapaksa habit of dealing with challenges by denying their existence or their severity is also making a comeback health ministry rejected the unicef report on child malnutrition president ranil wickremesinghe s truth telling days seem distant while president wickremesinghe blunders and the opposition exists in a parallel universe where their electoral victory is written in the stars the rajapaksas are back to weaving their web of lies and deception those who believe that aragalaya has rid the popular mind of the cobraesque myth should watch again the rapturous reception to the lotus tower lost in that marvel the contribution that monstrosity and other like it made to our economic bankruptcy is forgotten more than forgotten that column of folly is being hailed as the economic way to go a boon capable of attracting tourists and solving our foreign exchange crisis in one go if the rajapaksas resurface their old idea of building airports on various mountaintops and constructing an expressway right round the country they may even end up being hailed as the only solution to the economic crisis the unp the sjb and the jvp created with help from tamil and muslim parties traitors all
financial markets are under enormous strain despite vigorous efforts by the treasury department and the federal reserve to remedy the current crisis mostly one off interventions these efforts have proven inadequate so secretary paulson announced a four part program to deal with the markets troubles on a more systemic basis the most controversial and probably most important element of the treasury package is a plan to allow the treasury to purchase up to 700 billion in financial assets when markets for those assets appear to fail this new initiative is intended to restore and preserve normal market functions by permitting troubled financial institutions to continue to correct their balance sheets congress must also ensure that it protects the taxpayers interests absent the actions proposed by treasury capital markets at home and worldwide would eventually normalize of their own accord but at what cost to the rest of the economy how long would such a process take and how many non financial businesses would fold in the meantime for lack of access to functional credit markets the policies announced by the treasury are extraordinary and could be justified only if the united states financial system is at risk and the broader economy is under threat of deep recession the current situation appears to meet this test congress should pass the necessary legislation quickly and it should be very clear about the authorities of the new entity and especially about its mandate carefully constraining that mandate to the task at hand restoring markets while protecting taxpayers also congress should act without adding unrelated or loosely related provisions and pass the bill as stand alone legislation once a clean bill has been passed and signed into law congress should then address the many outstanding issues relating to the financial markets to prevent a recurrence of the current turmoil these issues range from tax reform to financial market reform to a re examination of federal policies toward home ownership to changes in certain accounting rules quick action and further action needed congress needs to act carefully but quickly in passing this legislation knowing that it can correct any flaws when it reconvenes next year quick action is needed because financial markets remain deeply stressed and the stress continues to spread to the rest of the economy but congress must also pass a clean bill avoiding the temptation to turn it into a christmas tree of unrelated proposals in particular the bill should not include provisions redirecting any proceeds from the ultimate sale of assets away from treasury s general fund nor should the bill be used as a vehicle for dictating private sector compensation or rewriting bankruptcy laws passage of financial legislation this week is important but much remains to be done in follow on legislation to address factors that contributed to the current turmoil here are some of the key issues congress should take up adopt tax policies to encourage recapitalization many financial firms are in serious need of recapitalization they need to raise additional equity capital to restore their balance sheets and participate again fully and normally with other financial participants and non financial borrowers to facilitate this process congress should allow these firms to issue new classes of common and preferred equity shares for which resulting capital gains and dividend income would be tax exempt many financial firms are in serious need of recapitalization they need to raise additional equity

dissolution reconsider mark to market rules and their application an accounting rule known as mark to market has been blamed as a major factor contributing to weaknesses in financial markets in brief this rule requires firms to value the assets they hold at current market values rather than some other value such as its purchase price under most conditions this rule is perfectly appropriate as it contributes to more accurate valuation of assets and firms however when applied to assets traded in stressed markets or markets where normal trading has ceased the mark to market rule results in the value of assets held in portfolio to be marked down below the fair value that would be established in the market under more normal conditions under the present circumstances the mark to market rule has further and artificially impaired the capital of already weakened firms and has made it more difficult for market participants to gauge the value capitalization and ultimately the potential solvency of troubled firms in short mark to market rules have exacerbated the tendency of financial weakness to spread from firm to firm mark to market rules are set by a private entity the financial accounting standards board fasb the fasb should reconsider the application of these rules under extraordinary circumstances in no way should congress undertake to dictate accounting standards but there may be circumstances in which congress may need to reconsider the effects of those standards with respect to bank capitalization rules for example revise the community reinvestment act cra the cra and other initiatives require banks and other financial institutions to better serve lower income workers while a worthy cause the net effect is often to encourage loans at lower credit standards and to encourage people to buy houses they really cannot afford as a result too often they lose their homes thereby losing savings that took a great effort to accumulate congress should revise these laws to ensure normal lending standards are maintained for all prospective mortgage borrowers the cra and other initiatives require banks and other financial institutions to better serve lower income

a month ago a pound was worth 1 18 down from 1 37 in mid january and 1 44 at its post brexit vote peak in april 2018 it has declined 24pc since then until yesterday many commentators saw the pound s weakness as a consequence of the strength of the dollar rather than a problem with the british currency because other world currencies had also lost value against the greenback sterling s fall accelerated yesterday while the decline in the euro and yen against the dollar was more muted although its weakness was undoubtedly driven in part by the global turmoil the euro fell by 1 4pc on friday and the yen by less than 1pc stocks the ftse 100 briefly dipped below the psychologically important level of 7000 on friday after starting the day at 7155 it fell steadily all morning to 6994 at noon before recovering slightly to close at 7019 a fall of just under 2pc the blue chip index is dominated by international companies but the more domestically focused ftse 250 fell by almost the same amount normally a falling pound would prop up multinational stocks relative to domestic ones because their overseas earnings become more valuable but this relationship broke down on budget day this echoes what happened the day after britain voted for brexit when panicking investors sold everything and forgot that the falling value of the pound it crashed severely that day would be good for the ftse 100 s companies only in the subsequent days did the penny drop something that may be repeated next week if the pound fails to recover other countries stock markets also fell severely on wall street the dow jones fell below 30 000 to close 1 6pc lower at 29 590 the nasdaq market for technology stocks lost 1 8pc in france the benchmark cac 40 fell by just 0 2pc however while in germany the dax lost 2pc the pan european stoxx 600 index dropped by 2 3pc bob schwartz senior economist at oxford economics the consultancy said financial markets are throwing in the towel now fully convinced the fed will do whatever it takes to curb inflation including bringing on a recession stock prices plunged to the lowest level of the year on friday and yields staged another leap upward in anticipation of a string of additional rate hikes commodities fears of a recession caused the oil price to fall by 4pc to 86 71 on friday compared with highs of about 130 after the russian invasion of ukraine this was dwarfed by the 10 2pc fall in the price of iron ore another key economic bellwether bonds gilts or british government bonds also slumped on friday as the biggest losers in a wider european sell off one 10 year issue fell from 106 40 to 103 50 a decline of 2 7pc and a german equivalent lost a more modest 0 5pc to eu97 2 from eu97 7 american bonds did better again reflecting america s safe haven status one 10 year issue gained a fraction from 92 02 to 92 10 gold gold is normally the asset that investors turn to when everything else is falling but not on friday it fell by 1 7pc from 1 673 to 1 644 bitcoin touted by its proponents as a digital replacement for gold thanks to its scarcity lost a similar 1 8pc from 19 400 to 19 094
less than one year after president bill clinton pledged to save social security first he appears to have had second thoughts instead of proposing meaningful reforms to boost workers retirement income and avert social security s coming financial crisis he continues to broker an approach that merely shifts more ious into the program s trust fund in addition to these accounting tricks he is proposing a new entitlement plan called retirement savings accounts these downsized versions of last year s universal savings accounts would use additional tax dollars to encourage people to save for their retirement both of these proposals allow the administration to avoid making any hard decisions about the future of social security the old universal savings accounts proposal was fundamentally poor and the new rsa plan is little better although some lower and middle income americans would be able to save more money for their retirement these accounts would do little to increase savings for all workers in fact many of the workers who would benefit most from such accounts would not even be able to take full advantage of them moreover the president s new tax supported entitlement program would be cumbersome and expensive to manage a better solution would be to allow workers to invest part of their existing payroll taxes in a safe portfolio of u s treasury bonds and stock index funds how rsa accounts would work under the president s latest proposal all single americans who earn up to 40 000 a year and married couples earning under 80 000 a year who contribute to either an employer sponsored 401 k retirement plan or an rsa account would be eligible to receive matching contributions from their employer or a financial institution workers could receive a match on both their overall contribution and the first 100 they save the level of match would depend on earned income the employers and financial institutions would then be reimbursed by the government through a new tax credit equal to 100 percent of the savings match flaws in the plan although workers could expect to earn much more for their retirement from money placed in rsa accounts than they now earn from their social security taxes the flaws in the rsa plan would far outweigh this benefit rsa accounts would not save social security from insolvency instead of reforms that address social security s problems directly the president recommends creating another program in addition to social security using part of the budget surplus to fund this program will not avert social security s impending financial crisis the rsa program would spend more tax money and allow washington to avoid making the painful and necessary decisions that would ensure americans retirement security and social security would continue to face insolvency rsa accounts would become a new tax financed entitlement dedicating promised surpluses to funding rsa accounts is a serious design flaw if the federal government ever ran a deficit something the congressional budget office has admitted could occur then working americans would suffer congress would either have to end the rsa program or force future workers to pay higher taxes for that entitlement far from representing a tax cut rsa accounts could become the first reason cited for future tax increases rsa accounts would be cumbersome and expensive to manage according to the clinton administration sometime after a worker filed an income tax return the government would send a form certifying eligibility for some level of federal match on contributions to either an rsa account or the employer s 401 k plan the worker would make the contribution and the matching amount would be paid by the financial institution or employer who in turn would be reimbursed by the government under the best of circumstances this cumbersome process would be open to mistakes misunderstanding and fraud the plan assumes that every employer or financial institution would participate and advance a matching dollar amount expecting reimbursement by the government in reality participating employers or financial institutions would face compliance paperwork and endless bureaucratic delays if fraud occurs the risk would be borne by the employer or financial institution not the federal government moreover the actual costs of compliance are likely to be much higher than the 10 non refundable tax credit offered by the plan rsa accounts are poorly designed for lower income families most lower income families the very people who most need additional retirement savings are unlikely to benefit from the program taxpayers who would have to choose between either paying the rent or medical bills or putting money aside for an event decades in the future are unlikely to have the extra dollars to save in these accounts and qualify for a federal match as a result the rsa program would evolve into just another middle class entitlement rsa accounts would do little to increase savings one reason many americans cannot save enough for their retirement is that current taxes are too high leaving high social security taxes in place without reforming the system does nothing to help these americans real reform is needed the solution to these problems is not to create a new entitlement or savings program but to turn part of the existing social security system into a true savings tool congress should allow workers to invest a portion of their current social security retirement tax dollars in individually owned personal retirement accounts the funds in these accounts could be put in a diversified portfolio of stocks bonds and other income producing assets part of the budget surplus could be used to cover the short term transition costs associated with this reform such personal retirement accounts unlike rsa accounts would enable americans to enjoy higher incomes in retirement while placing social security on sound financial footing david c john is senior policy analyst for social security at the heritage foundation

political dynasties are inherently problematic and ambiguous when politics becomes a family business enabling bloodline clans and generational households to occupy the seat of power we have what will often amount to the very antithesis of responsible political function indeed countries like indonesia have passed laws prohibiting relatives from immediately succeeding each other in public office advertisement as siddhartha george argues in a paper on the descendant effects of political dynasties employing regression discontinuity design rdd if political capital is heritable that is deriving from a prominent name or a powerful network dynastic politics may render elections less effective at selecting good leaders and disciplining them in office one of the factors involved in the likelihood of negative effects is in his term moral hazard descendants face moral hazard he explains because they inherit voters loyal to their family predecessor typically a father dampening incentives to exert effort and perform well in office the common problem of the epigone this is especially true in the economic realm dynastic politics tend to issue in a reversal of fortune that is a standard deviation decrease in wealth percentile rank inherited political capital george concludes allows descendants to persist in power even when they underperform as well as weakens the ability of elections to select talented leaders dynastic families are a predictable feature of despotic regimes such as the kims in north korea they can be prominent in secular patristic regimes such as the peróns in argentina or the abes in japan dynastic families readily assume office in democratic countries through name recognition and the accumulation of powerful resources consisting of politically acquired wealth long haul expertise and extensive influence one thinks of the pitt family in britain the adams and roosevelt families in the u s and the papandreous in greece each having produced two national leaders one notes three generations of nehru ghandi relations in india and the bush family in the u s that enjoyed three terms in the white house with indifferent results the clintons for their part almost achieved a regime by marriage advertisement the cataclysmic tenure of the rajapaksa family in sri lanka whose thunberg schwab apostleship caused the total ruin of their country serves as an object lesson for the times what brought the crisis to a boil writes john hulsman was the desire of the long ruling rajapaksa dynasty to curry favor with the international technocracy making davos man happy by overnight transforming the island into a net zero nation doing away at a stroke with all the chemical fertilizers and pesticides absolutely necessary to make the country function economically while not yet a sri lanka like basket case canada has clearly suffered under the sway of a political dynasty emanating from the province of quebec with its legal system rooted in the napoleonic code and its predilection for authoritarian rule whether clerical or political there has always been something ultramontane about my home province the british tradition of common law institutions linguistic plurality and individual rights and freedoms never took solid hold in la belle province as university of oxford professor and author of pluralist thought and the state in britain and france cécile laborde pithily explains french thought has been permeated by the idea of the autonomy of the state vis à vis society at large while british thought has remained committed to an ideal of fluidity between state and society pierre elliott trudeau a charismatic and authoritarian personality who served as prime minister of canada for 15 years and 164 days is a case in point his avowedly leftist politics and close friendships with dictators like fidel castro were a severe blow to the country s democratic identity and loyalist patrimony canada s current civil and political difficulties and dwindling economic prospects owe much to his national energy program nep of 1980 the first move in the gradual destruction of canada s oil and gas producing regions located primarily in the province of alberta at the expense of both the province s and the country s prosperity moreover according to gwyn morgan in the financial post during the 15 years that pierre trudeau was prime minister federal spending rose from 30 to 53 percent of gdp advertisement as bob plamondon reveals in his compendious the truth about trudeau the discrepancy between the strong economic position trudeau inherited from his predecessor and the calamity he left to his successor could not be more stark trudeau left deep divisions and scars a legacy of economic destruction regional alienation military emasculation and international isolation such is the elder trudeau s legacy to canada plamondon concludes trudeau may have brought canada moments of glamour but in the end his pirouettes were not worth the price though devoid of his father s intellectual sophistication justin trudeau is following in the footsteps of le père in devastating canada s tradition of freedom and prosperity there is really nothing new under the son on the economic front overall federal spending accounts for 64 percent of gdp and as of 2020 the gross national debt has risen to 129 2 percent of gdp and continues to rise politically justin is dismantling canada s democratic scaffolding girder by girder aligning the country with the globalist vision or great reset of a new world order predicated on wealth distribution away from small business and the middle class to the corporate elite an international green agenda and a redesign of the free market to favor the corporate takeover of global governance davos man will be happy increasingly centralized authority allows trudeau who may be regarded as a moral hazard par excellence to get away with one despotic initiative after another including 72 secret orders in council advertisement donald j savoie observes in democracy in canada the disintegration of our institutions an unsparing analysis of canada s federal and parliamentary dysfunction trudeau fils pointed to his father for putting in place measures to concentrate power justin himself concedes in his own words that the trend toward more control in the prime minister s office can be traced as far back as my father who kicked it off in the first place the dynasty persists in working its mischief when it comes to politicians like the trudeaus the dynastic urge to consolidate power and reset a representative mode of government in the direction of outright tyranny is irresistible they are the only two leaders who have invoked the 1914 war measures act in peacetime when neither occasion demanded it even in trying circumstances the emergencies act passed into law in 1988 is the same beast by another name regarding the first instance the october crisis in the fall of 1970 plamondon writes furnishing strong evidence to support his claim that trudeau senior wildly overestimated or purposely exaggerated the threat to society from a ragtag group of sovereignist insurgents in the second case the truckers protest in ottawa in the winter of 2022 trudeau junior perpetrated a needless and destructive farce provoked as many believe by personal spite or mere authoritarianism it must be a family trait the trudeau dynasty with its autocratic pathology has spelled approaching collapse for a once fortunate country canada has been torn from its historical foundations its heirs having become what cultural action party of canada director brad salzberg calls trudeau s nemesis communities old stock canadians anglophones westerners conservatives truckers oil sands workers farmers christians and pro lifers at the same time trudeau has promoted 3rd world immigrants the lgbtqia sodality transgenders violent agitators illegals freeloaders and indigents to the top of the food chain after all diversity is our strength advertisement the social order has been inverted by an anti democratic non consultative political family younger brother alexandre sacha also an acolyte of fidel castro and like his father animated by a profound appreciation of china does not apparently evince an interest in dynastic script fulfillment it appears that the dynasty will stop at two trudeaus though it may be too late for rejoicing the dynastic work has been done and canada may never be the same again

we have gone through the inflection point of bonds offering more value than equities thanks to the pricing in and delivery of large rate hikes and a re emergence of inflation risk premia in the bond market says peter chatwell head of global macro strategies trading at mizuho international we would expect the earnings downside risks to make those equity risk premia even less generous in the coming months unwilling to risk cash in a stock market that by one measure is swinging more wildly than any time since at least 1997 investors are instead settling for two year treasuries yielding the most since 2007 one year notes pay out nearly as much and while both are trailing the latest inflation readings it s better than the 20 per cent rout in the s p 500 this year lower volatility all told fixed income is yielding the biggest rewards relative to equities in more than a decade right on cue investors have been pouring record sums of money into short duration exchange traded funds while a record of 62 per cent of global fund managers are overweight cash according to a bank of america survey they have also reduced their exposure to stocks to an all time low cash and short term fixed income increasingly offer lower volatility and high yield within a cross asset portfolio morgan stanley s chief cross asset strategist andrew sheets wrote in a note the new appeal of those alternatives is one reason he recommends credit over equities advertisement the shift is increasingly showing up in flows into and out of funds government bond etfs have gathered more inflows in september than their equities counterparts for just the second instance in three years sovereign bonds now account for 22 per cent of all etf and mutual fund buys over the past year while allocations to stocks now net out to 2 per cent in that time according to deutsche bank the foundation of the post pandemic rally ultra low interest rates and monetary stimulus has crumbled in its place now stand elevated borrowing costs and tighter financial conditions that have forced investors into cash preservation mode fed s aggressive hawkishness that s evident even among those willing to wade into the stock market they are favouring companies with strong balance sheets and high dividend yields cash rich companies continue to see strong inflows such as the pacer us cash cows 100 etf which has seen only positive monthly inflows in 2022 totaling us6 7 billion year to date companies with steady income streams are also still attractive for investors with the us36 billion schwab us dividend equity etf getting a us10 6 billion cash injection this year the fed s aggressive hawkishness has increased the threat of recession and diminished the odds of soft landing that opens the door for longer dated bonds to soon become more attractive too especially if the fed shows signs of slowing the pace of tightening advertisement when rates have peaked it would make sense to move out along the maturity curve in anticipation of bond yields coming down said chris iggo chief investment officer of core investments at axa investment managers for hsbc s chief multi asset strategist max kettner short duration bonds have become a better option than equities but a clear shift from inflation worries to growth concerns would be the trigger for an even broader move to fixed income for now the hsbc strategy team led by kettner has moved to a bigger overweight position in cash and cut equity exposure to maximum underweight in august even the you only live once day trading crowd hasn t been able to profit from any equity dips we are definitely seeing a regime shift kettner says the tina and yolo world of 2020 21 has been basically brought to an abrupt halt by the combination of slower growth and higher inflation bloomberg

ken leung doesn t know what he s talking about in industry the razor sharp series about young graduates competing for permanent positions in the cutthroat world of finance requires its actors to deliver arcane terminology at such a speed you might think they understood the meaning behind what they were saying you d be wrong i just can t grasp the mathematics of it says the 52 year star of lost and rush hour it took me a long time to get what a short is and i still can t say i understand it now you borrow something you sell it then you buy it back and return the thing i have to try and picture it as a concrete thing like a loaf of bread but it doesn t always work that way in finance because of the minutiae of it shorting a stock google will tell you is when a trader borrows shares from a broker and immediately sells them expecting the stock price to plummet imminently ie when they have to pay for them so they can pocket the difference or something like that thankfully enjoying industry does not necessitate a ba in macroeconomics industry created by former finance boys mickey down and konrad kay is proof that good writing performed by good actors is all that s really needed to make a series immensely watchable that and the odd coked up sex scene backed by a jittery techno infused score this is tv by way of cardiac arrest a millennial mad men is how the independent s five star review of the first season put it the show returns to bbc one for its second run on tuesday and the new episodes have even more anxiety inducing thrills than the first the palpitating heart of the office bullpen is leung s hot headed character eric tao eric is the kind of boss who will offer sage advice and acceptance on your way into the office but will harshly admonish you in front of everyone 10 minutes later leung plays him like an amiable pet that ll bare its teeth without warning certainly it s a staggering contrast to the actor in front of me today leung is laidback and tranquil he has a voice suited to asmr videos despite eric s volatility it s he who asks his protégée harper stern myha la herrold in the first episode of the new season to visit an in house service for issues mood the more mental side of your health when harper bemused asks if he himself has ever paid these experts a visit eric brushes off the question the scene s unspoken context suggests that certain people feel a hesitancy in addressing their mental health and merely view it to be in eric s own words corporate diktat leung who was born to chinese parents in new york city agrees there s a block surrounding the usefulness of therapy among people of a certain age but does not think it s simply a generational issue sometimes it s a cultural thing he says like my parents for the longest time i have tried to cleverly get my mom to talk to somebody but it can t come from me it has to come from her i think there s a stigma among people of her generation and maybe her immigrant mentality that says there has to be something wrong with you like you re acknowledging that you re sick that you can t be an ordinary person and need a therapist there s most definitely that point of view leung is open about not having much of a relationship with his parents in the past he s spoken about their initial opposition to his job of choice and i wonder if they re now impressed with his career after all leung has been in the profession for 24 years he made his debut as the villain opposite jackie chan and chris tucker in 1998 buddy action film rush hour and since then he s traversed genres playing a wily electronics store owner in edward norton comedy keeping the faith 2000 a committed police detective in horror film saw 2004 and the abrasive sarcastic miles straume in lost a character who became as adored as the originals despite joining the show in its fourth season 2008 given leung s success you d think his parents might have softened to his chosen career he tells me they have never asked him questions about his job my dad is retired now but he was a high school teacher and a lot of his students would know me and ask him to get them an autograph and that was the only time that we even broached the subject of me being an actor he says maybe they watch stuff i have no evidence of them doing that he smiles wistfully although i had a lost action figure and they did get a kick out of that leung s life has undergone several changes in the past decade first in 2015 he became a father something he says has considerably changed his outlook on his job when was very little we used to go where i was shooting together leung who is based in brooklyn with his wife explains but then he started school which means he can t follow me that is now always a consideration my first questions whenever i m approached for a potential job are where is it how long is it and are they going to let me travel back and forth ken leung stars as the volatile hot headed eric tao in industry bbc bad wolf hbo and then in 2019 leung s younger brother kevin tragically drowned in thailand that year while waiting to film scenes for an unsuccessful pilot leung began writing an essay about his brother and the tumultuous struggle he endured to bring his body home the result was published on gq last year leung tells me he started jotting his thoughts down after thinking one day my son is going to ask about it and what am i going to remember it took him two years to write i remember that that period was so beautiful because it went with me wherever i went i wasn t alone leung says of the essay i miss that did the act of writing about the experience bring him closure you know i don t want closure with it i wish i wasn t done with it here leung s thoughts drift to his childhood he mentions a memory of playing in the back garden with his best friend gerard he says that like most youngsters they would pretend to be batman and superman characters leung recalls thinking didn t make sense for him a young chinese american boy to play now in a time rife with superhero films characters like black panther and shang chi who didn t get their own films when leung was growing up are fronting their own blockbusters in turn finally the spotlight is being placed on different cultures leung while happy with the change is also ambivalent about the extent of its success we live in an age where companies and my kid s school now have a diversity programme whether that is sincere or not is a whole other question my kid gets to see shang chi and instead of batman and superman he can pretend to be him which is a dream come true but i have mixed views he says it s gratifying to a degree but i m weary of it what we re talking about is undoing centuries of a mindset and that takes doing we live in an age where companies and my kid s school now have a diversity programme whether that is sincere or not is a whole other question he wonders whether these diversity programmes do anything or whether they re simply lip service designed to avoid getting people in trouble part of leung s weariness stems from the fact that a quarter of a century into his career he s still getting offered projects associated with martial arts purely because of his asian heritage will the world ever see us as something that doesn t have anything to do with martial arts he asks defeatedly why is that still happening why am i a non martial artist still periodically getting approached for things where it s just assumed that i know it so yeah there s a lot more internal work to do i know that we do it out in public but that s not where the work needs to happen one credit that stands out for leung is the aforementioned miles in lost the role was specifically created for him after showrunners damon lindelof and carlton cuse saw his memorable guest role in the sopranos leung appeared in the season six episode remember when as carter chong a patient with anger issues who junior played by dominic chianese befriends at a psychiatric centre they immediately dreamt up the role of miles and contacted leung s agent a year later in 2008 he made his debut in the show s fourth season and remained a part of the series right up until its finale in 2010 rumours of a lost reboot surface periodically and considering spoiler alert miles makes it out alive leung would probably get the call should that ever happen it would be a welcome call joining the fourth series of lost as miles in 2014 ken leung became a fan favourite star of the franchise abc youtube i would love to go back to hawaii he says visibly excited by the prospect when i think of lost i don t think of the show as much as i think of hawaii but i guess it depends on where they wanted to take it and who was coming back i know there was an idea being kicked around where miles and sawyer would have a true detective style spin off but that would be so much its own thing that it wouldn t feel like continuing lost but on the face of it sure there s nothing about lost where it s like i never wanna do that again so yeah maybe in the extremely unlikely case the acting dries up would leung be up for channelling his inner eric tao to pursue a career in finance no no no i would get killed he laughs after season one some journalists would ask me for financial advice and would not believe me when i told them they were literally asking the wrong person if they followed my advice they would have lost a lot of money industry returns to bbc one at 10 40pm on 27 september all episodes of the second season will be added to bbc iplayer on the same day

these three names and others of a similar sound such as donnellan and donlon are sometimes confused as spelling variations have occurred among emigrant families they are however totally distinct and indeed both the mcdonnells and o donnells are made up of several distinct septs the main branch of the o donnells based in donegal is the most eminent of the gaelic families leading back to niall of the nine hostages but owing their name to one domhnaill another branch was from thomond limerick and clare and a third from galway roscommon the donnelly or o donnelly family are also from the same stock as the o donnells in that they too are descendants of niall of the nine hostages and are originally from what is now county tyrone the mcdonnell family are more complicated having several separate roots one of which is the mcdonnells of antrim who were a gallowglass mercenary soldier family the roots of the other mcdonnell families are in donegal and clare because of the frequent omission of the o and mac from gaelic names it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the origin of a person named donnell among the prominent donnells whose specific kinship is difficult to determine is james c donnell 1853 1927 who was brought to the u s at age two and became a crude oil hauler in titusville pennsylvania later rising to become a vice president with standard oil and later president of ohio oil he was a classic oilman who even at the height of his executive career liked to work at the wellhead he is estimated to have drilled 42 000 wells during his career and at his death was one of the last oil giants among the prominent donnellys is ignatius donnelly 1831 1901 an entrepreneur of philadelphia who went to minnesota to found a town and on its failure farmed the site instead he became a republican politician and lieutenant governor of the state and later a congressman in 1863 69 perhaps the most famous of the o donnells historically was red hugh o donnell 1575 1608 who at age 18 was kidnapped and imprisoned by the english deputy in ireland who feared the power of the clan in 1591 along with the famous hugh o neill he escaped and the following year was inaugurated as chief of the o donnells he joined with o neill and the other ulster chieftains in the nine years war against the english which was finally lost at the battle of kinsale hugh o donnell was sent to spain to enlist further help and died there apparently from poison administered by an english spy of the donegal o donnells there was frank hugh o donnell 1848 1916 the politician and journalist who left the parliamentary party due to his opposition to its leader parnell but later wrote a major history of the party possibly the most prominent o donnell in ireland at the moment is the very popular donegal born singer daniel o donnell in the u s prominent o donnells include chat show host author and actress rosie o donnell and actor chris o donnell whose credits include batman forever circle of friends and in love and war among many others the o donnell mcdonnell and donnelly families were prominent in the american struggle for independence there were 155 donnellys 139 mcdonnells and 36 o donnells in the american revolutionary army the list of soldiers in the war also illustrates the range of spelling variations that occur in the u s the list includes ensign john o connell of washington county militia pennsylvania captain nathaniel donnell of steven new york artillery colonel andrew donnally of botecourt county militia virginia lieutenant patrick donnelly of 7 th regiment maryland line lieutenant moses donley of bedford county militia pennsylvania and captain john mcdonnol of shee s regiment pennsylvania
a simple blood test to detect more than 50 types of cancer is being hailed by the makers of the test as a new approach to cancer screening but canadian medical experts caution the technology needs more work earlier this month grail an american biotech company reported their latest results from their study on their galleri blood test a multi cancer early detection test mced the test is designed to find multiple types of cancer through a blood sample by looking for signals of cancer on dna that cells shed into the bloodstream in the company s recent clinical trial of their product they found that out of about 6 600 people over the age of 50 the test flagged potential cancer in 92 people of those 92 people most of them 62 per cent did not have cancer after they were followed up with further testing including imaging scans and biopsies some of the flagged people did have cancer with 35 people diagnosed with 36 cancers the fact that we actually caught these cancers 71 per cent of them do not have available screening options i thought was remarkable said dr jeffrey michael venstrom chief medical officer with grail a stock image of the galleri multi cancer early detection test which is only available in the u s grail of the some 6 500 study participants who were not flagged on the blood test 86 did go on to develop cancer in the next 12 months found through traditional screening methods it s not clear how many cancers might have truly been present in that group but missed by the test and screening the results have not been published in a peer reviewed journal more trials coming the galleri test is one of the first mced tests available in the u s by prescription through a doctor although not yet available in canada mced tests like galleri are gaining attention as they may be useful if they re proven to help prevent cancer deaths says the american cancer society recently u s president joe biden announced further review of these tests through a government funded clinical trial that will look at the efficacy of multiple types of early screening tests the galleri test has also caught the eye of the national health service in england which is partnering with grail on a three year trial to test out the galleri test and its effectiveness on 140 000 volunteers early results are expected next year it could be years before we see tests like these in canada for those who study early cancer detection and overdiagnosis they say it s too early to know if and how widespread a test like this one could be in canada one researcher says a concern he has with the galleri test is that it doesn t find every cancer for large tumours the test is very effective and you can detect it but if a tumour becomes smaller and smaller the test is not very effective said dr eleftherios diamandis a professor at the university of toronto s laboratory medicine department and a medical biochemist at mount sinai hospital and university health network in toronto diamandis says based on his research false positives with the test are also an issue if you were interested in taking this test you must understand that there is no perfect test can tell you you have cancer or you do not have cancer he said experts say overdiagnosis of cancer is a concern with any early detection test just because something is found doesn t mean it would ever have grown to be harmful kenchiro168 shutterstock the tests are imperfect and it s too early to decide if the galleri test is good enough for solving this century long quest to find biomarkers that counteract the presence of cancer at an early stage that s why diamandis and other canadian experts say the test needs to be scrutinized further and independently before it is used clinically which could be years from now we need to of course potentially be excited about these but they need to be evaluated in a rigorous way where we know exactly what the benefits or the harms are so that when people are thinking about getting these tests they know what they re dealing with said dr eddy lang head of emergency medicine for the calgary zone at alberta health services and professor at the university of calgary blood tests to detect cancer early detection of cancer is key to decreasing the number of cancer related deaths in canada although the overall rate of new cancer cases is declining the number of cancer diagnoses and deaths continue to grow due to an aging population and population growth about 233 900 people in canada will be diagnosed with cancer and 85 100 cancer related deaths are expected this year alone according to statistics canada watch blood test detects cancer in healthy people company claims blood test detects signs of cancer in healthy people study finds duration 2 07 a u s biotech company grail says its galleri blood test was able to detect signs of cancer in otherwise healthy people showing hopeful signs for early screening but experts warn that some cancers never become life threatening and early detection could lead to unnecessary or painful treatments the galleri test is just one of several tests being trialed in hopes of catching cancers in earlier stages venstrom says there are a lot of benefits of the test including early detection in grails s recent pathfinder study about half of the 36 cancers discovered in the 35 people were at an early stage this means that these patients are likely to go on to potentially curative intent therapy and have much better outcomes venstrom said the galleri test is only available in the u s a health canada spokesperson told cbc news the federal health authority does not regulate testing services nor tests developed by public or private laboratories for their in house use provinces and territories are responsible for testing services be an extremely cautious consumer diamandis says he and colleagues have been studying grail and the galleri test for about seven years based on the results they ve reviewed diamandis says the test isn t ready for clinical use as there are still some unknowns like how many cancers are missed and false positivity rate venstrom says the test s false positive rate is less than one per cent eddy lang is an emergency room doctor in calgary submitted by kelly johnston university of calgary both diamandis and lang say overdiagnosis is a concern with any early detection tests that s when you find something it s there but it would have never caused you any harm had you never known about it said lang he says this is well known for prostate cancer screening and for mammography screening for breast cancer there s always this risk that you re going to find a small indolent tumour that actually will never grow never spread and never come to your attention had you never looked for it in the first place so i think the key thing is for people to be aware of the risks lang added that s why he and diamandis say these multi cancer detecting blood tests need to be rigorously studied by independent bodies that can offer guidelines on any potential usage unless there s a recommendation that you should go ahead and have these things i would be an extremely cautious consumer of these tests because once the test is drawn and you know the result you may be going down a pathway that you will regret at the end of the day lang said

the federal reserve bank s move last week to raise interest rates again the fifth increase this year likely will fuel a corresponding surge that has developed the revival of certificates of deposit cds are making a comeback with arkansas financial institutions and lenders across the nation promoting the investments to customers an effort that dried up during the pandemic when interest rates effectively bottomed out at 0 financial institutions have followed the fed rate increases and raised yields on cds to a three year high we re going to continue to see rate specials as interest rates rise said randy dennis president of dd f consulting group a little rock firm that provides a broad range of services to the financial sector lenders are motivated by the need to replenish declining deposits their primary source of funding to bolster lending activity it seems to be a new trend now for banks and credit unions to attract deposits to come out with a cd special said ken tumin who operates depositaccounts com a consumer friendly site that tracks deposit rates and data nationwide it s been a competitive market consumers are responding favorably to the investment bonanza where rates in a handful of states are running as high as 4 and it s common to find returns of more than 2 offered by arkansas banks and credit unions cds are a fairly safe harbor product with a quick return they re guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corp for investors grappling with a turbulent stock market and threats of recession the benchmark s p 500 index is down about 14 for the year and morgan stanley is projecting that could fall by another 27 by the end of the year inflation at the same time has reached a 40 year high there s a huge market and a huge opportunity for customers to access cds and get a great rate of return said joshua jensen chief deposit officer at simmons bank when you compare where we ve been with today we re really at a very high return rate environment in terms of savings accounts and cds many banks are out there marketing and advertising their product again arkansas federal credit union began offering a special boost cd in march when the fed first raised rates that has attracted 43 6 million in cd investments since launch the 24 month cd gives investors greater flexibility by allowing them to move up to a higher return if interest rates increase during the term of the cd it s been an attractive product for our members chief financial officer eric mangam said the rationale behind that is we knew rates were going to go up and we wanted people to begin locking into a 24 month product that allows them to reprice their money it s a two year cd that gives flexibility in a rising rate environment the boost cd offered 1 interest in march that s up to 2 today and likely to continue rising with last week s fed move and predictions of more increases to come through next year across the board arkansas lenders revived promotions over the summer and are reporting favorable responses from investors whose interest is primarily driven by interest rates we saw an almost immediate response when we first started running the specials said cindy wolfe chief operating officer at bank ozk of little rock the folks who were on the sidelines for cds are definitely back the cd market is rate driven they re purely in and out with rates promotions are finding success arkansas federal has seen cd investments increase nearly 22 over the past year rising to 200 5 million according to mangam cd promotions at bank ozk and simmons offer returns ranging from 1 71 for eight months up to 2 55 for 21 months attractive offers also are easily found online typically at higher rates than in arkansas and investments are fairly simple there are no added fees or costs for buying cds outside of arkansas most cds require at least 500 to 1 000 to open though some have no minimum deposit requirements last year it was a challenge to even get 1 and now with rates reaching 4 it s turning some heads tumin said of current cd promotions the fed has increased rates at a blistering pace this year to battle inflation starting with a 0 25 increase in march that was followed quickly by four other increases the latest 0 75 increase approved wednesday that have pushed the federal funds rate to a range between 3 and 3 25 and have reached the highest level since 2008 that rate was essentially 0 when the year began fed officials also indicated the rate likely will rise by another 1 25 points before the end of the year to a range between 4 25 and 4 5 looking forward banking conditions are not likely to change soon a sept 19 report from stephens inc cited a nationwide survey of bankers and investors who predicted slowing deposit growth for the remainder of the year the federal deposit insurance corp reported earlier this month that deposits nationwide fell to 19 563 trillion as of june 30 down from nearly 20 trillion in march banks begin reporting third quarter earnings next month which will shed more detail on the current environment jacksonville based first arkansas bank trust began running promotions a few weeks ago mostly to offer customers competitive rates and retain deposits at the bank our customers expect us to respond to market rates in general and that s why we started offering special promotions wilson said we did do it in response to the rate increases and like most banks we re interested in protecting what we have in deposits we wanted to keep those deposits with us dwindling deposits combined with stronger loan demand create ideal conditions for cd investors we re not going to quit making loans said afcu s mangam noting that loan growth at the credit union was up 23 from a year ago when your loans are continuing to grow you have to pay a little more in cds to continue making those loans lenders will continue to tailor their cds to reflect competitive conditions meaning investors are likely to see higher yields in coming months according to dennis cds are an easy investment and get more attractive as rates increase he said banks might not really like it but it s great for consumers correction first arkansas bank trust the jacksonville based bank began promoting certificates of deposit a few weeks ago an earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled the bank s name
u s banking executives share common concerns about the sector over the remainder of the year the banking industry which touches every essential part of the u s economy can be the canary in the coal mine of the nation s economic outlook when the canaries are ailing we should pay attention stephens inc released a report last week that outlines worries over core issues including deposits loans and merger and acquisition activity deposits are projected to continue slowing loan growth won t be as robust as it was in the first half of the year and merger and acquisition activity essentially will dry up of course we ll see precise details beginning next month when financial institutions report third quarter earnings for the period ending sept 30 stephens banking team surveyed bank management teams across the nation the results included responses from 114 bankers and 48 industry investors keep in mind the report was released before the fed announcement wednesday that it would raise interest rates another 75 basis points on top of four other increases this year to 3 3 25 in the firefight with inflation bankers expected the increase more troubling the fed indicated other increases are on the horizon and we likely will end the year with upwards of a 4 5 interest rate key findings from the stephens report investors are more cautious about deposits leading into the end of the year and 88 expect deposits to slow in the third quarter and fourth quarter reports bankers also were cautious about deposit growth predictions regarding loans investors here too predict loan growth will drop off going forward compared to growth in the first six months of the year bankers expect similar to less loan pay downs and are more optimistic than investors about loan production stephens conclusion we think net loan growth is setting up for positive surprise in near term news is worse for the merger and acquisition landscape which has gone through 171 u s bank transactions in the past 12 months that will change and the stephens team says the outlook for the next year remains bleak bankers expectations for m a deals are at an all time low since stephens began the survey in 2017 results show 81 of bankers and 65 of investors predict a downturn overall economic uncertainty was the primary reason behind the anticipated slowdown the report said just a year ago more than 90 of bankers were forecasting deal activity would pick up in the next 12 months office commercial real estate loans rank as the most concerning asset class for both investors and bankers there was an interesting difference of opinion for the second most concerning issue bankers mentioned retail commercial real estate while investors elevated construction and development above that investors who participated in the survey were generally bullish on the outlook for stock prices with 60 giving an overweight rating though that is down from 80 earlier in the year conway entrepreneur support conway

pti new york september 25 describing russia as a major partner in many domains external affairs minister s jaishankar has said discussions with his counterpart sergey lavrov focused on bilateral cooperation as well as the conflict in ukraine we discussed a number of issues some part of my meeting was focused on our bilateral cooperation because russia is a major partner in many domains jaishankar said he was responding to a question by pti on his meeting with lavrov as he spoke to a group of indian reporters here saturday after wrapping up the new york leg of his visit to the us with his address to the un general assembly high level session just hours before his address to the un general debate jaishankar had a bilateral meeting with lavrov on the margins of the high level session a wide ranging conversation with fm sergey lavrov at unga 77 discussed our bilateral cooperation exchanged views on ukraine g 20 and un reforms jaishankar had tweeted responding to the question he said while obviously there are big issues which focus both the russians and the rest of the world the relationship has to address its own requirements processes and objectives we spend some time on the bilateral side where things are taking stock he said adding that they also spoke in some detail about issues related to ukraine a lot of it was he briefed me about various developments from the russian perspective i also shared with him what i picked up from some of the others so that was a back and forth conversation he said he said there was also a discussion on the g 20 with india beginning the g 20 presidency this december russia is very much at the centre of debate where g 20 is concerned and finally we spoke about the un reform the meeting in new york is the fourth between jaishankar and lavrov this year including in bali on the sidelines of the g 20 foreign ministers conclave in the indonesian city of bali and when lavrov was in new delhi earlier this year in response to a question on his meeting with ukraine s prime minister denys shmyhal this week on the unga margins and what were the concerns articulated by the leader jaishankar said a big concern was the conflict itself he gave me his perception his assessment of what was happening in ukraine in terms of india we had a discussion on what was our position and my sense is that he clearly appreciated the fact that we were against the continuation of the conflict and for the return for dialogue and diplomacy jaishankar said adding that shmyhal had his own views on why this was not happening the humanitarian assistance issue was also discussed and shmyhal brought up some specific aspects of the ground situation which he believed were concerns for the international community as a whole including discussion on the progress on the grain issue the concern about fertilizers nuclear power plant issue with the months long ukraine conflict raging on india told the un general assembly that it is on the side of peace and on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out as the ukraine conflict continues to rage we are often asked whose side we are on and our answer each time is straight and honest jaishankar said in his address to the high level un general assembly session here saturday he underlined that it is in the collective interest of the international community to work constructively both within the united nations and outside in finding an early resolution to this conflict delivering the national statement he said in this conflict india is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there we are on the side that respects the un charter and its founding principles we are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out he said we are on the side of those struggling to make ends meet even as they stare at escalating costs of food fuel and fertilizers at various un platforms like the un security council and the general assembly india has mostly abstained on resolutions on the ukraine conflict in his address jaishankar voiced concern over the sharp deterioration in the international landscape the world is already struggling with challenges of post pandemic economic recovery the debt situation of the developing is precarious to this is now added the rising costs and shrinking availability of fuel food and fertilizers these along with trade disruptions and diversions are among the many consequences of the ukraine conflict he added that the repercussions of the ongoing ukraine conflict have further heightened economic stresses especially on food and energy
while ranil wickremesinghe blunders and the opposition exists in a parallel universe where their electoral victory is written in the stars the rajapaksas are back to weaving their web of lies and deception by tisaranee gunasekara was there then no essential difference between the ruler and the ruled salman rushdie the enchantress of florence sri lanka unravelled and unravelling is mesmerised by a new wonder the lotus tower when that monumental symbol of rajapaksa folly was opened to the public last week people thronged to pay the entrance fee ride to the top and gaze down a monk enthused that he felt close to the highest of buddhist heavens women thanked mahinda rajapaksa for enabling them to have this wondrous experience it was as if economic ruin and social collapse was happening in another country to another people night view of colombo city according to a survey conducted by a group of doctors 80 of children in sooriyawewa in the rajapaksa home district of hambantota are malnourished unlike the international cricket stadium the rajapaksas built in that water starved locality which gets the water the people are denied that distressing statistic alone suffices to bare the vacuity of the rajapaksa brand of infrastructure led development in a 2007 cable american ambassador robert blake wrote an empty port an empty airport and an empty vast convention centre would not generate the benefits that hambantota needs one percent of the money spent on these vanity projects could have provided the people of hambantota with every possible creature comfort for generations to come hambantota was poor when mahinda rajapaksa first became president in 2005 and is still poor seventeen years later untouched by rajapaksa development yet solidly pro rajapaksa at every election infrastructure led development was a key pillar of rajapaksa economics build airports ports stadia expressways and prosperity will follow the strategy enabled corruption on unprecedented scale satisfied mahinda rajapaksa s colossal vanity and against all reason increased the family s popularity the projects productive or not often not were tabula rasa on which dreams of national glory and illusions of popular prosperity could be inscribed an actor playing the role of historian once created for the rajapaksas a lineage going back to the buddha via king dutugemunu the massive physical infrastructure projects were depicted as modern variants of the infrastructure projects of ancient kings a historical continuum sandahiru seya the descendent of runwanweli seya hambantota port the descendent of parakrama samudraya people were invited to come and admire a breakwater a runway a walking path masquerading as a marina in that way an illusion of ownership was created people came they admired and they voted the habit is so ingrained that even without the full effect of the rajapaksa propaganda machine the lotus tower looks like a shortcut to heaven to some lankans not in the same overwhelming numbers as in the past not enough for the slpp to win the next election but enough for every single contesting rajapaksa father son uncle nephew and cousin to be re elected perhaps even enough for the slpp with its consignment of deplorables to hold the balance of power in the next parliament basil rajapaksa can see this future and he is readying the slpp for it the party s new political academy will hone the next generation of rajapaksa devotee activists sinhala buddhist supremacism will be re burnished with the usual talk of motherland being in danger lotus tower undead tiger and encroaching muslim in combination can dazzle enough eyes and twist enough minds and the rajapaksas will have their path back to national relevance kingmakers if not kings absurd faith in an interview with a private tv channel during the run up to the 2019 presidential poll udaya gammanpila called gotabaya rajapaksa a composite of the managerial skills of mahathir mohammad farsightedness of lee kuan yew bravery of vladimir putin spiritual approach of jawaharlal nehru and patriotism of fidel castro the words seem grotesque now and should have seemed embarrassingly funny even then yet the interviewer didn t laugh or even roll his eyes the audience would have lapped it up an electorate that is predisposed to believe any absurdity sans proof sans fact that was what the rajapaksas needed and that was what they created with their propaganda illusions and delusions were their stock of trade in august 2005 an outburst of mass hysteria about buddha statues emanating luminous rays coincided with the mavilaru operation and shored up support in the sinhala south for the fourth eelam war an elephant calf was said to have been born on the very day high king mahinda won the war a lie that was believed until it was inadvertently exposed in 2013 credulity was nursed and fostered turned into a political weapon and election winning strategy to quote the late great hilary mantel did the enlightenment really occur or was it just someone by the styx lighting a cigarette is it still yesterday children of the revolution london review of books in a recent you tube interview journalist tharindu jayawardana chronicled the anti dr shafi conspiracy which helped set the stage for gotabaya rajapaksa s 2019 victory a gynaecologist singlehandedly sterilising 4000 sinhala buddhist mothers by squeezing their fallopian tubes during caesarean operations a claim that seems too preposterous to rate even a denial yet it was believed by millions of people as nothing but the truth the story of a terrorist muslim doctor working to annihilate the sinhala nation was published just a month after the easter sunday massacre channa jayasumana blessed the tale with his seal of approval wimal weerawansa called it the war of the wombs respected gynaecologists stated that women couldn t be sterilised by squeezing their fallopian tubes but most of the public and a large section of media preferred to believe a dentist who insisted it could be done the cid investigated the issue and dismissed it as a non issue the police arrested dr shafi on no evidence recorded statements afterwards and backdated them the confluence of the absurd and the illegal advanced gotabaya rajapaksa s saviour pretension in holy bones holy dust charles freeman argues that most medieval europeans lived in a community of the supernatural and points out that to shift one s consciousness to the supernatural the space between heaven and earth is to lessen one s attention to the immediacy of the natural world rajapaksa politics too operate in a similar politico psychological space which ignores denies reality delusions of divine signs illusions of grandeur and phobia of enemies are used to make voters forget their ordinary day to day earthly problems the kelani cobra story was not a singularity but the final landmark in this road of lies not even national bankruptcy has been able to end that mindset as the adoration of the lotus tower demonstrates facts have no role in this spectacle it never did in a functioning democracy people too bear a share of responsibility for outcomes be they positive or negative the culpability of 6 9 million of our fellow citizens in our national plight should not be denied the people are not innocent or blameless this is not a fairytale in which the monster holds a land in thrall forcibly in this story most people invited the monster to takeover their land and their lives even where leaders are forward looking progressive projects can suffer defeat if a majority of people are not in tandem the outcome of chile s referendum is an excellent case in point such dangers are particularly acute in times of economic and social anxiety when everything solid melts into air past or an imaginary version of it could seem the only mooring left in italy an extreme rightwing party which traces its lineage back to mussolini s fascist party is expected to gain power this sunday the new march on rome is electoral a democracy is shaped not just by its leaders but also by its people a system change is impossible if enough people remain unchanged the absurdity is obvious or should be a people cannot vote in the corrupt and expect an honest government vote in the inept and expect an efficient government vote in the stupid and expect an intelligent government holding leaders to account is not enough those who vote for them too should be held accountable the people are suffering but many of them brought this disaster on themselves they were deceived but they allowed themselves to be deceived that is why an election however necessary can easily become a part of the problem rather than its solution let alone the panacea that some claim it will be haunted by old mistakes yatharoopa was a highly popular late night magazine programme aired on rupavahini from august 2016 to march 2018 the programme aimed at debunking myths and superstitions and promoting reason and rational thinking in its second season it was suddenly taken off the air media reports claimed that president sirisena banned the programme at the request of a group of astrologers astrophysicist kavan ratnatunga made the same claim subsequently president sirisena reportedly said that as a state institution the remit of the rupavahini was to promote and not debunk astrology little wonder he made mahinda rajapaksa the pm seven months later in 2018 the 19th amendment was in force president sirisena did not have the constitutional right to make unilateral decisions regarding a ministry that was not under him yet neither pm wickremesinghe nor media minister mangala samaraweera objected publicly the reason for their public silence is not hard to fathom president sirisena was going off the rails already the unp tried to avert disaster by alternately ignoring and humouring his antics it didn t save the government the anti constitutional coup was defeated not via accommodation but through resistance winning elections is another matter the pragmatic would argue one must confirm be what people want their leaders to be so sajith premadasa distanced himself from the government he had been a part of for almost five years and adopted a rajapaksa lite approach characterised by temple hopping and a refusal to do or say anything remotely controversial the only exception was his courageous stance on menstrual products in vain mangala samaraweera felt that he had to leave electoral politics in order to be able to speak his mind truth has become a costly mistake in sri lanka by then telling truth to power could be dangerous telling truth to people could be disastrous the electorate s unparalleled credulity in 2019 was the result of a presence and an absence the rajapaksas occupied the propaganda arena promoting irrationality and absurdity anti rajapaksa forces avoided such propaganda battles or fled them when the cost was deemed too high as demonstrated by the banning of yatharoopa their evasion and disengagement backfired how could voters be weaned away from rajapaksa politics if they were subjected to only one kind of propaganda diet a no holds barred resistance might have worked better the present is becoming overshadowed by the shades of those past errors the appointment of 38 state ministers the same month indirect taxes were hiked is reminiscent of the unp s failed attempt to contain maithripala sirisena through appeasement the ongoing repression smacks of rajapaksa flavour from the use of pta to the prosecution of lawyer dushmantha weeraratne on september 9th for tooting his car horn to the tune of kaputu kak near galle face the rajapaksas too arrested a young motorist for tooting his horn against a road closure the difference lies in the judicial response in 2021 the young motorist was lambasted for exercising his constitutional right to peaceful protest in 2022 the magistrate threw out the case against the lawyer and warned the police to study the law bef ore taking legal action against a person in geneva the government opted to reject the resolution on sri lanka in toto this is not the wickremesinghe samaraweera foreign policy of 2015 19 when sri lanka was open to the world and willing to take on legitimate concerns of the international community this is a reversion to the medamulana foreign policy of the rajapaksas the rajapaksa habit of dealing with challenges by denying their existence or their severity is also making a comeback health ministry rejected the unicef report on child malnutrition ranil wickremesinghe s truth telling days seem distant while ranil wickremesinghe blunders and the opposition exists in a parallel universe where their electoral victory is written in the stars the rajapaksas are back to weaving their web of lies and deception those who believe that aragalaya has rid the popular mind of the cobraesque myth should watch again the rapturous reception to the lotus tower lost in that marvel the contribution that monstrosity and other like it made to our economic bankruptcy is forgotten more than forgotten that column of folly is being hailed as the economic way to go a boon capable of attracting tourists and solving our foreign exchange crisis in one go if the rajapaksas resurface their old idea of building airports on

a bottle of the new 45 year old release from littlemill photo illustration by brad japhe define rarity seems simple enough but when we re talking about whisky especially single malt scotch it s a particularly pesky task everybody want s something special something that s hard to find something that you have that others simply cannot get marketers are keen to capitalize on that innate desire of course and so we re constantly bombarded with small batches and limited releases even if the capacity exists to release a lot more of it than what we see on shelves in fact a lot of times we don t even want something until we think it s scarce observe the hoopla surrounding many a mothballed distillery old stock from shuttered facilities can fetch thousands of dollars per bottle but if that sort of feverish demand existed back when they were actually in operation why would they have ever closed to begin with and if they never did shutdown shop could the production levels have reached a point where it wasn t precious enough to substantiate a cultish following call it the port ellen paradox we ll collect more empirical data on this in the years ahead as diageo reignites stills at the historic site on islay as well as at brora another formerly mothballed object of obsession rarity for these brands will eventually become a thing of the past then we ll know once and for all if people only wanted the liquids because they couldn t get them but when it comes to littlemill rarity feels a touch more real it once stood as the oldest operation in all of scotch way back in november of 1772 along the banks of the river clyde the lowland distillery was the first to be granted license by king george iii to retail ale beer and other excisable liquors which already gives it an air of exclusivity then there s the unfortunate circumstance of it having burnt to the ground 232 years later the latest release of littlemill is a 45 year old single malt from the now defunct lowland distillery loch lomond group ever since michael henry master distiller of the loch lomond group has stewarded the last surviving casks we don t know precisely how much stock remains but we do know that whenever henry authorizes a release it is in extremely limited quantities the latest is the most significant in a generation a 45 year old offering marking what would have been the lowland distillery s 250th anniversary to match 250 individually numbered bottles hit shelves in august at a cool price of 9 500 per unit the liquid within was drawn from a single distillation on october 4th 1976 it was re casked in 1996 into american oak hogsheads before undergoing a six month finish in oloroso sherry casks just before bottling and yet you wouldn t necessarily know it from the first sip absent are the tell tale dark fruit markers replaced instead by an insistence of umami if anything the sipping experience could be defined as quite rare indeed meanwhile the packaging is the result of a collaboration with world renowned photographer stefan sappert the decanter sits in a cabinet which echoes a victorian bellows camera box sitting in a draw beneath is a silver on black glass photographic plate manufactured by sappert it features an image of a section of the river clyde near where the distillery once sat each plate is visibly unique and bears the artist s signature and fingerprints on the reverse the messaging here is quite clear this is a snapshot in time littlemill holds a unique place in scotch history one that can never be fully re created in the future thankfully its surviving stock allows us an opportunity to step back in time one dram at a time how rare is that exactly that s up to you to decide

the comics artist alex ross probably best known for his painted work in books like marvel s marvels and dc s kingdom come with writers kurt busiek and mark waid respectively published his very first stand alone graphic novel this month a short volume called fantastic four full circle it is more or less exactly what you d want from a fantastic four comic 64 pages of brightly colored sci fi fun starring reliable stock characters and featuring a journey into ff creator jack kirby s gorgeous chaos dimension the negative zone where entropy has defeated pretty much everything and an omnipotent creature called annihilus is forever trying to trick our heroes into helping him open a door to their own non negative dimension it reminded me a lot of another realm ruled by an omnipotent despot namely marvel entertainment which has officially announced that it will try for a fourth time to make a decent fantastic four movie by definition the marvel cinematic universe can t last as long as the marvel comics universe alex ross can make a fantastic four comic decades after kirby s death and it comes off as a tasteful homage because the characters whose lives he s prolonging are drawings not actual human bodies that s not a feat anyone can duplicate on the silver screen as disney demonstrated so forcefully with its horrifying computerized golems of carrie fisher and peter cushing in rogue one actors and directors and yes even superproducers like mcu maestro kevin feige get old run out of ideas and eventually die the question is less whether marvel s grand experiment in interlinked superhero films can continue forever than how long it will take for the experiment to run through all of the mcu s interesting configurations of living actors and familiar characters and how long after that it would take for people to get sick of them we re not there yet even eternals made 400 million lately the marvel movies have felt as though they re winding down even as each of them grows more desperate to impart some vital bit of trivia that the consumer can carry to the theater on their next outing advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement the marvel cinematic universe has its stan lee in kevin feige but it has no jack kirby or steve ditko no uniting visual artist whose unmistakable style makes the individual installments worth returning for some of this is accelerated by the disney rot that infects every property the company buys and then micromanages to death when was the last time you were truly hyped about a new star wars movie or pixar or and i m genuinely sorry to remind you of this anything involving the muppets the homogenizing impulse that has destroyed so much else that disney owns has not totally eaten marvel comics yet probably because even if you re hiring the hottest comics artist alive and working a title to which ross has at least some claim it s just cheaper to make a comic book that s what ross s graphic novel is incidentally it s the same page count as an old dc comics annual never mind that it s hardcover printed on heavy paper and available in an edition that comes slipcased with a commemorative print in a vellum envelope glued inside the front cover it has been packaged for grownups with disposable income but it is still very much kids stuff narratively full circle is perfectly attuned to the needs of industrially managed intellectual property the story takes place in the temporal pocket between fantastic four nos 51 and 52 revisiting the tragic protagonist of kirby classic this man this monster in that alone it s a perfect project for the disney era of non movie storytelling which studiously avoids anything that might invent or expand upon established content instead the company and its imitators prefer the artists in their employ to fill in the narrative gaps increasing the already granite like density of the interconnected plot structure advertisement advertisement visually full circle is a different story ross is the perfect artist for this kind of project the work from his most popular period the mid 1990s is such realistic superhero fare that reading it is like meeting santa claus in person it seems designed to convince readers that they are seeing something they used to believe in but had forgotten or dismissed as they grew up there s a fascinating section in the back of some of the fancier editions of marvels showing photos of ross s pals in cardboard headgear and makeshift capes leering at the camera or kneeling on the carpet ready to be repurposed in paint as giants or mutants or rock monsters but as he evolved and as he developed the leeway to do whatever he felt like doing ross s work grew profoundly wonderfully weird check out his covers to grant morrison s run on batman they are some of the greenest orangest pinkest batmen dc comics has printed since detective comics 241 it s this alex ross who gets to take over the fantastic four and if you haven t been paying attention you might feel that he s doing remarkably un rossian things leaving grainy pencils on the page rather than filling them in giving all colors a neon flare and eschewing gray normal realism in favor of bright blue shadows and chalk effects at every turn it s as if marvel studios hired steven spielberg to direct an indiana jones style mcu adventure film and he came back with something that looked more like empire of the sun advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement of course marvel entertainment would never let a director run away with a movie like that lest they wind up with a final product that is recognizably their own i don t say this as a particular mcu hater i ve seen every marvel movie and i probably like them more than they deserve even the bad ones have interesting moments of trying to top their immediate predecessors and some of them like scott derrickson s doctor strange and taika waititi s thor ragnarok are genuinely worth watching more than once i m even responsible for at least one friend spending 18 of his own dollars on doctor strange and the multiverse of madness a weird lumpy b movie made by a genuine b movie director sam raimi with an absolutely inexcusable 20 minute lore dump smack in the middle of it advertisement that multiverse of madness sequence is where marvel appeared to lay the groundwork for incorporating the fantastic four into the mcu a merger made possible by disney s 2019 acquisition of fox in a parallel universe dr stephen strange benedict cumberbatch sporting a truly other dimensional noo yawk accent is captured by the illuminati a kind of superhero super group whose hijinks suggest that marvel is in the process of stealthily adapting jonathan hickman s highest possible concept simultaneous runs on multiple fantastic four and avengers comics series the team itself is the creation of brian bendis and steve mcniven one illuminatum is reed richards mister fantastic himself with john krasinski wearing the classic blue jumpsuit and looking very serious which is the main character note for reed reed s sudden appearance is tailor made to elicit squeals of comic book glee at the prospect of such an auspicious addition to the universe i like to think mine was more of a manly grunt of approval and to suggest more broadly that the mcu has exciting frontiers yet to explore advertisement advertisement advertisement the trouble is that no matter how many new faces the mcu adds the vibe never changes the mcu is defined by the way it sublimates the personalities of its directors into its house style those directors often early career independents d are needed less to plot a course than to steer the ship and because they typically have next to no experience in effects heavy blockbuster filmmaking their adventures climaxes are outsourced to overworked cgi artists at low bid vfx houses this often gets characterized as a new problem but you can see its seeds if you look back at some of the earlier attempts to bring marvel s characters especially the fantastic four to the screen in 2005 a pre mcu feige hired tim story to direct the profoundly forgettable the fantastic four and the fantastic four rise of the silver surfer movies most notable now for introducing feige to his future captain america story who had directed the hugely successful low budget comedy barbershop and the queen latifah vehicle taxi would have seemed like an odd choice for a megabudget superhero franchise movie back then but now he looks just like the sort of sucker disney would be able to tempt with a high profile job nobody else wants advertisement advertisement advertisement in josh trank s 2015 fantastic four you can see an ambitious filmmaker s mind at work for about 55 of its 100 minutes trying to reimagine the original super team in the context of a ken russell style body horror film at times it almost threatens to become a real movie like christopher nolan and tim burton s batman flicks or even james gunn s suicide squad but that simply won t do trank s vision is unceremoniously swept away in the movie s second half and the whole interestingly gloomy affair disintegrates in a tonally bizarre battle over something to do with green energy beams the director marvel has chosen for the new ff movie is matt shakman who has worked primarily as a tv director notably on marvel s wandavision and while tv showrunners have more power than they used to it s still usually a job where you re trying not to make waves within a broader system good movie directors even pop sci fi directors like nolan often seem to be trying to set the whole system on fire and that s not a thing you can do when you ve squished all the individual agency out of your movies from the title marvel s the avengers marvel s doctor strange marvel s thor love and thunder on down advertisement advertisement advertisement the marvel cinematic universe has its stan lee in feige who is apparently personally responsible for making all the marvel films turn on one another like gears in a clock but it has no jack kirby or steve ditko no uniting visual artist whose unmistakable style makes the individual installments worth returning for and importantly whose overriding vision their successors are always trying to override or enhance the way ross john byrne mike weiringo alan davis and even indie artists like james sturm have profitably sought conflict with kirby art is after all an argument with your predecessors and in the mcu visionary directors have no predecessors to speak of kirby rendered his parallel dimensions as photo collages he drew shamelessly cubist spaceships and supercomputers he laid out splash pages and double page spreads composed as perfectly as renaissance paintings but in huge blocks and planks of black ink and radioactive colors that the third eye poster company immediately amplified and made into stoner culture black light wall art every time marvel seems to be on the cusp of finding its guiding artist it tears that person limb from limb advertisement like trank alex ross understands not so much what makes the kirby comics great but what he loves most about them in full circle ross draws much of the negative zone in those same black light poster colors bringing the culture the ff inspired back into the comic itself he willfully renders kirby s photo collaged negative zone in his own hyperrealistic gouache just as he and busiek made kirby and lee s galactus saga a series of newspaper photos to heighten its surrealism in marvels no one else has done that or would have thought to advertisement advertisement comics and cinema are close enough kin that you could be forgiven for mistaking the former for the r d division of the latter certainly there are entire publishing imprints devoted to producing comics that are packaged conspicuously like spec screenplays or pilot scripts virgin entertainment published comics at one point and production company legendary still does from time to time netflix now owns mark millar s millarworld like film comics are reliant on mass mechanical reproduction composed of sequential images and often sleazy or childish sometimes sleazy and childish despite or perhaps because of these similarities it is more or less impossible to make a faithful adaptation of a comic book and the harder you try the weirder you get think of warren beatty s dick tracy or robert rodriguez and frank miller s sin city both overwhelmed by crazed makeup jobs and intentionally garish cinematography in both those cases the trick sort of works because paradoxically the more they borrow panels from chester gould s or miller s own comics the more they look like a director s singular vision of course the best superhero comic movies actually are the product of a singular vision give yourself a moment to think about how wildly disparate burton s batman and nolan s the dark knight are despite starting with roughly the same set of characters advertisement advertisement advertisement since i show up to every single one of these things like an amnesiac i m going to tell myself that matt shakman does have a grand vision for the fantastic four and that he can stare down the marvel suits like reed richards telling off some guy in epaulets who wants johnny storm to do covert operations in qurac maybe it ll be a real ode to kirby with our heroes fighting space lobsters in the manhattan subway before shooting off in a rocket to a higher plane of existence that theatergoers have to wear 3d glasses to enjoy maybe they ll voyage to the second dimension and part of the movie will be a cartoon maybe the characters won t sound like they just stepped out of a comforting episode of the office even if one of them is jim wouldn t that be fantastic go on disappoint me i m used to it

their air conditioned room at the comfort inn it has been home for them and their 11 year old granddaughter for nearly two months ever since their new landlord hiked their rent and then evicted them for renovations they don t know how long they will be in the hotel the new hampshire emergency rental assistance program through southern new hampshire services is covering the cost snhs is the community action program for hillsborough county where the state s two largest cities manchester and nashua are located they are not alone she said there are about 70 other people at the hotel who were evicted as well we re all in the same boat she said the pandemic and new hampshire s hot real estate market has disproportionately affected the state s very low income residents who are being ousted from their homes by landlords citing the need to renovate the aged housing stock in some cases the buildings are redone in others not so much but the bottom line is apartment dwellers are left scrambling to find suitable and affordable places the squeeze on housing has left about 600 households 750 to 900 people residing in motels with the federal government footing the bill at a cost of millions of dollars a month those funds doled out through the new hampshire emergency rental assistance program are expected to run out by the end of the year experts say when that happens they say local welfare departments across the state will be inundated with people seeking help by law welfare departments have to help the poor and cannot run out of money renovation eviction an alarming trend todd marsh president of the new hampshire local welfare administrators association and director of rochester s welfare department said renovation evictions are happening statewide people in rochester approach the welfare office almost daily asking for a list of landlords with affordable housing we will give them some landlord numbers knowing that a lot of them have changed because it s hard to keep up with buildings being sold he said we ll give them what we think we have but then there s that look in their eyes they don t know where to go even people with two people working in the household making what used to be good money who no matter how much they shuffle their money around they can t afford the rent they ve never been there before late in august he said all of rochester s motels were full but he didn t know how many of the guests were there because they had been evicted that is because those costs are being covered by federal funds through the temporary erap the federal emergency program enacted to help tenants affected by the covid 19 pandemic when the funds run out however he expects welfare offices across the state will be inundated with requests for help even people with two people working in the household making what used to be good money who no matter how much they shuffle their money around they can t afford the rent they ve never been there before todd marsh president of the new hampshire local welfare administrators association and director of rochester s welfare department grace lessner director of communications and marketing for new hampshire housing which distributes the erap funds said there were 600 households which could include one or more persons staying in motels statewide at the end of july many of those individuals like the joneses became homeless after being evicted because they couldn t pay skyrocketing rents or their building was sold and the new landlord wanted them out so they could renovate the place affordable housing is hard to come by when new hampshire has a vacancy rate of 0 5 elliott berry managing attorney of the manchester office of new hampshire legal assistance and director of its housing project estimates those 600 households translates into 750 to 900 people in hotels or motels that s alarming he said jessica margeson with 603 legal aid hosts a weekly clinic for tenants seeking help in staving off an eviction while trying to find a place they can afford i was just told last week it s a 10 month waiting list now margeson said of the waiting list for motels they are not even going by how many households are on it she said hillsborough county applications for federal assistance are growing as well assistance applications went from an eight week backlog to closer to 15 to 16 weeks she said and while a request for the precise cost of hotel vouchers was not answered for this story margeson said the cost for a room at the comfort inn is 120 per night which is about 3 600 per month and when multiplied by 600 households as much as 2 16 million per month new hampshire s hot housing market stacy harrison granite state news collaborative lee ann blanchard 59 formerly of nashua sits on her king size bed in her room at the comfort inn in manchester her home since july after she was evicted from her nashua apartment over the past year manchester and concord have topped realtor com s hottest markets list nationwide manchester held the top spot for nine out of 12 months and concord ranked no 1 in june 2022 manchester with an abundance of 100 plus year old multi family buildings was just what investors were seeking rundown apartment buildings which are affordable for those with lower incomes fueled the housing rush for investors many of whom after buying the properties upped rents by the hundreds or served long time tenants with renovation evictions marsh said many renters are unable to move money around to cover the increased monthly rents tenants report rents being doubled sometimes 1 500 a month or more many who have never been behind in their rent in their lives quickly fall behind and are served eviction notices once evicted they have an even harder time finding a home because many landlords will not consider someone who has an eviction on their record no matter the reason most tenants opt to fight the evictions because they discover there is nowhere to go any apartment they can afford they are told has a years long waiting list the pricier ones have a waiting list of up to four years according to lee ann blanchard 59 another motel resident blanchard won t say why she was evicted from her nashua apartment in the cotton mill where she resided in a subsidized unit for about six years a former hair stylist blanchard has a medical disability and receives supplemental social security she said she decided not to fight the eviction but at the time she had no idea it would be impossible to find another affordable place after being evicted she initially stayed in her parents finished basement arriving with trash bags full of clothes and two broken arms the result of a fall weeks earlier that didn t work out and she found herself on the

king size bed marsh who has been rochester s welfare director for 20 years said people with the lowest incomes are the ones being hurt the most by renovation evictions say someone s income on ssi supplemental security income is 850 a month there was a time that 850 a month could house and feed someone marsh said it s no longer the case he said people are approaching the welfare office because they were struggling previously to pay the rent and now they can t afford it and for those who can he said one major car repair bill or some other unexpected expense is enough to set them on a path to an eviction and homelessness no legislative relief in n h in new hampshire there is no limit on how much a landlord can raise a tenant s rent tenants also have no recourse when a landlord goes to court and swears under oath that the occupants need to vacate the apartments in order for them to make extensive renovations however there is no penalty if a landlord does no renovations or merely paints the kitchen calls it a day and brings in a new tenant at a markedly higher rent in the last legislative session there was an attempt to give tenants 90 days to find another place when being evicted in the new hampshire senate the number of days was reduced to 60 days and then passed in the house however it was defeated state rep pat long said legislation introduced in the last session failed in part because the landlord lobby is so strong until the state municipalities and landlords collaborate on amenable solutions this issue will keep on devastating our citizens while they continue as workers in our economy which by the way will eventually hurt our economy rep pat long of manchester we were trying to get a 60 or 90 day extension for evictions because when eviction is not due to lack of payment you have to give them time long said but then it died the landlord lobbyists are very strong and also what is an issue in manchester is not necessarily an issue in rural parts of the state yet we know that there are people from all over coming to manchester for services until the state municipalities and landlords collaborate on amenable solutions this issue will keep on devastating our citizens while they continue as workers in our economy which by the way will eventually hurt our economy he said the new hampshire emergency rental assistance program has provided

ethics agreement under which the new hampshire emergency rental assistance program assisted households in emergency housing are to be referred to their municipality of origin when seeking local welfare assistance that means when the funds run out a person from derry being housed in a motel in manchester will be referred to the derry welfare office for assistance not manchester so where local

these rock solid income stocks with yields ranging from 5 to 7 can pad aged investors pocketbooks while making them richer this year has served as an unpleasant reminder that the stock market doesn t move up in a straight line since the year began the benchmark s p 500 and growth centric nasdaq composite have each fallen into a bear market with peak declines of more than 20 to boot the u s economy has delivered back to back quarters of gross domestic product declines on the heels of historically high inflation in other words it s a worrisome time for investors and especially retirees who can t afford to lose their principal investment but when trouble looms on wall street historically so does opportunity that s because every major stock market correction has eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally this means that in spite of heightened volatility in the short run it s the perfect time for aged investors to pounce what follows are three ideal high yield dividend stocks for retirees that have the potential to turn an initial investment of 350 000 into 1 million by 2030 walgreens boots alliance 5 62 yield the first perfect high yield dividend stock that can generate a 186 return for aged investors by 2030 is pharmacy chain walgreens boots alliance wba 1 12 walgreens has been paying a consecutive dividend for more than 89 years and has increased its base annual payout for the past 47 years what typically makes healthcare stocks such a genius investment is their defensive nature no matter how poorly the u s economy or stock market perform there s always going to be demand for prescription drugs medical devices and healthcare services however the covid 19 pandemic proved to be one of the few exceptions to this rule at least for walgreens boots alliance because walgreens is reliant on foot traffic into its stores the lockdowns associated with the pandemic hurt its sales and bottom line like other retailers it s also contending with historically high inflation and the negative effect that can have on consumer spending and yet there are numerous reasons to be excited about walgreens prospects as it enacts a multipoint turnaround strategy designed to boost its operating margins organic growth rate and customer loyalty to begin with management noted at the end of fiscal year 2021 the company s fiscal year ends on aug 31 that it had surpassed 2 billion in annual cost savings a full year ahead of schedule but it s not the company s cost cutting that s going to raise eyebrows it s where management is aggressively pulling levers one area where walgreens boots alliance is sparing no expense is with its various digitization initiatives even though the company will continue generating most of its revenue from its brick and mortar stores the pandemic has demonstrated the value of having a more prominent online presence walgreens has invested heavily in its direct to consumer platform which should lead to healthy organic sales growth what s more walgreens boots alliance has partnered with and become a majority investor in villagemd the duo has opened 120 co located full service health clinics as of may 31 2022 with a goal of opening 1 000 clinics in over 30 u s markets by the end of 2027 offering physician staffed clinics differentiates walgreens clinics from its competition and should drive repeat business valued at roughly seven times wall street s forecast earnings for 2023 walgreens has a safe floor to go along with its promising upside and rock solid 5 6 yield innovative industrial properties 7 04 yield a second ideal high yield income stock that has the capacity to turn a 350 000 investment into a cool 1 million over the next eight years is cannabis focused real estate investment trust reit innovative industrial properties iipr 1 61 over the past five years iip as innovative industrial properties is more commonly known has grown its quarterly payout by 1 100 just 20 months ago marijuana stocks were all the rage on wall street with democrats taking narrow control of congress and joe biden winning the presidency the expectation was for sweeping federal cannabis reforms unfortunately no reforms have taken shape and pot stocks have been pummeled as a result however individual states maintain the right to legalize and regulate marijuana around three quarters of all states have given the green light to medical cannabis which provides more than enough opportunity for a company like iip to profit innovative industrial properties business model is just like any other reit except for the cannabis focus as of early september iip had purchased 111 medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities spanning 8 7 million square feet of rentable space in 19 states although acquisitions are iip s primary source of growth it does have a modest organic growth component built in that allows for inflationary rental increases to be passed along to its tenants each year what makes reits so valuable for retirees is the predictability of their operating cash flow and their dividends as of the end of june 99 of iip s rents were being collected on time meanwhile reits are required to pay out a majority of their earnings as a dividend which is what allows them to avoid normal corporate income tax rates another big catalyst for iip is the lack of cannabis reforms at the federal level innovative industrial properties has benefited immensely from its sale leaseback program which involves purchasing facilities from multi state operators for cash and immediately leasing them back to the seller because access to basic financial services is limited for cannabis companies iip has turned this lack of reform on capitol hill into a positive catalyst that bolsters its long term rental portfolio intel 4 96 yield the third ideal high yield dividend stock for retirees that can turn 350 000 into 1 million by 2030 is semiconductor behemoth intel intc 1 74 intel s roughly 5 yield is the juiciest payout its shareholders have ever received like most cyclical stocks intel is taking it on the chin at the moment a combination of economic weakness high inflation and employees returning to the office has slowed personal computer pc sales and data center spending at least temporarily to boot advanced micro devices has been chipping away at intel s mobile and server central processing unit cpu market share while this would appear to be a less than ideal scenario for intel a deeper dive points to an inexpensive cash flow juggernaut that has multiple catalysts on the horizon first concerns about intel s loss of market share look to be an overreaction according to second quarter market share data from mercury research intel maintains desktop pc mobile and server market share in the neighborhood of 75 to 86 even if amd were to continue slowly chipping away at intel s pcu market share the sheer growth potential of mobile devices and data center servers should allow intel to steadily grow its sales and generate abundant cash flow intel is also a prime beneficiary of the chips and science act which was signed into law by president joe biden last month the chips act will provide 52 7 billion in subsidies to chip designers and manufacturers with the goal of boosting chip production innovation and hiring within the united states intel which is spending 20 billion to build two manufacturing plants in ohio could eventually up its presence to eight total factories with federal aid sometime soon we should also witness the spinoff and initial public offering ipo of autonomous vehicle company mobileye which intel acquired in 2017 for 15 3 billion mobileye delivered 41 year over year sales growth in the most recent quarter with annual run rate revenue of 1 84 billion the expectation is for mobileye to command a valuation of 30 billion for its ipo in short intel looks to have made a wise acquisition despite short term headwinds intel has the catalysts needed to nearly triple the initial investment of retirees by the end of the decade
can you believe these are my customers donald trump once asked while surveying the crowd in the taj mahal casino s poker room look at those losers he said to his consultant tom o neil of people spending money on the floor of the trump plaza casino visiting the iowa state fair as a presidential candidate in 2015 he was astounded that locals fell in line to support him because of a few free rides in his branded helicopter in the white house he was sometimes stunned at his own backers fervor telling aides they re fucking crazy yet they loved him and wanted to own a piece of him and that was what mattered most almost immediately after his defeat in 2020 trump began fundraising off his claims of fraud turning to his ardent fans for support plenty of people donated small amounts of money to continue a fight he swore was valid and building toward action it was difficult to discern though whether trump actually believed what he was saying about the election i learned in the spring that trump was repeating a claim from one of his most vocal allies the self made pillow company ceo mike lindell that trump would be reinstated as president by august 2021 trump liked the idea telling aides he did not want to have to sit through another three and a half years of a biden presidency he quietly encouraged some conservative writers to publicize the idea in their own voices telling the national review editor rich lowry as well that he anticipated being reinstated by august 2021 trump encouraged lowry to write about it saying it could help the magazine when jenna ellis his former adviser protested on twitter the notion that trump could be reinstated to office trump told ellis that her reputation would be damaged she took that as pressure to reverse her statement trump conceded to her that the scenario was almost impossible but that he wanted to keep the idea alive this article is adapted from haberman s forthcoming book other moneymaking opportunities arrived ostensibly tied to the reverent memory of the trump presidency the most audacious plan was for a social media company of trump s own in the days immediately following the riot at the capitol on january 6 2021 trump was suspended from twitter facebook instagram and youtube he spent most of the next year insisting that he did not care about being banned while also suing the companies to get his accounts restored in october he announced that he would launch his own social network as part of a merger with a so called blank check company whose stock price shot up when the merger was announced the funding mechanism which sparked an sec investigation prior to the platform s launch was completely opaque none of this came as any surprise to me for much of the past decade reporting on trump has been my full time job as a correspondent for the new york times to fully reckon with donald trump his presidency and his political future people need to know where he comes from the new york from which trump emerged was its own morass of corruption and dysfunction stretching from seats of executive power to portions of the media to the real estate industry in which his family found its wealth the world of new york developers was filled with shady figures and rife with backbiting and financial knife fighting engaging with them was often the cost of doing business but trump nevertheless stood out to the journalists covering him as particularly brazen i have found myself on the receiving end of the two types of behavior donald trump exhibits toward reporters his relentless desire to hold the media s gaze and his poison pen notes and angry statements in response to coverage his impulse to try to sell his preferred version of himself was undeterred by the stain that january 6 left on his legacy and on the democratic foundations of the country if anything it grew stronger he had an almost reflexive desire to meet with nearly every author writing a book about him trump s aides offered me an interview and i asked for two additional ones trump typically welcomed visiting authors for interviews in an indoor area at mar a lago that gets converted to a dining room at night where a model of the redesigned air force one sits proudly on a low table but after the headiness of being at the center of the world s gaze his time after the white house made him seem shrunken he often played golf and then went to his newly built office at the club for meetings with whoever traveled down to seek his approval he would watch television before going to dinner where club members would sometimes applaud him and then it would start all over again the next day so removed from the daily rhythms of the broader world that he was oblivious to holidays on the calendar and staff had to remind him when i arrived for the first interview in march 2021 i was ushered away from the usual room to a smaller area where trump sometimes dined with guests i learned as we wrapped up that the club was empty because it had been closed off after a covid 19 scare but trump decided to have us sit there regardless without checking to see if i was vaccinated covid trump said as he described the club s closure turns out not good trump greeted me cordially before taking a seat across the table from me he was in sales mode not combat mode his history in new york was the focus of our interview he thought back to the first major political figure he had observed up close the democratic party boss meade esposito who dominated brooklyn politics when trump joined his father s real estate business meade ruled with an iron fist trump said and he was a very strong leader to put it mildly and when i came to washington i said oh well this is now the big league so as tough as they were this must be even tougher but i said how could anybody be tougher than meade meade had a cane at the end he used to start swinging the cane at people i mean he was wild trump had seemed to try to emulate esposito s style in his post presidency receiving visitors who came to kiss his ring and picking favorites in primaries to try to determine the outcomes of those races trump s view of strength never changes regardless of the context flattening all situations so they appear the same he used identical language with an iron fist when describing how esposito presided over his boroughwide fiefdom and when he praised china s president xi jinping after his own term ended i asked him if he had expected the presidency to function the same way rather trump said that is how he thought congressional leaders would act on his behalf well i figured that the mitch mcconnells would be like him in the sense of strength there were plenty of factual problems with the criticism in fact mcconnell had kept republican senators in line over and over to advance trump s policy and personnel concerns and generally protect his political standing as the leader of the republican party nevertheless trump said to me in another session using his favorite new nickname for mcconnell the old crow s a piece of shit trump also complained to me about senators successfully practicing this type of power politics against him as lindsey graham and ted cruz had when they persuaded trump not to back a challenge to a colleague nebraska s ben sasse trump gave a surprise endorsement to sasse who then after winning reelection voted to convict trump during his second impeachment like a schmuck i went along with it trump said trump was clear that he did not believe he would have faced any of the same legal problems that had dogged him if manhattan s longtime district attorney robert morgenthau had still been in office no he was a friend of mine he was a great gentleman he was a great man he was highly respected no and i run a clean organization this is a continuation of the witch hunt he added bob morgenthau would not have stood for this the investigation by morgenthau s successor he insisted was part of an attack on the republic he was perhaps even more dire when describing the threat he had faced from the special counsel investigation into his campaign s ties to russia it forced him he said to perform two jobs when i was president running the country and survival at one point trump made a candid admission that was as jarring as it was ultimately unsurprising the question i get asked more than any other question if you had it to do again would you have done it trump said of running for president the answer is yeah i think so because here s the way i look at it i have so many rich friends and nobody knows who they are he then went on to talk about how much easier his life would have been had he not run yet there it was reflecting on the meaning of having been president of the united states his first impulse was not to mention public service or what he felt he d accomplished only that it appeared to be a vehicle for fame and that many experiences were only worth having if someone else envied them when i asked him in a later interview about what he d liked about the job he replied getting things done and listed a few accomplishments we met for a follow up interview five weeks later again at mar a lago again in the late afternoon he was not in a good mood by way of greeting he told me i m watching the arizona situation very carefully a private company called the cyber ninjas was conducting a so called audit of maricopa county ballots and tabulation equipment that had been handed over by the republican led state senate he had talked about his claims of widespread fraud in our first interview but not about trying to undo the results he seemed to be going backward i learned later that he d tried getting the republican national committee to fund the audit in arizona to no avail the audit ultimately affirmed the results of the state s election he was at his most animated when i asked about why he had trusted sidney powell given the concerns his other advisers had had about her since then powell had faced libel suits from voting machine manufacturers she had accused of corruption her defense had been essentially that no one should have taken what she had to say seriously i was very disappointed in her statement trump said that is so demeaning for her to say about herself then he essentially read stage directions on how to use public claims in lawsuits all she had to say he said was upon information and belief i think such and such now all she says there was take a thousand stories that were written over the last 10 years long before all of this that are bad stories he said and that is information and belief she read them and that s the end of that case that s true for everybody it s upon information and belief and let s go to court to find out if it s true i pressed him on what at that point was one of the persistent mysteries of january 6 which would become central to the congressional select committee s investigation what he had been doing in the hours when the capitol was under assault from his supporters he insisted that he was not watching television despite volumes of witness testimony and other evidence to the contrary i didn t usually have the television on i d have it on if there was something i then later turned it on and i saw what was happening he said he lied throughout that bit of our interview i had heard that afterward and actually on the late side i was having meetings i was also with mark meadows and others i was not watching television our third meeting was at the end of the summer which he had largely spent at the quarters that he kept on the grounds of his new jersey golf course when i arrived at the trump national golf club bedminster i waited in a small room off the front entrance i spotted lindsey graham outside in golf pants it was the second time i had encountered him in trump s vicinity that year trump eventually entered the room having lost a noticeable amount of weight since i had seen him last graham followed a minute later and gestured toward trump the greatest comeback in american history graham declared trump looked at me you know why lindsey kisses my ass he asked so i ll endorse his friends graham laughed uproariously i was curious when trump said he had kept in touch with other world leaders since leaving office i asked whether that included russia s vladimir putin and china s xi jinping and he said no but when i mentioned north korea s kim jong un he responded well i don t want to say exactly but before trailing off i learned after the interview that he had been telling people at mar a lago that he was still in contact with north korea s supreme leader whose picture with trump hung on the wall of his new office at his club he demurred when i asked if he had taken any documents of note upon departing the white house nothing of great urgency no he said before mentioning the letters that kim jong un had sent him which he had showed off to so many oval office visitors that advisers were concerned he was being careless with sensitive material you were able to take those with you i asked he kept talking seeming to have registered my surprise and said no i think that s in the archives but most of it is in the archives but the kim jong un letters we have incredible things in fact trump did not return the letters which were included in boxes he had brought to mar a lago to the national archives until months later the washington post reported on it in early 2022 the justice department began investigating how the classified material made its way in and out of the white house residence in one of our earlier interviews i had asked him separately about some of the texts between the fbi agent and the fbi official working on the robert mueller investigation whose affair prompted the agent s removal from the case we had learned the night before biden s inauguration that trump was planning to make the texts public he ultimately didn t but he told me that meadows had the material in his possession and offered to connect me with him over the course of our conversations he appeared reluctant to take shots at many of those people on whom i knew him to have been toughest behind closed doors his campaign manager brad parscale spent money unwisely he said but he did not criticize him beyond that i asked why he had given jared kushner expansive power i didn t trump said although he had done exactly that when i pressed trump said look my daughter has a great relationship with him and that s very important in the fall of 2016 ahead of the election trump once tried to call kushner to complain about why the situation in florida was bad for him kushner who usually didn t answer his phone on the sabbath was unresponsive fucking shabbat trump groused asking no one in particular if his jewish son in law was really religious or just avoiding work when i later asked him about this he denied that he had said it he was not so sanguine about mike pence who had begun to defend his own actions on january 6 with increasing stridency prompting trump to escalate his condemnation of his former vice president s judgment that day i said mike you have a chance to be thomas jefferson or you can be mike pence trump recounted to me repeating an inaccurate comparison to the election of 1800 he chose to be mike pence i brought up another potential future primary rival by mentioning that he had been compared to new jersey s feisty governor chris christie before the two men faced off in the 2016 primary trump replied i was compared to him why i didn t know i had that big of a weight problem a small smirk followed then he s an opportunist i heard that trump was describing florida governor ron desantis in similar terms calling him fat phony and whiny while claiming credit for making his candidacy in 2018 even as he talked about launching another campaign for the presidency trump was more comfortable looking backward than forward when i told trump i wanted to talk about 2024 he asked quizzically 2024 by the time we spoke at mar a lago i had covered trump as a political figure for many years and little was surprising and still the choreography of in person interviews could reveal moments of unintended candor he started to explain why he doesn t like when audiotapes of his interviews are released being on camera was much different he said whereas he said in a written interview i ll repeat it 20 times because i want to drum it into your beautiful brain do you understand that he repeated himself again one of the things i ll do if i m doing like with you for the written word is i got to drum it into your head so i ll repeat something six times his interest in repetition was not news to me but his self awareness of it was notable at another point he was going on a stem winder about new york s then outgoing mayor bill de blasio canceling a contract with the trump organization to manage a public golf course in the bronx after january 6 de blasio s choice to replace trump was deeply controversial and a judge later ruled in trump s favor it s like communism trump said asking what the word was for when someone takes your property it came to him 20 minutes later confiscate is the word he declared in the middle of another thought i tried redirecting him but he cut me off let me just finish it he said just let me do this and then i m going to tell you he seemed to hear himself and smiled then he turned to the two aides he had sitting in on our interview gestured toward me with his hand and said i love being with her she s like my psychiatrist it was a meaningless line almost certainly intended to flatter the kind of thing he has said about the power of release he got from his twitter feed or other interviews he has given over the years the reality is that he treats everyone like they are his psychiatrists reporters government aides and members of congress friends and pseudo friends and rally attendees and white house staff and customers all present a chance for him to vent or test reactions or gauge how his statements are playing or discover how he is feeling he works things out in real time in front of all of us along the way he reoriented an entire country to react to his moods and emotions i spent the four years of his presidency getting asked by people to decipher why he was doing what he was doing but the truth is ultimately almost no one really knows him some know him better than others but he is often simply purely opaque permitting people to read meaning and depth into every action no matter how empty they might be this article is adapted from haberman s forthcoming book confidence man the making of donald trump and the breaking of america
beer makers are facing many challenges as inflation and supply chain issues raise cost of brewing and shipping shortages in aluminum cans and carbon dioxide used in brewing have hampered some brewers for consumers beer prices are rising up 5 so far this year but not as fast as on other goods including food which rose about 11 we have endured no shortage of shortages recently there was toilet paper and computer chips followed by tampons and baby formula could the next shortage involve beer the potential arises as beer makers big and small are under pressure from a confluence of inflation and several supply chain issues some breweries have found it challenging to get carbon dioxide co2 which is used to clean tanks and carbonate beer when they do get it the price is often higher sometimes twice what they used to pay also rising the price of other ingredients such as malted barley and the cost to ship that and other products all this could lead to higher beer prices and it could result in some of your favorite beers being out of stock or not on tap i don t know if i can think of a scenario where there d be no beer from a brewery but i can understand a scenario where there would be a limited or smaller offering as beer has a short shelf life said chuck aaron owner and founder of jersey girl brewing in hackettstown n j the environment is challenging enough that it could force some breweries to close this could certainly be a factor in closures bart watson chief economist for the brewers association told usa today in a mid year survey of the association s membership about 5 600 u s small and independent breweries some brewers sentiments amounted to we re selling as much beer as we were pre pandemic but making far less on that beer and we re unsure how long that is sustainable watson said gas prices go up after declines here s where gas is cheapest and most expensive what s it mean for you fed hikes interest rate 0 75 percentage point to tame inflation why could there be a beer shortage because breweries which are accustomed to some supply chain struggles face a growing list of headaches the price and availability of aluminum cans became increasingly volatile as cans became critical to breweries survival many had pivoted to curbside pickup and offsite distribution during the national shutdown brought on by covid 19 similarly the supply of co2 has remained tight since the shortages in the spring of 2020 watson said in a recent report breweries have often got less than they ordered or worse not had promised amounts delivered at all now inflation has driven up the entire cost of breweries shopping list just as it has for all americans that means breweries are likely paying more for co2 cans paper goods malt grains needed for making beer and hops what s unprecedented is the number of areas where we are seeing challenges watson told usa today inflation no more steak ordering out less here s how inflation is squeezing american diets settle down easy brewing co in falls church virginia hasn t been hit hard by co2 price increases but is paying an additional two cents per can for its canning line purchased during the pandemic said co owner frank kuhns but other price increases have hit harder including 150 300 gas travel fees for each delivery from suppliers and labor and equipment costs of 30 to 40 more than originally budgeted for the construction of a second northern virginia location a few miles away in oakton virginia so far we have made the decision to hold and not pass these increases onto the customer and instead look for new suppliers or cutting costs without sacrificing quality kuhns said despite the dilemma the nation s beer taps won t likely run dry but they could be tempered he said i m not sure i d go so far as to say there will be shortages individual producers may have issues but this isn t so widespread that you re going to see empty beer shelves watson said i think the beer brand that consumers want occasionally being out of stock is closer to accurate and brewers might make different or fewer beers why is carbon dioxide needed to make beer most beer lovers know that brewers use co2 to carbonate beer but co2 also is used to clean fermentation tanks and keep oxygen out before they are refilled oxygen is the devil of beer and will kill a beer if you have oxygen in it aaron said but many breweries have had a devil of a time getting the co2 they need a main contributor is that a natural source of co2 the jackson dome an extinct volcano in mississippi is facing a contamination issue with the raw gas from the mine creating a significant decrease in available food grade co watson told brewers in a july report high demand and some shutdowns at ammonia plants which create and capture co2 to sell to other industries has compounded the shortage so have rail disputes which have disrupted deliveries wrote forbes columnist richard howells a supply chain executive yes you heard right howells wrote in this era of trying to reduce emissions of co2 into the atmosphere we are actually going to have a shortage of the co2 that provides the carbonation so loved by millions of concerned beer drinkers how are breweries coping with the co2 shortage most have had to pay more for co2 while many have had to find alternate suppliers and if a brewer cannot get enough that could lead to some beers not getting made said tomme arthur co founder and chief operating owner of port brewing and the lost abbey in san diego county california i don t expect the grocery aisles to be missing 18 packs of lager he said but your local craft brewer is certainly at risk for having to adjust brewing schedules and deliverables based on this lack of co2 and the need for it in so many of the brewing practices at jersey girl brewing the cost has doubled over the the past year from about 20 cents a pound to 44 cents aaron said he has been watching the invoice price creep up and up and up as we fill the brewery s bulk tanks capable of holding 1 500 pounds of the gas aaron has also had to decide not to make some beers such as a helles lager because the german grains needed were too costly with increased shipping prices and some beers needing new zealand international hops have not been produced hopefully once the prices come back in line we ll be able to reintroduce those into the market he said earlier this week axios reported that a u s beer shortage looms with gap in carbon dioxide supply it also noted that some breweries have equipment to capture the co2 emitted in the brewing process but it is very expensive also vying for co2 other industries including carbonated beverage makers and food manufacturers as we have learned brewers are a relatively small user of co2 in the grand scheme of things watson said what s everyone talking about sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day could beer become more expensive it already has the makers of miller lite and coors light and bud light as well as stella artois have all raised prices recently but beer prices are up far less than the cost of production the price of beer purchased to drink at home had risen about 5 as of august 2022 compared to august 2021 according to the consumer price index that s higher than whiskey 3 wine 2 5 and other spirits 1 2 another barometer of pricing the average cost to consumers for beer has risen 3 4 over the past year for the equivalent of a 24 pack of 12 oz cans based on prices for the week ending sept 10 2022 according to nielsen iq beer price increases have also remained below that of other consumer goods overall prices increased 8 3 compared to a year ago and food rose 11 4 price hikes have not stopped consumers from trading up to craft beers imported beers or canned cocktails and seltzers said bump williams a beverage industry consultant consumers have also been buying more 12 packs and single serving cans as they have been changing their purchase behavior with inflation going up interest rates going up gas prices going up and a declining stock market turning 401k s into 201k s williams said so folks are managing their affordable luxury expenditures a bit differently today could the price of cans also affect beer supply probably indirectly since aluminum prices are just one of several costs brewers see increasing costs of cans are still much higher than they were and i believe once prices go up the way we ve experienced them you tend not to see them come back down aaron said while there has been less volatility recently some breweries had to find a new supplier when ball corp one of the nation s largest can manufacturers earlier this year raised its minimum requirements for customers citing unprecedented demand we were sent scrambling to find an alternative supplier which charges 1 5 cents more per unit arthur said a truck load of cans is approximately 156 000 units so the pennies add up he said i have never seen this level of inflationary pressures combined with outright shortages it s bonkers to put it mildly arthur said i suspect that nearly every brewery in town is being jammed on the same fronts

cbg gummies while we comment on the customers pleasure with these businesses tastes and results there is much more to our selection procedure we apply a precise set of criteria to determine which cbg gummies are worthwhile purchases to assist you in selecting this minor cannabinoid what we looked for in cbg gummies policies for customer service identifying all the customer service rules that will make or break the company is the first stage in our methodology then we looked for regulations that favor one brand s customers over another discounts guarantees the capacity to contact staff members and any other practices that help a business stand out from its rivals are examples of policies that enhance the customer experience when you purchase cbg gummies the transaction should go smoothly and you should get the greatest support brand reputation additionally we checked to determine whether the company is acknowledged as a pioneer in cbg goods if so new items like cbg gummies are more likely to live up to our high requirements the likelihood that the brand s cbg goods will live up to the hype is often increased if it offers other comparable items with a solid reputation for quality and efficacy you must avoid purchasing from inferior companies with dubious reputations so we researched to make sure that you get high quality cbg items customer feedback we trawled independent forums and reviews to determine what consumers think of their cbg gummies regarding brand reputation to prevent you from purchasing anything that won t fulfill your requirements we investigated customer complaints and unfavorable reviews to see whether they are justified we used positive and negative reviews to decide whether or not the business has a loyal client base tests by a third party on cbg gummies safety is one of our top considerations when it comes to your well being and not every cbg gummy on the market has undergone independent testing thus we scanned the websites for proof of independent testing for any company s cbg products we also examined their certificates of analysis coas to ascertain what they tested for we recommend them if they have full panel testing although this is uncommon in the market for cannabinoids instead they often examine the cannabis content so that you may calculate the cannabinoid content of each product this is advantageous since you will know what you are receiving such as if the cbg edibles are created from broad spectrum cbg oil and are thc free doing so will be critical if you re looking for anything with no thc buying guide factors to consider before buying best cbg gummies you may have to go through a few items before you locate one that will work for you since cbg is a trendy new product in the cannabis business due to the lack of standardization in the production process for cbg there may be significant differences in potency across brands based on how it is separated and extracted here are some suggestions for purchasing cbg gummies laboratory testing always search for lab testing when purchasing cannabis products regardless of the kind every product and batch should be subject to independent laboratory testing we don t advise buying cbg or any cannabis product from a firm if you can t readily access third party lab testing on their website independent testing determines the concentration of the goods and the presence of each constituent you may thus select an alternative product if it contains any dangerous oil or more innocently if it has less cbg than claimed aim for us grown hemp the federal government regulates the cultivation of hemp plants in the us therefore if you purchase us hemp you know that the farm it comes from complies with quality and safety regulations since hemp is legal in the us neither farmers nor processors have any incentive to get it illegally over the last several years there have been many contamination problems with chinese or indian hemp although it is significantly less expensive to cultivate crops in these areas the air and ground pollution levels are often higher than what the united states deems acceptable additionally compared to the us canada and european nations indian and chinese authorities are far less strict on industrial safety standards and quality control look for 1 1 cbd cbg blends when combined with cbd cbg performs even better than when used alone according to our research aside from that cbg is pretty pricey this is partially attributable to the decarboxylation procedure which causes losses of up to 50 when converting cbga to cbg cutting cbg with cbd offers much better value without compromising potency consider cbd oil cannabis plants as previously established contain trace quantities of cbg producers must thus blend cannabis with other cannabinoids and full spectrum cbd oil is one of the most remarkable chemicals to mix with cbg this guarantees you the advantages you desire as the oil includes terpenes and other cannabinoids that may improve the effects of your cbg gummies brand reputation several companies offer cbg gummies while some are trustworthy others only want to take your money most of the time it isn t simple to discern between the two examining the brand s reputation is one of the best methods to identify a high quality product you may achieve this by performing brand research please keep track of the brand s history reviews and efficacy of its goods remember that some newer brands are excellent most trustworthy firms would interact freely and honestly consequently they will give you independent laboratory testing and in many circumstances a money back guarantee additionally seek a corporation that does not deceptively sell its items when you purchase from a trusted supplier your mind is at peace and you may take these cbg gummies without worrying about unpleasant side effects cbg cbn cbc thc and other cannabinoids are not under the control of the food and drug administration fda consequently you cannot rely on the agency to give the essential information many materials are available online health organizations industry critics and others have all aired their opinions on cannabis check the label the overwhelming majority of individuals skip this stage however it causes more damage than good we realize that you may not have time to read the labels on all available cbg gummies before picking which one to purchase nevertheless it is in your best interests this is because some gummies have additives you may not desire sugar artificial flavors and animal byproducts are just a few examples you should check to verify that the cbg gummy you select does not have any of these substances as you may be allergic or sensitive to them potency the strength of the cbg gummy you require will vary depending on the issue it is intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent check that the cbg gummy has enough cbg to have the desired effect because if the cbg chewable dosage is inadequate it will not help you our selection includes items for both novice and expert users price products containing cbg may be much more costly than those containing cbd allowing the extraction of cbg to require less plant material however certain cbg gummies have reasonable prices we offer items in every price range on our list be wary if you find cbg products for dirt cheap they could potentially be dangerous to use or were made under questionable conditions faqs on best cbg gummies what is cbg most cannabinoids including cbd thc and cbc are precursors to cannabigerol or cbg the cbg found in the buds of the cannabis plant changes into other cannabinoids as it grows cbg has gained nicknames like the mother of all cannabinoids and the cannabinoid stem cell because it serves as the precursor to all other cannabinoids what is the process of producing cbg gummies cbg gummies are made by extracting cbg from the cannabis plant there are two methods to achieve this using co2 or hydrocarbons the most used technique is hydrocarbon extraction since it is more effective and less costly cbg is first extracted and then it is separated and purified this procedure eliminates any impurities or undesirable components from the substance what does cbg feel like cbg is entirely non psychoactive just like cbd therefore you won t get high the effects of cbg are first mild and won t start to manifest immediately as they do with thc products instead people could only become aware of the repercussions after the fact in that instance you could realize you were more productive or concentrated than usual a few hours after consuming it what advantages does cbg offer cbg may seem like another cannabis business trick but it isn t since cbg is a distinct substance from cbd and has a different chemical makeup than thc and cbd it has different advantages the key advantage of cbg is its capacity to boost both physical and mental energy levels what sets it apart from other stimulants is that instead of immediately activating the brain like traditional stimulants like coffee cbg seems to extend the time it takes to burnout which often leads to unwanted side effects are there any side effects to using cbg cbg is a very safe substance with no known adverse effects however starting with a modest dosage and gradual increase as necessary is crucial this is so because each person s response to cannabinoids is unique some individuals could have minor side effects including dry mouth or lightheadedness conclusion what are cbg gummies good for to sum up the best cbg gummies are beneficial to your health cbg like the other cannabinoids is thc free thus it does not cause intoxication but has all the different medicinal properties of the cannabis plant cbg may therefore thrive where other cannabinoids have fallen short you may use it instead of thc for conditions like glaucoma or reduced appetite since it isn t intoxicating although further study is necessary to determine the advantages of cbg it has already shown considerable potential as a thc substitute it is reputable as the best cannabinoid for boosting mental and physical energy attention and productivity particularly in conjunction with other synergistic substances if you like marijuana edibles such as thc gummies and cbd gummies you could also enjoy some other gummy sweets the market for cbg gummies is relatively fresh because of this when consumers do learn about them they still choose well known substances like cbd but using cbg gummies has the same impact as using cbd gummies you could discover that you like some items effects more than others

it s clear that the shared kitchen spaces that do exist while providing a great service didn t have enough capacity to meet the need chatalbash said the hunger prevention program s second facility purchased last spring is equipped with loading docks which expand the program s food storage capacity as well as a commercial kitchen but the program only needs the kitchen for 10 20 hours a week for soup kitchen prep so the organization decided to offer the hours when it stood empty to food companies farmers community groups and nonprofit organizations that offer cooking classes the goal is not

col asadullah akbari in his apartment on sept 1 2022 in jacksonville fla photo zach wittman for the intercept on a normal morning asadullah akbari a colonel in the afghan national army would arrive at his office in kabul to coordinate online meetings between afghan officials and their u s advisers based in qatar after years of fighting across afghanistan akbari had helped set up his country s special forces training program and risen through the ranks he now worked near the highest levels of the military side by side with afghanistan s political leaders morning teleconferences with western partners were part of his daily routine he had grown accustomed to this relatively quiet life but as the u s backed afghan government imploded last summer a thick cloud of fear descended on the afghan capital rumors spread that taliban fighters were going house to house hunting down afghan military officials akbari stayed home texting anxiously with his military and defense ministry colleagues all of them trying to make sense of the sudden changes akbari s future had seemed relatively predictable now it was difficult to see even a few days ahead on august 20 2021 five days after kabul fell to the taliban akbari headed to a well known mall with his kids walking the streets of kabul where he d spent most of his life he had the distinct feeling that these could be his last days on earth when his children begged him for candy and ice cream from the vendors on the street he bought everything they wanted akbari knew in his heart that he and his colleagues had been left to their fate many of the senior afghan officials they d served under had already made their own arrangements and fled the city people who had supervised akbari for years suddenly stopped responding to his messages it was the last betrayal after years of corruption and double dealing that he had personally witnessed from his perch in the ministry of defense the afghan government they d spent two decades helping to build had collapsed now its ruins were raining down on top of millions of ordinary afghans like him the fall of the afghan government triggered a tidal wave of anguish and soul searching among afghans and americans who had invested years of their lives in the u s mission there it was also personal for me as an afghan journalist for seven years i worked at etilaatroz one of afghanistan s leading investigative news outlets i reported and wrote scores of articles on politics and security in afghanistan including more than a dozen major investigations across all this reporting one theme stood out above all the rest corruption the greed self interest and amorality of afghan elites was like an acid that ate away at the institutions ordinary afghans had sacrificed so much to build in the end that corruption would prove fatal to our hopes for building a free and independent nation photo zach wittman for the intercept i was among tens of thousands of afghans evacuated by the u s government when the taliban took control of afghanistan last summer since then during the nearly 10 months i spent with other refugees in a hotel in albania and now in the united states i ve been trying to figure out what happened to my country and why like everyone i watched in horror as my etilaatroz colleagues still in kabul were beaten by the taliban for the crime of covering a protest how could the gains of the last 20 years have evaporated so quickly this remains an agonizing question for both afghans and americans in april the senate armed services committee announced the creation of an afghanistan war commission aimed at establishing why the u s backed afghan government and its security forces dissolved so spectacularly the commission plans to provide a comprehensive review of key decisions related to u s military involvement in afghanistan and to deliver a final report to congress within three years around the time president joe biden will complete his term in office eight months ago i began calling akbari and other sources in the former afghan security forces there were many questions about why the army did not fight that continued to bother me and other afghans why after years of grueling struggle did soldiers in many parts of the country put down their guns in the face of the enemy to find the answers i started interviewing former military officers and government officials they told me that corrupt inexperienced commanders as well as leaders who valued loyalty above capability had weakened the chain of command tens of thousands of afghans had given their lives for their country in the end ordinary soldiers were betrayed by leaders who failed to give them the tools they needed to succeed against a brutal insurgency on august 20 the day akbari walked to the mall the taliban were rushing to establish themselves across kabul flush with excitement over their victory they had fought for years suffering terrible losses themselves and were now almost certain to take revenge on their enemies their knock on his door seemed inevitable as akbari walked into his home he received an unexpected text message on his phone from a u s military adviser based in qatar with whom he had regularly teleconferenced from kabul asadullah where are you within a few days akbari and his family were packed into the cargo hold of a plane with other afghans who had been lucky or connected enough to make it out the flight took him from kabul to qatar and then on to jacksonville florida where he and his family are the only afghan residents in a rundown apartment complex the speed with which his life had transformed gave it all an air of unreality akbari had spent decades at war lost many friends and suffered scars that he will carry for the rest of his life looking at afghanistan today he cannot escape the feeling that it was all for nothing col asadullah akbari flips through cellphone photos from his time in afghanistan while in his apartment in jacksonville fla on sept 1 2022 photo zack wittman for the intercept the fall of the three man republic the u s is believed to have spent upwards of 2 trillion in afghanistan money that was in many cases eaten up by graft or funneled back to politically connected u s government contractors afghan military officers like akbari saw the rot up close in the final years of his government afghan president ashraf ghani and a close circle of advisers were widely criticized for monopolizing decision making and personnel appointments and gradually losing touch with the people they governed akbari regularly briefed ghani his senior advisers and the afghan defense minister their constant changes to military leadership and their obsession with personal loyalty overshadowed efforts to prevent a taliban takeover he says i was 18 years old when i joined the army i never saw happy days in afghanistan only war blood fighting and clashes and in the end our leaders betrayed the country he told me i saw myself that we had no honest leaders and no one who was thinking of the national interest they were only thinking of their own benefit and appointing those who were loyal to them i never saw happy days in afghanistan only war blood fighting and clashes and in the end our leaders betrayed the country top former afghan officials painted a picture of increasing paranoia on the part of ghani and his aides who feared not just disloyalty but even a possible coup by officers of the afghan military lt gen sami sadat the last commander of the afghan national army special operations command described ghani to investigators for the u s special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction or sigar as a paranoid president afraid of his own countrymen adding that ghani was changing commanders constantly bring back some of the old school communist generals who saw as loyal to him instead of these american trained young officers who he feared during the last two years of the ghani government power was held by a triumvirate the afghan president his national security adviser hamdullah mohib and his chief of administrative office of the president fazel mahmood fazly many afghans referred derisively to this group of power brokers as the three man republic neither mohib nor fazly had experience in security or national defense mohib had been the afghan ambassador to the united states and fazly was a surgeon who had previously been a political adviser to ghani both men played a critical role in the catastrophic decision making that led to the collapse of the army akbari said what i witnessed was that hamdullah mohib was given the widest authority in appointments all the corps commanders were personally appointed by him and were doing whatever mohib commanded akbari said all orders were issued by mohib and a group of officials in the presidential palace mohib meanwhile has blamed western countries for leaving their afghan partners too abruptly claiming that the sudden departure of american troops and contractors sapped the afghan military s morale and deprived it of the material support it needed to fight when reached to comment for this story mohib referred me to an interview from earlier this year in which he attributed the collapse of the afghan government to u s political concessions made to the taliban and biden s decision in the summer of 2021 to announce a final withdrawal while denying that he had enriched himself with afghan government funds mohib pointed to the corrupting impact on afghan institutions of exorbitant amounts of unmonitored money dumped into the country by the international community since 2001 the final taliban offensive that toppled the government laid bare this corruption which my colleagues and i had documented for years at etilaatroz at the moment of their country s greatest crisis many top officials and commanders simply abandoned afghan soldiers and civilians focusing instead on their own safety and grabbing whatever resources they could as they fled the country by the end the people in charge had given up on other factors and were making personnel appointments based entirely on what they thought would be their own interests said saleh jahesh a former head of the strategic planning office within afghanistan s national security council the major corps commanders were all known to have luxury houses in dubai jahesh told me photo marcus yam los angeles times via getty images a great crime accusations from biden and others that afghans failed to fight the taliban stung akbari whose job for years involved maintaining accurate statistics on afghan security force casualties the numbers of dead and wounded were sobering many of the elite commando units he d worked with took heavy casualties in the last days of the war in total at least 66 000 afghan police and military service members are estimated to have been killed since 2001 the u s had built an afghan security infrastructure that was almost entirely dependent on foreign military and contractor support for its own maintenance and logistics when the u s withdrawal began afghan soldiers found that they were suddenly unable to call in airstrikes or receive resupply by air although their u s led combat training had included these as critical components of their style of fighting by the end many afghan soldiers were stuck holding positions that were impossible to defend and lacked even basic logistical support the u s withdrawal only highlighted the unsustainable nature of the giant afghan military apparatus that had been built over 20 years it was a myth that the afghan security forces didn t fight in the weeks before the collapse of the government a lot of them stood and fought and they died in huge numbers said jonathan schroden an afghanistan expert with the center for naval analyses a nonprofit military research and analysis center in virginia but once word started getting around that if you stood and fought the taliban there would be no cavalry to come save you defections and surrenders began the taliban were then able to highlight these instances of security forces surrendering as part of a very successful psychological warfare campaign long before the final collapse of the government the afghan security forces had already been struggling under the weight of high casualty rates corrupt leadership and low morale the number of new recruits became very low because people were not ready to send their sons to the afghan national army they were aware of the situation and knew that if they send their sons then they won t go back home alive akbari said some soldiers were not able to go to their homes and see their families for more than a year those afghan soldiers and police who stayed in the fight had to deal with chronic shortages of food fuel warm clothing and ammunition corruption in the procurement process steadily ate away at the military s capacity a systemic problem that sigar documented in real time throughout the war but which was never fixed a 2017 sigar report on efforts to reform the procurement process said that the creation of a national procurement authority which centralized contracts under ghani s office was one bright spot in a system otherwise rife with corruption and graft but according to jahesh the centralized authority slowed resupply missions reducing transparency and creating more opportunities for corruption contracts sometimes took more than six months to be approved jahesh said and prices were wildly inflated in one instance he recalled that the procurement authority approved a contract to buy watermelon for the afghan army at 70 afghanis per kilogram while watermelons in the market cost about 1 4 afghanis per kilogram meaning the army paid 50 times more than the going rate the soldiers did not receive anything on time and they had no energy to fight simply because they had no vegetables fruit or meat to eat to meet their basic needs for calories jahesh told me commanders were being forced to sell military equipment from bases because they were receiving nothing from the government on time despite these shortages on paper senior officials were making it look like everything was being provided for the soldiers once word started getting around that if you stood and fought the taliban there would be no cavalry to come save you defections and surrenders began i had witnessed supply shortages and other problems for years in my own reporting on the afghan military in october 2018 i visited a military base in a suburb of the city of ghazni which had recently been the site of fierce clashes between the afghan military and the taliban instead of training to fight the afghan soldiers i met were forced to spend their time gathering firewood to cook their meals as the government had failed to deliver propane and other vital supplies a 2020 video shared on social media showed a group of wounded afghan soldiers surrounded by the taliban in wardak province just south of kabul we don t have water we don t have food one of the soldiers said addressing ghani we have morals to fight if we receive support on top of the brazen economic inequality between themselves and top officials in the afghan government the sense of abandonment that many soldiers felt made it seem logical to return to their families rather than die for leaders who they expected would flee to safety in dubai or turkey in case of a taliban victory afghan soldiers had been fighting and dying pointlessly for years those who perished in what had become a futile effort to stop the taliban received little dignity even in death we had many wounded personnel on our bases with wounds that became infected and who later died as a result akbari said some of these soldiers were temporarily buried inside the bases and dug up again when transport planes arrived to take them in some cases the bodies of afghans who died on the battlefield were even returned to the wrong families the family held a funeral ceremony for them akbari recalled but after a while they were found to be alive and returned home while some families were mistakenly told that their sons brothers and cousins were dead the bodies of others who had actually died were sometimes simply lost akbari says this ate at his conscience even as he continued serving a government that he saw as the only hope of saving his country from the taliban it was a great crime committed against them and their families akbari told me col asadullah akbari poses for a portrait in his bedroom in jacksonville fla on sept 1 2022 photo zach wittman for the intercept haunted by the past though we came from different walks of life and served afghanistan in different ways akbari and i are now both refugees in the united states his days are spent looking for work and running through the bureaucratic gauntlet necessary to build a new life for his family like many other refugees he spends his free time on whatsapp trying to learn about developments back in afghanistan many nights he can t sleep for thinking about the war many of my colleagues from special forces units have been persecuted tortured and martyred by the taliban their families have been tortured a number of them are alive in afghanistan and cannot leave the country neither can they work nor can they stay in their homes akbari told me they have a lot of financial and security problems none of the defense ministry authorities worked for their evacuation to a safe place these authorities are thinking about how and where to buy a house or car and they do not think about soldiers lieutenants and officers who were on the front lines in akbari s mind the failure of the war was not due primarily to the americans who could have withdrawn in any year since 2001 and seen the afghan government collapse just as quickly instead it was a product of a corrupt afghan political class that has still not been held accountable for its failures recent news reports of former afghan officials driving expensive luxury cars and living lavishly in gulf arab countries turkey and the west do not surprise him they are only the crowning insult to the efforts of ordinary afghans who gave their lives in a tragic two decade attempt to rebuild their country with international support the corruption and mismanagement of afghanistan by its own elites enabled in many cases by their u s partners has plunged the country into a new era of suffering under the taliban one day akbari and i both dream of returning for now we can only try to learn from what went wrong if i say that afghanistan was a country during the ashraf ghani government it would not be fair akbari said afghanistan was like a joint stock business company in that every partner exercised as much authority as their share
