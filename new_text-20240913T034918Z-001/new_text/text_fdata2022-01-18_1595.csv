the ak is the most widespread assault rifle in russian military forces but little do people know what other assault rifles special operation units have in their arsenal here is a list of weapons that you ve probably never heard of but which are widely used in counter terrorist operations on russian territory and abroad an 94 abakan visually the an 94 resembles a classic ak 74 but on the inside it differs a lot and has several features designed to increase its shooting capabilities in comparison with kalashnikov rifles first of all an an 94 s barrel moves together with the bolt on every shot it was made to reduce the recoil and increase the accuracy in comparison with a standard ak 74 an 94 is considered two times more precise and easier to operate due to the stabilized shooting mechanics says viktor murahovsky editor in chief of homeland arsenal magazine abakan also received an innovative feature for the early 1970s a two shot burst fire mode the weapon s capable of firing sets of two 5 45x39 mm bullets with the speed of 1 800 rounds per minute thus sending the second round into the same spot where the first round went in comparison an ak recoils upwards and to the right with every subsequent round fired a person can also switch between fire modes with a right hand thumb like with american ar 15s it s more convenient than dragging a hard stuck fire selector with a second hand on ak rifles by the way kalashnikov intentionally made its switcher so hard to operate as military trials proved that an inexperienced soldier could accidentally switch from safety into fire mode and make an accidental shot the expert notes as he also notes the an 94 was considered in the early 1970s as the main ak 74 rival on becoming the army s main assault rifle the weapon outclassed the ak in shooting tests but its numerous design mechanisms turned out to be too complicated for ordinary soldiers so the an 94 was adopted to special operation units and is still used today sr 3 vikhr the russian whirlwind the sr 3 is a submachine gun chambered with subsonic 9x39 mm ammo it resembles a more powerful analog of kalashnikov s pp 19 vityaz submachine gun for russian special operation units the sr 3 was initially created in the mid 1990s for fsb units for close combat inside buildings as well as for hitting targets up to 50 meters away in open areas at the same time the weapon s producers suggest it s capable of eliminating targets in 3rd class body armor plates up to 200 meters away from a shooter the sr 3 is a small sized weapon with side folding stock and can be concealed beneath the coat of a security officer who operates in urban areas in civilian clothes so besides an army purpose the weapon matches all the security forces criteria of a concealed weapon for defending vips at public events the weapon features a dovetail rail for mounting optics a modern version of the submachine gun received two picatinny rails on sides for installation of lasers grips and flashlights on the weapon aps underwater assault rifle in the 1970s the soviet military saw the need to protect its ships and submarines in docks from a potential assault of enemy marines underwater to do so the military command decided to arm its marines with assault rifles that would effectively hit targets both on the ground and underwater a standard army ak 74 didn t fit well for these circumstances as its bullets lost their velocity due to the water density to put it simply rounds that would effectively eliminate a target 100 meters away from a shooter were powerless against a target situated a couple of meters away in the water says murahovsky for these purposes russian engineers created 115 mm long needle shaped rounds that could effectively pierce through the water and after that created an assault rifle suitable for this ammo the aps the weapon was capable of hitting a target 30 meters away from a user five meters underwater it had both semi and full auto modes and 26 needles in one magazine military tests showed that aps is quite effective underwater but its spear shaped rounds are no match for standard rounds on ground these weapons are used by marines and divers in russian military docks and to protect russian ships in the syrian port of tartus adds the expert if using any of russia beyond s content partly or in full always provide an active hyperlink to the original material

toronto strength in the energy sector combined with some positive economic news to kick off the trading week helped canada s main stock index achieve triple digit gains monday the s p tsx composite index was up 179 89 points at 21 537 45 the gain came as u s stock markets were closed for the martin luther king jr day holiday it s been a good day for the tsx said pierre cleroux vice president of research and chief economist for the business development bank of canada the tsx was positive very early today and it kept the story all day leading the charge was the energy sector with the s p tsx capped energy index up 1 72 per cent to 193 58 some of the biggest winners were advantage oil gas ltd which was up 3 5 per cent baytex energy corp which was up 3 1 per cent and arc resources ltd up 3 09 per cent the march crude oil contract was up 1 68 cents at us 83 30 per barrel and the february natural gas contract was down approximately one cent at us 4 26 per mmbtu cleroux said global demand for oil continues to outpace supply which is the reason the benchmark west texas intermediate price has been so strong in recent months the fundamental reason is the fact that we have underinvested in oil for the past several years probably since 2014 he said there s not a lot of investment to increase the supply and on top of that there have been political issues around the world like opec maintaining a policy of not increasing supply and omicron doesn t seem to be slowing down the demand for oil around the world the strong performance of canadian energy stocks indicates that investors believe elevated oil prices are here to stay at least for a while cleroux added in addition to energy canadian banks also saw gains during monday s trading with the s p tsx capped financials index up 1 15 per cent cleroux said markets were likely reacting to two positive economic releases monday the bank of canada s quarterly survey of businesses which was conducted before the arrival of the omicron variant showed business owners are concerned about rising inflation and supply chain challenges but are generally feeling quite positive in terms of their recovery from the covid 19 related recession that in addition to statistics canada s november 2021 manufacturing numbers help to paint an optimistic economic portrait said cleroux manufacturing sales increased about 2 6 per cent in november so that s another positive piece of news that probably helped the markets today he said the canadian real estate association said monday annual home sales reached a new high in 2021 eclipsing the previous record set in 2020 by about 20 per cent in general the canadian economy is performing quite well despite the current omicron wave cleroux said personally as an economist i believe omicron won t have a big impact on growth this year and i think a lot of economists share that he said so that s probably reflected in why the market s increasing as well the canadian dollar traded for 79 87 cents us compared with 79 71 cents us on friday the february gold contract was down us 4 90 at us 1 816 50 an ounce and the march copper contract was down 13 cents at us 4 42 a pound this report by the canadian press was first published jan 17 2022

graduating class of students to have gone an entire year through the pandemic shows variation and big disparities but not huge drops in colorado s graduation rate statewide 81 7 of the class of 2021 graduated on time last spring slightly down from 81 9 in 2020 according to data published by the colorado department of education tuesday although the dip may be statistically insignificant it represents the first time in a decade that colorado s annual graduation rate didn t increase we know how tough it was for everyone last school year due to the challenges brought on by the pandemic with schools going to remote learning and others offering hybrid models said katy anthes colorado s education commissioner in a released statement it is a relief that the graduation rate is nearly the same as it was the previous year with the state s dropout rate also nearly unchanged it is a concrete display of the dedication and determination of colorado s students parents and teachers especially

increased in the past year with students of color seeing drops in their graduation rates where white students didn t students identified as indigenous or hispanic posted the largest drops among racial groups in graduation rates this year black students also showed a drop districts with large portions of students from low income families also posted drops in their rate compared with last year in the metro area sheridan englewood and westminster school districts had some of the largest drops despite all having posted increases in 2020 the denver school district the largest in the state posted a 74 graduation rate just slightly down from 74 6 in 2020 in northern colorado the greeley school district managed to continue its upward trend this year the district had a graduation rate of 84 1 up from 82 in 2020 and 81 7 in 2019 deirdre pilch the greeley superintendent said that increasing graduation rates has been one of her main priorities since she became superintendent in 2015 it s part of a strategic plan that pre pandemic included close monitoring of students from their first year of high school students who are at high risk of not graduating on time are actually identified in middle school so they can receive additional support during the pandemic the greeley district that serves nearly 22 000 students including 70 students of color and about 66 students who qualify for subsidized lunches a measure of poverty met mostly in person though high school students had hybrid schedules with just two days per week of in person learning during more than half of the year to keep quarantines to a minimum the district also switched to a quarter system where high school students took only four classes at a time and groups of students who had special needs or those who were learning english as a second language had more in person instruction throughout the year the spring 2021 semester ended with all students in person five days a week it absolutely had to make a difference pilch said teachers and staff were saying we need our kids every day we got to have them every day there s no question you re seeing that in this data despite the win the greeley district also had a slight increase in the number of students who dropped out it s absolutely the pandemic pilch said we ve gone down mostly every year we shouldn t have a slight uptick families who were the most impacted suffered the most there are kids we lost and we don t know where they went over the summer the district used some of its esser federal relief dollars to hire two additional attendance advocates to find missing students pilch said the two found and re enrolled nearly 200 k 12 students who had been missing now they work to keep those students engaged the small district of sheridan which borders southwest denver experienced a big drop in its graduation rate but because the district is so small the drop represents just a handful of students maegan daigler the district s executive director of assessment and technology said that sheridan officials found students at the alternative high school who said they wanted to continue school but not while the district was in remote learning those students may have counted as dropouts even though they have re enrolled this school year daigler said sheridan now also has a district position dedicated to helping students re engage and re enroll in school the rate of students coming back to school has increased she said daigler also pointed out that sheridan has been increasing graduation rates for students who take longer than four years the six year graduation rate for sheridan high school was 100 she said data manager duncan anderson said sheridan is in a position to be able to offer individualized planning for each student the graduation data might help the district continue to do that acknowledging the pandemic was a real struggle for some students and as a result might need an additional year of high school anderson said statewide the rate of students completing high school in five six or seven years has continued to increase a total of 9 7 of the class of 2021 or about 6 614 students remain enrolled and could still finish high school in their fifth sixth or seventh year look up your school or district s four year rate below chalkbeat is a nonprofit news site covering educational change in public

lithium the elemental metal is a hot commodity these days since it s used in the manufacture of batteries increasing electric vehicle ev sales have many investors feeling optimistic about companies that produce and refine the basic material although lithium is a common substance prices for it skyrocketed some 1 000 from 2021 to the end of 2022 easily exceeding previous highs reached in 2017 but 2023 has been a different story as the effects of inflation and china s long pandemic lockdowns work through the system lithium supply is expected to briefly be in oversupply which has sent prices back down to levels not seen since 2021 image source getty images even with the oversupply soaring battery demand from evs and energy storage saving power for later distribution to the electric grid have some estimates pointing to a doubling of lithium demand in the next few years in the u s the 2021 infrastructure investment and jobs act set aside 5 billion in federal funding for ev charging stations more recently the 2022 inflation reduction act was put into place to provide credits for consumers to support president biden s goal of getting evs to account for 50 percent or more of new auto sales by 2030 with automakers on board there will be ample demand for lithium in the years ahead here s what you need to know before investing in this basic material used in battery development definition icon law of supply and demand the law of supply and demand is an economic theory asserting that supply and demand will meet each other at a certain equilibrium price five leading lithium stocks investing in lithium stocks in april 2024 like any basic materials and metals investment betting on lithium isn t for the faint of heart soaring demand for a material used in the manufacture of a product doesn t automatically equate to higher sales and profits for a company supply also plays a hand in the market price of the basic material so when supply outpaces demand prices fall and the material producer s sales can fall too even if overall demand is expanding as is the case with all mining operations getting new lithium projects up and running can be a costly endeavor it can take many years to ramp up to full production draining a mining company of its cash and other liquidity in the process chile has also thrown a wrench in the gears the south american country s president recently announced intention to nationalize the lithium industry with a state owned company this would affect the financial results for companies that operate in chile as well as any company with plans to develop lithium mining there chile s national congress would need to sign off on the plan before it proceeds chile is the world s second largest lithium producing country behind australia

pll 15 77 tread lightly with these speculative bets related investing topics stay diversified with lithium battery stocks investing in mining companies that produce base materials and chemicals can be a wild ride for investors stock prices can be volatile and susceptible to sharp fluctuations based on the market price of the material being mined and sold although global demand for batteries bodes well for lithium battery producers expect plenty of volatility along the way especially in 2023 as producers deal with a lithium oversupply to help lessen wild swings in value consider buying a

energy sector helps lift s p tsx composite to triple digit gains people cross the street in front of the bank of montreal building in toronto on tuesday aug 29 2017 the canadian press doug ives original publication date january 17 2022 8 36 am strength in the energy sector combined with some positive economic news to kick off the trading week helped canada s main stock index achieve triple digit gains monday the s p tsx composite index was up 179 89 points at 21 537 45 the gain came as u s stock markets were closed for the martin luther king jr day holiday it s been a good day for the tsx said pierre cléroux vice president of research and chief economist for the business development bank of canada the tsx was positive very early today and it kept the story all day leading the charge was the energy sector with the s p tsx capped energy index up 1 72 per cent to 193 58 some of the biggest winners were advantage oil gas ltd which was up 3 5 per cent baytex energy corp which was up 3 1 per cent and arc resources ltd up 3 09 per cent the march crude oil contract was up 1 68 cents at us 83 30 per barrel and the february natural gas contract was down approximately one cent at us 4 26 per mmbtu cléroux said global demand for oil continues to outpace supply which is the reason the benchmark west texas intermediate price has been so strong in recent months the fundamental reason is the fact that we have underinvested in oil for the past several years probably since 2014 he said there s not a lot of investment to increase the supply and on top of that there have been political issues around the world like opec maintaining a policy of not increasing supply and omicron doesn t seem to be slowing down the demand for oil around the world the strong performance of canadian energy stocks indicates that investors believe elevated oil prices are here to stay at least for a while cléroux added in addition to energy canadian banks also saw gains during monday s trading with the s p tsx capped financials index up 1 15 per cent cléroux said markets were likely reacting to two positive economic releases monday the bank of canada s quarterly survey of businesses which was conducted before the arrival of the omicron variant showed business owners are concerned about rising inflation and supply chain challenges but are generally feeling quite positive in terms of their recovery from the covid 19 related recession that in addition to statistics canada s november 2021 manufacturing numbers help to paint an optimistic economic portrait said cléroux manufacturing sales increased about 2 6 per cent in november so that s another positive piece of news that probably helped the markets today he said the canadian real estate association said monday annual home sales reached a new high in 2021 eclipsing the previous record set in 2020 by about 20 per cent in general the canadian economy is performing quite well despite the current omicron wave cléroux said personally as an economist i believe omicron won t have a big impact on growth this year and i think a lot of economists share that he said so that s probably reflected in why the market s increasing as well the canadian dollar traded for 79 87 cents us compared with 79 71 cents us on friday the february gold contract was down us 4 90 at us 1 816 50 an ounce and the march copper contract was down 13 cents at us 4 42 a pound this report by the canadian press was first published jan 17 2022 companies in this story tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x tsx aav tsx arx tsx bte

in short the situation in december 2021 the biden administration increased the focus on the rapidly evolving alternative vehicle industry by releasing its electric vehicle charging action plan the result the plan seeks to increase battery electric plug in hybrid electric and hydrogen electric vehicles ev market share amplify the u s charging network and augment u s manufacturing looking ahead strategic alliances will proliferate premised on large scale fleet conversion an influx of capital into ev innovation and consolidation and substantial development of cross sector capacity these transactions offer market leading opportunities for focused participants electric vehicles have been in the news this quarter and rightly so the december 2021 biden harris electric vehicle charging action plan accelerates the conversion of internal combustion vehicles to the array of ev drive trains the plan targets evs as 50 of all new cars in 2030 with an incentive package to enable domestic manufacturers oems to shift ev manufacturing to the united states the administration s effort to support oems is testimony to the rapidly evolving scope breadth and scale of the ev sector current purchasers of ev vehicles challenge outmoded stereotypes about adopters of zero and low carbon technologies e g nascar will go hybrid in 2024 in 2020 worldwide ev stock exceeded 10 million passenger vehicles with significant fractions in ev market share in europe 10 and china 8 the 2021 sales trending are 7 of global sales with 18 of the 20 largest oems committed to increasing ev offerings and sales kpmg s annual global automobile executive survey captures as megatrends that 98 of auto executives polled consider sustainability a key differentiator premised on the shift to evs what does this mean for the private sector and the sector s legal counsel teams in particular we are all learning nonetheless from more than a decade of work with pioneering ev developers companies and service providers worldwide we can identify a number of key considerations for those ad venturing in this space strategic partnerships large scale fleet conversions to evs which began in earnest in 2018 are accelerating worldwide our ongoing work for our clients particularly those pioneers among the first to undertake commercial fleet conversions at 1b may continue to reflect the frontier of the sector but not for long the commercial ev sector is rapidly scaling even beyond the biden administration s u s fleet conversion goal for an estimated 645 000 vehicles these ip intensive collaborative and strategic initiatives to advance new vehicles and integration systems are pioneering and in our experience benefit from well constructed pilot strategies and processes along the conversion road map municipal planning class a real estate owners drove early adoption and integration of ev charging stations into multi use developments the four to eight spaces just next to the elevator that conversion process is now accelerating in the middle market as well as being widely deployed by municipalities with their often central locations and the underappreciated benefits that sovereignty affords project development our experience from extensive work in this area underscores the importance of identifying and advancing a development plan responsive to potential barriers to system ownership functional project deployment and the rights of the vehicle charging public ev incentive subsidy and tax policies are critical but quickly normalized across the sector becoming more of a practical necessity than a long term competitive advantage the time to fill the expertise gaps for incentives may well be now electricity infrastructure charging stations are significant electricity consumers with non utility ownership and regulatory status interconnection delays and demand charges among the essential legal and commercial considerations electricity infrastructure integration delays can tip the scale toward behind the meter or micro grid projects equally important but too often overlooked are the legal rules relating to the monetary charges for electricity usage which require an understanding of electricity rate design and grid stability considerations as well as the rights to the significant data and information that connected evs generate charging rules and cybersecurity risks remain multi faceted items on any counsel team s checklists battery storage advanced both by renewable sourcing goals and time of use pricing variables vehicle charging owners look to battery storage these projects can be challenging not least because of the design siting and construction considerations associated with rapidly evolving technologies and battery storage in particular our experience in advising on both implementation and litigation including in the context of grants and loan guarantees related to large scale battery storage project development suggests that what may be considered routine contract considerations ranging from dispute resolution to taxation warrant particular attention supply chain raw material supply concerns for batteries

paper 3 purported to find racial bias in pulse oximetry measurements based upon a comparison of data obtained from black and white patients compiled from multiple sets of health record data using unspecified pulse oximeters and controls masimo founder and ceo joe kiani responded to the letter and promised additional research to test masimo s understanding of the subject and hypothesis about the performance of masimo technology the first of such studies was conducted and reported by dr steven j barker chief science officer masimo and dr william c wilson chief medical officer masimo drs barker and wilson performed a retrospective analysis of masimo laboratory data obtained from black and white volunteer subjects in an effort to identify differences in masimo pulse oximeter accuracy and bias between ethnic groups the authors reviewed data collected between october 2015 and july 2021 which included 7 183 paired samples 3 201 black and 3 982 white collected from 75 subjects 39 black and 36 white who were screened with the same criteria to remove potential bias based on health conditions all subjects were exposed to the same hypoxia protocol which varied the arterial saturation of hemoglobin sao 2 between 70 and 100 noninvasive oxygen saturation spo 2 values were obtained from masimo set pulse oximeters with rd set sensors and time matched within 5 seconds rather than up to 10 minutes as in the letter to the editor with arterial blood gas abg samples analyzed using an abl 835 blood gas analyzer the authors analyzed the data to determine the bias the mean difference in paired spo 2 and sao 2 samples precision standard deviation of the difference and accuracy root mean squared error a rms for both groups they found a negative bias of 0 20 for black subjects compared to a negative bias of 0 05 for white subjects a difference of 0 15 p 0 001 which is not clinically significant and is numerically indistinguishable because the spo 2 display resolution is 1 on commercially available pulse oximeters both from masimo and other manufacturers they found precision of 1 40 for black subjects and 1 35 for white subjects accuracy a rms was 1 42 for black subjects and 1 35 for white subjects these results are consistent with the accuracy specifications of rd set sensors 1 5 accuracy a rms by comparison to the masimo finding of 0 15 difference in bias between black and white subjects the 2020 letter to the editor reported a difference in bias of 8 1 in a cohort of black and white hospital patients 2 54 times higher than the masimo result masimo is conducting additional studies and will report its findings in the future masimo masimo a rms accuracy is a statistical calculation of the difference between device measurements and reference

new york jan 17 2022 prnewswire pomerantz llp announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against peloton interactive inc peloton or the company nasdaq pton and certain of its officers the class action filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and docketed under 21 cv 10266 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired peloton s common stock between december 9 2020 and november 4 2021 inclusive the class period the claims asserted herein are alleged against peloton and certain of the company s senior executives collectively defendants and arise under sections 10 b and 20 a of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act and u s securities and exchange commission sec rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder if you are a shareholder who purchased peloton common stock during the class period you have until january 18 2022 to ask the court to appoint you as lead plaintiff for the class a copy of the complaint can be obtained at www pomerantzlaw com to discuss this action contact robert s willoughby at or 888 476 6529 or 888 4 pomlaw toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased based in new york city peloton is a fitness equipment and media company during the class period peloton sold internet connected stationary bicycles and treadmills that were designed and marketed for use in customers homes the bicycles and treadmills include connected touchscreen devices through which customers can access exercise classes and other content to that end in addition to the exercise equipment peloton sells monthly subscription services that allow customers to access fitness classes using their peloton equipment or alternatively to access classes and related content on their own devices without using peloton equipment for most of 2020 and 2021 as the covid 19 pandemic and related stay at home orders and business closures largely kept individuals out of the gym the demand for in home exercise options increased dramatically against that backdrop in the months leading up to the class period peloton experienced unprecedented demand for its products and services as defendant john foley foley confirmed in statements to investors on february 11 2021 there s been crazy demand for our products because gyms have been closed or you didn t want to go to the gym because you might get covid there so the demand has been through the roof the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants repeatedly and falsely assured investors that peloton s recent success was not primarily due to covid related increased demand but rather that the company s growth and financial results were sustainable and would continue post covid for example on december 9 2020 the first day of the class period in response to an investor s question about how a post covid world impacts view of business opportunity defendant foley assured investors that peloton s results ha nothing to do with covid that is a human need of i want to get fit i want fitness in my life in a consistent way i want it to be convenient i want it to be fun i want it to be motivating and i want it to be a great value and all of those things are foundational to what peloton delivers always delivered it we delivered it in pre covid during covid and we will deliver it post covid defendants also represented to investors during the class period that investments in the company s supply chain including increasing the number of bikes and treadmills produced and reducing the average time it takes to deliver products to customers were sound investments that would enable peloton to align supply and demand for its products for example on february 4 2021 in a letter to peloton shareholders the company stated that our supply chain investments over the last several months are helping us better match our supply and demand going forward accordingly defendants represented that the rising inventory levels reported in the company s periodic financial reports filed with the sec during the class period reflected outstanding demand including orders that had not yet been filled rather than excess supply that outpaced waning demand defendants class period representations that peloton would continue to succeed and grow post covid were false in truth peloton s class period financial results were primarily driven by covid related increases in demand for at home exercise options as gyms have reopened and other outside the home exercise options have become more available because of covid vaccinations being more widespread and other covid related restrictions abating demand for peloton s equipment and subscription services have declined substantially moreover rather than matching supply and demand peloton had a massive growth in inventory that far exceeded customer demand further the company has admitted that it suffered from a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting during the class period specifically concerning inventory levels in light of that material weakness the company could not accurately report its inventory levels and had no sound basis to represent to investors that supply and demand were aligned the truth began to emerge on august 26 2021 after the market closed when peloton disclosed one day in advance of its announcement of the company s financial results for its fiscal year 2021 that in the course of our fiscal 2021 audit process a material weakness was identified in our internal controls over financial reporting with respect to identification and valuation of inventory in the company s annual report for its fiscal year 2021 filed with the sec on form 10 k on august 27 2021 it further disclosed that this material weakness arose because our controls were not effectively designed documented and maintained to verify that our physical inventory counts were correctly counted and communicated for reporting in our financial statements as a result of these disclosures the price of peloton common stock declined by 9 75 per share or 8 5 from a closing price of 114 09 per share on august 26 2021 to a closing price of 104 34 per share on august 27 2021 at the same time however peloton made false reassuring statements to investors including issuing guidance of 5 4 billion of total revenue for fiscal year 2022 beginning september 1 2021 representing 34 year over year growth discussing that guidance defendant jill woodworth claimed that we are entering fiscal 2022 with a normalized backlog for our bike portfolio and guidance reflects our expectation of continued strong demand then on november 4 2021 after the market closed peloton shocked investors when it disclosed that it had revised its full year revenue guidance down to a range of 4 4 to 4 8 billion dollars due to declining demand as its customers were increasingly free to exercise outside the home and regarding inventory peloton disclosed that inventory totaled 1 27 billion a 35 increase over the prior quarter 91 of which were finished products that the company still held as a result of these disclosures the price of peloton common stock declined by 30 42 per share or over 35 from a closing price of 86 06 per share on november 4 2021 to 55 64 per share on november 5 2021 erasing 8 1 billion in shareholder value pomerantz llp with offices in new york

jackie botts calmatters by the lone tent under the cement overpass just visible from the hollywood freeway in los angeles fernando maya waited with several backpacks stuffed with clothes electronics and food once a constant roar of traffic below his makeshift home the freeway stood empty in the waning days of spring 2020 as the first wave of coronavirus tore through california here occasional cars whipped up gusts of wind their whistles morphing into the voices of people he had let down a car pulled up alongside a chain link fence that separated a service road from maya s camp he hadn t taken down his tent raised from the dirt by a wood pallet to let rats pass he was leaving and he didn t know how long he d be gone maya slid into the back seat his mind spinning with doubts at 6 feet 1 the 56 year old brimmed with an energy that could swing from charming to intimidating when agitated he slung his words faster then harder i don t want to go anywhere where there s a curfew maya said to the driver jorge soria his caseworker i don t need the headache of having to follow directions you re getting a good place but it s not like a free for all soria recalls saying as he pulled the car forward california s pandemic response marked the start of maya s journey indoors through project roomkey the statewide effort to take vulnerable and elderly people off the street he was given the keys to a hotel room of his own that june later maya would credit the program and gov gavin newsom with having ended his homelessness over the course of a five month stay at a hip west hollywood hotel soria helped maya renew his application for a federal housing program for veterans in an apartment complex with 90 affordable units set aside for people experiencing homelessness by september his application was approved the state would claim maya as a successful transition into permanent housing on paper at least so called permanent supportive housing programs like maya s which pair ongoing rental assistance with supportive services such as case management substance use programs and mental health treatment represent the gold standard for housing chronically homeless people such as maya for every one open unit in los angeles now about seven people are waiting having slept in the alleyways underpasses and sidewalks of los angeles throughout much of his adult life maya longed for a place to call home a chameleon by nature maya assumed he would transition quickly just as he had adapted to the navy prison and living in a tent he d have his own keys his own coffee maker safety ease he didn t think the hardest part was yet to come ___ for years openings in permanent supportive housing have not kept up with the growing number of californians facing chronic homelessness in the three years before the pandemic the number of permanent supportive housing slots in california grew by about 10 in contrast the state counted a 36 uptick in chronically homeless people california is trying to increase capacity last year state lawmakers approved a 12 billion two year plan to tackle homelessness according to the newsom administration these investments would convert 35 000 hotel and motel rooms into permanent supportive housing over five years growing california s stock by over 50 this month the governor proposed another 1 5 billion to place people with complex behavioral health issues in tiny homes and other temporary housing while they wait for slots to open but demand outstrips supply while conservative estimates put the total number of chronically homeless californians at around 49 000 it s been growing each year the vast majority live outside and about half live in los angeles county if the state executes its plan tens of thousands of people like maya sick and scarred from years of living on california s streets will finally come inside all at once whether they get the support they need to stay housed will determine the future of california s homelessness crisis ___ on the morning of oct 28 2020 maya packed his life into plastic bags and duffels once again leaving the upscale hotel behind he loaded his belongings into soria s car and the two men drove east sandwiched between the hollywood freeway and a busy boulevard lined with auto shops the brand new apartment complex towered six stories over a commercial zone where little else was as modern or sleek as the building s white red gray and glass exterior maya had grown up just blocks away he carted his belongings past a debris filled encampment of tents that snaked around the building then through the glass front door and into a pristine courtyard of cement and manicured lawns maya waited jittery with coffee and anticipation in a room strung with halloween decorations where residents watched a communal television minutes after signing his lease he surveyed his new studio shaped like an l the unit opened into a galley kitchen that widened into a bedroom already equipped with a bed and dresser maya bid soria goodbye thanking him profusely for his help having secured housing for his client soria would soon clear maya from his caseload at the people concern a nonprofit provider of housing and mental health services in los angeles several days later sitting at his new kitchen table decorated with a flowerpot of pens maya contemplated his goals decades of stimulant use had left his face gaunt his smile revealed rotting and missing teeth but while at the hotel maya had gained 10 pounds that filled out his pockmarked cheeks a red lanyard hung around his neck weighted by his new apartment keys he felt optimistic he said he wanted a real job before the market locked him out for good his housing voucher subsidized his rent so it only ate through 52 of his 221 monthly cash assistance he still wanted to prove to the world and to himself that he had something to contribute he wanted to visit his mother now in her early 80s whose life waned as she battled an alphabet soup of immunocompromising illnesses they d only spoken on the phone twice in the past five years or so both times at the start of the pandemic now she lived an 8 minute bike ride away but something told maya he wasn t ready he wanted to show her a version of himself that she would finally be proud of drug free and employed ___ in 2016 california created a homeless coordinating council and adopted a model known as housing first for all state homelessness programs the model pioneered by a psychologist in new york in the 1990s and soon embraced by the federal government is straightforward end a person s homelessness by getting them into a permanent home as quickly as possible regardless of whether they use drugs or alcohol or participate in treatment offer them hands on counseling once they re inside let them choose where they live and which services they receive in contrast with how service providers had operated for decades this approach viewed housing as a tool rather than a reward for recovery extensive research shows that permanent supportive housing that follows this approach works better especially for chronically homeless people they stay housed at higher rates reducing the taxpayer costs they would otherwise rack up in shelters jails ambulances and emergency rooms critics including the previous homelessness czar under former president donald trump say that the model hasn t proved its worth as homelessness skyrockets several conservative think tank voices point out that housing first has a mixed record when it comes to addressing serious mental health issues substance use or employment others argue that it writes a blank check for rent without moving people toward the goal of self sustainability republican state lawmakers called housing first the most expensive and difficult policy this month when they implored newsom to declare a special legislative session on homelessness proponents insist that their aim is more realistic and less paternalistic to permanently end a person s homelessness and help that person achieve individual goals but the plan only works if it s executed well a team of university of southern california researchers found that the reality often falls short in a pre pandemic study of 26 housing first programs in los angeles residents tended to report social isolation and unchanged substance use after their first year though their mental health significantly improved most said they received little assistance from the in house support team contributing to tenants isolation difficulty navigating a complex health and social services system and inability to develop additional life skills the housing supervisors described offering comprehensive case management primary and mental healthcare and substance use treatment but the researchers interviews with frontline staff revealed gaps caseworkers reported that a patchwork of outside agencies providing services were difficult to communicate with caseloads averaged 36 residents per staff member far higher than the recommended caseload of 12 to 15 and staff struggled to focus on anything more than keeping people housed understaffing turnover and burnout plague homeless services throughout the state as california faces a growing shortage of providers including psychiatrists psychologists therapists clinical counselors and social workers covid 19 has only exacerbated staffing shortages so people fall through the cracks according to research by the california policy lab at least one in five people placed in permanent supportive housing in los angeles between 2010 and 2019 returned to homelessness ___ maya recalls that when he was about 7 his father taught him how to bike by pushing him down a narrow alleyway behind their duplex on a three speed without training wheels in the last few years maya rediscovered bicycles as a way to cope with his frustrations memorizing the streets of los angeles when major events occurred mass grief after the death of kobe bryant protests after a police officer killed george floyd he watched history unfold from his bike during the early months of the pandemic he swerved across empty boulevards and zipped the wrong way down desolate streets linkin park blaring through his headphones on maya s 11th day in the apartment nov 7 2020 he recalls leaving around noon on his beach cruiser he needed to

cocaine while in the navy he still remembers how the drug felt a short lived rush of intense euphoria then a gnawing need for more in his fifth year of service maya failed a drug test for cocaine and then another for marijuana after his second unauthorized absence he was discharged in 1986 a navy medical evaluation classified him as an occasional user not drug dependent maya returned home crack had seeped through his neighborhood soon he was selling or stealing to buy more at 25 his parents shipped him to a recovery program after a few weeks maya abandoned it with nowhere to go it was a hot dry year during his first year of homelessness maya remembers wearing shorts every day the next two decades he recounts with a series of numbers a total of 8 years spent in nine state prisons between 1990 and 2011 he was charged with two second degree burglaries one sale of a controlled substance and two petty thefts according to california department of corrections and rehabilitation records once out he would get into sober living and work parole programs but before long he d get the itch for crack he often landed back in prison for violating parole for stretches he stayed with family rented or paid month to month in a downtown hotel but he usually procrastinated on applying for jobs he acknowledges and no one wanted to offer him one anyway so he returned to the streets stealing to get by paul who also used crack and heroin but quit 23 years ago said that addiction always gripped his older brother with tighter claws and it ruptured their relationship when maya stole from paul a family heirloom a ring from ecuador the drug was a chasm maya could never fill when he wasn t high his body ached at the depths of addiction crack could consume 18 hours of each day finding buying using however maya s last three appearances in los angeles court records in 2017 2018 and 2019 show something new possession of methamphetamine someone suggested he try smoking crystal meth to help him beat crack it worked ___ days after maya left on his bike to withdraw his rent his memory resumed to the unmistakable chemical smell of a hospital he was in a sixth floor intensive care unit an ambulance had delivered maya to a county hospital with no wallet no phone nurses shared few details besides that he d arrived with a traumatic head injury requiring five staples four ct scans and anti seizure medication ambulance records requested by calmatters reveal that the 911 caller referred to the accident as a hit and run maya believes he left the hospital about a week later with a walker and took a bus home after the hospitalization maya s days changed he rarely left his apartment biked less his dizzy spells continued sometimes so extreme that he could hardly stand up from bed without losing balance he smoked crystal meth most days he now rarely felt a high just freedom from the cravings he stayed up until dawn watching late night news and cop shows or playing solitaire on his phone he often thought of his goals when he first moved in but couldn t muster the will to apply for a job or walk to his mom s house paranoia dogged him he d emerged from the hospital with no bruises or scrapes other than a gleaming scar about an inch long on the back of his head he suspected someone attacked him from behind and might do it again over the summer maya asked his primary care doctor for help quitting crystal meth a highly addictive stimulant methamphetamine floods the brain with dopamine a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward heavy use decays the body and brain sometimes leading to delusions and paranoia that mimic psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia unlike other drugs like opioids there are no good replacement medications that can help a user wean off maya s doctor prescribed daily anti depressants and a monthly injection of a drug used to treat opioid dependence a combination found to slightly reduce cravings for some meth users meanwhile his mental health provider continued to prescribe him zoloft a drug often used to treat depression and anxiety and zyprexa an antipsychotic medication often used for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but maya distrusted the meds he didn t want to feel sluggish or numb as summer turned to fall maya increasingly perceived threats in the apartment complex he fixated on the idea that neighbors perhaps people living in the encampment outside or other residents or security guards hacked into his internet and monitored his behavior sometimes he heard their voices jeering as if they knew what he had just typed on his phone before his father was diagnosed with parkinson s disease maya thought joseph was going crazy in the years before he died in the early 2000s joseph heard voices saw people who weren t there imagined threats everywhere ___ now maya empathized he said he reported the issues several times to his housing case manager and the property manager and even called the cops it s hard to get a clear picture of what was really happening people assisting the homeless or path a major statewide nonprofit that runs maya s permanent supportive housing citing privacy declined to make his housing case manager or anyone else available to discuss maya security concerns are common in the complex said chester reyes the in house case manager for veterans reyes who works with up to 45 veterans at two different housing complexes said many say they feel unsafe due to a homeless encampment outside crime and drug use near the building and a lack of staffing after hours and on weekends it s also difficult to pin down how various teams in maya s building coordinate support for him path owns the complex contracts with an on site security team and runs the supportive services partnering with a nonprofit medical clinic a nonprofit mental health provider and county department of mental health substance abuse services an affordable housing management company maintains the building and collects rent meanwhile the u s department of veterans affairs pays for maya s rental subsidy and his case manager reyes together these providers are supposed to help maya recover from homelessness set goals develop skills and build community according to path the team meets on a weekly basis to discuss individualized plans for residents however maya says he received no assistance with job applications or other goals he doesn t blame the in house staff he d mostly avoided them especially after he didn t see them act on his safety concerns he d never been one to stick to treatments or open up to counselors at least now he observes that doesn t get him kicked out of housing by maya s account his mental health provider did not coordinate with his primary care provider though he thought they should reyes was on leave for most of the year with a rotating cast of veterans social workers from other buildings filling in maya missed soria his previous case manager who helped him get off the streets as maya s distress grew his studio felt more cramped clutter covered his kitchen counters and stove shopping carts held bike parts and clothes socks and towels hung on a rope strung across his kitchen he kept his blinds drawn he often felt trapped in his room worried that if he left he d be attacked he d rigged a security system at his door to ward off intruders a red shoelace tied around the inside door handle would impede lock pickers a three sided ruler duct taped under the door blocked anything from sliding under when inside he often pulled out his refrigerator to block the entrance he kept a knife tucked in his back pocket on his one year anniversary in the apartment maya mulled over the idea of returning to the streets if he couldn t move soon he still had a new tent that soria once gifted him he said he still slept on the sleeping bag he used at the underpass ___ maya s experience echoes what the usc researchers found a disconnect between the lofty goals of program supervisors and the realities that formerly homeless residents and frontline staff face reyes said his main goal for his clients is to help them enroll in any mental or health care they need and keep up with rent but researchers and county administrators and state officials are more ambitious about improving maya s wellbeing dr margot kushel a ucsf professor who studies health and homelessness said maya s team should help him relocate to a place where he feels safer in a study of 169 permanent supportive housing residents in santa clara county in which nearly all remained housed kushel and other researchers found that 70 needed to move at least once the medical director for the substance use branch of the county department of public health dr brian hurley said that maya should have a team of specialists who coordinate his treatment plan and access to contingency management therapy a well evidenced treatment for meth use that incentivizes sobriety with small rewards like cash or prizes dr jonathan sherin a neuroscientist who directs the los angeles mental health department said he wished he could pair maya with a well trained occupational therapist who could meet with him frequently to work through questions like what do you care about what do you want to do what are your goals what s your vision of a future that s bright after a year in permanent supportive housing maya s own goal for himself was simple and urgent move out maya could transfer his housing subsidy to a different kind of permanent supportive housing known as scattered site where he would rent a market rate apartment but would continue to receive veterans case management and other services but his caseworker reyes described it s a long bureaucratic process and it will be on maya to find the rare landlord willing to accept his voucher a challenge in los angeles hot housing market ___ in early november desperation pushed maya to stop smoking meth cold turkey and apply for a job at an amazon warehouse his monthly aid had covered life outdoors but life inside required new expenses rent cleaning supplies and food for which he no longer relied on the salvation army mostly he wanted to get away from the anxiety he felt in his building after eight harrowing days endured mostly alone in his apartment as the voices teased and harassed him maya left the apartment on a sunny morning arriving two hours early to a nondescript office building inside a man behind a glass partition click clacked on a keyboard as maya answered his questions within 15 minutes the man assigned maya his first shift the following friday from 10 p m to 3 a m the man directed maya to one of the drug test stations across the room he held a swab to the inside of his cheek for several minutes before sticking it in a plastic vial you re good to go he recalls an attendant saying maya stepped into the warm autumn sunlight relieved and proud the text arrived several days later hi this is amazon with a message about your recent job application we need you to schedule another appointment due to an error with your drug test results energy drained from maya s body in the weeks that followed maya would schedule another amazon drug test only to miss it he would talk himself out of calling his mother again an employee badge would continue to elude him he would eye the tent he stored in his closet maya doesn t remember whether he relapsed before or after he received amazon s text as soon as the smoke hit his lungs he felt a rush of relief ___ the state too has fallen short on many plans a 2020 audit called california s efforts to address homelessness disjointed with at least nine state agencies operating 41 different programs that fund homeless services the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office criticized newsom s homelessness spending plan in both 2020 and 2021 for lacking a clear strategy lawmakers are pushing change from the top they reformed the state s homeless council last year naming the secretaries of california s health and housing agencies as leaders in an effort to improve coordination the state built a data system to track whom counties are serving and how newsom s budget plan last year included a 2 billion boost for local governments to provide homeless assistance as they see fit but only if they make progress toward concrete goals at the same time the state is overhauling its low income health insurance program to provide high needs patients especially those who are homeless with care coordinators who make sure they get all the rehabilitative services they need it s unclear whether these efforts to bake in accountability and coordination will trickle down into the apartment complexes clinics shelters and encampments where social workers doctors therapists and addiction counselors try to help people heal from chronic homelessness one of newsom s point people on these initiatives recognizes the difficulties ahead dr mark ghaly the state health and human services secretary will now co chair the california interagency council on homelessness as california pours billions of taxpayer dollars into tens of thousands of units ghaly said supportive services will have to catch up and be really strong fast for us to see the dividends ___ on new year s day chilly and clear after heavy rains maya biked past his old home under the freeway underpass he noted no new tents its emptiness almost inviting but he didn t plan to return over the holiday the voices he heard in his apartment quieted he attributed it to the clearing of a government sanctioned encampment across the street he started leaving the apartment more and rode farther the new year held some promise and many unknowns maya had filled out paperwork for free dental work to replace his broken and missing teeth he d begun registration for an app that pairs freelance labor with odd jobs for the first time in his life he had started to regularly see a therapist he planned to end 2022 a little more self sufficient he said though he no longer expected he d get sober he also didn t plan to move after he d learned he d have to pay a security deposit but didn t qualify for assistance a year and a half after leaving the underpass maya had found a new albeit tenuous stability he remained a statistical success story in california s fight to reverse its mushrooming homelessness crisis yet 14 months into permanent supportive housing he still felt little support maya s battle to build a new life for himself was still one he waged largely in solitude a few evenings later maya biked to a 99 cent store to load up on bell peppers tomatoes cucumbers pepsi a can of chili and a raspberry strudel his backpack heavy he peddled the wrong way down empty boulevards for several hours the cool winter air whipping at his face close to midnight he challenged himself up a hill not far from his building at the top a second burst of energy exhilarated maya peddled home he had groceries to put away this article is part of the california divide project a collaboration among newsrooms examining income inequality and economic survival in california

you guys in america to samadams76 i think it s a monumental mistake for any business to descend into politics if you can t serve the damned pizza or service the damned account sell the damned car or whatever the hell you think your business is regardless of your customer s politics then you re in politics not in business and you should expect to catch all the fresh hell that accrues to those who descend into politics that said i think conservatives around the country have broad leverage to take any woke company and clamp its nuts in the vise of bds boycotts divestment and social sanctions business owners toying with going woke likely have little grasp of how much business they get from political conservatives those who d like to find out should be duly served and lose it all i doubt this minnesota bank has the least grasp of how much of their assets are tied to conservative depositors if they decide to run lindell off the feds need to require them to make full disclosure to all

i hear you about not being political or otherwise being homo is not political however businesses are run by people people have opinions people wish to or not associate with certain views or people

be allowed to associate as they wish to raptor22 i just received mypillow slippers for christmas they are very good to the olline rebel being homo is a moral issue and demanding others support makes a moral demand on them if they disagree you re done if you want to remain ethical not baking the cake was never political demanding to have the cake anyway was unethical trying to sue the baker into capitulating his mortal position that s crazy unethical and overtly political saying you will agree with me morally or else if the root of the disagreement is of a political nature it s not in the purview of doing business if the root of the issue is moral it might be linddell arguing about election results and the ifs ands or buts of fraud that s political it s not a business issue lnidell running a social media site that s political it s not a business issue unlike a sole proprietorship bakery a bank is subject to federal regulation and inherent in that is all kinds of compliance with

a version of this post was originally published on tker co the spread of the omicron variant of covid 19 is disrupting business which could have implications for markets and the economy recent weeks have come with lots of headlines highlighting how businesses have been forced to scale back due to omicron related issues here are a few from just the past week united airlines cuts flights as workers call out sick ny times shake shack expects 2021 revenue to beat street expectations but staffing is taking a hit from covid marketwatch supply woes omicron push abercrombie big lots to issue dull sales view reuters nike lululemon and starbucks join macy s and walmart in reducing store hours as omicron spreads business insider omicron dents albertsons supply chain recovery us news walgreens cvs shut some pharmacies on weekends as omicron strains staffing wsj according to monthly survey data from the bureau of labor statistics as of december there were 1 68 million people who said they had a job but were not at work due to illness with these developments many businesses have warned that near term financial results would be weaker than expected due to this inability to serve customers but the long run economic impact is a bit less clear and perhaps nothing to panic about just yet delayed demand again one of the big economic stories of the pandemic has been the trillions of dollars of excess savings accumulated during the early parts of the pandemic in addition to consumers being cautious for health reasons they also had limited options for spending with much of the economy effectively shut down at the time ¹ these savings helped propel consumer spending well above record levels as the economy reopened in other words demand didn t disappear it was just delayed people are seen by the united airlines counter at the newark international airport in new jersey united states on december 27 2021 amid rise in number of the fast spreading omicron coronavirus variant photo by tayfun coskun anadolu agency via getty images anadolu agency via getty images and it s not unreasonable to think this phenomenon could be picking up again we see omicron delaying but not derailing the powerful activity restart even as its impact will differ by country blackrock investment institute analysts wrote recently of course this time is a bit different as the government isn t sending out stimulus checks and other forms of emergency financial assistance as it did over the past two years that said we also don t have the sky high unemployment we had during the onset of the pandemic in fact the unemployment rate fell to a pandemic era low of 3 9 in december as the omicron variant was spreading source fred bls furthermore initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remain relatively low with the latest weekly tally sitting at 230 000 all of this suggests there s a lot more people still getting paid this time around and so money that isn t spent right now is money that may be saved for later we should also remember that businesses have learned a lot and changed a lot in the past two years and they re much better prepared to deal with the challenges that come with new waves of infections businesses that would ve otherwise made cuts in early 2020 are retaining employees today there s no question that the coronavirus pandemic is a big problem as it persists as a public health crisis and the disruptions it s causing are very visible and very real however it s far too soon to conclude that these problems aren t more than a blip in an ongoing economic recovery in case you missed it some argue that the stock market is likely to crash because historically high valuations are doomed mean revert but their argument is flawed link this chart makes very clear that earnings are the most important driver of stock prices over the long run link rearview stock market backslide the s p 500 closed at 4 662 85 on friday down 0 3 for the week the index is now down 2 2 for the year for more on stock market sell offs read this inflation as expected the consumer price index climbed by 0 5 in december from november this represents a 7 1 increase from a year ago which is the biggest jump since june 1982 the numbers were basically in line with economists expectations and they confirmed a well known trend that already has the federal reserve taking action to rein in prices so no real surprises here for context on why we re here read this and this yes but the jump in the cpi is largely due to some categories that have been uniquely impacted by pandemic related supply chain disruptions for instance used car prices were up 37 3 from a year ago if your purchases in the past year didn t include a used car then the overall inflation you re experiencing is likely a lot less than 7 1 jason furman harvard economics professor and chairman of president obama s council of economic advisers shared the chart below tracking the prices of durable goods i e stuff that lasts a long time like washing machines and services e g digital newsletters like tker inflation is still almost entirely driven by durable goods not services furman said durable goods inflation

prompted by supply chain worries higher prices and the spread of omicron led to a surprising retrenchment in retail sales in december lydia bousseur lead u s economist at oxford economics said on friday yes but as discussed above at least some of the shortfall represents demand that s being deferred into the future from pantheon macro via carl quintanilla consumers are sitting on pandemic excess savings of 2 7t equivalent to 4 3 months worth of total retail sales lack of cash is not the issue so we expect a strong rebound in sales once the omicron wave subsides retail sales are well above pre pandemic levels source fred census mortgage rates spike the national average 30 year fixed rate mortgage jumped to 3 45 this past week up from 3 22 in the prior week this is the highest level since march 2020 from freddie mac this was driven by the prospect of a faster than expected tightening of monetary policy in response to continued inflation exacerbated by uncertainty in labor and supply chains the rise in mortgage rates so far this year has not yet affected purchase demand but given the fast pace of home price growth it will likely dampen demand in the near future source

prophecy 2022 abortions tortured animals gender confusion and fear of pandemics do not make for a bright future january 17 2022 by michael bresciani inasmuch as prophecy is the forth telling of the will and counsel of god from the past the present and the future real prophets are not nostradamus like mystics with a long list of quatrains biblical prophecy is replete it tells us all we need to know from beginning to end because it was provided to us by the great alpha and omega rev 1 8 who is both the beginning and the end of all things if there is a need for extra biblical information it will be provided by the holy spirit jn 16 13 oddly people who don t heed the given revelation hardly warrant or deserve a second helping the title of this piece seems to lack what otherwise might be thought of as the heart of the future the economy that is because the morality of a nation and its economy are inextricably entwined the economy and our morality are the horse and carriage in god s dealings with men in fact the economy is the carriage and morality is the horse when nations begin to sink into a moral morass the economic welfare also begins to slide or to be more precise no deliveries can be made which is something that today we are beginning to appreciate year after year i have reiterated what god gave to me many have heeded it others seemed to think that because it seems delayed it could not possibly be true and finally there are mockers only this year have the signs begun to enter at an alarming rate their fulfillment although just beginning is now under way the three paragraphs under the subheading below are an excerpt of that revelation first published in july of 2008 the revelation came in the 1970s and was spoken to many before the advent of the internet it can be seen in its entirety here america and the coming economic disasters in the mid seventies i heard a four part message that at the time seemed impossible it was prior to the economic boom of the eighties when home values were skyrocketing and the stock market was reaching to the stars the message was in english and said michael you are a prophet then came the words you will speak to the american people followed by this is the message you will speak ov ov penury the final word was not many will come out all my ideas of becoming a humble teacher in the public schools went south along with my secondary hope that i might want to become a gospel missionary in some foreign land the message made no sense to me not only because america wasn t experiencing shortages of almost anything but also because i hadn t a clue what ov meant the word penury wasn t even in my vocabulary and i had to look it up i finally found that ov is an old english contraction for overmuch which more commonly means a lot of the word penury means a state of extreme poverty or scarcity america in a state of extreme poverty and scarcity try telling that to the american dream crowd pounding away at the house in suburbia with two cars strong college funds for the 3 5 kids good pension plans and success in careers or business the solid economics of the trump administration came to a screeching halt under joe biden and few see any reprieve in the very near future now america is not just perceived as weakening it is full blown anemic now we are back to an average of 2000 abortions per week and news sites are also showing us the extremely inhumane pictures of beagle puppies and monkeys being tortured in scientific experiments the biden way of helping science is to ignore it or at the very least politicizing it or as some prefer to say weaponizing it against our american freedoms next biden has taken to fighting against religious exemptions to the vaccine in short joe biden has made it abundantly clear that he does not care about you your faith your children or your animals prophecy 2022 is grim until the day biden is voted from office impeached or taken by dementia or poor health our favor with god will continue to diminish what is our part in the very immediate future some want a religious revival but a christian revival is not just a more excited church but it is a world that sees more people getting converted to the faith of the lord jesus christ there is plenty of revival talk in the wind but until the wind of the holy spirit sweeps across a receptive nation it is just talk a nation that deals a death blow to unborn children by the thousands and then cannot agree what sex the children are if they are allowed to be born should not hold its breath looking for something holy much less the holy spirit of god revival or not the militant church has the task of prayer and more succinctly it must now be involved in imprecatory prayer this means that rather than praying general prayers for the president or the leaders we must be very specific to pray against them is not unusual or inappropriate we all know the president claims to be religious but is he saved or actually connected to the will of god in any way if christ s litmus test were applied to biden we would be forced to conclude that he is as far from god as the east is from the west christ said wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven mt 7 20 21 prayer against those who conduct misrule oppression or persecution is a clearly defined biblical doctrine if the leaders are upholding evil or proposing evil we should pray that they fail in their efforts since god has promised to deliver us from evil perhaps we should get on with asking him to do just that in this day of deep perversions liberal and social insanity and the rise of ruthless american hating leaders who worship themselves and power exclusively don t ever accept the notion that your prayer does not count the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much james 5 16b the science vs no science argument is nonsense the fruit or product of wholesale sin was long ago identified nothing has changed the long list of judgments and calamities is listed here we can seek a political answer blame climate change racism or follow the latest trends to the new promised liberally concocted utopian dreamscape but reality will soon set in and bite us on the posterior we may no longer admit to or have the capability to recognize the source of our problems but we can all commiserate together in the result it has never been easier to predict america s future than it is

this review of philip temple s life as a novel a biography of maurice shadbolt volume two 1973 2004 appears in the latest issue of landfall it is quite possibly the last essay the editor author and critic stephen stratford wrote he died in november another marvellous performance from philip temple with multiple plots and time lines expertly interwoven as with volume 1 it is a triumph of research and narrative skill but what is missing is a subtitle perhaps this quote from shadbolt what a human muddle i leave in my wake god this book is grim reading not the author s fault it is entirely the subject s there are many upsetting passages but none more so than when shadbolt s daughter tui came up from wellington by train on her own and he refused to see her she was 12 volume 1 seemed at times a bonkbuster and volume 2 does not disappoint in this regard at the launch of a touch of clay temple tells us a young english lecturer asked shadbolt how he was feeling lonely he said it worked the young lecturer one of several moths to the flame attended to his loneliness over the days following the launch launching a touch of clay 1975 l r annette and eddie isbey maurice karl and kay stead keith sinclair photo supplied at one point in london shadbolt was entangled with three women none of whom seemed to know the other relationships were going on when he was with fleur adcock she told him he was a shit after he made advances to bridget armstrong his engagement to armstrong was news to his then partner who was devastated when the herald reported it when he was married to armstrong they went to spend the weekend with actor bruce purchase and his wife elspeth sandys and my heart sank because i knew what was coming e began to make up to her while purchase and bridget were drinking hard together in another room maurice followed this encounter by writing romantic overtures to sandys until she told him to stop after armstrong had left the marriage and was living again in london shadbolt went to europe on reader s digest assignments and let himself into armstrong s house causing her shock and fury when he opened the door on her return home her friend caroline ireland threatened to go round with an axe if he came back she would have too after armstrong was out forever shadbolt wrote to sandys i fell in love with you years ago the other women the wives they were all substitutes for you temple who has an excellent bullshit detector comments successfully capturing a new wife was like resolving the structural problems of a novel could he make it work could he sell it at the same time shadbolt was writing to and phoning ex lover beverley bergen it all seems a bit pathetic this inability to live without a woman in the house i am frighteningly dependent on females later when shadbolt had successfully captured sandys and she wanted to spend half the year in england where her career was temple notes his protest but you must be with me temple adds drily that after writing the first 150 000 words of the lovelock version he had to take a break it was time to get married again early on to his closest male friends he would boast about his endless conquests claiming that the difference between an ordinary fornicator and him was that he made women fall in love with him it had become an addiction to seduction with bridget at little akaloa banks peninsula 1978 photo philip temple i found all these bad behaviour stories very lowering fortunately there is much more to the book than this gossipy who s had who stuff the wider cultural context makes the book as much a social history as a life of a writer there is the baleful long term effect of cost overruns of the television series the governor pm robert muldoon s subsequent refusal to raise the licence fee and the knock on effect of that on ian cross s vision for tv one and tv two we are still suffering the consequences how that sounded the death knell for serious drama including the projected television adaptation of shadbolt s novel strangers and journeys which was a major financial blow and the sheer amount of work that goes into making a tv documentary temple is outstanding on the business side of the writing life he is a good guide to the authors fund since he knows as much about it as anyone and how precarious it was in the early days it was subject to the iron whims of muldoon there are sales figures inventories of publishers and booksellers stock how shadbolt s shell guide was not selling because of diana and jeremy pope s rival mobil guide well theirs was much better and fees from reader s digest articles and books the money is astonishing shadbolt received 65 000 for the text for the 1988 reader s digest guide to new zealand which is many times what i was paid for the 1998 edition in 1984 he wrote 9000 words about the erebus inquiry for reader s digest 8000 and a script for a gallipoli doco 12 000 he also sold the film rights to among the cinders 2000 or so these are all in 1984 dollars money rolls in but what for he wrote then unless to keep me going as a novelist there s no sense there s no pleasing some people maurice in his favourite chair at arapito road titirangi mid 1980s photo gil hanly journalism wasn t just useful for the money in that age of post pill and pre aids he could look forward to frequent amatory encounters as he travelled europe for reader s digest all expenses paid yet despite these apparent successes there are many phrases in this account along the lines of tumultuous personal life maurice s equilibrium was fragile the recurrent chaos of his domestic life a refuge from the slowly collapsing domestic environment beyond his bush studio did i mention that this was grim reading but temple is remarkably non judgmental he describes one journal entry as almost histrionic self pity the kindest use of almost i have seen meanwhile shadbolt s drama was not only with women and matters of money in a rehearsal for the play once on chunuk bair director ian mune wanted cuts mune later wrote temple tells us if challenged will explain in excruciating detail why every word was essential in the shadbolt version ian and i had marvellous rapport in cutting it was the same with the gallipoli television documentary where chris pugsley says they would debate a word for what seemed like hours shadbolt seems to have been writing for the page not the stage actors and directors saw scripts as words that were to be spoken they had to work that way very different propositions then there are the mental health issues there is a lot of depression but also a fair bit of what seems its flipside mania each new relationship marriage is at last the one here temple captures shadbolt s giddiness at new love the marvellous thing about b is that i can talk to her about my work the first time this has truly been so to which i would respond bollocks armstrong is as sharp as anyone i know but he had already had relationships with marilyn duckworth and fleur adcock both of whom know quite a bit about writing on the road with adcock new year s 1976 photo supplied temple also deftly tackles shadbolt s verdicts on his books as usual he thought was by far the best thing he had written he quotes shadbolt himself t should be magnificent something the like of which literature has never seen and i make bold to say that no one has written a novel like it temple points out the heavy influence of marquez s one hundred years of solitude but concedes it was something new in australasian fiction as for season of the jew it was ready to walk out into the world and what a book no one can take this triumph from me ah yes season of the jew as temple lays out when the war is over by shadbolt s american friend stephen becker was a model for it unforgivably shadbolt did not acknowledge this when he and armstrong visited becker she started reading the american novel and soon exclaimed to maurice it s exactly the same as season of the jew it s exactly the same book the same language he grabbed the book and said don t you dare mention it don t you dare there is an injection of fizz whenever temple quotes armstrong one can hear her marvellous voice she is our own joan greenwood take for example this moment when she recounts that on the plane from london maurice asked about her taste in music and when she hesitated told her well i only like mahler and sibelius oh christ she thought at times shadbolt s notorious hypochondria looks suspiciously like dodging his financial obligations he was slippery with money especially with his reader s digest commissions the magazine met the costs of intra european travel to magnify his income he claimed those european expenses against income in his tax returns but kept the digest expense payments in a separate bank account and did not declare them when shadbolt pleaded poverty temple records his net income for that year as 87 000 which put him in the top five per cent of all income earners temple right and the second volume of his maurice shadbolt bio photo supplied then there is the weird relationship with michael king who as a hustling freelance historian tried to get in on shadbolt s book of the television documentary about gallipoli there are four major spats the first was over king s listener review of a touch of clay which temple sees as a thorough and fair review but brutally honest next king objected to shadbolt s version of lt col william malone in the lovelock version and wrote a negative review for metro of voices of gallipoli then shadbolt assumed that king wrote a wretched little paragraph critical of him in metro s felicity ferret column he didn t i did but the information in it came from king who was adept at lobbing hand grenades and being some distance away whistling innocently when they exploded the worst spat was when king got the page proofs to review one of ben s for metro and showed ck stead the page where shadbolt described him as elderly bitter and bald stead was 60 temple says quite rightly king s action was utterly unethical especially since he had already told ling the phrase might be inflammatory and he and maurice decided to remove it king was not invited to the launch king s subsequent landfall review of one of ben s quoted the passage deleted from the book i don t know of a shabbier episode in our literary life for my taste there is a bit much showing of the author s political views there is a snark about muldoon winning an fpp election he wouldn t have under mmp voting systems are an enthusiasm of the author s the destruction of an auckland theatre is blamed on roger douglas when it was under labour mayor cath tizard and an endnote to a paragraph about academics disparaging professional writers says more recently writers who wish to enter the halls of literary recognition should complete a degree in creative writing from an approved institution still in a seven year project an author may be forgiven the occasional tiny indulgence the epilogue is a superb summary of shadbolt s oeuvre the fiction nonfiction journalism drama tv docos the lot the bibliography is as much information as one would want discussions of the novels that occur throughout this volume are as illuminating as one would expect from a writer and reader as thoughtful as temple publisher david ling s contribution must be applauded too not least his provision as in volume 1 of an exemplary index by diane lowther this is often an awful story but it is an outstanding book life as a novel a biography of maurice shadbolt volume two 1973

cooperation council gcc at these meetings the principal topics of conversation were to finally seal a china gcc free trade agreement and deeper strategic cooperation in a region where u s dominance is showing signs of retreat according to local news reports as oilprice com has been highlighting for some time now the u s s influence across the middle east has been in particular decline since the presidency of donald trump in line with his comments to get out of endless wars and that the u s should no longer resolve old conflicts in distant lands the repercussions of this broad policy idea found the greatest resonance in those countries already aligned to the u s s primary global rivals for power china and russia these included most notably iran iraq other states in the shia crescent of power and syria a shift that is analyzed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets following the u s s unilateral withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action in may 2018 and the subsequent broad and deep ranging alliance between iran and china as delineated in its 25 year comprehensive strategic agreement it was iran s historical enemy saudi arabia that felt particularly vulnerable to a seemingly newly reenergized tehran and looked to the u s for reassurances the problem at that point was that a series of events in the preceding years had undermined the core relationship between saudi arabia and the u s that had been formulated and formalized at a meeting on 14 february 1945 between the then u s president franklin d roosevelt and the saudi king at the time abdulaziz this agreement was that the u s would receive all of the oil supplies it needed for as long as saudi arabia had oil in place in return for which the u s would guarantee the security both of the ruling house of saud and by extension of saudi arabia however facing the prospect of having its own oil industry the only substantial revenue generator it has marginalized by the then nascent u s shale oil sector saudi arabia launched the 2014 2016 oil price war to try to destroy the u s shale threat or at least severely disable it when that effort failed to have the desired effect succeeding only in destroying saudi arabia s own finances and those of its oil producing neighbors as well the u s changed the 1945 agreement in one key way the new understanding was the u s will safeguard the security both of saudi arabia and of the ruling house of saud for as long as saudi arabia guarantees that the u s will receive all of the oil supplies it needs for as long as saudi arabia has oil in place and that saudi arabia does not attempt to interfere with the growth and prosperity of the u s shale oil sector shortly after that in may 2017 the u s assured the saudis that it would protect them against any iranian attacks provided that riyadh also bought a huge quantity of weapons from washington us 110 billion immediately and us 350 billion over the next 10 years however the saudis then found out that none of these weapons were able to prevent iran from launching successful attacks against its key oil facilities in september 2019 or several subsequent attacks at around the same time as the u s s assurances of its security were proving of limited worth to saudi arabia riyadh was also trying to raise money to plug the huge holes in its finances that had been caused by the 2014 2016 oil price war by doing an initial public offering ipo for its oil and gas giant saudi aramco the additional problem in this respect for saudi arabia was that whenever oil prices rose to or above the level where it could make a profit us 84 per barrel of brent was its budget breakeven price for a couple of years after the end of the 2014 2016 oil price war the u s told it and its opec brothers to pump more because it was damaging the u s s economic prospects specifically before the latest disconnect between oil and gas prices the longstanding rule of thumb was that for every one cent that the u s s average price of gasoline increased more than us 1 billion per year in discretionary additional consumer spending was lost the u s and every other western country refused to allow aramco to undertake any part of its listing on their respective benchmark stock exchanges for a wide range of reasons thus limiting saudi s ability to begin to repair its own finances but china was ready willing and able to provide a solution for the aramco ipo problem china s willingness to do this and more importantly from the personal perspective of crown prince mohammed bin salman mbs to allow him to save face over the ipo was another major milestone in the shift of saudi towards china the solution was that china would simply buy the entire stake at that time 5 percent was the stated amount to be offered in a straight private placement this would have the twin huge benefits for mbs of firstly raising the money that saudi arabia needed immediately and secondly not requiring any public disclosure of the offer price per share this latter factor would allow mbs to assure the senior saudis who by that time were skeptical of his abilities to lead the country when the time came that he had managed to hit the us 2 trillion valuation for the whole of aramco that he had publically set as a benchmark for ipo success although the offer was eventually declined the fact that china had offered itself as a backstop bid for mbs s most important public project to that point was not forgotten and nor were the corollary desires of china to forge closer links with saudi arabia going forward shortly after the offer was made china was referred to by saudi arabia s then vice minister of economy and planning mohammed al tuwaijri as by far one of the top markets to diversify the funding basis of saudi arabia and that we will also access other technical markets in terms of unique funding opportunities private placements panda bonds and others these comments came at around the same time as the visit of high ranking politicians and financiers from china in august 2017 to saudi arabia which featured a meeting between king salman and chinese vice premier zhang gaoli in jeddah and during the visit saudi arabia first mentioned seriously that it was willing to consider funding itself partly in chinese yuan raising the possibility of closer financial ties between the two countries at these meetings according to comments at the time from then saudi energy minister khalid al falih it was also decided that saudi arabia and china would establish a us 20 billion investment fund on a 50 50 basis that would invest in sectors such as infrastructure energy mining and materials among other areas the jeddah meetings in august 2017 followed a landmark visit to china by saudi arabia s king salman in march of that year during which around us 65 billion of business deals were signed in sectors including oil refining petrochemicals light manufacturing and electronics with russia having already positioned itself as being vital for the efficacy of any future opec policies and deals in the aftermath of the 2014 2016 oil price war china through its one belt one road obor program with all of its associated investment was and remains ideally placed to pick up influence across the region as the u s eases back moreover for the oil producing countries of the middle east china is not a threat to their positions in the global oil sector as the u s is through its shale oil sector but rather remains a notable end consumer the fact that the obor related investments made by china come with considerable caveats allowing beijing to secure key strategic tracts of land or sea in lieu of debts owed or investments made including iran s major airports and naval ports under the 25 year deal with china sri lanka s hambantota port and djibouti s doraleh port may be regarded by these middle eastern states as being little different to the conditions attached to u s investment since the end of the second world war for the u s though news just before christmas that saudi arabia is now actively manufacturing its own ballistic missiles with the help of china may not be regarded as part of a reasonable rebalancing of power in the middle east especially in light of washington s current and ongoing efforts to address iran s nuclear ambitions by

week december 19 2022 liberal media scream martha raddatz lets biden off on border crisis washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features a bizarre line of thinking about the historic border crisis from abc s martha raddatz a trusted media voice who wants to shift the blame to republicans hosting sunday s this week raddatz suggested that since president joe biden never explicitly said that the border is open then he s not to blame for the crisis despite months of signaling that the former trump administration s border closings were being lifted interviewing texas gov greg abbott raddatz said i don t think i ve ever heard president biden say we have an open border come on over but people i have heard say it are you are former president trump are ron desantis that message reverberates in mexico and beyond she doubled down on the impact of republicans acknowledging the reality of the open border smugglers use all those kinds of statements from sunday s this week raddatz you talk about the border wall you talk about open borders i don t think i ve ever heard president biden say we have an open border come on over but people i have heard say it are you are former president trump are ron desantis that message reverberates in mexico and beyond so they do get the message that it is an open border and smugglers use all those kinds of statements abbott it was known from the time that joe biden got elected that joe biden supported open borders it is known by the cartels who have sophisticated information whether or not the biden administration is going to enforce the immigration laws or not is known across the world but most importantly known among the cartels raddatz and how do you play into that what can you do better abbott so we have every level of government doing everything we can to prevent people from coming into the country illegally or repelling them or arresting them and putting them behind bars brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick how ludicrous a line of reasoning president biden s open border policies speak louder than any words he may not have explicitly said and since when does denouncing a policy mean you are advocating for that reality by that reasoning journalists like raddatz were promoting trump policies every time they denounced them rating four out of five screams december 12 liberal media scream msnbc and beschloss democracy wins only if democrats do washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features presidential historian and msnbc regular michael beschloss with the latest spin that only democrats are good and all republicans are bad talking about the georgia victory of sen raphael warnock he even took it a step further the victory secured democracy for another minute this was a really good week for our democracy msnbc s resident presidential historian declared on friday s the 11th hour with stephanie ruhle citing warnock s win in georgia and how donald trump has continued to implode he suggested the gop is on its deathbed for nominating herschel walker in the race at the suggestion of former president donald trump pointing to trump he said if the republicans continue to beat this horse of donald trump and stick to him which they may have to because of presidential primaries the republicans themselves may die too beschloss on friday s the 11th hour on msnbc with substitute host alicia menendez alicia i think this was a really good week for our democracy i have been enjoying almost every minute and i hope that all of our friends watching feel the same way you know beginning with rev warnock you know this is he s been elected to a six year term in georgia martin luther king s church pastor in atlanta well 1960 martin luther king was locked up in a georgia prison that was so dangerous that coretta scott king thought there was a danger that he would be killed in prison look how far things have come this is a week in which donald trump has continued to implode you know let s think about what might have happened this week had the republicans won in those battleground states those election denying candidates they might have losers might have said we really won we should be installed there should be violence in the streets almost none of that happened you know the fact that we are living in a peaceful country that really this last month has resembled the way things used to be in this country in terms of democracy i think we have to pause and enjoy and the other thing is when you are thinking about donald trump and the republican party look at history when parties do not adapt to public opinion they die that happened to the federalists in 1816 war of 1812 they remain the pro british party happened to the whigs they did not adapt to changing views on slavery and if the republicans continue to beat this horse of donald trump and stick to him which they may have to because of presidential primaries the republicans themselves may die too brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick such crocodile tears from beschloss as if such a hardcore left wing advocate who sees a really good week for our democracy because a liberal democrat won a senate seat after a bunch of

coverage of the hunter biden affair was imagine suggesting that the hunter biden laptop story covered in conservative media but ignored during the 2020 campaign by liberal outlets such as the new york times was akin to pizzagate or birther charges against former president barack obama well that s exactly what the gray lady did in a video bragging about how smart she thought she was flashback see how the nytimes opinion folks trashed the hunter biden laptop scoop as conspiracy theories and lies like birtherism and pizzagate in a feb 4 2021 video on how biden beat trump biden won by not

hunter biden laptop story as the narrator charged the campaign wrapped the story with layers of conspiracy theories and lies newsbusters executive editor tim graham with our partner for the weekly liberal media scream the media research center came across the embarrassing video monday morning of course the paper this year conceded that the biden computer story was very real and it linked the biden family to potentially scandalous business dealing with china from a new york times opinion video posted on feb 4 2021 on youtube though trump has had more controversies than i can count biden had one too a booby trap that could have brought down his entire campaign his son hunter for sure there are some awkward truths about hunter from his drug problems to his business dealings around the world team trump then wrapped these with layers of conspiracy theories and lies clip of rudy giuliani this is hunter biden s laptop and when you look at the photograph section it s disgusting and it includes a large number of underage girls clip of donald trump jr money tied to human trafficking and prostitution rings and the other one that s another big one the chinese money joe biden is compromised 100 narrator in politics a conspiracy theory doesn t have to be true to have legs think birtherism or pizzagate biden won this battle precisely by not engaging with the nuttiness brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick how embarrassing or at least it should be for the new york times though they probably lack the required self awareness the journalistic line today is that the news media suppressed the hunter biden laptop story because corporate media outlets couldn t prove it was real so they responsibly tilted toward the side of caution this shows they were totally in the tank for joe biden eager to discredit as a conspiracy any attacks on him from donald trump that may have damaged their preferred

clear goal to stand against black people in the broadest racial smear she not only said on msnbc s morning joe that republicans are racists but that they are even worse by putting walker up to challenger sen raphael warnock as if voters had no say and even in a more twisted way of thinking she said walker s nomination somehow is a way for white people to deny black people democracy and promote voter repression a false claim since the primary saw record voting the new york times editorialist told al sharpton given what the republican party has come to stand for and stand against which in part is simply black people at this point and access to democracy and to citizenship the idea that the republican party in 2022 would put forth a candidate who among other things is also a black man to kind of usher in more voter repression and more of what the republican party stands for is cynical of course show co host mika brzezinski and sharpton were in agreement from monday s morning joe on msnbc mara gay given what the republican party has come to stand for and stand against which in part is simply black people at this point and access to democracy and to citizenship the idea that the republican party in 2022 would put forth a candidate who among other things is also a black man to kind of usher in more voter repression and more of what the republican party stands for is cynical the thing that makes it though really disturbing to me is just the overall message to voters black and white that one black man is just as good as another one black man is the same as any black man so it doesn t matter if you re barack obama it doesn t matter if you re raphael warnock it doesn t matter if you re herschel walker they re all the same you re all the same and voters should see you that way and it s also just an insult to black americans but to all voters mika brzezinski that s the i mean sort of racist aspect of this is truly insulting brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick instead of celebrating how blacks achieved the nominations of both parties to a u s senate seat from a southern state

age 28 she said using that as her straw man she lashed out at republicans but no national gop figure in washington is seriously considering such a move from the nov 14 the view just like the latina saved the senate young voters saved this country we need to really understand that we are supposed to leave this world in a better place than we found it when you look at the youth voter turnout in the 2022 midterms they delivered key wins for the democrats younger voters aged 18 to 29 which by the way now the republicans want to raise the voting to age 28 younger voters were the only voter group by age to overwhelmingly support democrats in the midterms sixty three percent of voters voted for democratic house candidates i think my friend you know cornell belcher and you know cornell as

including hunter biden and the immigration crisis for example on sunday as he hosted this week karl tried to embarrass virginia gov glenn youngkin on the planned investigations suggesting that they weren t what republicans ran on five times he asked about impeachment though as a governor youngkin would have no say in such a move against biden or his cabinet members house and senate gop leaders have promised to open investigations into white house policies and scandals if they take control just as democrats have continued to do on former president donald trump from sunday s this week on abc jon karl i m hearing a lot though of talk about investigations investigations into hunter biden fbi all things anthony fauci republicans talking about going you know all in if they take control of particularly the house is that really what you re campaigning on to have massive investigations into all virginia gov glenn youngkin i think that the house and the senate and the white house are going to have to go to work and offer solutions on top of that our democracy is better when our congress exercises its responsibility for oversight and they can also deliver answers i think voters are going to make a statement on tuesday and they want their elected leaders to deliver results karl what about all this impeachment talk i mean i ve gone through i can count at least three members of the biden cabinet that republicans have talked about impeaching and obviously there have already been impeachment resolutions introduced many of them for biden himself would that be a mistake for republicans to go in with impeachment youngkin again i believe strongly our democracy is better when our congress exercises its oversight functions karl impeachment youngkin the reality of this is virginians are gonna vote for congressional representatives and i think that we re going to see a number of seats flip and they want them to go to work to deliver karl but let me press you on that though commonsense kitchen table issues that s what you ve been talking about is that what voters have in mind impeaching an impeachment of joe biden i m hearing that a lot youngkin you know i don t know i don t know if

ahead to the midterm elections this past summer it was looking like the supreme court decision to overturn roe v wade might offer an opportunity to the party in power the democrats but a more recent issue inflation could very well rule the day and favor republicans and beneath it all says our robert costa lies what could be the most critical issue of all the very future of our democracy robert

about what else is at stake in 2022 michael berkman director of the mccourtney institute for democracy at penn state democracy doesn t usually die through coups or invasion it usually dies from within costa the republican party is gripped by people who are election deniers how should the press contend with that it s happening inside one particular party margaret sullivan right and we need to be very straightforward about saying that and pointing it out of course we are going to hold both parties to the same standards it s not that we re on one team we hold both parties to the same standards

attacks on democracy for fear of being labeled partisan costa to sullivan how does the press cover it without sounding alarmist at every step sullivan i don t think we re nearly alarmist enough i think we need to stop being asleep at the switch and sound the alarm more about what could happen if election denialists are in power and decide oh well we only like the results of this election but not that one i mean we no longer have a country anymore brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick pauley and costa serve here as liberal political operatives pushing a democratic polemical line so many journalists find compelling vote democratic or the nation will end as we know it such unjustified fearmongering the kind of

sunday s meet the press with biden his challenge is that he hasn t been able to communicate to the american people what he s done she said citing student loan payoffs and his focus on manufacturing she went on to suggest that biden is a policy president and that is a harder sell than former president donald trump s communications about undermining elections though he arrived in washington with a long list of policy initiatives that he acted on including reducing regulations limiting illegal immigration and establishing a basis for middle east peace kumar on sunday s meet the press with biden his challenge is that he hasn t been able to communicate to the american people what he s done i mean we can say that the difference between donald trump and the difference within biden is biden is a policy president so he s going to make fundamental changes for a generation and we re talking about student loan relief we re talking about bringing back manufacturing and the list goes on but the difference with trump is that his consequence is not policy it s his legacy of undermining elections and it s not just him it s not him but he actually has a cadre of individuals right now seeking office that are election deniers and that legacy is far more dangerous for a modern day president than any other thing because it believes in undermining our democracy brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick more media delusion blame the messengers for the public s failure to appreciate president biden for the great things he

democrats broadly jen psaki well it was a big week here in washington so much news i don t even know how you decided what to talk about this morning kristen but the truth is you know i looked at a bunch of local front pages this morning and if you look at the front page in nevada they re talking about trump s rally there and what it means for candidates in turning out to vote if you look at the front pages in pennsylvania they re talking about mastriano does he have a grassroots campaign or movement going and obviously georgia is quite focused on every latest development in herschel walker

s what we re seeing currently brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick how ridiculous some newspapers covering local news on their front pages do not prove a major development in the hunter biden scandal is not newsworthy newspapers carry more than one story but it is true that the media s power to ignore is its most insidious

boss from the roundtable on sunday s meet the press chuck todd jackie walorski died in a car accident in i believe it was in august she was a big part of this hunger and so that s how this moment came about symone how would you have handled that situation symone sanders townsend look karine jean pierre has a very tough job i think she goes out there every single day and a number of people could not do what she does every single day look i think it s very clear that the president had a slip of the tongue obviously and i m sure he is extremely apologetic to the family of the congresswoman if he caused them any more trauma or agony no one i mean i think everyone understands that the president unfortunately uniquely understands how the family is feeling and i m sure he made that very clear to them when he came to the white house on friday just acknowledge he had a slip of the tongue move on it s unfortunate again life is here he understands and empathizes i think that s what s most important here and i think karine did try to do that todd people make mistakes and you try to go from there sanders townsend yeah yeah we have all done it before todd fair enough brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick president biden makes an embarrassing fumble which suggests he s become more forgetful as he approaches 80

he picked up on panelist chris christie s claim that trump is losing support among republicans stephanopoulos countered that the polling right now is not really showing that it s showing among republican voters he s holding firm our poll shows him defeating joe biden in 2024 in fact the poll put trump at 48 to 46 for biden a finding that appeared in the 34th paragraph of a 35 paragraph story in the washington post george stephanopoulos from sunday s this week on abc chris christie says this is slowly moving away from donald trump and i think i actually agree with him but the polling right now is not really showing that it s showing among republican voters he s holding firm our poll shows him defeating joe biden in 2024 brent baker vice president of research and publications for

meet the press host chuck todd said swing voters he talks to all think president joe biden is too old to run again panelist yamiche alcindor pushed back with the latest biden talking point the key issue will be whether or not them thinking president biden is too old outweighs them thinking that the future of our democracy is on the line the washington correspondent for nbc news and host of pbs s washington week argued that when i talk to voters even democrats who say biden he s a little slower he s a little bit quieter i m not sure if i want to back him when they think about the state of our democracy they re like that s the bigger issue here from the sept 11 meet the press on nbc chuck todd the biden situation you know i ve asked this question to swing voters all over the country some of them are democrats some are independents and they ve all said the same answer they all think he s too old to run again yamiche alcindor well the key issue will be whether or not them thinking president biden is too old outweighs them thinking that the future of our democracy is on the line when i talk to voters even democrats who say biden he s a little slower he s a little bit quieter i m not sure if i want to back him when they think about the state of our democracy they re like that s the bigger issue here in our nbc poll we saw people say the threats to democracy are their no 1 thing even above cost of living so i think if you re a democrat even if you re joe biden looking at this and saying ok i understand people think maybe i should be a little bit more lively you re still thinking they use the words unrecognizable distrust and that there should be some compromise those are words that i think are probably worse for republicans especially when you think of while we might have a minority of republicans who don t believe that 2020 was fair they re the people with the loudest voices right they re the people who are still winning the elections that s where the candidates are and i think that to me is probably signaling that republicans have a bigger problem here brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly

the 10 a m hour on friday sept 2 of cnn newsroom with poppy harlow and jim sciutto well look they are standing by the message that president biden offered of course it was a political speech we re in a midterm reelection year the issues that he s talking about are inherently political but i think it s also important to say that the core point he made in that political speech about a threat to democracy is true now that s something that s not easy for us as journalists to say we re brought up to believe there s two different political parties with different points of view and we don t take sides in honest disagreements between them but that s not what we re talking about these are not honest disagreements the republican party right now is led by a dishonest demagogue many many

party that can stem this continued rise of fascism register and vote work toward an overwhelming majority that can protect your body protect your freedoms and just may save our country she said in a speech that the show aired twice mika brzezinski on monday s morning joe on msnbc i ve been hearing from women all over the country and even around the world this is devastating and you know they asked me what we can do and i ve got two words please vote it was winston churchill who said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others that have been tried and the same might be said of the democratic party at this point democrats somehow managed to get the most votes and lose the most elections so they need more even when they win they lose it could be argued that today s democrats are too weak too fragile too woke too elitist too disconnected from the realities of working americans and yet the democratic party is the world s last best hope against fascism against an extreme autocratic anti woman anti gay anti contraception anti freedom collection of fascists who dominate the trump wing of today s republican party a group of fascists who even refuse to investigate the violent riots that their president launched on january 6 to overthrow a legitimately elected president why because they are fascists and now they re claiming control over your bodies your health your life and they ve promised they re coming next to take away your birth control pills and even what you do with another consenting adult in the privacy of your bedroom to call trump s republican party and trump s supreme court extreme understates the danger these institutions pose to american freedom to our democracy they are fascists who have contempt for what 70 of americans believe about roe v wade what 90 of americans believe about universal background checks and what you believe about your right to control your own body and your life so what does donald trump s america look like joe sort of described it there in reality it looks like a 13 year old rape and incest victim being ordered by the state to have a forced birth of her rapist s baby that s where we are in

reelection it s not just sean hannity talking about biden s age it s the atlantic magazine harwood that s right it was an outstanding piece by mark without taking a stand on whether he s too old to run for reelection let me just run through what s true what s false and what gets conflated what s true is the presidency is a hugely taxing job mentally and physically and joe biden is old he doesn t talk or walk as smoothly as he once did that suggests challenges when you get into your 80s which he s about to do the risk of health problems grows with every year on the other hand what s false is that he is not capable of doing the job right now or he s not mentally in tune with the demands of the job anybody any aide who engages with him or reporters we can see this the gears of his mind are working that s an issue pushed by right wing media but it s not correct and what gets conflated is this president biden is in a weak political position right now and because he s old people think he s weak because he s old his biggest political problem right now is 5 a gallon gas gas is not 5 a gallon because joe biden s old his legislative program is not stymied in congress because joe biden is

just craziness this is not conservative this is authoritarian it s plain and simple and conservatives know that scarborough a onetime florida house member on monday s morning joe on msnbc setting up guest dave aronberg the state attorney for palm beach county florida if it were just about the sports stadiums he could have vetoed it and said i don t support giving money to sports stadiums or sports outfits when of course marc just pointed out he does for ones he prefers but again there is an authoritarian streak here if you tweet something that a governor doesn t like he will veto your spending and he will tell you that s why he vetoed the spending he could have just vetoed it and said i don t like sports stadiums and leave it there but no he wanted people to know he s punishing a public enterprise because of their political views with taxpayer money same thing again i talked about it before with disney talked about with cruise lines that wanted at the height of covid to keep their people safe to have them wear masks which any doctor sane doctor would have said this makes sense told them they couldn t do that told small businesses they couldn t have mask mandates if that s how they wanted to run their small business told school boards what they could or couldn t do despite the fact there s 67 counties in the huge state of florida i mean it s just craziness this is not

genetically disappearing right he said data of mothers who report having abortions however show that more black people than white 38 33 opt for the procedure but that doesn t fit the left s posture that the hot button issue boils down to racism not religion or fostering life when you tie it all together white replacement theory anti crt argument the insistence that abortion be banned and that white babies in particular be born this is all of a larger piece and that larger piece is the fear of whiteness disappearing in the face of a worldwide global expansion of people of color said dyson vanderbilt university s centennial chairman and university distinguished professor of african american and diaspora studies dyson on the may 18 cnn tonight hosted by laura coates so as odd and as exceptional as the white replacement theory looks there s a newfangled twist to it here the explicit expression that we are fearful of genetically disappearing right we know that in what 20 some odd years white people will no longer be the statistical majority in this country and when you tie it all together white replacement theory anti crt argument the insistence that abortion be banned and that white babies in particular be born this is all of a larger piece and that larger piece is the fear of whiteness disappearing in the face of a worldwide global expansion of people of color and

newly created position at planned parenthood senior director of news content on sunday denied her abortion activism came through in her reporting on cnn s reliable sources she insisted we have standards we have lawyers before anything goes on air there s a thorough review of what s going on showing her hostility to her critics she said i think these people just don t understand how newsrooms actually work they don t have that kind of experience from sunday s reliable sources on cnn brian stelter last year though national review the conservative outlet called you two years ago planned parenthood s ambassador to cbs they said you were posing as a reporter and constructing articles that more closely resemble press releases than news so that was the charge when you were at cbs and now you re at planned parenthood how do you react to the conservatives who said you were biased in your cbs coverage kate smith planned parenthood look if you re a blogger online you might not realize all of the different layers that someone goes through before they publish a piece before they go on air we have standards we have lawyers before anything goes on air there s been a thorough review of what s going on so i stand by every article i write and i would say making that accusation you re playing into the right anybody who doesn t fall by their rules who isn t anti abortion is against them so if you re trying to cover this from a neutral point of view and you re including both sides they automatically think you are against them because they view doctors as anti or excuse me for abortion and they view them as biased even though these are doctors we re talking about so i really reject all that criticism again i think these people just don t understand how newsrooms actually work they don t have that kind of experience but yeah completely reject that criticism brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our

truth department like the one headed by homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas from cnn s reliable sources on sunday may 1 brian stelter here in the u s there s been an uproar in recent days about the department of homeland security setting up what they call a disinformation governance board this has been mostly a foxworld story it did come up earlier today on cnn s state of the union but i don t think people know what it is and what it isn t and there s just been a lot of right wing uproar without knowing what it is so are you aware of this at all what is this all about moira whelan national democratic institute aware of it and i think the first thing is that it s a board exactly as we say it is meant to bring together people to coordinate a lot of the efforts inside of dhs that means law enforcement that means emergency services like fema they ve all been doing counter disinformation efforts for a while to give us accurate information about human rights abuses but also about disasters and where people can get assistance so coordinating that activity and making it speak with one voice and being a stronger advocate to tech companies and engaging the public and academia that s really what they re after stelter well that sounds like common sense but when i google this all i see is like joe biden s ministry of truth and they re going to you know like it s there s this

actions as on behalf of parental rights the two are hiding how they are really dehumanizing the lgbt community dehumanization is a tactic that s being used right now russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them dehumanization as a practice is a tactic of war it s being deployed in our politics and people like you and i sometimes lose the plot and admire its effectiveness she said from wednesday s april 20 show during a segment with guest tim miller of the bulwark nicolle wallace you and even i fall into a tradition of or profession of focusing on what works and i think we recently had a conversation about mitch mcconnell and why does he do what he does because it works it s the political reality and i worry that in covering glenn youngkin and his politics of parental choice all the focus was on how well it worked and even in our conversations about desantis it s about how well they re serving him the truth is dehumanization as a tactic for politics is from war dehumanization is a tactic it s being used right now russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them dehumanization as a practice is a tactic of war it s being deployed in our politics and people like you and i sometimes lose the plot and admire its effectiveness it s not acceptance but even the analysis of these tactics loses sight of what this speech brings us back to which is that dehumanization has a cost right now right now as it s being deployed there are children and chasten buttigieg made this point when don t ask don t tell was introduced kids will die how do we bring it back to the substance of the harm that is done by any strategy in war and politics of dehumanizing people brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research

time people s perception and that s what s important they look at the numbers and it doesn t matter that we have low unemployment it doesn t matter that the gas prices are beginning to go down a little bit the perception is things are more expensive and when i go to the market everything is more expensive even if it does start to get a little bit better that s the feeling that people have and that s what motivates people to go out and vote sometimes not necessarily fact but the perception what they re feeling stephanopoulos is this a wedge issue that cuts against democrats salinas i think it definitely does now that you mentioned title 42 what comes to mind to me is that it really depends on who s talking of course republicans are going to say president biden is opening up the border but then critics are going to say it s too little too late why didn t he do this before remember this is a health initiative it s not an immigration policy that was implemented so if the cdc is already allowing kids to go back to school people going back to baseball games and football games why do they continue to have this at the border when they forced these people to put up these camps

i can tell you right now any democrat running statewide in 2022 that has 73 of the black vote has lost full stop there is no path to victory mckinnon wow woodbury i think that we have to put donald

told you if republicans win the house then donald trump will be president in 2024 every single hand went up mckinnon oh really interesting woodbury every single hand now that right there we can t let that happen mckinnon interesting patrick gaspard i m only suggesting that in addition to the affirmative message that we have about successes you ve got to be clear they only win by punching hard you

criticism as prompted by racism is it ever possible to criticize an african american and not be called racist by someone in the media rating four out of five screams march 14 liberal media scream nyt says trump would have killed nato by now washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features the latest reason why a trump derangement syndrome vaccine for the press should be developed and its use mandated during a meet the press panel focused on the war in ukraine the discussion turned to former president donald trump and the tussle over what he would have done compared to what president joe biden has done new york times pentagon correspondent helene cooper cut to the chase offering to game out trump s move which she said would have been the destruction of nato in two weeks nato at this point would have been completely divided you would see disunity you would see other nato countries peeling off what are we going to do the alliance would be broken she said on the nbc show during his presidency trump demanded that nato allies start paying their fair share of expenses and stop relying on the united states to supply the bulk of money and troops in his game of hardball he also cut troops in germany sending some home and redistributing others we don t want to be the suckers anymore trump said we re reducing the force because they re not paying their bills it s very simple but the times reporter said that was a preview of his plans to kill nato which she then said pentagon generals held off until the election for biden to stop former trump national security adviser turned critic john bolton has also claimed the former president would have pulled the u s out of nato from the march 13 meet the press roundtable new york times pentagon correspondent helene cooper i would love to just game out where we would be right now if donald trump was still president and vladimir putin had invaded ukraine first of all trump who would already have pulled us out of nato because that s what he wanted to do he had already started pulling american troops out of europe the pentagon had kind of stalled that until biden came into office the first thing he would have said is it s not our problem ukraine is not our problem that s it go off and do you know this is not our business and nato at this point would have been completely divided you would see disunity you would see other nato countries peeling off what are we going to do the alliance would be broken so let s make sure when trump is saying this stuff about how much differently just if president trump was president right now we would be in a completely different place brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick despite all the policy changes from the trump years made by the biden administration which pleased vladimir putin such as ending arms sales to ukraine and making the u s more dependent on importing oil and gas cooper can t see past her trump myopia everything must be worse if trump is involved and she overlooked one little fact when trump was in office putin didn t invade rating three out of five screams march 7 liberal media scream lester holt fights truth that cops are where crime is washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features a rare case of a news source pushing back against the bias of a big shot news host this time nbc anchor lester holt s view that minorities are targeted by biased police doing the pushing back was former president donald trump s attorney general william barr who challenged holt s positive view of black lives matter and rejected the liberal statement that police are racists in a special about barr who is pitching his new book one damn thing after another memoirs of an attorney the former attorney general was his typical matter of fact self stopping holt dead in his tracks when he said black men are the subject of three times as many traffic stops by police barr responded that sometimes is a function of where the police are police go where the crime is from the sunday night nbc news special bill barr in the eye of the storm lester holt can we talk about the big lie bill barr which one is that holt well you write about the big lie being black lives matter barr yeah holt what did you mean by that barr black lives matter is based on the premise that the main threat to black welfare in the inner city are out of control police force that gratuitously kill african americans that s simply not borne out by the facts holt narration as the nation s top law enforcement official bill barr always had hard line views on crime and how to fight it in 1992 when barr was attorney general the first time he wrote a memo called the case for more incarceration the kind of tough lock em up policy that s been cited as a leading cause of destabilizing black communities holt to barr 1 in 3 black men will be incarcerated sometime in their lifetime 1 in 17 for white men can you not see how that shapes the perception and makes people want to rally around the idea of black lives matter barr well i understand the perception and i think there s ambivalence that s what i have found on the one hand there is a concern that when they encounter police they re not given the benefit of the doubt and they re treated as second class citizens and there s definitely that concern on the other hand i think they also understand that the police are there to try to make their community safer that it s a very tough job and they want more police crowd black lives matter no justice no peace no justice no peace holt in society do you believe there s such a thing as systemic racism barr i actually think the whole idea is a cop out i think racism exists in people s individual s souls holt by dismissing systematic racism are you not dismissing the pain of african american families that have to sit down with their children and have the talk because they re afraid a simple traffic stop could lead to their deaths barr no i don t you know i don t
