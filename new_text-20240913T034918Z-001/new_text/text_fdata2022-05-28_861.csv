chancellor sunak received labour cheers for his statement in parliament on thursday as the tories fought to regain some popularity after the continuing exposure of how tory leaders such as the pm and the chancellor broke covid regulations and displayed complete contempt for the millions of workers who carried out the covid laws sunak made it clear that his proposed rescue plan was very very risky he told mps this country is now experiencing the highest rate of inflation we have seen for forty years the bank of england expects inflation to average around 9 this year he added however over the course of this year the situation has evolved and has become more serious there are areas of particular concern even excluding energy and food core inflation has become broader based and elevated he continued and lastly as the bank has noted longer term inflation expectations have risen above their historical averages by more than they are in the us and europe he announced a levy the new levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25 it will be temporary and when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels the levy will be phased out and with a sunset clause written into the legislation this is obviously fraudulent since this current crisis is a crisis of the capitalist system it is systemic and long term and not just a brief episode his 21 billion support package includes 400 off energy bills for every household as well as payments of of 650 for people on benefits 300 for pensioners and 150 to those with disabilities it is to gain time for the tories while they get the state forces ready to hammer the working class the chancellor announced that the windfall tax will raise about 5bn creating a 16bn black hole that will have to be filled with additional borrowing meanwhile the capitalist crisis develops through slump and wars there have already been stock market crashes and predictions that the imperialist war in the ukraine will see food prices rocket out of control leaving the third world starving while hundreds of millions go hungry in the usa the uk and the eu once again sunak is seeking to buy time and hopes that his sticking plaster for gaping wounds will see the labourites co operate with the tories even to the point of forming a national government while the uk ruling class tools up for a class war against the working people at home and revolutionary movements abroad in fact the labourites were thrilled with sunak s announcement and put all notions of removing johnson as pm and forcing a general election off the agenda in favour of working for a national government the labourites who are really pleased that johnson has now adopted their pet policy of a windfall tax can now be guaranteed to work hard to halt the railworkers strikes and all the actions that workers are taking to insure that families are not living on one meal a day there is no doubt that a sudden deepening of the world crisis could see labour enter into a national government for workers the situation is clear the tories are making limited financial concessions to save their regime while they know that inflation will advance by leaps and bounds workers must direct their trade unions to oppose any move by the labourites to join a national government with the tories whose job would be to introduce the kind of poverty that workers went through in the 1930s the way forward is to turn the proposed rail strike into a general strike and make the tuc call for it at their mass rally in london on june 18th there must be no national government there must be a general strike to bring down the tories and bring in a workers government in the uk that will nationalise the banks and the major industries and fight for socialist revolutions throughout europe the workers revolutionary party and the young socialists must be built up rapidly to lead the british socialist revolution and build the fourth international as the leadership of the developing world socialist revolution there is no other way forward

as someone with an already unmanageable collection of cookbooks i see a stack of new titles and wonder what they could possibly offer that i can t already find on my sagging shelves then i open one and happily remember there are as many ways to cook as there are cooks as long as i have eyes i ll want to read new cookbooks and as long as i can hobble to the stove i ll try new recipes but unless you live in a warehouse hard choices must be made of the many intriguing cookbooks published thus far in 2022 eight held my attention first and foremost the wok recipes and techniques norton 658 pp 50 by j kenji lópez alt this five pound slab of a book grew out of a planned chapter in lópez alt s 2015 the food lab and covers all things wok from why you need one to what to look for carbon steel and a flat bottom when you buy it and of course how to stir fry meats deep fry tofu pan fry dumplings and simmer any number of savory asian soups in your favorite new pan i m embarrassed to admit that before i read the wok i thought i could cook anything just fine in my cast iron skillet i was right but is just fine all i aspire to the first batch of lópez alt s pepper steak that i whipped up in my new 20 wok was far superior to anything i d ever stir fried before the dish had wok hei the faint smoky flavor you get when flames from a blazing stove mingle with aerosolized particles from the food after that for a while i wanted to cook everything in my beloved wok and the 200 recipes in lópez alt s book made that easy ironically the recipe i love most from this book appears in a chapter on simple no cook sides and doesn t require a wok at all a cucumber salad showered in fresh dill and chili oil served on a bed of greek yogurt that made a spectacular accompaniment to stir fried beef i never would have guessed that yogurt salad might harmonize with chinese food and i can t stop thinking about the way the two worked together

bloomberg long before broadcom inc sealed a deal to buy vmware inc for 61 billion thursday it eyed the company secretly from a distance most read from bloomberg vmware had been one of the assets at the top of broadcom s target list for some time according to people familiar with the matter but the suitor quietly scrutinized the business before it went further broadcom crunched numbers scoped out vmware s products and ran scenarios for about a year before making an approach said the people who asked not to identified because the deliberations were private thus began what is set to be the biggest takeover by a chipmaker in history and one of the top tech deals of all time thursday s agreement marries a sprawling semiconductor company with a silicon valley software pioneer a merger few had anticipated before bloomberg broke news of the talks earlier this week broadcom plans to make vmware the linchpin of its software strategy reducing its reliance on the boom and bust chip industry the courtship started slowly for good reason vmware was part of dell technologies inc until a spinoff last year that split announced in april 2021 and completed nov 1 extricated vmware from dell and made it more attractive as an acquisition but broadcom executives couldn t act on anything or show their interest until at least six months after the deal closed the people said tax rules prevent a spun off company from having m a conversations for a period of time lawyers generally advise a six month window so broadcom had to wait until it felt vmware would be willing to engage the talks got going in early may with a phone call from broadcom chief executive officer hock tan to michael dell who had remained the top shareholder in vmware after the spinoff from his computer business tan a malaysian born entrepreneur who built broadcom into one of the biggest and most diversified chipmakers wanted to sound out dell about interest in a tie up the two men set up a meeting in austin texas there tan made his official pitch he promised to offer a generous premium and deliver value well above that dell seemed receptive to the idea in part because vmware s stock of which he owned 40 hadn t been performing well since the spinoff vmware s board where dell is chairman formed a transaction committee to analyze a possible takeover story continues but if the deal had a slow start the two sides soon made up for lost time once they both agreed to move forward the transaction came together in about two to three weeks in addition to tan and dell the chief negotiators were broadcom software head tom krause and egon durban a partner in private equity giant silver lake the investment firm is a major vmware shareholder and had helped dell s namesake company go private nearly a decade ago vmware was advised by bankers at goldman sachs group inc and jpmorgan chase co broadcom is no stranger to m a the company was the product of a 2016 merger with tan s avago technologies ltd and it has completed several blockbuster deals since then broadcom sped through the process we pride ourselves on having a very clear vision in terms of what we want to do broadcom s krause said in an interview and when we see these opportunities we move quickly advisers were retained and staff hustled to complete diligence to bring together vmware code named verona during the talks with broadcom which went by barcelona the european theme was fitting because dell was in davos switzerland during the final leg of talks broadcom and vmware also held meetings near their silicon valley offices the two companies are based about 20 miles from each other with broadcom in san jose and vmware in palo alto broadcom worked with at least four banks and then brought in two more during the days leading up to the deal those six firms barclays plc bank of america corp citigroup inc credit suisse group ag morgan stanley and wells fargo co ended up agreeing to lend broadcom 32 billion the largest debt financing in more than a year despite the market turmoil punishing tech stocks this month the deal proceeded smoothly and with regular due diligence people close to the talks said it was more of a traditional negotiation than they saw with the last big tech deal this year elon musk s 44 billion takeover of twitter the two sides wanted to move fast to minimize leaks and cope with a volatile market so vmware held off on speaking with other potential bidders according to the people with knowledge of the discussions instead a so called go shop clause was included in the agreement under that provision vmware will be able to solicit competing offers for the next 40 days which is rare in strategic deals of this size that gave vmware s board the comfort that it could proceed both sides agreed to a 1 5 billion breakup fee but vmware only has to pay 750 million if it can find a superior offer by the july 5 deadline having the go shop provision in the agreement made the deal more palatable to vmware and broadcom was willing to live with it it is what it is krause said it s part of a highly negotiated deal there were a lot of trade offs made based on the price and other conditions he said putting in the go shop that seemed like the right balance updates with more on the meetings in the 13th paragraph most read from bloomberg businessweek 2022 bloomberg l p

twenty years ago this week 90 000 barrels of whiskey aging at heaven hill distillery in bardstown kentucky were lost in a massive and tragic fire that when looking at tv news footage resembles a peek into the depths of hell the loss of liquid that day represented 2 percent of the world s whiskey stocks at that time and the destruction of heaven hill s distillery was akin to the death of a family member in the bourbon community it was a 30 million hit for the brand 8 million in lost bourbon 22 million in ruined facilities but no lives were lost nor injuries suffered in the conflagration since the tragedy occurred in 1996 when bourbon s rebound was just beginning it s likely few american whiskey fans outside of kentucky recall the disaster but had a fire happened now when bourbon is booming beyond anyone s expectations the market impact would be staggering and heaven hill s whiskey stocks wouldn t rebound for years the industry came to our rescue if you will says max shapira president of heaven hill his face softens at the memory as he recalls his kentucky bourbon peers stepping up to contract distill the family owned company s products but the times were different shapira resumes adding that distillers were able to help out because their plants were underutilized if something like that happened today to anybody in the industry there wouldn t be enough production capacity to be of any help or enough excess inventory to be of any assistance fire in the sky the change from fall to winter in kentucky can arrive with manic temperature swings and severe storms that describes the weather on the afternoon of nov 7 1996 when thunderstorms rolled through bardstown packing 75 mph wind gusts torrential rains and vivid lightning whether the latter sparked a fire in warehouse no 1 isn t known says shapira for the devastation was so complete that there was little evidence for experts to examine rickhouse fires aren t frequent but when they begin they re nearly impossible to stop as the initial fire burned out of control barrel after barrel of high proof ethanol exploded sending rivulets of flaming whiskey streaming out of the wooden structure as wind whipped flames some reaching 350 feet into the air reached other rickhouses blazing whiskey crept toward others spreading the fire and triggering further explosions with seven of 42 rickhouses on fire a whiskey river formed and flowed downhill into the company s historic distillery erected in 1935 so all consuming was the blaze that firefighters knew it couldn t be extinguished until the supplies of whiskey and those rickhouses wood were exhausted able only to play defense and stop the fire from spreading fire crews trained their hoses on nearby warehouses to keep them cool drew kulsveen master distiller at willet distillery watched the fire from about one third of a mile away he recalls watching the flaming whiskey river flow toward a road and creek that divides his family s property and heaven hill s between them were thickets and trees he feared might feed the fire and send flames climbing the slope to his family s distillery it was awful watching that just something you keep asking yourself am i really seeing this kulsveen said we were seriously scared and thinking the fire could come this far but it turned out not to be a threat melissa swan then an anchor for louisville tv station whas 11 says her helicopter crew first saw the conflagration from 23 miles away handling the voice over for the live coverage swan could hardly believe what she was seeing as the chopper circled the site it was almost like lava flowing down a hillside says swan her challenge was to keep talking about the blaze while getting information about what she and viewers were seeing live i was thinking about the next thing we could report that might be something of some substance but we really didn t quite know what we were looking at thankfully people who knew heaven hill s distillery called in to describe what we saw fortunately for heaven hill its headquarters and bottling plant were located up a hill and a safe distance from the fire and despite the tragedy the next day saw production continue as usual shapira also put a team in place to find jobs for its distillery workers whose workplace was gone we did not miss a day s work shipping and processing to customers all around the world and we didn t lay anyone off he says shapira says the company s strategy for warehousing its aged stocks also helped it avoid severe product shortages tied to the fire by mixing barrels of various ages in each warehouse no particular brand is concentrated and vulnerable to elimination in a fire in any one warehouse you could potentially find some whiskey produced today some three months ago and whiskey that was up to 20 years old he says keeping that broad diversity of whiskey in its warehouses keeps us from facing a large gap in our inventory if something like that were to happen as the company considered plans for rebuilding its distillery representatives of united distillers now diageo approached it about a sale of its bernheim distillery in louisville just 30 minutes away shapira could hardly believe his luck the site was one of the newest distilleries in the bourbon industry and it had the capacity to replace all of heaven hill s lost production from a technological aspect it was state of the art and our master distiller said the stills were perfect for what we wanted to do shapira says it was essentially a turnkey purchase which we made in 1999 symbolic of the brand s recovery from the fire is a new rickhouse set to open in november at the edge of bardstown as the company s largest the building will hold 56 000 barrels of aging whiskey 62 percent of the volume lost in the fire and more than double the size of warehouses it erected as recently as 2011 clearly the bourbon boom continues and it s that sentiment that leaves shapira smiling for us the fire is ancient history a significant event but one in the past he says and just this week the distillery released a select stock 20th anniversary fire edition which we reviewed here all we re concentrating on now is the bourbon renaissance we re pretty excited about that

a poster in seattle promoting an amazon shareholder resolution on plastics geekwire photo todd bishop new numbers reveal an undercurrent of amazon shareholder opposition to the company s board and management on issues including executive pay the environment and working conditions in a regulatory filing friday afternoon amazon disclosed the vote totals from its annual shareholder meeting held wednesday morning there were more close votes than at any other point in amazon s recent history in several cases the outcome would have been reversed if not for the presumptive votes of jeff bezos amazon s founder and executive chairman who has voting power over 12 7 of the company s outstanding stock shareholders came within 6 percentage points of a majority vote opposing compensation packages for amazon s top executives and within 2 points of approving a shareholder resolution calling on the company to pursue new ways to reduce its use of plastic packaging to address ocean pollution a resolution seeking a detailed report on amazon s lobbying activity and spending won 47 of the shareholder vote another requesting an independent audit and report on warehouse working conditions received 44 of the vote the detailed results indicate a degree of discontent that wasn t evident when amazon announced at the wednesday meeting that shareholders approved the company s proposals and rejected a record 15 shareholder resolutions shareholders were more united on the issue of a 20 for 1 stock split the company s first stock split in more than two decades about 84 of outstanding shares were voted in favor of the plan designed to make individual shares more affordable the company says the stock split will be reflected in existing shareholder accounts on or around june 3 and trading will be adjusted for the split starting june 6 amazon shares closed friday at 2 302 93 up more than 3 6 for the day putting its market value at 1 17 trillion shareholder votes are tabulated based on the number of shares cast for or against each proposal with 50 required to pass a resolution amazon s board recommended a vote against each of the shareholder proposals saying it agreed with the sentiment in many cases but had already taken action or disagreed with the proposed means of addressing the issue executive pay the vote on executive pay was advisory and would not have nullified executive compensation packages even if it had received less than 50 support however it s a way for shareholders to express their collective opinion on the matter potentially influencing how the board addresses the issue in the future in an unusual move in advance of the meeting shareholder advisory firms institutional shareholder services and glass lewis both recommended that shareholders vote against the pay packages for executives including amazon ceo andy jassy calling them excessive and misaligned with the company s performance amazon gave an extensive defense and explanation of its compensation practices in its proxy statement saying it believes in giving a modest base salary along with stock grants that naturally rise or fall in value based on trends in the company s share price aligning executives interests with those of shareholders the company pointed out that the vast majority of jassy s compensation package of more than 212 million came from a one time award of 61 000 shares of amazon stock that will vest over 10 years the grant was awarded in conjunction with jassy succeeding bezos as ceo last year see amazon s 2022 proxy statement page 98 for footnotes and other details extraordinary stock grants were also made to amazon worldwide consumer ceo dave clark and amazon web services ceo adam selipsky as part of their appointments to those positions vesting over several years plastic packaging and ocean health the shareholder proposal on plastic packaging waste was filed by shareholder advocacy group as you sow and supported by ocean conservation advocacy organization oceana which estimates that amazon s plastic packaging waste grew by 29 in 2020 to nearly 600 million pounds oceana promoted the resolution in seattle with billboards posters and teams of canvassers the proposal received more than 35 support last year and nearly 49 this year amazon needs to address and stop dodging its plastic problem said matt littlejohn oceana s senior vice president in a statement following the vote the fact that almost 49 of its shareholders are calling on the company to address this issue is clear signal that change needs to happen in advance of the vote the board said in its proxy statement that it has taken action to reduce reliance on the use of plastics in a number of areas including products manufactured by other companies packaging for shipment and delivery our amazon and other private label devices and our physical stores the company has committed to reach net zero carbon by 2040 as part of its climate pledge labor union and safety issues several proposals focused on labor issues they come as amazon faces ongoing unionization efforts in its warehouses and intense scrutiny of injury rates in its fulfillment network the proposal that received 44 of the vote was presented during the meeting by isaiah thomas a worker in the bessemer ala warehouse that has emerged as a flashpoint in the union campaign thomas called amazon s working conditions physically unsustainable abusive and ruthless saying its facilities are more high pressure and dramatically more dangerous than any other warehouses maybe that s why amazon has an estimated employee turnover rate of over 150 he added shareholders you ll have to apply for a warehouse job at this rate investors love to think about their returns but what about the safety of the people who helped you get those returns the proposal called for an independent audit and report of the working conditions and treatment that amazon warehouse workers face including the impact of its policies management performance metrics and targets andy jassy new amazon ceo speaks at the 2021 geekwire summit geekwire photo dan delong addressing a shareholder question about warehouse safety issues during the meeting jassy said he has personally spent time with the numbers and found that there are a lot of ways you can spin that data jassy cited the fact that injury rates are higher for new workers noting that amazon hired 300 000 people in 2021 alone if you look at the industry averages vs our numbers we re a little higher on warehousing and a little lower on messengers and couriers and grocery so about average but i take no solace in being average he said we want to be the best in the industry he cited several company initiatives to improve safety including wearable technology that lets workers know when they re moving in ways that could lead to injuries and algorithms that predict when repetitive actions could cause injuries so that workers can be moved to different activities jassy acknowledged that the company has a lot of work to do here however he added you can bet we re going to be very focused on it judith mcgrath an amazon director since 2014 was previously ceo and chair of mtv networks amazon photo one longtime amazon director judith mcgrath received 78 of the vote in favor of her reelection to the board nominated directors typically receive more than 90 approval glass lewis and new york city officials had lobbied against mcgrath s reelection citing worker treatment and executive pay issues and her role as chair of the amazon board s leadership development and compensation committee amazon issued a statement defending the board s leadership development and compensation committee saying in part that the committee takes its role very seriously and has overseen human capital management during a time when amazon has regularly received recognition as a top employer the company also cited several measures of progress on issues including safety diversity equity inclusion and compensation see amazon s 2022 proxy statement for more details on each proposal and the company s responses update saturday morning brad lander the new york city comptroller issued a statement on the vote results calling the vote on mcgrath a stinging rebuke to amazon s leadership regarding the company s high injury rates unsustainable turnover and

the week of the terrausd ust collapse was among the most painful weeks in crypto history and one we ll reckon with for a long time it wrought havoc on the crypto market resulting in billions of dollars in lost value and while those in washington d c rightly debate next steps a smart thoughtful conversation around potential regulation is critical stablecoins are a vital innovation providing many benefits for users and a competitive advantage for the united states stablecoins improve efficiency in payments and transfers reducing costs and accelerating settlement for businesses and consumers they make the financial system more inclusive by offering open access to anyone anywhere regardless of their background or economic status they can also advance u s geopolitical interests strengthening global dollar dominance in the face of attempts by our adversaries such as china and russia to undermine u s leadership in the financial system jake chervinsky is head of policy at the blockchain association as the name suggests stablecoins are intended to be stable and reliable in general there are two broad categories of stablecoins custodial and decentralized custodial stablecoins are issued by a central administrator and backed by collateral held in a bank or other institution they are usually fully collateralized the issuer holds one dollar in the bank for every one dollar of stablecoins it issues custodial stablecoins represent the vast majority of total stablecoin volume and are very stable and reliable provided the issuer is trustworthy and transparent decentralized stablecoins are designed to address the fact that not all issuers are trustworthy or transparent their goal much like the public blockchains that enable them is to eliminate dependence on trusted intermediaries in the financial system who often do more harm than good they achieve that goal by producing stablecoins that seek to maintain their peg to the dollar through the operation of autonomous code rather than reliance on a central issuer instead of being backed by dollars in a bank decentralized stablecoins are typically backed by other digital assets held programmatically as collateral on the blockchain importantly although custodial and decentralized stablecoins use different models neither is fundamentally better or worse than the other each has unique properties both benefits and risks that combine to form a robust competitive market characterized by consumer choice we should support responsible innovation in both categories read more secure america s financial strength with stablecoins not central banks unfortunately ust was in a category of its own relying solely on an algorithmic mechanism to maintain price stability with no collateral whatsoever a risky model that many predicted might fail so following this month s events how should policymakers respond first as u s treasury secretary janet yellen indicated in congressional testimony on may 12 policymakers should follow the process set forth by president joe biden s executive order eo earlier this year the eo directing federal agencies to study crypto and report on regulatory priorities and solutions provides clear guidance on how to thoughtfully proceed on stablecoin regulation that work is important and ongoing with the help of input from industry stakeholders and trade groups like my employer the blockchain association policymakers should develop a strong understanding of the stablecoin space and the essential differences between various stablecoin designs this is a necessary first step before effective regulation can be formulated second a bipartisan consensus should be developed in congress immediately following ust s collapse congress became entrenched on either side of the aisle over the issue but as my colleague kristin smith recently wrote crypto is too big for partisan politics we need leaders on both sides of the aisle to come together and determine the best regulatory approach for crypto as the president s working group on financial markets pwg recommended in its report on stablecoins last year a regulatory solution must come from congress not from the regulatory agencies third new regulations should be adopted that are fit for the purpose these policies must be balanced and consider the essential nature of dollar dominated stablecoins to u s financial security in the coming decades we need tailored regulatory frameworks that address the specific benefits and risks of stablecoins for custodial stablecoins sen pat toomey r pa and rep josh gottheimer d n j separately proposed tailored frameworks great examples of smart regulatory approaches from both sides of the aisle in the senate and house of representatives with time we can develop similarly well tailored frameworks for decentralized stablecoins too stablecoins present too big an opportunity for us to risk getting them wrong as a matter of policy the u s is in a competitive international race to be the home of web 3 it s time for strategic thought and deliberate action the future of the u s as a hub of global crypto innovation hangs in the balance read more what s the point of stablecoins understanding why they exist this story originally appeared on coindesk

america s financial watchdog is investigating whether elon musk adequately disclosed his purchase of twitter shares last month just as his bid to take over the social media company hangs in the balance a letter from the sec addressed to the tech billionaire said he not appear to have filed the proper form detailing his 9 2 percent stake in twitter required 10 days from the date of acquisition and asked him to provide more information musk s shares made him one of twitter s largest shareholders the letter is dated april 4 and was shared this week by the regulator musk quickly moved to try and buy the whole company outright in a deal initially worth over 44 billion musk sold a chunk of his shares in tesla worth 8 4 billion and bagged another 7 14 billion from investors to help finance the 21 billion he promised to put forward for the deal the remaining 25 5 billion bill was secured via debt financing by morgan stanley bank of america barclays and others but the takeover is not going smoothly now musk must secure 33 5 billion to fund the twitter deal after a 12 5 billion margin loan against tesla stock is set to expire tech stocks have taken a beating due to rising inflation and interest rates and it s looking like even the world s richest man may struggle to pay for the social media giant in an all cash deal musk claims it cannot move forward until the social network proves less than five percent of all users are fake bot accounts which twitter s ceo parag agrawal insists is true twitter however filed a preliminary proxy statement with the sec confirming musk s initial offer to purchase twitter at 54 20 per share in cash twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable it previously said in a statement meanwhile drama among twitter shareholders continues to rise as the company s stock price dips some blame the decrease in share price 40 17 at the time of writing on musk he was sued for allegedly driving down the stock price to try and snag the company at a lower cost than his initial offer or is using this as an excuse to back out of the acquisition altogether twitter s founder and ex ceo jack dorsey has officially left the board egon durban a pro musk board director tried to resign from the panel after shareholders voted to have him removed but his request was rejected by twitter in an sec filing durban is reportedly a supporter of musk s efforts to take twitter private he lost the confidence of twitter stockholders due to him serving on the boards of six other companies already his offer to leave was ultimately rejected while the board does not believe that mr durban s other public company directorships will become an impediment if such engagements were to continue mr durban s commitment to reduce his board service commitment to five public company boards by the remediation date appropriately addresses the concerns raised by stockholders with regard to such engagements twitter said in the filing accordingly the board has reached the determination that accepting mr durban s tendered resignation at this time is not in the best interests of the company
undeterred by tuesday s school shooting a few hundred miles away former president donald trump headlined the national rifle association s annual legislative conference in houston on friday and called for a top to bottom security overhaul at schools across this country in addition to drastically changing the u s approach to mental health it was a welcome message for the embattled nra which has been plagued by scandal and embroiled in litigation had trump skipped the event he would have been in good company texas gov greg abbott pulled out of a planned appearance in favor of a return visit to uvalde texas where a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers in an elementary school tuesday abbott provided pre recorded remarks to the conference which sen john cornyn and rep dan crenshaw of texas also backed out of citing scheduling conflicts unlike some i didn t disappoint you by not showing up trump said at the start of his remarks trump described the uvalde shooting as a savage and barbaric atrocity and called for a moment of silence as he read the names of the 21 victims the former president said those killed are now with god in heaven while the shooter will be eternally damned to burn in the fires of hell trump then laid into president joe biden for urging congress to take up gun safety legislation saying biden s criticism of the gun lobby was really directed at gun owners across the country but trump also called for action arguing there are steps that can be taken to prevent mass shootings while we don t yet know enough about this week s killing we know there are many things we must do he said we need to drastically change our approach to mental health there are always so many warning signs almost all of these disfigured minds share the same profile teachers parents school officials and community members need to be recognizing and addressing these alarm bells promptly and very very aggressively he continued and our school discipline systems instead of making excuses and continually turning a blind eye need to confront bad behavior head on and quickly and clearly we need to make it far easier to confine the violent and mentally deranged into mental institutions in calling for increased school security trump echoed other republicans in suggesting schools must transition to having only a single point of entry implement metal detectors and employ an armed security officer at all times trump also said teachers should be able to be armed on school property if the united states has 40 billion to send to ukraine we should be able to do whatever it takes to keep our children safe at home trump said we spent trillions in iraq trillions in afghanistan and got nothing before we nation build the rest of the world we should be building safe schools for our own children in our own nation right at the same time increased spending security and training preceded the shooting in uvalde where robb elementary school had invested in a significant safety plan the school had hired security officers and erected fencing around the building teachers were under instruction to keep classroom doors locked and students routinely went through drills to prepare for an active shooter those efforts did not prevent tuesday s massacre trump dedicated a significant portion of his speech to boosting the police at one point going so far as to suggest he would no longer feel obligated to defer to state and local governments to respond to protests that turn violent if he were to be president again i would crack down on violent crime like never before he said trump also veered sharply off topic in his campaign style speech as is the case in virtually all of the former president s remarks following his 2020 loss trump decried a rigged election elevating the false claim that widespread voter fraud and malfeasance by election administrators cost him a second term and while those comments were far afield from the debate over gun laws it was an appropriate venue nonetheless few national organizations have been as important to trump s political fortunes as the nra the country s most prominent pro gun rights group in the 2016 presidential election trump won 63 percent to 31 percent among voters who lived in gun owning homes while losing 65 percent to 30 percent among those who didn t as he considers a third bid for the presidency and as other republicans with similar support for gun rights do the same trump has tremendous incentive to tighten his ties to the nra and the gun owners who make up its more than 5 million members in 2019 the last annual meeting of the nra before the coronavirus pandemic trump made the political connection explicit far left radicals in congress want to take away your voice your jobs your rights and they especially want to take your guns he said at the time you know that they want to take away your guns you better get out there and vote from the white house trump delivered prized victories to the gun lobby by nominating supreme court justices neil gorsuch brett kavanaugh and amy coney barrett who have expansive views of the second amendment s protection of the right to bear arms he also nixed an obama era rule adding people with mental illnesses to the national background check system and despite thorough negotiation of potential statutory and executive actions that could be taken to counter mass shootings trump did little to change policy from washington he signed a broader law that strengthened the existing background check system and issued a regulation to ban bump stock devices that make it easier for shooters to fire multiple rounds quickly when he considered pushing to expand background checks to cover many more transactions the nra was quick to deter him likewise his flirtation with supporting a red flag law to take guns away from people deemed to pose a risk did not result in any federal action he made no mention of expanded background checks or red flag laws in friday s address the shootings in texas this week where law enforcement officers waited outside as the gunman shot children and teachers injected an awkward dissonance into trump s long held view that more guns are the answer to mass shootings we know that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun he said at the 2019 nra conference in indianapolis he echoed that line on friday as the age old saying goes the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun trump said have you ever heard that because of secret service protocols surrounding trump s appearance attendees were advised by the nra that they would not be allowed to bring guns into the assembly hall where trump spoke and that there would be no storage available for firearms
the u s centers for disease control has categorized albemarle county charlottesville fluvanna county greene county and nelson county as high transmission areas for covid 19 in the community as of friday listing louisa county as medium the positivity rate in the region is about 14 which is around the same as it was at the onset of the pandemic reaching the united states in march 2020 university of virginia medical center officials report treating 24 patients with covid 19 18 are in acute units four are in the icu and two are in the pediatrics unit uva s covid 19 tracking website shows an average of 16 new cases a week among both students and staff with a 25 6 positivity rate the rate may be misleading as the number of at home covid tests kits makes it easier for people to determine if they may have the virus those who do not test positive are unlikely to report the test findings meaning tests reported to the virginia department of health and the cdc are skewed to positive tests for instance on may 25 72 people were tested for covid with 16 new cases reported on jan 25 550 people were tested and 57 cases were reported dr costi sifri director of hospital epidemiology at uva health said more people are getting the more accurate tests after testing positive for covid 19 on an at home test that may inflate that number sifri said but the chances that somebody who has symptoms will test positive is relatively higher now than it was at other parts of the pandemic sifri said the good news is that the community is at a different place than it was in march 2020 with prevalence of vaccines and both at home and pcr tests sifri said most stocks of at home tests have been quickly replenished we do have a lot more tools now than we did before we have a widely vaccinated population he said according to the cdc covid 19 community levels ratings are the most recent tool designed to help communities and individuals decide what preventive steps to take based on the latest data the levels come with recommended mitigation measures including that people living in high community levels of covid 19 transmission wear masks indoors in public and stay up to date with vaccines testing if they have symptoms additional precautions may be needed for people at high risk for severe illness regardless of community levels the cdc recommends people with symptoms a positive test or exposure to someone with covid 19 should wear a mask masks are also recommended in indoor public transportation settings

the number of oil rigs operating in the u s declined by two to 574 according to oil services giant baker hughes oil prices have risen to the highest level since the end of march due in part because of a decline in u s oil inventories and an expected boost in demand for gasoline as the u s heads into summer the average price for a gallon of gasoline hit an all time high of 4 60 on thursday crude inventories fell by 3 4 million barrels in the week ended may 13 defying forecasts for a build in the oil supply gasoline stocks fell by 4 8 million barrels much larger than the 100 000 barrel decline expected last week crude inventories fell by 2 4 million barrels and gasoline by 5 1 million the supply contraction occurred despite a five million barrel release from the strategic petroleum reserve the decline appears to be due to a fall in the number of offshore louisiana rigs the rig count in louisianna counting both natural gas and oil fell by three texas and oklahoma added one rig each although it is not clear in the data if these were oil or natural gas canada added total of 15 oil rigs in the week the biden administration has said it wants more domestic oil production but until recently it was refusing to auction new leases for federal land even as the administration announced the move however it made clear that it had contempt for fossil fuel companies and regarded them as dangers to the public good

the man at the gun show lifted a 2 2 pound rifle and pulled back the stock with an audible chock presenting it to the youtube segment s host when we set out to produce a small firearm for children in an ar looking package we were pretty sure we needed to have a wow factor in the safety area eric schmid owner of wee 1 tactical said in a video uploaded in january what utah based wee 1 tactical produced was a smaller model of the ar 15 called the jr 15 schmid was in las vegas in january to promote the smaller weapon which the company pledges will look and feel just like mom and dad s gun schmid demonstrated a safety pin intended to keep the weapon s trigger locked he and the host noted that it would likely prevent small children from operating a firearm without their parents present it takes a lot of tension to be able to pull that out said host barret kendrick your 12 year olds are gonna unlock it really quickly schmid replied a bill that passed out of the assembly on thursday night would make the marketing of firearms to children and those not legally allowed to possess them a civil liability ab 1594 would allow lawsuits against gun manufacturers based on their marketing one of the few exemptions to a federal ban on such lawsuits the bill is now in the hands of the senate brought by san francisco democrat phil ting the bill is an attempt to ensure that gun manufacturers can t object in state court to lawsuits that target their marketing an argument smith wesson made in a san diego court last year the proposal is similar to a bill passed last year in new york one that survived a legal challenge from guns rights advocates in federal court on wednesday unfortunately it seems like not a day goes by before there s another tragic mass shooting ting said we have guns in the hands of the wrong people and we have an industry that takes no responsibility for empowering killers in our community the bill alleges that some gun manufacturers market and sell increasingly dangerous new products from ghost guns to bump stocks which give them an unfair business advantage over more responsible competitors if passed the bill would allow the department of justice county attorneys city attorneys and the public to sue over those practices among the practices singled out in the bill are manufacturers that produce guns with features most suitable for assaultive purposes rather than hunting or self defense guns designed sold or marketed in a way that foreseeably promotes their conversion into an illegal weapon such as turning a semi automatic weapon into a fully automatic weapon guns designed sold or marketed to children or people who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms the bill is part of a larger wave of more than a dozen gun control laws proposed by california democrats ahead of today s deadline to move bills from their house of origin on wednesday one day after a man killed at least 21 people with an ar 15 in a shooting at a texas elementary school gov gavin newsom singled out some gun marketing tactics at a press conference rallying support for ab 1594 and other gun control measures you ve got folks out there manufacturing and marketing an ar 15 for babies for babies newsom said and their logo is a pacifier with the baby ar 15 these are extremists they need to be called out newsom seemed to be talking about the jr 15 and wee 1 tactical s logo which is two skulls with a target in one eye and a pacifier in each mouth one skull has a mohawk and the other has pigtails lawsuits against gun manufacturers are prohibited by the protection of lawful commerce in arms act a 2005 law that the nra said at the time was the most significant piece of pro gun legislation in twenty years a portion of a wee1 tactical press release president joe biden has said repealing the law is among his administration s top priorities though his justice department continues to defend the legislation in court the federal law allowed for six exceptions in which lawsuits are allowable against gun manufacturers one of them is for manufacturers who violate state or federal laws governing the marketing or sales of guns the marketing exception to the law allowed parents of children killed in the 2012 sandy hook elementary school massacre to successfully sue remington arms last year a state lawsuit in san diego after a 2019 shooting was allowed to proceed last year on the same basis the survivors of the shooting at a san diego area synagogue argued that smith wesson used marketing that attracted impulsive young men with military complexes who were particularly likely to be attracted to the unique ability of ar 15 style weapons smith wesson responded that the federal law shielded them from such lawsuits but a san diego county superior court judge disagreed citing the marketing exception michael schwartz executive director of san diego county gun owners said the bill and others brought forward by democrats this session are a threat to gun ownership rights throughout california if fully realized and implemented it s an enormous threat to gun rights schwartz said there s no way to stop anyone from using a product illegally but you wouldn t sue ford for someone drinking and driving when it comes to the jr 15 singled out by newsom schwartz said marketing is still directed to the people who can purchase the guns the parents and he said previous laws around regulating the marketing of age limited products like tobacco don t apply to guns i don t know what the perceived fear is but i m not afraid that kids are gonna get addicted to an ar 15 schwartz said it s the most popular long gun in the united states because it functions in all kinds of situations calmatters is a nonprofit

former president donald trump has defended the rights of gun owners in remarks to the national rifle association s annual convention in houston three days after a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school on the other side of the state trump paid tribute to the victims of the texas shooting by reading out each child and teacher s name while bells tolled before he rejected calls for gun control sadly before the sun had even set on the horrible day of tragedy we witnessed a now familiar parade of cynical politicians looking to exploit the tears of sobbing families to increase their own power and take away our constitutional rights trump said former president donald trump speaks at nra conference 9news every time a disturbed or demented person commits such a hideous crime there is always growing effort by some in our society to use the suffering of others to advance their own extreme political agenda trump added evil like the shooter in the texas school massacre is a reason to arm and not disarm one by one leaders like trump took the stage at the nra s annual convention and denounced the texas massacre and one by one they insisted that changing us gun laws or further restricting access to firearms was not the answer we must not react to evil and tragedy by abandoning the constitution or infringing on the rights of our law abiding

the financial markets were anxious about the us core pce inflation data not only are traders laser focused on inflation but they know the pce is the favored inflation indicator for the fed the core pce declined from 5 2 to 4 9 in april while the headline came in at 6 3 vs 6 6 admittedly that is still higher than the fed wants to see but with the economic news this week for the most part pointing to a slowdown of growth confidence and even some chinks in employment see the list of payroll cuts underway at tech giants the hope is it has a corresponding decline in inflation and inflation expectations as well of note today within the economic data today was inventories rose by 2 1 that is the 3rd straight month with gains of inventories of over 2 with the economy in the us shifting more toward services and things like vacations that could be the antidote for supply chain issues of goods if inventories continue to build that could lead to a shift lower prices for some goods also today the michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 58 4 vs 59 1 estimate the sentiment index is the lowest since 2011 the expectation index is also near the low for the year which was the lowest level since 2011 as well so although the consumer may be flush from gains and things like housing in stocks concerns about the levels of the housing market and lower stock prices are having an impact on the margin consumers are not likely to cancel their vacations or not go to that elton john or michael buble concerts but they may downshift other spending habits especially if oil prices remain elevated this weekend there will be a lot of people out for dinner and to check out a movie as top gun is expected to open to large crowds in theaters oh the good ole days having said that the fed is still walking a tightrope as they try to bring the economy down softly still to come us jobs will be released next friday traders will be hoping for a softer number the stock market will be hoping for a softer number we are in an environment where slower economic data is good for stocks at least for now the expectations are for a gain of 325k which is still rather robust with the current unemployment rate at 3 5 qt the fed has not started its bond selling program however the last 3 weeks have seen a decline in the 10 year yield from 3 203 to 2 74 currently at least if the fed is selling treasuries bought in 2020 and 2021 when 10 year yields were between 0 6 and 1 8 they won t be selling them at the high yield from 3 weeks ago at 3 20 but at a lower 2 7 will treasury and mortgage backed selling push yields back to the upside ps at least part of the balance sheet decline will be the maturing of short term issues which there seems to be a decent amount of demand russia ukraine war oil prices rising up 150 is not out of the question as oil supplies remain tight and the risk of a more escalation increases especially if it starts to impact things like food that people rely on to live china and china covid policy the bad news about china covid policy is that they shut down their economies which has the potential to exasperate supply chain issues and inflation the good news is demand for goods seems to be lower apple spoke this week about lower iphone sales that might be a good thing if demand was strong the supply might not been there and could push prices even higher these things and more will have to be worked out in the markets however for this week the focus was on lower inflation lower yields lower stocks and a lower dollar too in the forex market today the nzd was the strongest and the usd was the weakest the strongest to weakest of the major currencies the nzd gain may have been a delayed reaction to 50 basis point hike by the rbnz on wednesday at the meeting in addition to raising rates by 50 basis points they also raised expectations for rates going forward as a reminder in september 2022 the rbnz expects the official cash rate to be 2 68 previous 1 89 by june 2023 the rbnz expects the official cash rate to be 3 88 previous 2 84 in september 2023 the rbnz expects the official cash rate to be 3 95 previous 3 1 that 3 95 is expected to be the peak says the rbnz the peak was previously seen at 3 35 by the rbnz after initially moving higher on wednesday the nzdusd moved lower but found support buyers against the rising 100 hour ma see post here the pattern continued on thursday today however the nzdusd moved up 0 91 it was the biggest mover of the day us dollar selling also contributed as the string of lower inflation type numbers and a general flight out of the safety of the greenback pushed the greenback lower a look at other markets showed spot gold rose 3 16 or 0 17 at 1853 49 spot silver rose 0 11 or 0 5 at 22 10 wti crude oil remains elevated at 115 19 up 1 10 or 0 96 the price bitcoin is trading below the 29 000 level at 28 813 natural gas which traded to a high this week of 9 43 in at the highest level since august 2008 backed off into the weekend and is closing at 8 70 that still higher by 6 73 this week but as i said it could ve been worse in the us stock market the major indices broke there

the trading week 2 year fell 10 3 basis points 5 year fell 8 0 basis points 10 year fell 4 2 basis points 30 year fell 2 0 basis points overall if the mood of investors is measured by things like stock markets and interest rates this week was a good week a great week thank you for you support and your patience with me this week as adam had to deal with a power outage for 3 consecutive days as result of violent storms last sunday he was dealing with all that goes with that so happy days were here again after 7 8 weeks of stocks moving lower and yields mostly moving higher however the mood for humanity continues to be somber as result of the continued russian aggression in ukraine where old young men and women are dying senselessly and as a result of the other senseless killing of nineteen 10 year olds and their two teachers in uvalde texas and the death of 14 in buffalo new york i will never understand the thought process no matter what was written down on a piece of paper nearly 250 years ago i have always said and believed that when my time comes i don t want to remembered by my party affiliation by the country that i was born or even by the religion that i practice i don t affiliate with any particular ideology i just happened to be born in america and my parents were catholic so that s how i was raised i do love my home and country i love my faith but i love something grander what i would like to be remembered as is a person who appreciated that life is a gift from god if you have a different god than mine that s okay i don t care that god gave me this life filled with choices those choices kinda like trades are either this way the right way or that way the wrong way the right way is to love one another the wrong way is to not love one another none of us are perfect and i am in that bucket we all have losing trades there are times when i judge there are times when i choose not to love to hurt someone however if i am truly grateful for this gift called life i can get back on the trend i can attack the good trends in life with a focus on love i will look to enjoy the weekend and i wish you all a love and peace filled weekend as well however i will also remember and pray for the children the men and women young and old that have lost their gift of life early for senseless reasons and for their families who are left with a void that can only be filled with faith love one another

tara moore digitalvision via getty images â it can be terribly dangerous even perilous to assume that because people hold positions of responsibility they are therefore acting responsibly â david mccullough there was a reason i was so concerned last year about stimulus spending kickstarting inflation and bringing the fed back into the picture much earlier than anticipated for the express purpose of fighting inflation raising rates in a good economy is one thing raising rates to fight inflation is quite another if the situation wasn t so concerning i would find the commentary from analysts research firms and some investors comical when they start to talk about the fed and this rate cycle how much is too much and when will the fed start to back off these conversations can only be described as absurd ladies and gentlemen the fed is going to keep raising interest rates for the foreseeable future the end of this cycle will come when inflation is under control the fed will be successful in taming inflation so there is no doubt as to what is going to occur none whatsoever the question and the problem then become at what cost both the economy and the equity markets will reset and that reset will be lower depending on other factors as well that reset is what we are witnessing today i also believe we do not need to get caught up in this notion that inflation is going away quickly my read on the situation today suggests inflation at these levels is here for at least 9 12 months if not at these levels then at levels that are still high 4 6 relative to what we have been accustomed to energy costs are at the heart of the inflation problem and unless someone can tell me then convince me that energy costs are going to come down with present policies in place then i simply can t change my outlook there is no more room for hope and politics howâ s the glass half full no way itâ s not even half empty itâ s been emptied put in the recycling machine and crushed to pieces we have a fed chair talking about a painful period of policy normalization and a treasury secretary telling the public that a soft landing is conceivable with a little bit of skill and luck somebody get us a rabbitâ s foot a lucky horseshoe and some four leaf clovers the fate of the worldâ s largest economy hinges on these lucky charms they need they be reminded of the famous quote â hope is not a strategy â or maybe it should be stop playing politics and deal with reality for investors the reality of the situation is seven straight weeks where the s p 500 finished the week in the red that is the longest streak of weekly losses for the index since march 2001 and just the fourth streak of seven or more weekly losses in the post wwii period itâ s a small sample size but these types of streaks havenâ t occurred during particularly positive periods for the equity market most investors are aware of the root causes of the weakness some deny them and others say they are someone else s fault either way the technical damage in the equity indices has been enormous and it is rare to find an individual stock and or sector in an uptrend it s been a horror show while everyone knows that the u s equity market has performed horribly in 2022 bespoke investment group tells us it has actually been the second worst first 100 trading days in a year since the five day trading week began in late 1952 through early trading yesterday the s p 500 was down 17 3 ytd which ranks second only to 1970 for the worst start to a year when the index declined 23 7 in the first 100 trading days not only that but this year has seen the worst start on record for both the nasdaq and the russell 2000 which have declined by 27 and 21 respectively the equity market is in a relatively unique spot this year as investors question the post covid 19 bull run from late march 2020 through late 2021 extremely low interest rates and covid stimulus powered the market higher but investors have been faced with numerous headwinds over the last six months as the fed attempts to remove stimulus and covid benefits lapse inflation has surged to multi decade highs supply chains remain constrained geopolitical issues have flared and consumer confidence has fallen off a cliff all of that has caused the reset that has been part of the market scene since february resulting in a bear market backdrop for sure we will soon discover whether the stock market is going to predict a typical bear 20 25 or one that lingers and takes stocks down 40 50 that all depends on a series of factors revolving around inflation the week on wall street after the friday afternoon reversal on may 20th the s p followed with more positive price action as trading began on monday gaining 1 8 and closing at 3973 once again the bottom callers were out in force that rally lasted a tad more than one trading day before stocks sold off hard on tuesday more of the typical bear market action as the search for an intermediate bottom continued it was more back and forth action until the sellers took a breather buyers emerged and stocks rallied across the board the s p s posted a gain of 6 for the week breaking its seven week losing streak it was the best week for the index since november 2020 the extremes investors have witnessed have been both frustrating and nerve wracking an unprecedented rally off of pandemic lows to one of the worst starts to a year in history followed by reflex rallies that take everyone by surprise all of the major indices posted strong gains as the djia s eight week losing streak also came to an end what comes next is anyone s guess and for those that wish to make forecasts on what we have seen recently i wish them the best of luck the economy april data from the chicago fed showed economic activity remained robust in the month chicago national fed activity index was 0 47 in april up from 0 36 in march production indicators were the biggest contributor to the

candidates for purchase where the fundamentals and the technical pictures are aligned giving any investor a higher probability of success on a median basis these stocks have gained 12 7 ytd and are trading 8 8 above their 50 day moving average over the last five days these stocks have gained an average of 5 7 i invite you to take a look at this and other research i provide in my savvy investor marketplace service food for thought ok i get it it s all about the transition to electric vehicles and lithium is the white gold for the ev transition as we forge ahead with the agenda it is noteworthy that the u s produces 1 of the world s supply while the us has a supply of this material the ominous regulatory burdens make it difficult to get this crucial element out of the ground in addition no one wants a mine in their backyard and the thacker pass proposal and other projects have been stalled by lawsuits and opposition from environmentalists permitting delays and opposition from native american tribes in the area the ny times also noted that lithium mining isn t so green friendly so while the greenies march to the drumbeat of an all electric environment void of all fossil fuels it s apparent they have failed to place the pieces of the puzzle in the right order as this parade continues it is becoming increasingly apparent that once again the u s will be totally dependent on others to provide the white gold for this transition since there has been little progress in developing domestic production u s lithium imports increased by 70 in q1 none of this is new anyone that has a shred of common sense saw all of this as a failed transition from the day it was announced if these issues aren t resolved and resolved quickly the entire green movement will remain in the starting block no matter what is being preached so not only have policies caused an inflationary environment that has the global economy looking at a recession the so called savior of the human race will be stuck at the starting gate make no mistake this botched journey has more issues than just lithium it s estimated that the average electric vehicle requires an additional 400 pounds of aluminum aluminum is made from bauxite and china produces more aluminum than any other region of the world but it has to rely on coal to do so evs also use more copper generally speaking evs use almost three times more copper than combustion engine vehicles with the acceleration of evs charging infrastructure will also expand and that adds more demand for copper as well this agenda wouldn t be so flawed if it didn t involve the existing energy platforms that are needed today and will continue to be needed for a long time to keep the economy moving ahead unfortunately this electrification plan is ill conceived and patently absurd as proposed i ll say what other authors won t it s based on a lack of common sense and total dismissal of science and facts surely these issues can be overcome but not with the policies in place today and not with the continued dependence on others to make it happen it s apparent the mistakes that keep america reliant on others continue to be repeated over and over in what can only be called sheer insanity so until there is a change in the agenda it won t happen at the lightning speed that this foolish plan calls for what s worse unless there is genuine acknowledgement that fossil fuels will be needed to keep the economy going inflation and sub par growth remains in our future no doubt about it eventually this transition occurs over a long period of time from an investment standpoint the strategy is crystal clear the companies that produce materials will be in demand for a long time as well the daily chart of the s p 500 spy the long awaited bounce has finally arrived the s p has put together a nice 8 rally off of the may 20th intraday low s p 500 5 27 www freestockcharts com in what seems to be a replay of the march rally there is still more room for the rally to continue before more overhead resistance enters the scene in the 4250 4300 range whether this is a mere counter trend bear market rally or the rejuvenation of the secular bull market is yet to be determined investment backdrop we ve had a rough 6 months and the technical charts i use to assist my strategy leave me pondering what comes next despite the late week price action i haven t seen any sign of a definitive bottom in place so far all of the bearish sentiment has been correct the indices have all followed a path to lows on the back of what has been the poorest sentiment reading we have witnessed in quite some time at some point something has to give just as it seemed as though whatever could go right went right in late 2020 and early 2021 everything that can go wrong has gone wrong these days finding something positive feels a bit like grasping at straws but one thing working in the marketâ s favor for a change is seasonality bespoke investment group provided the graphic that depicts the favorable seasonality issue as we entered may and so far that positive seasonality trend hasn t worked out perhaps the late week rally is our first indication of a change in the investment backdrop may seasonality www bespokepremium com the image above shows the s p 500â s median one week one month and three months returns from the close on 5 19 over the last ten years not much is working only energy commodities and healthcare are trading above their long term trend lines and this is the area where the uninterrupted bull market resides today all of the other sectors are now questionable certainly in pause mode and possibly ready to turn into full blown bear mode from an economic viewpoint other factors could tip the scales and turn this market scene into an event oil prices continue higher inflation moves higher double digits and or stays at this level for months all while growth slows and stagflation is the order of the day so what should we do i continue to exercise the rarest commodity on wall street patience eventually this stance shall change and i can become much more aggressive towards stocks either up or down hopefully i will be able to recognize that change when it occurs in the meanwhile those investors traders attempting to force trades for the most part are losing money as a savvy market observer once opined â there are two rules on wall street 1 donâ t lose money 2 donâ t forget rule number 1 â finally if this turns out to be a full blown bear market event prices are going to go much lower this last month or so represents the beginning of the decline the first warning signs and the technicals have deteriorated quickly so the backdrop suggests this is a very fluid situation that is evolving rapidly thank you for reading this analysis if you enjoyed this article so far this next section provides a quick taste of what members of my marketplace service receive in daily updates if you find these weekly articles useful you may want to join a community of savvy investors that have discovered how the market works the 2022 playbook is now lean and mean yes that is correct except for energy commodities and healthcare my message for over 6 weeks now to clients and members of my service my canary message regarding the financials transports semiconductors and small caps became the tell for the near term strategy they have sent their messages for the economy there will be times when they appear to be revived but until there is a decided swing in the technical picture where rallies take out resistance levels caution is advised we saw evidence of life in the canaries as they rallied to end the week and did manage to take out short term resistance levels in the process now we wait to see if this move has staying power fixed income i closed out a trade in the short 20 year treasury etf tbt that was established in march for a 34 gain these are the types of situations that can be uncovered to help make an investor s year sectors energy i ve pounded the table for the energy sector and it remains one of the areas of the market that is in a bullish pattern i have had a few people write to tell me asking if itâ s now â too lateâ to buy commodities and commodity related stocks in areas such as energy and natural resources i donâ t think it is at all as i have mentioned previously these groups have been out of favor for years energy materials are still undervalued despite the s p 500 energy sector currently up almost 50 year to date many seem to feel they have â missed the move â however i believe the move may only be getting started in not only energy but basic materials natural resources too materials have the lowest p e ratio over the last 12 months while energy has the lowest forward p e ratio outside of utilities which has the highest peg ratio thanks to the lowest expected growth rate energy is also trading with a p s under 1 and the lowest p fcf surprisingly it also now has the highest eps growth rate over the past 5 years too when i add it all up i think when looking for investments energy and materials should continue to be the first areas to explore commodity stocks largely topped relative to the rest of the market back in 2008 but the mass exodus out of them accelerated after the last â bustâ in commodities around 2011 2014 investors at that point ran from these stocks and flocked into the â high growthâ oftentimes speculative areas and big tech here is a group that has been shunned and during that time supplies haven t been increased due to little to no capex spending with demand still high and supply still lacking commodity prices will likely stay on the higher side despite the global energy crisis western powers are still not ready to concede their efforts to make the transition to â clean energyâ and many have doubled down on their â fight against climate changeâ ideology despite soaring energy costs that is not likely to change anytime soon either at least not without much higher prices first that force their hands companies that want to invest in projects to bring on new energy supplies are frequently running into a stiff government regulatory environment to do so at the same time as the fed raises interest rates to fight inflation it makes it even more costly for companies to fund the new projects that are allowed creating yet another barrier to boosting supply without an increase in supply the only other â solutionâ for higher prices seems to be another prolonged recession that will kill demand iâ m not talking about a â recessionâ when we just have two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth i mean a real recession the kind where millions lose their jobs and bankruptcies and mortgage defaults skyrocket that kind of scary slowdown may eventually force a reversal in energy policy if a real recession is going to be what â curesâ high commodity prices i think prices first go higher or stabilize at high levels anyway given the currently tight job market and a strong desire among consumers to travel after being locked away for much of the past two years i therefore donâ t think energy and resources are necessarily reliant on inflation numbers continuing to go up they should have their tailwinds so no i donâ t think itâ s â too lateâ to buy these companies even though they will certainly have pullbacks that likely make it look like their trends have ended and many of them are still very attractively valued with dividends that are some of the best in the s p 500 universe healthcare besides energy and commodities the healthcare sector remains in a long term bullish configuration the daily chart indicates another successful test of the lower end of the trading range is complete as the healthcare etf xlv has rallied 5 off that recent low within the sector i like the big pharma names that pay solid dividends and unlike many other stocks they remain in bull mode abbv pfe mrk jnj and a host of others are in solid long term trends semiconductors i always watch the semiconductor index for indications of where the general market is headed or when it may turn while it doesn t look like it there has been a slight outperformance in the soxx relative to the overall market and it s been that way since mid april in this recent decline the march 21 lows have held and perhaps are signaling a turn on thursday we saw a complete reversal in near term sentiment after nvidia nvda reported earnings what was originally viewed as a negative outlook turned into a 3 gain for the stock moving the semiconductor etf soxx up 3 as well however we ve seen rally attempts fail and if this range does not hold then it s a long way down to the pre covid 19 highs that can be used as a target for any bearish forecast now this week was certainly a positive development for the group china the chinese stocks etfs that caught my attention in march when jpmorgan announced that china was uninvestable continue to form a nice basing pattern despite the etf being in a protracted downtrend kweb has gone 52 trading days without making a new low thatâ s the longest streak since late november alibaba baba jd com jd the csi 300 ashr and the china internet etf kweb are all worthy of research as a simple reversion to the mean in these beaten down names can produce an outsized gain in 22 cryptocurrency crypto markets have been taking a breather relative to the roller coaster that was the prior week but the notion that bitcoin is a risk on trade was challenged this week while the equity market posted a strong late week rally most of the crypto space has posted further declines conditions remain deeply oversold which has historically not been a signal for upside mean reversion and stronger than normal returns as would be the case for many other assets new lows would also mark a significant development from a long term technical perspective bitcoin last 5 years www bespokepremium com the above chart shows a 5 year look at bitcoin with potential retracement levels as shown the declines of the past two weeks have brought btc down to a retracement level which also traces to other prior lows of the past year and a half although that support has appeared to have held for the moment a break below those levels would leave bitcoin in a bit of no manâ s land assuming it breaks lower the next support level to watch could be the late 2017 early 2018 peaks 19k marking about a 76 retracement of the post pandemic rally aggressive traders should be inclined to short the crypto sector final thoughts stocks don t go up forever nor do they go down forever right now investors are just looking for some sort of balance so they can catch their breath if the may 20th low turns out to be an intermediate bottom we can expect to see plenty of starts and stops as the rebuilding process begins that process can also include a possible retest of the lows with so many sectors and stocks in bear market trends my strategy remains laser focused on the areas of the market that are in bull mode they continue to serve as market leaders a moment of silence please for the families of the victims that were involved in the robb elementary school shooting in uvalde texas a very special thank you to all who have served this country happy memorial day postscript please allow me to

the tentative agreement ta between chevron and the united steel workers usw is a sellout all down the line workers have been on strike for two months to fight the cut in real wages contained in the national oil bargaining agreement this agreement which is now part of the deal the usw is presenting to workers increases wages by only 12 percent over four years with inflation at over 8 percent in a single year this means workers will see a real wage cut of as much as 20 percent over the life of the contract chevron is reaping all the benefits of this rise in costs on thursday the day the news of the ta was broken by reuters the shares of chevron reached their all time high chevron is feasting on the pain and suffering experienced by millions at the gas pumps over the last few months the company now boasts a 350 billion market capitalization striking chevron workers only the most deceitful economist could claim there is no money to address striking workers needs preliminary reports on the contract make clear that the ta is a slap in the face to workers there is no signing bonus according to reuters nothing fundamental has been done to address rising health care costs and critically no serious agreements have been made by chevron to end its abusive work schedule and adequately staff the plant a principal concern of workers by agreeing to this ta the united steel workers is just confirming what thousands of oil workers across the country are beginning to realize they are not on the side of oil workers whatever fiery language the usw cooks up for its pep rallies it was the usw that from the start sought to prevent a unified movement of oil and gas refinery workers three months ago usw president thomas conway was given his marching orders from president biden in a closed door meeting on february 24 there was to be no national oil strike and everything would be done to prevent local strikes biden told the usw biden knew that a national oil strike would garner immense sympathy in the working class galvanizing millions of workers angry at inflation and undermining plans to escalate the united states confrontation with russia in what has now become a proxy war with ukraine as the battlefield refinery workers are livid about this contract after meeting with biden usw officials flew across the country to systematically batter down any opposition in billings montana at the phillips 66 plant workers voted the sellout contract down usw leadership was then flown out to browbeat workers in a series of informational meetings to vote yes workers were intimidated with threats that should they strike the company would be free to fire them the contract barely passed on the second vote at valero s refinery in sunray texas 350 workers voted down the agreement the usw tried to palm off on them which contained within it the national agreement above all they wanted to fight against changes in work assignments and schedules that would make their job more exhausting and dangerous the role of the usw can be best summarized in conway s own words a few days after getting his orders from biden conway proudly boasted that the responsible contract worked out between the usw and the oil companies would not add to inflationary pressures the statement which was released as part of a bellicose press release pledging usw s support for the war drive essentially meant this contract is a sellout for workers and won t in any way touch the profits of big oil so don t blame the usw for high oil prices the usw has barely spoken about the chevron strike because they oppose it and want it to be shut down as soon as possible in richmond where gas is 6 a gallon workers twice voted down the contract presented to them by the usw the usw is now hoping that workers are demoralized enough from their isolated strike with no strike pay to force through the agreement there is a way for workers to win what they are fighting for chevron and the oil companies cannot be bargained with they refuse to adequately staff these massive dangerous refineries and they insist on driving down wages while they make record stock market gains a genuine struggle requires breaking through the isolation the usw has imposed on all refinery workers throughout the united states richmond workers and refinery workers across the country are not alone their attempts to oppose this attack on them by the oil companies comes as millions of other workers in the united states and internationally are waging their own struggles against understaffing low wages inflation and attacks to medical and retirement benefits workers need new organizations that can represent them in a genuine united struggle against the oil companies workers in texas california montana and elsewhere have formed an oil workers rank and file committee owrfc the owrfc is an organization of by and for the workers independent of the trade unions and their political allies in the democratic and republican parties the owrfc calls on richmond refinery workers to vote no on this rotten contract this however is only the beginning a rejection of the contract must be the beginning of a mobilization of all oil and gas workers in a common fight the strike at richmond must be expanded with a clear list of demands raised as the basis of a coordinated fight these demands should include a 40 percent raise and the restoration of cost of living adjustments cola restoration of the 8 hour day expansion of paid time off including a six week vacation during the first year of service and one month of paid paternity leave fully paid medical benefits the hiring of more full time workers the establishment of worker run health and safety committees and the abolition of corrupt joint labor management committees workers control over production rates and input over capital expenditures fully paid pensions and retiree medical benefits after 25 years of service the elevation of contractors to full time positions with the same pay and benefits workers at richmond should further demand that the the strike continue with full strike pay paid from the coffers of the usw which has over 168 million in cash on hand no striking workers or their families should suffer when the union has tens of millions of dollars it could easily make available workers must have adequate time to read and discuss the ta workers need the full agreement in their hands for at least five days so no tricks or fine print can be pulled there must be no end to the strike until a vote to officially end it has taken place oil refinery workers as a whole must fight for a reopening of the national oil contract free from the bullying and intimidation of the usw a national strike of oil workers would be a powerful force that would immediately win the support of workers throughout the us and around the world vote no on chevron usw sellout tentative agreement rally the tens of thousands of oil workers to

the man at the gun show lifted a 2 2 pound rifle and pulled back the stock with an audible chock presenting it to the youtube segment s host when we set out to produce a small firearm for children in an ar looking package we were pretty sure we needed to have a wow factor in the safety area eric schmid owner of wee 1 tactical said in a video uploaded in january what utah based wee 1 tactical produced was a smaller model of the ar 15 called the jr 15 schmid was in las vegas in january to promote the smaller weapon which the company pledges will look and feel just like mom and dad s gun m g perez kpbs a line of children bear signs opposing gun violence at a rally outside of the george r brown convention center which is hosting the nra annual meeting in houston on may 27 schmid demonstrated a safety pin intended to keep the weapon s trigger locked he and the host noted that it would likely prevent small children from operating a firearm without their parents present it takes a lot of tension to be able to pull that out said host barret kendrick your 12 year olds are gonna unlock it really quickly schmid replied a bill that passed out of the assembly on thursday night would make the marketing of firearms to children and those not legally allowed to possess them a civil liability ab 1594 would allow lawsuits against gun manufacturers based on their marketing one of the few exemptions to a federal ban on such lawsuits the bill is now in the hands of the senate brought by san francisco democrat phil ting the bill is an attempt to ensure that gun manufacturers can t object in state court to lawsuits that target their marketing an argument smith wesson made in a san diego court last year the proposal is similar to a bill passed last year in new york one that survived a legal challenge from guns rights advocates in federal court on wednesday unfortunately it seems like not a day goes by before there s another tragic mass shooting ting said we have guns in the hands of the wrong people and we have an industry that takes no responsibility for empowering killers in our community the bill alleges that some gun manufacturers market and sell increasingly dangerous new products from ghost guns to bump stocks which give them an unfair business advantage over more responsible competitors if passed the bill would allow the department of justice county attorneys city attorneys and the public to sue over those practices among the practices singled out in the bill are manufacturers that produce guns with features most suitable for assaultive purposes rather than hunting or self defense guns designed sold or marketed in a way that foreseeably promotes their conversion into an illegal weapon such as turning a semi automatic weapon into a fully automatic weapon guns designed sold or marketed to children or people who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms the bill is part of a larger wave of more than a dozen gun control laws proposed by california democrats ahead of today s deadline to move bills from their house of origin on wednesday one day after a man killed at least 21 people with an ar 15 in a shooting at a texas elementary school gov gavin newsom singled out some gun marketing tactics at a press conference rallying support for ab 1594 and other gun control measures you ve got folks out there manufacturing and marketing an ar 15 for babies for babies newsom said and their logo is a pacifier with the baby ar 15 these are extremists they need to be called out newsom seemed to be talking about the jr 15 and wee 1 tactical s logo which is two skulls with a target in one eye and a pacifier in each mouth one skull has a mohawk and the other has pigtails lawsuits against gun manufacturers are prohibited by the protection of lawful commerce in arms act a 2005 law that the nra said at the time was the most significant piece of pro gun legislation in twenty years president joe biden has said repealing the law is among his administration s top priorities though his justice department continues to defend the legislation in court the federal law allowed for six exceptions in which lawsuits are allowable against gun manufacturers one of them is for manufacturers who violate state or federal laws governing the marketing or sales of guns the marketing exception to the law allowed parents of children killed in the 2012 sandy hook elementary school massacre to successfully sue remington arms last year a state lawsuit in san diego after a 2019 shooting was allowed to proceed last year on the same basis the survivors of the shooting at a san diego area synagogue argued that smith wesson used marketing that attracted impulsive young men with military complexes who were particularly likely to be attracted to the unique ability of ar 15 style weapons smith wesson responded that the federal law shielded them from such lawsuits but a san diego county superior court judge disagreed citing the marketing exception michael schwartz executive director of san diego county gun owners said the bill and others brought forward by democrats this session are a threat to gun ownership rights throughout california if fully realized and implemented it s an enormous threat to gun rights schwartz said there s no way to stop anyone from using a product illegally but you wouldn t sue ford for someone drinking and driving when it comes to the jr 15 singled out by newsom schwartz said marketing is still directed to the people who can purchase the guns the parents and he said previous laws around regulating the marketing of age limited products like tobacco don t apply to guns i don t know what the perceived fear is but i m not afraid that kids are gonna get addicted to an ar 15 schwartz said it s the most popular long gun in the united states because it functions in all kinds of situations

it s planting season and all around the indiana countryside the land is being readied for the hottest new crop it s not a new strain of corn or soybean but thousands of acres of solar panels in almost every direction on a rolling rocky stretch of farmland in clinton county north of frankfort bulldozers are smoothing the earth for a new 1 800 acre solar farm for utility aes indiana that could provide enough electricity to power more than 30 000 homes in randolph county east of muncie workers from edp renewables llc completed the construction of a 1 400 acre solar farm in january and are getting ready to sell the electricity under a 20 year power purchase agreement to hoosier energy cooperative for communities in indiana and illinois and in northwest indiana engineers are developing plans to install panels across a whopping 13 000 acres on a 1 5 billion project straddling starke and pulaski counties the huge project aptly named mammoth solar will generate enough electricity to power 70 000 homes developer doral renewables of israel will sell the power under a long term agreement to american electric power in columbus ohio in all at least 15 indiana solar farms of 1 000 acres or more are slated to go online by 2024 with several more in various stages of development many rural landowners are rolling out the welcome mat attracted by the promise of rich long term leases that sometimes pay five times an acre what they get from farmers cash strapped communities too are finding a new way to boost their property tax base and pay for road paving or fire departments indiana is riding a wave of solar energy due to surging demand from customers and falling prices for solar panels and it s just getting started over the next five years indiana is expected to install 6 7 gigawatts of solar capacity enough to power more than 5 million houses and that would catapult indiana to fourth place in the nation for solar growth behind only texas california and florida according to the solar energy industries association based on publicly announced projects indiana was very near the bottom not that long ago with less than a half a percent of our whole generation portfolio from solar said steve eberly executive director of hoosiers for renewables a statewide advocacy organization things are certainly changing by the end of 2021 that figure had nearly doubled to 0 92 still modest but the beginnings of what could be a tsunami in solar farms across the state it s growing exponentially said doug gotham director of the state utility forecasting group at purdue university indiana is definitely on an upswing meeting opposition now the question is whether indiana can hold the pace as some communities and landowners push back against an explosion in solar farms some farmers say that renewable developers are pushing too hard gobbling up tens of thousands of acres of land that could be used for other purposes and in the process littering the countryside with what they consider unsightly projects they say communities should be more selective in approving projects i don t agree with taking prime farmland out of the equation especially with food prices going up food insecurity starting to go up said kyle barlow a fourth generation farmer who grows corn soybeans pumpkins and sunflowers on his 1 000 acre shelby county farm i don t feel it s a good use of the land at all he opposed new york based ranger power s 1 900 acre speedway solar project near morristown which shelby county officials approved in 2019 and he has been one of the most vocal opponents of a second project a solar farm proposed by utah based spower near the small town of bengal about 10 miles southwest of shelbyville earlier this month barlow won a primary election for shelby county council following a grassroots campaign heavily focused on controlling the growth of renewable energy projects near homes and adjoining farms i think we should look for other places for solar if we really need that energy he said pointing to brownfields parking lots airports and interstate medians as possible sites counties are also flexing their muscles to protect their right to approve projects last year a group of counties was able to sink a proposed state law that would have set statewide standards on setbacks heights and other facets of renewable energy projects the bill was meant to address a major concern of large renewable developers who said they must deal with a hodgepodge of regulations across indiana s 92 counties rather than one state standard in setting up large projects but county commissioners said the bill would have taken away their ability to decide which projects would fit into their communities this year state lawmakers passed a watered down version of the bill adding incentives for local governments the big difference this time the state standards were voluntary challenges slow some progress and there s another bump in the road perhaps a substantial one this one coming out of washington d c earlier this year the biden administration s commerce department launched an investigation into whether chinese companies have been circumventing u s tariffs on solar panels by secretly producing solar cells with chinese parts in cambodia malaysia vietnam and thailand those four countries supply more than 80 of the most popular types of solar modules used in the united states if the investigation finds that china illegally steered its solar panels through those four countries that could amount to a trade violation that could result in steep penalties in the meantime hundreds of solar projects in the u s have been canceled or delayed as solar companies scramble for supplies due to a near shutdown in the supply chain the industry is essentially frozen leah stokes a political scientist at the university of california santa barbara told the new york times it s already leading to layoffs to say nothing of the impact on our climate goals already indiana is feeling the first tremors on may 5 merrillville based utility northern indiana public service co said it would delay retirement of its largest coal fired power plant the schahfer generating station in wheatfield by two years because of the federal investigation it s a sudden about face for the company which had said in 2019 it would retire four of its five remaining coal fired units within five years and generate 65 of its power from wind solar and other renewables by 2028 but now the solar tariff probe is leading to uncertainties for solar projects say officials at the utility s corporate parent nisource the investigation by the u s commerce department related to the import of solar components from certain countries has brought uncertainty and delays to the solar panel market nisource chief strategy and risk officer shawn anderson said in a conference call with investors we along with others in the industry continue to advocate for an expeditious resolution to this investigation no other indiana utility has yet made similar comments that indicate an abrupt retrenchment duke energy indiana which currently operates about 21 megawatts of solar power has said it wants to build or buy projects that generate an additional 4 525 megawatts of solar power over the next 20 years but it has not given details on where those projects might be located only saying it has requested bids on projects and it s up to the third party developer to decide where to locate them so not only can t it say where the projects will be located but it also can t say whether the tariff investigation might slow them down where we are in the process right now we haven t seen the bids yet said kelley karn vice president of regulatory affairs and policy for duke energy indiana so we re not aware of whether that s going to be a significant issue or not yet andrés gluski president and ceo of virginia based aes corp the parent of aes indiana told analysts in a may 6 conference call that the investigation could have a very deleterious effect on the whole solar industry in the u s but he added the company doesn t expect a slowdown in projects sooner than the second half of next year and predicted the case would be dismissed within months this is not going to stop us he said in indiana aes has two big solar projects under way one is the clinton county project called hardy hills which will stretch across union and owen townships and include 581 594 solar panels making it one of the largest solar farms in the state the other is a 250 megawatt solar farm in pike county near its petersburg generating station located about 125 miles southwest of downtown indianapolis that project is scheduled to come online in 2024 and power the equivalent of 45 000 homes during peak hours booming all over aes indiana officials said indiana s boom in solar might be significant in scale but other states are seeing big upswings in solar farms as well across the united states solar has been the most dominant most added form of new capacity for the last three years said kristina lunda president of aes indiana so everywhere across the u s in all 50 states solar is growing very fast two primary factors are driving the solar boom on one side is the falling cost of solar power solar energy prices dropped from 369 to 40 a megawatt hour between 2009 and 2019 far lower than the cost of coal 109 or natural gas 56 according to a 2020 study by michael hicks an economist at ball state university indiana is in the midst of an historical shift in fuel use he said in his report the shift he said would make indiana more attractive to firms and households that favor lower prices and fewer emissions the other major factor is demand major corporations including indiana s eli lilly and co and cummins inc have said they want to sharply cut their carbon footprint and are putting pressure on energy providers to ramp up capacity last year lilly opened a 16 acre solar farm near one of the drugmaker s manufacturing plants in kinsale ireland the farm was developed by lilly partner enerpower which designed built and will maintain the farm lilly said the farm will generate almost 6 000 megawatts of power over a year equivalent to reducing 2 350 tons of carbon an additional 10 acres of solar panels are being added nearby and will be put in operation in the second half of 2022 lilly is also constructing with partners small solar farms in france spain and puerto rico and has solar arrays in use at facilities in italy india california and new jersey the company said it is also investigating potential locations for solar panel arrays at its headquarters complex in indianapolis if it sounds like indiana will soon be producing more than enough electricity to power most of the households across the state it s not a bad guess indiana is on track to install enough solar capacity by 2027 to power more than 5 million houses but of course electricity does not stay in one place the large utilities that are developing or buying power from the massive solar farms say all those electrons will go onto the grid and at that point carmel based midcontinent independent system operator the organization responsible for managing the power grid across indiana 14 other states and the canadian province of manitoba decides where to route the energy throughout the region and at what price all of the energy from our generation facilities go into miso said lund of aes indiana and then miso determines the way that plants get dispatched to both ensure reliability and then also ensure the lowest cost across the system so electricity generated in the rural countryside of indiana can end up as far south as louisiana and as far north as canada but still solar advocates say it is not only good for reducing carbon emissions but can generate millions of dollars in economic development for local communities hoosiers for renewables website is full of success stories how wind and solar projects have generated windfalls to fund schools first responders road paving programs and the like a single 50 megawatt renewable energy project like a solar energy farm can generate more than 1 million in property tax revenue per year the website says that s new money for schools road improvements and other essential services eberly the group s executive director and a former warren county commissioner said he quickly learned of the benefits while trying to improve services in his community located just west of purdue university many of the roads he said are dirt and gravel but that is changing i saw firsthand what the influx of a 200 million utility scale solar project can do he said we ve created for the first time ever a paving fund whereby we can pave key roads to encourage residential growth i think it s been a good thing he said many of our residents agree read more innovation issue stories

go ahead and ask bob malone about anything related to manomet s priscilla beach theatre from the literal nuts and bolts of the extensively restored buildings at the site to the shows for the season that kicked off april 29 whatever your question his answer is bound to be equal parts instant and enthusiastic i love every aspect of it malone the theater s owner said during a recent tour of the property malone grew up in the neighborhood around the theater he started hanging out there when he was 13 i d do whatever they wanted me to do he said the chief they was geronimo sands the 50 year artistic director of the theater who purchased it from pbt founder franklin trask in 1960 when sands born jim lonigro was barely into his 20s more geronimo sands dies at 79 while malone tried his hand at acting a skill he said that turned out not to be in his blood he continued filling whatever role was asked of him whether on stage or behind the scenes malone entered his later teens graduating in 1981 from plymouth carver regional high school he went on to earn his bachelor s degree in economics at framingham state university and completed his mba at northeastern he founded the it company leapfrog systems in 2000 which he eventually sold in 2020 more asgn inc plans to acquire leapfrog his success allowing him to come in and save the theater when he bought it from sands in 2013 is a direct result of the lessons he learned from working there there s a broad set of skills you learn from acting and working in a theater he said such as discipline working with others and seeking to constantly improve one s skills his purchase of pbt from sands came at a dark time for the theater sands had remortgaged the property to help his ailing sister with her medical bills the barn had fallen into disrepair and had been condemned the theater mostly focused on children s programs and used a smaller space in another building to hold performances that space has since been christened as the geronimo sands black box theatre he was looking for a buyer but didn t find anyone malone said out of a love of the theater the neighborhood the acting community and especially sands malone purchased the property and its associated buildings for over 500 000 more priscilla beach theatre restoration it s the worst investment i could ever make he said his return on investment from the purchase has been rewarding just not in any way to do with money this is a labor of love he said that love was felt by sands this is a sacred act sands who died in 2020 at age 79 said in a 2013 interview and he is an angel malone sees himself as a guardian but not of the angelic sort i m just the current guardian of this wonderful place he said i hope there s someone who will come after me to take on that role new life for an old barn the barn was built in 1875 as a working structure by its original owner dr franklin trask purchased the property and opened the new barn theatre concept in 1937 his wife agnes became pbt s first artistic director trask was brilliant and artistic malone said he turned this into a true theatre colony when summer stock was everything there wasn t any netflix in addition to the 240 seat barn theater the original complex included several cottages residences dormitories a mansion carriage house and athletic field under sands subsequent guidance the theater became a training ground for a host of well known actors in the 1960s and beyond including rob reiner al brooks and paul newman geronimo put his heart and soul into this theater malone said undeterred by the repeated claims of contractors that nothing could be done with the barn malone held to his faith that wasn t the case i eventually found a company that specialized in historic barn restorations he said new owner same vision even after nearly a decade of successful maintenance and operation of the theater malone casts himself as a pale comparison to sands i m the exact opposite of geronimo sands mallone said he was larger than life and i m the boring accountant type despite his self assessment malone exudes enthusiasm in discussing every aspect of the theatre the theater buff in him is equally matched by his excitement in giving a detailed explanation of everything that has been repaired restored and replaced in an expensive process that nonetheless took only two years to complete from engineering to construction ninety percent of the structural components including the roof beams had to be replaced but much of the original planks have been preserved malone explained more priscilla beach theatre s barn theater is back restored the restoration project involved everything from pulling in the barn s walls which were leaning out to installing a state of the art microphone system for actors and a communication system so everyone involved in the production can talk to each other to ensure that shows go off without a hitch most everything is still wood and even the original wagon wheel chandelier that hung from the rafters has been restored and returned to its place of honor it was a playground malone said of pbt in 2013 after first acquiring it there are so many nooks and crannies in the barn theater it s a wonderland if you re a kid we made ourselves a permanent fixture some important aspects of the original barn remained intact through the process the backstage and basement walls are covered in names and messages written in markers malone said far from being any sort of graffiti the walls are a living history of the performers and stagehands who have been a part of the theater over the years my own signature from 1976 is on the wall behind all those tools he said pointing to a side room backstage with various tools and equipment welcome to 2022 the late april to october season is underway its first production sisters of swing a tribute to the andrews sisters ran from april 29 to may 7 the second show she loves me kicked off may 27 and will run through june 4 subsequent shows include big hits such as mamma mia june 30 july 16 and forever plaid sept 2 10 in between those two is the lesser known but highly bob malone recommended musical comedy something rotten july 28 13 a lot of people don t know that one but it s one of the funniest shows i ve ever seen he said the season concludes with disenchanted oct 10 15 that one centers on fairy tale princesses upset with being left at happily ever after stepping out of the books to tell what really happened that one is not for the kids malone said the play s the thing malone and others involved with the theater travel down to new york city each february to audition for the upcoming season we had 1 650 something resumes come in he said we filter that down to 100 people for actual auditions some of the actors perform for only one show some for multiple this season will feature just under 50 performers in all i love the whole selection process he said year after year he is happy to see not only new actors honing their craft but also the relationships that develop among everyone involved with each season they really develop such deep bonds he said as far as the show s selections season to season malone said his focus is on the quality of the plays themselves although royalty fees for each play can range from the hundreds to the thousands of dollars while also being charged as a flat fee or per each performance i only pick shows i want to see he said and i happily watch every performance the theater continues in sands footsteps of holding acting workshops for children throughout the season four are planned for this year the last of which aladdin will have two different casts performing as long as he is able to malone said he is committed to giving it his all just as his predecessors did i may or may not open another business but i will always do this he said
theshooting at robb elementary school in uvalde texas on tuesday was the second deadliest school shooting since 1970 but in the aftermath of columbine parkland sandy hook and thenearly 1 000 other school shootings since 2012 advocates for nationwide gun control measures like universal background checks and banning assault rifles have run into political realities that have stopped these efforts from moving forward in the aftermath of the shooting in uvalde some elected officials have indicated there could be legislative change senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said he wants republican senators like texas john cornyn to work with democrats to find common ground on a legislative response to the shooting but years of disagreements on gun violence solutions in the aftermath of deadly shootings across the country have led to no major reforms on the matter i think the likelihood the senate will act is still vanishingly small but it s not zero bob spitzer author of the politics of gun control told npr it s not clear to me why mitch mcconnell would be interested in allowing that to happen but it s not impossible just because of the atmospherics of right now historically republican lawmakers have generally said they wouldn t back measures that limit firearm rights and in the last few days several gop lawmakers have reiterated that sentiment guns are not the problem we ve had guns forever and we re going to continue to have guns alabama republican sen tommy tuberville said wednesday still lawmakers like democratic sen chris murphy remain hopeful maybe i m a fool for being the eternal optimist but i m just gonna stay at it for these next few days the next week murphy told npr s all things considered passing major gun control measures on a federal level is possible it s been done before and gun control advocates point to more pieces of progress that have have been passed on state levels in the last decade but over the last few decades gun rights has become an even more polarized topic among elected officials in washington here s a look at some of the political barriers that have prevented the debate from progressing to action there are limits on what the president can do if a divided congress can t take action on gun violence even when there is public opinion behind it there are often calls for the executive branch to act within its own authority past presidents have taken action on their own to help curtail gun violence but major reforms require legislative action from congress for example former president donald trump banned bump stocks after the las vegas shooting in 2017 while legislation that would do the same never gained traction in congress so far in his administration president biden has signed a series of executive orders that tackle ghost guns and braces on ar 15 pistols and former president barack obama also took executive actions that were meant to more strictly regulate gun purchases but experts point out that those actions did little in reality to curtail mass shootings furthermore executive actions can be undone by the next administration when trump came into office in 2017 he revoked obama s order that tried to make it harder for those with mental illnesses to purchase weapons the supreme court s interpretation of the second amendment in recent decades the u s supreme court has ruled on two gun rights cases that have effectively expanded its interpretation of the second amendment which enshrines the right to bear arms in the 2008 case district of columbia v heller the court determined for the first time that an individual had the right to possess a handgun in their home in the 2010 case mcdonald v city of chicago the court built on heller and said that state and local gun control measures must respect that right spitzer says that despite the court s ruling in heller it didn t set a precedent of loosening most gun restrictions that already exist but an upcoming opinion from the supreme court involving a new york state law does have the potential to broaden gun rights spitzer said that case involves a challenge to the state s proper cause law requiring that people applying for a license to carry a concealed weapon outside the home show that they have a concrete need for self defense or they re going hunting or to target practice in hearing the case in november the conservative majority seemed ready strike down new york s law several other states have similar restrictions for carrying guns in public i think they re going to redefine gun rights by expanding them to outside the home in some manner spitzer said pro gun lobby has spent millions pro gun rights organizations like the nra and gun owners of america have spent tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and contributions to political candidates they consider to be on their side of the debate most of them republicans in the 2020 presidential race the nra spent more than 16 million to back trump it spent more than 12 million on congressional races far surpassing direct spending by gun control groups for decades the nra has been a major block to not only passing gun control legislation but to even researchingthe negative effects of owning guns a culture of hopelessness on top of policy barriers the incessant number of mass shootings in the united states have enabled a culture that has begun to see gun violence as a norm it s helped create a culture of hopelessness peter ambler political director at the gun control advocacy group giffords said one of the broader barriers is hopelessness which is the nra s chief political product they use hopelessness to stymie progress he said hopelessness sort of paralyzes the response some advocates want to frame gun control as a public health crisis while political debate over how to respond to the uvalde shooting has already begun some gun control advocacy groups are already sending the message to congress that the endemic of gun violence in the country needs to be treated and legislated as a public health crisis that addresses root causes of violence our policy solutions should start from a public health perspective and that means we can t just focus on the firearms and the hardware greg jackson the executive director of the community justice action fund and a gun violence survivor himself said to npr while those efforts will be helpful the reality is that there are still 400 million guns in our country already there s more guns than people most neighborhoods like mine are already saturated with firearms and so we have to make sure there s a comprehensive strategy to reduce violence jackson said he says his organization is already communicating the message to congressional leaders including senate majority leader chuck schumer that bills focused on regulatory gun control and crime control aren t the only solution to prevent violence he encourages lawmakers and the public to see combating gun violence as something that can be tackled on multiple fronts including by addressing trauma and other roots of violence if we re just focusing on the second amendment debate then we re over simplifying this issue he said there are dozens if not more of legislative approaches that could be considered in this moment copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

experts are expecting many travelers at airports and on the nation s byways during the long memorial day weekend in spite of high fuel costs a price gauge closely tracked by the federal reserve rose 6 3 in april from a year earlier just below a four decade high set in march and the first inflation slowdown since november 2020 friday s report from the commerce department added to other recent signs showing that while high inflation continues to cause hardships for millions of households it may finally be moderating at least for now the report also showed that consumer spending rose by a healthy 0 9 from march to april outpacing the month to month inflation rate for a fourth straight time the ongoing willingness of the nation s consumers to keep spending freely despite inflated prices is helping sustain the economy yet all that spending is helping keep prices high and could make the fed s goal of taming inflation even harder advertisement on a month to month basis prices rose 0 2 from march to april down from the 0 9 increase from february to march still inflation remains painfully high and it s inflicting a heavy burden in particular on lower income households many of them black or latino surging demand for furniture appliances and other goods combined with supply chain snarls began sending prices surging about a year ago consumers are now increasingly shifting their spending from goods to services such as airline fares and entertainment tickets that trend could help cool inflation in the months ahead though it s unclear by how much the cost of such services as restaurant meals plane tickets and hotel rooms is also rising newsletter news alerts get breaking news investigations analysis and more signature journalism from the los angeles times in your inbox enter email address sign me up you may occasionally receive promotional content from the los angeles times federal reserve chair jerome h powell has pledged to keep ratcheting up the fed s key short term interest rate until inflation is coming down in a clear and convincing way those rate hikes have spurred fears that the fed in its drive to slow borrowing and spending may push the economy into a recession that concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the last two months though markets have rallied this week powell has said the fed is aiming for a soft or soft ish landing in which wages consumer spending and growth slow but the economy avoids a downturn most economists say that although such an outcome is plausible they doubt it can be achieved a better known inflation gauge the consumer price index earlier this month also reported a slowing of still high inflation the cpi jumped 8 3 in april from a year earlier down from a 40 year high in march of 8 5 advertisement yet rising prices of gas and food worsened by russia s invasion of ukraine will keep measures of inflation painfully high at least into the summer the national average price of a gallon of gas has reached 4 60 according to aaa a year ago it was 3 04 other trends however suggest that core inflation may continue to slow in the coming months retailers have reported rising stockpiles of televisions patio furniture and other goods for the home as consumers have shifted their spending more toward travel and services related goods such as luggage and restaurant gift cards those stores will probably have to offer discounts to clear inventory in the coming months and auto manufacturers have been ramping up production as some supply chain snarls untangle and as they have managed to hire more workers both trends could help lower the prices of goods at the same time higher pay for many workers particularly at restaurants hotels and warehouses will keep forcing up prices for services which in turn would at least partly offset the benefit of less expensive goods and most economists forecast that inflation as measured by the fed s preferred gauge will still be at about 4 or higher by the end of this year price increases at that level would probably mean that the fed will still raise interest rates to lower inflation to its 2 target the inflation measure reported friday called the personal consumption expenditures price index differs in some ways from the consumer price index that help explain why it shows a lower inflation level than the cpi does rents which are steadily rising are given less weight in the pce than in the cpi advertisement the pce price index also seeks to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps in that way it can capture for example any trend in which consumers switch from pricey national brands to cheaper store brands

c uday bhaskar director society for policy studies the quad summit held in tokyo on tuesday may 24 had some significant security related strands embedded in the joint statement though in keeping with the reticence of the us led four nation group about security per se the relevant sections were tucked away towards the end of the 3 000 plus word document cybersecurity has been accorded a separate paragraph but the real substance is in the references to the maritime domain and its extrapolation to the composite security lattice of the global oceans that goes beyond the military naval component the last paragraph of the tokyo joint statement notes we welcome a new maritime domain awareness initiative the indo pacific partnership for maritime domain awareness ipmda designed to work with regional partners to respond to humanitarian and natural disasters and combat illegal fishing emphasis added ipmda will support and work in consultation with indo pacific nations and regional information fusion centres in the indian ocean southeast asia and the pacific islands by providing technology and training to support enhanced shared maritime domain awareness to promote stability and prosperity in our seas and oceans ipmda embodies what the quad stands for catalysing our joint efforts towards concrete results that help to make the region more stable and prosperous humanitarian assistance and being able to provide swift relief during natural disasters has been central to the quad and it may be recalled that the four nations came together organically in december 2004 when a major tsunami ravaged parts of peninsular india and southeast asia littoral to the bay of bengal indian ocean at the time india was the first nation to respond with its naval ships reaching the worst affected areas and this effort was soon complemented by the usa japan and australia taking forward the deliberations from the previous virtual summit in march 2022 the tokyo statement announced the establishment of the quad partnership on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief hadr in the indo pacific this partnership will anchor the activities of the four quad nations and their respective navies coast guard as applicable and while enhancing interoperability the objective is humanitarian and in keeping with the abiding tenets of the seafarer provide relief to those in distress if you have the wherewithal however it is the focus on maritime domain awareness mda as part of the ipmda that has considerable potential for providing directivity to the naval component of the quad in a subtle but effective manner as former naval chief admiral arun prakash notes mda is at the core of all maritime operations and pooling surveillance resources would enable greater and more granular awareness about the vast indo pacific region the tokyo statement highlights mda in reference to both hadr and illegal fishing and the latter activity is import laden illegal unreported and unregulated fishing iuu is an international maritime security challenge and is the equivalent of rapacious macro poaching of the global commons the oceans and seas of the world it is estimated that almost 30 per cent of the global fish catch is obtained through the iuu methodology and this has many negative consequences apart from impoverishing the livelihood of communities whose traditional fishing areas are poached state revenue is also depleted due to illegal and unregulated fishing furthermore mechanised all weather trawlers poach the indo pacific exclusive economic zone eez of small states that do not have the capacity to monitor or harvest those areas apportioned to them as part of the unclos un convention on the law of the seas various studies have established that the fragile food chain in the oceans is under dire threat due to the rampant use of vast fishing nets and indiscriminate scooping of the ocean bed left unchecked such iuu can lead to an imbalance in marine life thereby resulting in irreparable damage to the global marine food chain that can impact millions of human beings dependent in different ways on ocean produce the fao cautions that iuu fishing undermines national and regional efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks and as a consequence inhibits progress towards achieving the goals of long term sustainability and responsibility chinese fishing vessels have been identified as the most active in iuu fishing globally a report published in march by the environmental justice foundation ejf a uk non profit organisation concluded that china s distant water fleet is frequently associated with illegal fishing having identified more than 300 confirmed and 240 suspected fisheries offences between 2015 and 2019 china is estimated to have 3 000 distant water fishing ships and taiwan is second with 1 150 such vessels followed by japan south korea and spain the ipmda initiative mooted at tokyo can provide a very useful 24x7 real time picture of all surface activity in the indo pacific by pooling existing resources that include maritime reconnaissance aircraft ships satellites and regional information fusion centres ifc while platforms such as ships and aircraft are constrained by endurance the fusion centres combine technology with data mining to provide a continuous visual mapping of specific oceanic spaces india has a dedicated ifc manned by the navy in gurugram and in 2021 the centre monitored recorded and analysed a total of 3 411 incidents in the wider indian ocean region these incidents include piracy and armed robbery smuggling iuu irregular human migration and unauthorised maritime incidents the ifc monitored 392 iuu incidents in the same period which is an average of 32 per month and this is the tip of the iceberg granular mda enables tracking of vessels ships that try to deactivate their identification systems ais and any suspicious activity can be monitored in real time and this information conveyed to the authorities concerned the tokyo sub text is that if ipmda allows chinese or taiwanese engaged in iuu to be tracked with precision much the same degree of surveillance can be applied to chinese naval platforms it is instructive that while the tokyo joint statement brought mda towards the end of the document the us released a white house fact sheet on may 23 a day before the tokyo summit and led with the ipmda the document asserted that this initiative will transform the ability of partners in the pacific islands southeast asia and the indian ocean region to fully monitor the waters on their shores and in turn to uphold a free and open indo pacific the degree to which ipmda will succeed in its stated objectives will be a function of collective political resolve adequate material resources and sustained professionalism
mapping the global economy in the second half entering the second half of the year financial market risks are becoming more apparent investors believe the risk of recession is increasing resulting in volatile financial markets we believe there are five major risks associated with five economic areas as follows first the us economy has started to suffer from rising costs gdp in the first quarter contracted by 1 5 from the fourth quarter of last year due mainly to increased prices of imported goods while exports slowed in line with the global economy leading economic indicators such as the institute of supply research purchasing managers index ism pmi have begun to slow down sharply reflecting the rising cost of production and rising wages the university of michigan consumer sentiment index was the lowest since 2008 while its survey of one year inflation expectations is the highest in 40 years looking forward us economic risk is associated with tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation which makes recession risk more apparent us liquidity is also tight at the same level as it was before the covid crisis our us economic momentum model posits that the federal reserve will raise interest rates to a range of 2 75 and 3 by early next year while economic growth will continue to slow leading to a crisis in the second quarter of 2024 second the european economy is also slowing with both manufacturing and services pmi readings confirming that view first quarter gdp growth slowed and inflation is at a record high partly as a result of the russia ukraine war the main economic risk to europe in our view is the ukraine crisis peace looks increasingly remote and many experts now predict a protracted conflict as president putin has signalled his determination to take back territory in ukraine that he sees as russian this will create a risk of stagflation as a result of food and energy crises a view increasingly shared by european policymakers including the ecb president and the bank of england governor china syndrome third economic indicators in china have begun to contract severely as the government s zero covid lockdowns have disrupted economic activities of citizens and businesses we believe the government will continue the policy until president xi jinping is sworn in for a third term in november with continuing risk of on and off lockdowns hurting the economy nevertheless chinese authorities have begun to signal easing of monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy which we believe will lessen the impact somewhat fourth economic risks arising from three factors are leading to deterioration in emerging market economies bloomberg economics has ranked 19 emerging market countries at risk of crises based on their food and energy self sufficiency and their risk of capital outflows both from relatively large foreign currency debt and high current account deficits it identified 10 emerging markets at risk of further economic crises including thailand the others are turkey egypt vietnam the philippines poland south korea chile china and peru malaysia india and indonesia meanwhile are ranked 11th 12th and 18th respectively on bloomberg s high risk list looking forward three factors the prolonged ukraine russia war on and off lockdowns in china and tightening liquidity as a result of fed actions will have a negative effect on emerging economies lastly the thai economy is at risk of high and rising production costs global liquidity tightening and global supply chain disruption although first quarter gdp was better than expected the details behind the growth are quite worrisome the manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace while the sub sector of export goods manufacturing contracted for the first time in five quarters as a result of supply chain disruption especially for technology products that require semiconductors meanwhile the construction sector contracted sharply for the third straight quarter partly due to continued rising construction material prices especially steel seven risk factors the monthly thai economic numbers have also begun to fall especially the domestic demand components such as consumption and investment private consumption has slowed due to the higher cost of living while investment has slowed in terms of both investment in construction and machinery the manufacturing sector has started to contract due to supply chain problems and slowing demand in world markets the national economic and social development council has revised its economic forecast downward as have we given the deteriorating conditions we have based our revised economic assumptions on seven factors the protracted ukraine war higher crude oil prices higher domestic diesel prices a possible 10 20 increase in the minimum wage export growth that may increase somewhat but with negative risks tourist arrivals at risk of coming in below the target of 8 million the baht may be weaker than previously expected based on those assumptions we expect the thai economy to expand by around 2 9 to 3 4 this year from a previously expected 3 6 while inflation is likely to increase to 3 5 from 2 projected previously global economic risks are all around investors please be careful

hey there time traveller this article was published 26 05 2022 690 days ago so information in it may no longer be current honeybees are in short supply this summer though a final count isn t out yet experts assume at least half of manitoba s honeybees died over the past nine months the hopelessness is in the air said michael clark co manager of clark apiaries he began the winter with over 3 200 colonies when the season ended he d lost 50 per cent of his regular hives and 30 per cent of his smaller ones called nucleus hives supplied michael clark s family has been running a bee farm near brandon for more than a century then spring or consistent snow and rain storms entered the province clark said he s now lost up to 80 per cent of his bees we re looking at a complete crop failure he said the century old wawanesa man farm has never experienced anything like it clark added but he s not alone across the country apiarists are facing losses and sometimes complete wipeouts of their bee populations it s hard talking to the guys at 90 per cent losses because what do they do they ve lost all their bees said ian steppler chair of the manitoba beekeepers association farmers who rely on local apiarists bees to pollinate their crops must check in to make sure the insects will be around according to paul gregory a keystone agricultural producers director it s the crops like clover buckwheat trefoil no honeybees no seed so it s extremely important gregory said the extra long winter and frigid spring didn t allow the hives to build up properly clark apiaries facebook photo steppler estimates manitoba has lost between 50 and 60 per cent of its honeybee population last year the province had 115 000 hives he said the number was over 118 000 in 2020 according to agriculture and agri food canada data if steppler is correct manitoba will have no more than 69 000 hives this summer a number of factors contributed to the collapse steppler said many beekeepers are still determining the causes it probably started last summer when we had that extreme hot dry smoky weather steppler said that weather is really hard on the bees i think it stressed them and put them back a bit then came an unusual fall where some apiarists couldn t treat their bees for varroa mites like they normally would steppler said the mites are parasitic they latch on to bees and suck their blood weakening the pollinators which can lead to death varroa mites infested some apiarists hives bringing devastation it s hard talking to the guys at 90 per cent losses because what do they do they ve lost all their bees ian steppler then came an extra long winter and frigid spring it didn t allow the hives to build up properly steppler said every time they got an opportunity to build to bring natural pollen and nectar we seemed to have a storm that followed steppler s farm holds 1 600 honeybee hives it lost 10 per cent in the winter and another 25 per cent in the spring due to the weather he said if manitoba sees another 50 per cent loss it s going to pretty much bankrupt our industry steppler said we could be in dire straits next year if we have another loss event clark has one eye on the skyrocketing price of honey and another on his empty bee boxes to have this loss at the time when we have the highest price historically is just like a double punch to the gut he said manitoba produces around 19 million pounds of honey annually according to steppler it was a 48 9 million industry in 2020 we re looking at a complete crop failure clark said clark apiaries facebook photo we re going to have trouble producing 10 million pounds this year he said retailers might fill manitoba honey product gaps with international purchases and they may not turn back he said clark has laid off three employees and told another three regulars they won t be starting work neither he nor his neighbours will hire local teenagers for labour this summer he said the impact on the wawanesa community at large is significant he said he s hoping beekeepers can push back their mortgage payments for the next year there are government insurance programs like overwinter bee mortality and agristability for financial relief it s not going to help apiarists get their bee numbers back get industry capacity back said gregory who s also a commercial beekeeper it probably started last summer when we had that extreme hot dry smoky weather that weather is really hard on the bees i think it stressed them and put them back a bit ian steppler this isn t the first year manitoban apiarists have experienced losses normally though they can get replacement stock from overseas to boost their numbers and prepare for the next year however provinces from alberta to quebec are facing honeybee shortages there aren t enough foreign replacements to go around clark is looking to canada s southern neighbour with frustration he can t purchase bee packages from the united states the canadian food inspection agency prohibits it to prevent pest spread we could have a profit clark said it s extra disheartening when you can basically see the border and you know right there they can solve your problems but you have no access to that market he said american bees fly over the border anyway so there s always a chance canada will get the pests it s far too late to ask for american honeybees this year gregory from kap said clark said american bees fly over the border anyway so there s always a chance canada will get the mites david lipnowski free press files he said the mites from south of the border could be more acaricide resistant than those currently in manitoba because they ve been exposed to different pesticides once these mites are into canada you can t go back the genie s out of the bottle he said still gregory would like to see a study done on potential honeybee exporters including the u s and whether shipments would bring pests and disease the land border should be open for honeybees if pests aren t a threat he said the canadian food inspection agency did not respond to free press questions by print deadline kon paseschnikoff an apiarist in oak bluff is focused on rising operating costs honey production will be down he lost one third of his bees but the cost of queen bees bee boxes and fuel keep rising at the end of the day the consumer pays for it he said noting a queen bee that used to cost 20 could now be 40 or 50 cp if people can hold off on spraying the dandelions and maybe plant some more pollinator flowers in their yards that would help a lot kon paseschnikoff said kerstin joensson the associated press files he s beginning to see dandelions they usually come in the first week of may paseschnikoff said if people can hold off on spraying the dandelions and maybe plant some more pollinator flowers in their yards that would help a lot he said honeybee activity is about five weeks behind schedule according to steppler but farmers are late to seed and plants are just beginning to blossom he added manitoba accounted for nearly a quarter of canada s honey production in 2020 according to agriculture and agri food canada honeybees pollination affects crops from fruit and vegetables to fibre and hay the insects add millions of dollars worth of value to the agriculture sector through pollination of sunflowers canola fruit trees and more

that s only 1 5 above where it was prior to the invasion and 9 from the post invasion peak the move was done to arrest the appreciation in the rouble and has had some effect but further rate cuts are likely with many anticipating that the rouble will remain strong regardless of the central bank s actions it s worth noting that the cbr is not waiting for scheduled meetings to cut rates so another

steppler estimates manitoba has lost between 50 and 60 per cent of its honeybee population last year the province had 115 000 hives he said the number was over 118 000 in 2020 according to agriculture and agri food canada data if steppler is correct manitoba will have no more than 69 000 hives this summer a number of factors contributed to the collapse steppler said many beekeepers are still determining the causes it probably started last summer when we had that extreme hot dry smoky weather steppler said that weather is really hard on the bees i think it stressed them and put them back a bit then came an unusual fall where some apiarists couldn t treat their bees for varroa mites like they normally would steppler said the mites are parasitic they latch on to bees and suck their blood weakening the pollinators which can lead to death varroa mites infested some apiarists hives bringing devastation it s hard talking to the guys at 90 per cent losses because what do they do they ve lost all their bees ian steppler then came an extra long winter and frigid spring it didn t allow the hives to build up properly steppler said every time they got an opportunity to build to bring natural pollen and nectar we seemed to have a storm that followed steppler s farm holds 1 600 honeybee hives it lost 10 per cent in the winter and another 25 per cent in the spring due to the weather he said if manitoba sees another 50 per cent loss it s going to pretty much bankrupt our industry steppler said we could be in dire straits next year if we have another loss event clark has one eye on the skyrocketing price of honey and another on his empty bee boxes to have this loss at the time when we have the highest price historically is just like a double punch to the gut he said manitoba produces around 19 million pounds of honey annually according to steppler it was a 48 9 million industry in 2020 we re looking at a complete crop failure clark said clark apiaries facebook photo we re going to have trouble producing 10 million pounds this year he said retailers might fill manitoba honey product gaps with international purchases and they may not turn back he said clark has laid off three employees and told another three regulars they won t be starting work neither he nor his neighbours will hire local teenagers for labour this summer he said the impact on the wawanesa community at large is significant he said he s hoping beekeepers can push back their mortgage payments for the next year there are government insurance programs like overwinter bee mortality and agristability for financial relief it s not going to help apiarists get their bee numbers back get industry capacity back said gregory who s also a commercial beekeeper it probably started last summer when we had that extreme hot dry smoky weather that weather is really hard on the bees i think it stressed them and put them back a bit ian steppler this isn t the first year manitoban apiarists have experienced losses normally though they can get replacement stock from overseas to boost their numbers and prepare for the next year however provinces from alberta to quebec are facing honeybee shortages there aren t enough foreign replacements to go around clark is looking to canada s southern neighbour with frustration he can t purchase bee packages from the united states the canadian food inspection agency prohibits it to prevent pest spread we could have a profit clark said it s extra disheartening when you can basically see the border and you know right there they can solve your problems but you have no access to that market he said american bees fly over the border anyway so there s always a chance canada will get the pests it s far too late to ask for american honeybees this year gregory from kap said clark said american bees fly over the border anyway so there s always a chance canada will get the mites david lipnowski free press files he said the mites from south of the border could be more acaricide resistant than those currently in manitoba because they ve been exposed to different pesticides once these mites are into canada you can t go back the genie s out of the bottle he said still gregory would like to see a study done on potential honeybee exporters including the u s and whether shipments would bring pests and disease the land border should be open for honeybees if pests aren t a threat he said the canadian food inspection agency did not respond to free press questions by print deadline kon paseschnikoff an apiarist in oak bluff is focused on rising operating costs honey production will be down he lost one third of his bees but the cost of queen bees bee boxes and fuel keep rising at the end of the day the consumer pays for it he said noting a queen bee that used to cost 20 could now be 40 or 50 cp if people can hold off on spraying the dandelions and maybe plant some more pollinator flowers in their yards that would help a lot kon paseschnikoff said kerstin joensson the associated press files he s beginning to see dandelions they usually come in the first week of may paseschnikoff said if people can hold off on spraying the dandelions and maybe plant some more pollinator flowers in their yards that would help a lot he said honeybee activity is about five weeks behind schedule according to steppler but farmers are late to seed and plants are just beginning to blossom he added manitoba accounted for nearly a quarter of canada s honey production in 2020 according to agriculture and agri food canada honeybees pollination affects crops from fruit and vegetables to fibre and hay the insects add millions of dollars worth of value to the agriculture sector through pollination of sunflowers canola fruit trees and more

few episodes in english history are more curious than the founding of virginia in the course of the mightiest conflict the world had witnessed between the powers of despotism and the powers of freedom considerations chiefly strategical led england to make the ocean her battle ground and out of these circumstances grew the idea of establishing military posts at sundry important strategic points on the north american coast to aid the operations of the navy in a few far sighted minds this idea developed into the scheme of planting one or more protestant states for the increase of england s commerce the expansion of her political influence and the maintenance of her naval advantages after royal assistance had been sought in vain and single handed private enterprise had proved unequal to the task of founding a state the joint stock principle herald of a new industrial era was resorted to and we witness the creation of two rival jointstock companies for the purpose of undertaking such a task of the two colonies sent out by these companies one the popham colony meets the usual fate succumbs to famine and retires from the scene the other at jamestown barely escapes a similar fate but is kept alive by the energy and sagacity and good fortune of one extraordinary man until sturdy london has invested so much of her treasure and her life blood in it that she will not tamely look on and see it perish then the lord mayor the wealthy merchants the venerable craft guilds with many liberal knights and peers and a few brilliant scholars and clergymen turn to and remodel the london company into a truly great commercial corporation with an effective government and one of london s foremost merchant princes at its head as if by special intervention from heaven the struggling colony is rescued at the very point of death and soon takes on a new and more vigorous life but for such lavish outlay to continue there must be some solid return and soon a new and unexpected source of wealth is found as all this sort of work is a novel experiment mistakes are at first made in plenty neither the ends to be obtained nor the methods of obtaining them are distinctly conceived and from the parties of brave gentlemen in quest of el dorado to the crowd of rogues and pickpockets amenable only to rough martial law the drift of events seems somewhat indefinite and aimless but just as the short lived system of communism falls to the ground and private ownership of land and earnings is established the rapidly growing demand for tobacco in england makes its cultivation an abundant and steady source of wealth the colonists increase in numbers and are improved in quality meanwhile as the interest felt by the shareholders becomes more lively the company acquires a more democratic organization it exerts political influence the court party and country party contend with each other for the control of it and the latter wins hitherto the little virginia colony has been like the contemporary french colony in canada and like all the spanish colonies a despotically governed community closely dependent upon the source of authority in the mother country and without any true political life but now the victorious party in the company gives to virginia a free representative government not based upon any ideal theory of the situation but rooted in ancient english precedent the result of ages of practical experience and therefore likely to thrive finally we see the british king awakening to the fact that he has unloosed a power that threatens danger the doctrine of the divine right of kings that ominous bequest from the half orientalized later roman empire to post mediæval europe was dear to the heart of james stuart and his aim in life was to impose it upon the english people his chief obstacle was the country party which if he could not defeat in parliament he might at least weaken by striking at the great corporation that had come to be one of its strongholds in what we may call the embryonic development of virginia the final incident was the overthrow of the london company but we shall see that the severing of that umbilical cord left the colony stronger and more selfreliant than before in the unfolding of these events there is poetic beauty and grandeur as the purpose of infinite wisdom reveals itself in its cosmic process slowly but inexorably hasting not but resting not heedless of the clashing aims and discordant cries of short sighted mortals sweeping their tiny efforts into its majestic current and making all contribute to the fulfillment of god s will from the very outset the planting of virginia had been watched with wrath and chagrin by the spanish court within the last few years a virginian scholar alexander brown has collected and published a large number of manuscript letters and other documents preserved in the spanish archives at simancas which serve to illustrate the situation in detail very little of importance happened in london that the ambassador zuñiga did not promptly discover and straightway report in cipher to madrid we can now read for the first time many memoranda of secret sessions of philip iii and his ministers in which this little protestant colony was the theme of discussion it was a thorn in the flesh not easy to extract unless spain was prepared for war with great britain at first the very weakness of the colony served to keep this enemy s hands off if it was oil the point of dying a natural death as seemed likely it was hardly worth while to repeat the horrors of florida in 1612 after sir thomas dale s administration had begun spain again took tiie ahum for the moment a war with england was threatened and if it had broken out virginia would have been one of the first points attacked but the deaths of lord salisbury and of henry prince of wales in 1612 changed the policy of both philip and james there was now some hope of detaching the latter from protestant alliances and philip s designs upon virginia were subordinated to the far larger purpose of winning back england herself into the catholic ranks a plan was made for marrying the infanta maria to baby charles and with this end in view one of the ablest of spanish diplomats count gondomar to give him at once his best known title was sent as ambassador to london charles was only twelve years old and an immediate wedding was not expected but the match could be kept dangling before james as a bait and thus his movements might be guided should the marriage finally be made gondomar believed that charles could be converted to his bride s faith and then england might be made to renew her allegiance to rome gondomar was mightily mistaken in the english people but he was not mistaken in their king james was ready to swallow bait hook and all gondomar completely fascinated him one might almost say hypnotized him so that for the next ten years one had but to shake that spanish match before him and he would follow whatever might betide the official policy of england was thus often made distasteful to englishmen and the sentiment of loyalty to the sovereign was impaired to gondomar the king was in the habit of confiding his grievances and in 1614 after his angry dissolution of parliament he said to him one day there is one thing i have here which your king in spain has not and that is a parliament of five hundred members i am surprised that my ancestors should ever have permitted such an institution to come into existence i am a stranger and found it here when i arrived so that i am obliged to put up with what i cannot get rid of here james stopped short and turned red in the face at having thus carelessly admitted his own lack of omnipotence whereupon the wily spaniard smiled and reminded him that at all events it was only at his royal pleasure that this very disagreeable assembly could be called together james acted on this hint and did not summon a parliament again for seven years it is worth remembering that at this very time the representatives of the people in france were dismissed not to be called together again until 1789 while parliament was not sitting the sort of discussion that james found so hateful was kept up at the meetings of the london company for virginia which were commonly held at the princely mansion of sir thomas smith against this corporation gondomar dropped his sweet poison into the king s ear the government of colonies he said is work fit only for monarchs and cannot safely be entrusted to a roomful of gabbling subjects beware of such meetings you will find them but a seminary to a seditious parliament before james had profited by these warnings however the case of sir walter raleigh came up to absorb his attention a rare chance as strange and sad as anything that the irony of human destiny can show was offered for spain to wreak her malice upon virginia in the person of the earliest and most illustrious of its founders in 1603 not long after king james s arrival in england raleigh had been charged with complicity in lord cobham s abortive conspiracy for getting james set aside in favor of his cousin lady arabella stuart this charge is now proved to have been ill founded but james already hated raleigh with the measure of hatred which lie dealt out to so many of elizabeth s favorites after a trial in which the common law maxim that innocence must be presumed until guilt is proved was read backward as witches were said to read the lord s prayer in summoning old nick sir walter was found guilty of high treason and condemned to death the wrath of the people was such that james who did not yet feel his position quite secure did not venture to carry out the sentence he contented himself with plundering sir walter s estates while that noble knight was kept for more than twelve years a prisoner in the tower where he solaced himself with experiments in chemistry and with writing that delightful history of the world which is one of the glories of english prose literature in 1616 at the intercession of villiers raleigh was set free on his expedition to guiana in 1595 he had discovered gold on the upper waters of the caroni river in what is now venezuela in his attempt to dispense with parliaments james was at his wit s end for money and he thought something might be got by sending raleigh back to take possession of the place it is true that spain claimed that country but so did james on the strength of raleigh s own discoveries and if any complication should arise there were ways of crawling out raleigh had misgivings about starting on such an adventure without first obtaining a pardon in set form but sir francis bacon is said to have assured him that the king having under the privy seal made him admiral of a fleet with power of martial law over sailors and officers had substantially condoned all offenses real or alleged a man could not at one and the same time be under attaint of treason and also an admiral in active service before raleigh started james made him explain the details of his scheme and lay down his route on a chart and he promised on the sacred word of a king not to divulge this information to any human creature it was only the sacred word of a stuart king james may have meant to keep it but his evil genius was not far off the lifelike portrait of count gondomar superbly painted by the elder daniel mytens hangs in the palace at hampton court and one cannot look on it for a moment without feeling that mephistopheles himself must have sat for it the bait of the infanta with a dowry of two million crowns in hard cash was once more thrown successfully and james told every detail of raleigh s plans to the spaniard who sent the intelligence post haste to madrid so when the english fleet arrived at the mouths of the orinoco a spanish force awaited them and attacked their exploring party in the fight that ensued raleigh s son walter was slain though the english were victorious the approaches to the gold fields were too strongly guarded to be carried by the force at their command and thus the enterprise was baffled the gold fields remained for spain but with the fast increasing paralysis of spanish energy they were soon neglected and forgotten their existence was denied and raleigh s veracity doubted until in 1889 they were rediscovered and identified by the venezuelan inspector of mines since the expedition was defeated by the treachery of his own sovereign nothing was left for the stricken admiral but to return to england the spanish court loudly clamored for his death on the ground that he had undertaken a piratical excursion against a country within spanish jurisdiction his wife cleverly planned an escape to france but a judas in the party arrested him and he was sent to the tower the king promised gondomar that raleigh should be publicly executed either in london or in madrid but on second thought the latter alternative would not do to surrender him to spain would be to concede spain s claim to guiana without conceding this claim there was nothing for which to punish him accordingly james in this year 1618 revived the old death sentence of 1603 and spain drank a deep draught of revenge when the hero of cadiz and fayal was beheaded in the palace yard at westminster a scene fit to have made elizabeth turn in her grave in the abbey hard by a fouler judicial murder never stained the annals of any country the silly king gained nothing by his crime popular execration in england set him up in a pillory from which posterity is not likely to take him down the spanish council of state advised philip iii to send him an autograph letter of thanks but the half promised infanta with her rich dowry kept receding like the grapes from eager tantalus a dwindling exchequer would soon leave james with no resource except summoning once more that odious parliament meanwhile in the london company for virginia there occurred that change of political drift whereof the election of sir edwin sandys over sir thomas smith aided though it had been by a private quarrel was one chief symptom that election revealed the alarming growth of hostility in the city of london to the king s pretensions and to the court party james had said just before the election choose the devil if you will but not sir edwin sandys from that time forth the king s hostility to the company scarcely needed gondomar s skillful nursing it grew apace till it became aggressive not to say belligerent at the election in 1620 it was the intention of the majority in the company to reelect sandys with whose management they were more than pleased nearly five hundred members were present at the meeting it was the custom for three candidates to be named and voted for one after another by ballot and a plurality sufficed for a choice on this occasion the name of sir edwin sandys first of three was about to be put to vote when some gentlemen of the king s household came in and interrupted the proceedings the king said their spokesman positively forbade the election of sir edwin sandys his majesty was unwilling to infringe the rights of the company and would therefore himself propose names even as many as four on which a vote might be taken the names were forthwith read and turned out to be those of sir thomas smith and three of his intimate friends this impudent interference was received with a silence more eloquent than words a profound silence that might be felt after some minutes came murmurs and wrathful ejaculations among which such expressions as tyranny and invasion of chartered rights could be plainly heard the motion was made that the king s messengers should leave the room while the situation was discussed no said the earl of southampton let them stay and hear what is said this motion prevailed then sir lawrence hyde moved that the charter be read and his motion was greeted with one of those dutiful but ominous cries so common in that age from all parts of the room it resounded the charter the charter i god save the king the roll of parchment was brought forward and read aloud by the secretary mr chairman said hyde the words of the charter are plain the election of a treasurer is left to the free choice of this company his majesty seems to labor under some misunderstanding and i doubt not these gentlemen will undeceive him for a few minutes no one replied and there was a buzz of informal conversation about the room some members leaving their seats to speak with friends not sitting near them one of our accounts says that some of the king s emissaries stepped out and sought his presence and when he heard what was going on he looked a little anxious and his stubbornness was somewhat abated he said of course he did not wish to restrict the company s choice to the names he had mentioned whether this concession was reported back to the meeting we are not informed but probably it was when the meeting was called to order sir robert phillips who was sitting near sandys got up and announced that that gentleman wished to withdraw his name he would therefore propose that the king s messengers should nominate two persons while the company should nominate a third the motion was carried and the company nominated the earl of southampton the balloting showed an extremely meagre vote for the king s nominees it was then moved and carried that in the earl s case the ballot should be dispensed with and the choice signified by acclamation and then with thundering shouts of southampton southampton the meeting was brought to a close the rebuke to the king could hardly have been move pointed and in such a scene we recognize the prophecy of the doom to which james s wrong policy was by and by to hasten his son the choice of shakespeare s friend instead of sandys made no difference whatever in the policy of the company from that time forth its ruling spirits were southampton and sandys and nicholas ferrar the deputy treasurer the name of this young man calls for more than a passing mention letter known in ecclesiastical than in political history he was distinguished and memorable in whatever he undertook and among all the thronging figures in england s past he is one of the most sweetly and solemnly beautiful his father the elder nicholas ferrar who died in april 1620 just before the election i have been describing was one of london s merchant princes and it was in the parlor of his hospitable house in st osyth s lane now known as size lane near the poultry that the weekly meetings of the virginia council were in these latter days regularly held in this house the young nicholas was born in 1593 he had spent seven years in study at cambridge and five years in very extensive travel upon the continent of europe when at the age of twentyseven he came to devote all his energies for a time to the welfare of the colony of virginia from early boyhood he was noticeable for taking a grave and earnest but by no means sombre view of life its interests and its duties for him frivolity had no charm coarse pleasures were but loathsome yet he was neither stern nor cold through every fibre of his being he was the refined and courteous gentleman a true sir galahad fit to have found the holy grail his scholarship was thorough and broad an excellent mathematician and interested in the new dawning of physical science he was also well versed in the classics and in modern languages and knew something of oriental philology but he was most fond of the devotional literature of the church his intensely religious mood was part of the great spiritual revival of which puritanism was the mightiest manifestation yet nicholas ferrar was no puritan either in doctrine or in ecclesiastical policy in these matters his sympathies were rather with william laud at the same time his career is a living refutation of the common notion that there is a necessary connection between the religion of laud and the politics of stratfford for his own political views were as liberal as those of hampden and pym indeed ferrar was a rare product of the harmonious coöperation of the tendencies represented respectively in the renaissance and in the reformation tendencies which the general want of intelligence and moral soundness in mankind has more commonly brought into barren conflict his ideal of life was much like that which milton set forth with matchless beauty in il penseroso its leading motive strengthening with his years was the feeling of duty toward the studious cloister s pale and the part of his career that is now best remembered is the founding of that monastic home at little gidding where study and charitable deeds and prayer and praise should go on unceasing where at whatsoever hour of day or night the weary wayfarer through the broad fen country should climb that billy range in huntingdon he should hear the pealing organ blow to the full voiced choir below and entering should receive spiritual comfort and strength and go thence on his way with heart uplifted in that blest retreat ever busy with good works lived nicholas ferrar after the downfall of the great london company until his own early death in 1637 at the age of forty four of great or brilliant deeds according to the world s usual standard this man did none yet the simple record of his life brings us into such an atmosphere of holiness and love that mankind can never afford to let it fade and die this protestant saint withal was no vague dreamer but showed in action the practical sagacity that came by inheritance from london s best stock of bold and thrifty citizens as one of the directing minds of a commercial corporation he showed himself equal to every occasion that arose he is identified with the last days of the london company and his family archives preserve the record of its downfall it is thence that we get the account of the election of southampton and many other interesting scenes and important facts that would otherwise have passed into oblivion after southampton s election the king s hostility to the company became deadly and within that corporation itself he had allies who when once they found themselves unable to rule it were only too willing to contribute to its ruin sir thomas smith and his friends now accepted their defeat as decisive and final and allowed themselves to become disloyal to the company probably they would have expressed it differently they would have said that out of regard for virginia they felt it their duty to thwart the reckless men who had gained control of her destinies unfortunately for their version of the case the friends of sir thomas smith were charged with the burden of argall s misdemeanors and the regard which that governor had shown for virginia was too much like the peculiar interest that a wolf feels in the sheepfold it is not meant that the members of the court party who tried to screen argall were all unscrupulous men such was far from being the case but in public contests nothing is more common than to see men personally stainless blindly accept and defend the rogues of their own party in the heat of battle the private quarrel between smith and the earl of warwick was either made up or allowed to drop out of sight the two men worked together and in harmony with the king to defeat southampton and sandys and ferrar in the company s quarter sessions the disputes rose so high that the meetings were said to be more like cockpits than courts on one occasion a duel between the earl of warwick and lord cavendish eldest son of the first earl of devonshire was narrowly prevented as chamberlain one of the court gossips of the day writes last week the earl of warwick and the lord cavendish fell so foul at a virginia court that the lie passed and repassed and they are to try their fortune yet we do not hear they are met so that there is hope they may return safe in the mean time their ladies forget not their old familiarity but meet daily to lament their misfortune the factions in are grown so violent as guelfs and ghibellines were not more animated one against another and they seldom meet upon the exchange or in the streets but they brabble and quarrel in 1621 the king having arrived at the end of his purse seized what he thought a favorable moment for summoning parliament but found that body more intractable than ever the commons busied themselves with attacking monopolies and impeaching the lord chancellor bacon for taking bribes then they expressed unqualified disapproval of the spanish match whereupon the king told them to mind their own business and not meddle with his a long and angry dispute ensued which terminated in a strong protest in which the commons declared that their privileges were not the gift of the crown but the natural birthright of english subjects and that matters of public interest were within their province this protest so infuriated the king that he tore it into pieces and forthwith dissolved parliament sending pym southampton and other leaders to prison this was in january 1622 as more than a hundred members of this froward parliament were also members of the company it is not strange that the king should have watched more eagerly than ever for a chance to attack that corporation a favorable opportunity was soon offered him a certain nathaniel butler governor of the bermuda islands was accused of extorting a large sum of money from some spaniards who had been shipwrecked there and very damaging evidence was brought against him but he seems to have known how to enlist powerful friends on his side on being summoned to england he went first to virginia where his services were in demand during the brief but bloody indian war that followed upon the massacre of 1622 then after arriving in england he published in april 1623 a savage attack upon the london company entitled the unmasked face of our colony in virginia simultaneously with the publication of this pamphlet the charges against its author were dropped and were nevermore heard of such a coincidence is extremely significant it was commonly believed at the time that butler bought the suppression of the charges by turning backbiter his attack upon the company is so frivolous as plainly to indicate its origin in pure malice it is interesting as the first of the long series of books about america printed in england which have sorely irritated their american readers sixteen of the old virginia settlers who were at that moment in london answered it with convincing force some of this butler s accusations with the answers of the settlers may fitly be cited for the side light they throw upon the state of things in virginia as well as upon the peculiar sinuosities of stuart kingcraft 1 i found the plantations generally seated upon meer salt marishes full of infectious bogs and muddy creeks and lakes and thereby subjected to all those inconveniences and diseases which are so commonly found in the most unsound and most unhealthy parts of england whereof every country and climate hath some answer we say that there is no place inhabited but is conveniently habitable and for the first plantation which is kiccontan men may enjoy their healths and live as plentifully as in any part of england yet that there are marishes in some places we acknowledge as for bogs we know of none in all the country and for the rest of the plantations as newport s news blunt point warriscoyak martins hundred and all the plantations right over against james city and all the plantations above these which are many they are very fruitful pleasant healthful and high land except james city which yet is as high as deptford or ratcliffe 2 i found the shores and sides of those parts of the main river where our plantations are settled everywhere so shallow as no boats can approach the shores so that besides the difficulty danger and spoil of goods in the landing of them people are forced to a continual wading and wetting of themselves and that in the prime of winter when the ships commonly arrive and thereby get such violent surfeits of cold upon cold as seldom leave them until they leave to live answer that generally for the plantations at all times from half flood to half ebb any boat that draws betwixt 3 and 4 foot water may safely come in and land their goods dry on shore without wading and for further clearing of his false objections the seamen do at all times deliver the goods they bring to the owners dry on shore whereby it plainly appears not any of the country people are by this means in danger of their lives and at many plantations below james city and almost all above they may at all times land dry i ke new people that are yearly sent over arrive here for the most part very unseasonably in winter find neither guest house inn nor any the like place to shroud themselves in at their arrival not so much as a stroke is given toward any such charitable work many of by want hereof are not only seen dying under hedges and in the woods but being dead lie some of them many days unregarded arid unburied answer the winter is the most healthful time and season for arrival of newcomers true it is that as yet there is no guest house or place of entertainment for strangers but we aver it was a late intent to make a general gathering for the building of such a convenient house which by this time had been in good forwardness had it not pleased god to suffer this disaster to fall out by the indians but although there he no public guest house yet are new comers entertained and lodged and provided for by the governor in private houses and for any dying in the fields through this defect and lying unburied we are altogether ignorant yet that many die suddenly by the hand of god we often see it fall out even in this flourishing and plentiful city in the midst of our streets as for dying under hedges there is no hedge in all virginia 5 their houses are generally the worst that ever i saw the meanest cottages in england being every way equal if not superior with the most of the best and besides so improvidently and seatteringly are they seated one from another as partly by their distance but especially by the interposition of creeks and swamps they offer all advantages to their savage enemies answer the houses were built for use and not for ornament and are so far from being so mean as they are reported that throughout labouring men s houses are in no wise generally for goodness to be compared unto them and for the houses of men of better rank and quality they are so much better and convenient that no man of quality without blushing can make exception against them for the creeks and swamps every man that cannot go by land hath either a boat or a canoe for the conveying and speedy passage to his neighbour s house so go the charges and the answers it is unnecessary to cite any further the animus of captain butler s pamphlet is sufficiently apparent he wished to make it appear that things were wretchedly managed in virginia and that there was but a meagre and contemptible result to show for all the treasure that had been spent and all the lives that had been lost whatever could weaken people s faith in the colony check emigration deter subscriptions and in any way embarrass the company he did not fail to bring forward not only were the sites unhealthy and the houses mean but the fortifications were neglected plantations were abandoned the kine and poultry were destroyed by indians the assembly enacted laws willfully divergent from the laws of england and speculators kept engrossing wheat and maize and selling them at famine prices so said butler and knowing how effective a bold sweeping lie is sure to be in spite of prompt and abundant refutation he ended by declaring that not less than ten thousand persons had been sent out to virginia of whom through the aforenamed abuses and neglects not more than two thousand still remained alive therefore he added unless the dishonest practices of the company in london and the wretched bungling of its officials in virginia be speedily redressed by some divine and supreme hand instead of a plantation it will shortly get the name of a slaughter house and justly become both odious to ourselves and contemptible to all the world all these allegations were either denied or satisfactorily explained by the sixteen settlers then in london and their sixteen affidavits were duly sworn to before a notary public some months afterward captain butler s pamphlet was laid before the assembly of virginia and elaborately refuted nothing can be clearer than the fact that the sympathies of the people in virginia were entirely on the side of the company under its present management and no fact could be more honorable to the company from first to last the proceedings now to be related were watched in virginia with intense anxiety and fierce indignation on thursday of holy week 1623 a formal complaint against the company embodying such charges as those 1 have here recounted was laid before the privy council and the lord treasurer cranfield better known as earl of middlesex sent notice of it to nicholas ferrar with the demand that a complete answer to every particular should be returned by the next monday afternoon ferrar protested against such unseemly haste but the lord treasurer was inexorable then the young man called together as many of the company as he could find at an hour s notice that afternoon they met in his mother s parlor and he read aloud the complaint which took three hours then lord cavendish sir edwin sandys and nicholas ferrar were appointed a committee to prepare the answer these three says our chronicle made it midnight ere they parted they ate no set meals they slept not two hours all thursday and friday nights they met to admire each other s labours on saturday night and sat in judgment on the whole till five o clock on sunday morning then they divided it equally among six nimble scribes and went to bed themselves as it was high time for them the transcribers finished their task by monday morning the company met at six to review their labours and by two in the afternoon the answer was presented at the council board this answer was a masterpiece of cogency it proved the baselessness of the charges either they were complete falsehoods or they related to disasters directly connected with the indian massacre which was not due to any provocation on the part of the whites or else they showed the effects of mismanagement in sir thomas smith s time especially under the tyrannical administration of argali from which the colony had not yet fully recovered in short such of the charges as really bore against the company were successfully shown up as affecting its old government under smith and warwick and not its new government under sandys and southampton the latter was cleared of every calumny and its absolute integrity and vast efficiency were fully established such at least is the decisive verdict of history but the lords of the privy council were not willing to accept such a result it amounted almost to an impeachment of the court party and it made them angry so the earl of warwick succeeded in obtaining an order that lord cavendish sir edwin sandys and rev nicholas ferrar as chief actors in inditing and penning an impertinent declaration containing bitter invectives and aspersions should he confined to their own houses until further notice the object of this was to prevent them from conferring with each other further hostile inquiries we1 re prosecuted and an attempt was made to detach ferrar from his associates one day as he was answering some queries before the privy council one of the lords handed him an important official letter to the governor of virginia l who draws up such papers asked the lord the company replied ferrar modestly no no interrupted another lord we know your styde these papers are all yours and they are masterpieces the letter was shown to the king who was pleased to observe verily the young man hath much worth in him to detach him from the company the king offered to make him clerk of the privy council or ambassador to the court of savoy both were fine offers for a man only in his thirtieth year but ferrar was not to be tempted then an effort was made to induce him to advise the company to surrender its charter but he refused with some scorn a great number of the nobility and gentry he said besides merchants and artisans of the city of london relying upon the royal charter had engaged in a noble enterprise one of the most honorable that england had ever undertaken many planters in virginia had risked their estates and lives in it the lord had prospered their endeavors and now no danger threatened the colony save the malice of its enemies as for himself he was not going to abuse his trust by deserting it while these things were going on the king appointed a board of commissioners to investigate the affairs of virginia and the spirit in which they were appointed is sufficiently revealed by the fact that they all belonged to tlie disaffected faction in the company and held their meetings at the house of sir thomas smith one of their number was the vindictive and unscrupulous exgovernor sir samuel argall which was much like setting the wolf to investigate the dogs some of these commissioners went out to virginia and tried to entrap the assembly into asking for a new charter it was all in vain governor council and house of burgesses agreed that they were perfectly satisfied with the present state of things and only wanted to be let alone not a morsel of evidence adverse to the present management of the company could be obtained from any quarter on the contrary the assembly sent to england an eloquent appeal afterward entitled the tragical declaration of the virginia assembly in which the early sufferings of the colony and its recent prosperity were passed in review the document concluded with an expression rather more forcible than one is accustomed to find in decorous and formal state papers after describing the kind of management under which such creatures as argall could flourish the document goes on to say rather be reduced to live under the like government we desire his majesty that commissioners may be sent over with authority to hang us long before this appeal reached england the final assault upon the company had begun in july 1623 the attorney general reported his opinion that it was advisable for the king to take the government of virginia into his own hands in october an order of the privy council announced that this was to be done the company s charter was to be rescinded and its deputed powers of sovereignty were to be resumed by the king this meant that the king would thereafter appoint the council for virginia sitting in london he would also appoint the governor of virginia with his colonial council such a transformation would leave the joint stock company in existence but only as a body of traders without ascertained rights or privileges and entirely dependent upon royal favor no settled policy could thereafter be pursued and under the circumstances the change was a death blow to the company southampton and ferrar refused to surrender and referred the question to their next quarter sessions to be held in november then the king brought suit against the company in the court of king s bench and a writ of quo warranto was served then came the most interesting moment of all the only hope of the company lay in an appeal to parliament and that last card was boldly played early in 1624 the spanish match to secure which the miserable king had for ten years basely truckled and licked the hand of england s bitterest enemy was finally broken off war with spain was imminent a new policy of helping the german protestants and marrying baby charles to a french princess was to be considered and much money was needed so james reluctantly issued writs for an election and the new parliament containing sandys and ferrar with many other members of the virginia company met in february in april a petition was presented in behalf of the virginia company and a committee had been appointed to consider it when the speaker read a message from the king forbidding parliament to meddle with the matter he distinctly announced the doctrine that the government of colonies was the business of the king and his privy council and that parliament had nothing to do with it this memorable doctrine was just that which afterwards found favor with the american colonists for very different reasons from those which recommended it to king james the americans took this view because they were not represented in parliament and intended with their colonial assemblies to hold the crown officials the royal governors in check just as parliament curbed the crown by the middle of the eighteenth century this had come to be the generally accepted american doctrine it is interesting to see it asserted early in the seventeenth by the crown itself and in the interests of absolutism in 1624 parliament was not in good condition for quarreling with the king upon too many issues at once so it acquiesced not without some grumbling in the royal prohibition and the petition of the virginia company was laid upon the table a few weeks later the case on the quo warranto was argued before the court of king s bench the attorney general s argument against the charter was truly ingenious that charter allowed the company to carry the king s subjects across the ocean to virginia if such a privilege were to be exercised without limitation it might end in conveying all the king s subjects to america leaving great britain a howling wilderness such a privilege was too great to be bestowed upon any corporate body and therefore the charter ought to be annulled such logic was irresistible and on the 16th of june the chief justice declared that the patent or charter of the company of english merchants trading to virginia and pretending to exercise a power and authority over his majesty s good subjects there should be thenceforth null and void next day thomas wentworth afterward earl of strafford gave vent to his glee in a private letter methinks i imagine the quaternity before this have had a meeting of comfort and consolation stirring up each other to bear it courageously and sir edwin sandys in the midst of them sadly sighing forth oh the burden of virginia by the quaternity he meant southampton sandys ferrar and cavendish on june 26 the privy council ordered nicholas ferrar to bring all the books and papers of the late company and hand them over to its custody ferrar could not disobey the order but he had made up his mind that the records of the company must be preserved for its justification in the eyes of posterity as soon as he saw that the day of doom was at hand he had copies made one of farrar s dearest friends was the delightful poet george herbert a young man of his own age whose widowed mother had married sir john danvers a prominent member of the company they lived in a fine old house in chelsea that had once been part of the home of sir thomas more there nicholas ferrar passed many a pleasant evening with george herbert and his eccentric and skeptical brother afterward lord herbert of cherbury and if ever their talk grew a bit too earnest and warm we can fancy it mellowed again as that other sweet poet dr donne dropped in with gentle izaak walton as used often to happen in that house of friends ferrar hid a clerk locked up with the records until they were all copied everything relating to the administrations of sandys and southampton from the election of the former in april 1619 down to june 7 1624 the copy was carefully compared with the original documents and its perfect accuracy was duly attested by the company s secretary edward collingwood sir john danvers then carried the manuscript to the earl of southampton who exclaimed as he threw his arms about his neck god bless you danvers i shall keep this with my title deeds at tichfield it is the evidence of my honor and i prize it more than the evidence of my lands about four months afterward southampton died fortythree years later in 1667 his son and successor passed away and then this precious manuscript was bought from the executors by william byrd of virginia father of the famous historian and antiquary from the byrd library it passed into the hands of william stith president of william and mary college who used it in writing his history of virginia published at williamsburg in 1747 one of the most admirable of american historical works from stith s hands the manuscript passed to his brother in law peyton randolph president of the continental congress and after his death in 1775 thomas jefferson bought it in 1814 ex president jefferson sold his library to the united states and this manuscript is now in the library of congress 741 folio pages bound in two volumes as for the original documents they are nowhere to be found among british records and when we recollect how welcome their destruction must have been to sir thomas smith to the earl of warwick and to james i we cannot help feeling that the chest of the privy council was not altogether a safe place in which to keep them it is to the copy preserved through the careful forethought of nicholas ferrar that we owe our knowledge of one of the most interesting chapters in early american history in the development of virginia the overthrow of the great london company was an event of cardinal importance for the moment it was quite naturally bewailed in virginia as a direful calamity but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise stuart despotism gained not one of its ends except the momentary gratification of spleen and self government in virginia which seemed in peril went on to take root more deeply and strongly than before john fiske

a lawsuit filed in san francisco calif federal court on wednesday says that elon musk acted unlawfully when the funding for his proposed purchase of co defendant twitter began to slip according to the shareholder complaint musk engaged in illegal market manipulation and offered to purchase securities from twitter shareholders while falsely disparaging the company in violation of the california corporations code the allegations center on musk s ongoing attempt to purchase twitter for approximately 44 billion the 42 page complaint details musk s wealth and his 90 million twitter following before delving into the timeline of what the plaintiff sees as questionable events as another lawsuit recently took issue with musk purportedly secured a windfall of approximately 156 million after he failed to timely file a federal regulatory form disclosing that he exceeded the 5 ownership threshold of twitter according to the complaint this allowed him to buy additional shares at an artificially low price among other purported missteps the complaint cites musk s pledge of his tesla stock as collateral for a 12 5 billion loan to finance the buyout the lawsuit says musk gained motive to manipulate the market when and since musk s announcement tesla s shares declined by more than 37 because the loss in their value put musk at risk of a margin call or a requirement to pump more cash into tesla he quickly acted to attempt to mitigate these personal risks to himself by engaging in unlawful conduct that moved the price of twitter s stock down the complaint states the shareholder points to purportedly untrue disparaging remarks musk tweeted about twitter including a may 13 broadcast when musk said that the deal was temporarily on hold while he looked into the true percentage of fake or bot controlled twitter accounts the complaint avers that the buyout was not on hold citing musk s contractual inability to pause the deal moreover musk s statement was misleading because it implied that buying the company was conditioned on his satisfaction in reality he specifically waived detailed due diligence as a condition precedent to his obligations under the buyout contract the complaint states musk s conduct not only harmed twitter shareholders by causing its stock to plummet by approximately 25 but also threw twitter employees into tumult the complaint adds the lawsuit points to both media coverage of the unpredictable work environment musk created as one executive put it a chaos tax while adding that musk bullied twitter employees and threatened that he would stop censoring hate speech the complaint states five counts for relief three under the california corporations code s anti fraud provisions one for declaratory and injunctive relief against twitter and musk and one for unjust enrichment against musk the plaintiff seeks to certify the lawsuit as a class action on behalf of twitter shareholders harmed by musk s alleged misconduct as well as an award of compensatory and punitive damages the plaintiff is represented by bottini bottini inc and cotchett pitre mccarthy llp

consolidated financial statements and md a have been filed on sedar and can be viewed at www sedar com or at www dynamictechgroup com the acquisition of our 50 interest in the award winning skyfly soar america patented flying theatre attraction at the island in pigeon forge tennessee was the highlight of the first quarter said guy nelson executive chairman and ceo it demonstrates our technical and creative expertise and has already contributed free cash distributions to the company which we view validates our drive towards a recurring revenue business model based on co ventures there have been unexpected delays in our re financing efforts arising from the shutdown of the city of shanghai where the lead strategic investor is based but the lifting of that shutdown appears to be on the horizon which should get our financing back on track in the meantime our senior lender has extended the next principal repayment from may 31 2022 until the earlier of june 30 2022 or 10 days after the shanghai shutdown is lifted we appreciate their ongoing support and confidence summary of first quarter consolidated results revenues decreased to 8 6 million in first quarter 2022 down 20 from first quarter 2021 ebitda loss of 0 7 million in first quarter 2022 compared to an ebitda gain of 0 2 million in first quarter 2021 the change was driven largely by reduced revenues and an elimination of the government subsidy in q1 2022 versus q1 2021 net loss in first quarter 2022 of 3 2 million versus a net loss of 3 0 million in first quarter 2021 cash generated in operating activities was 4 3

used by management creditors analysts investors and other financial stakeholders to assess the company s performance and management from a financial and operational perspective readers are cautioned that ebitda should not be considered to be more meaningful than loss before tax determined in accordance with ifrs the company continues to execute its four pronged operational plan continue to advance the company s development plans for the co venture business dynamic entertainment continue to aggressively market its parts and service division to its customers as they started the process of reactivating their theme and amusement parks dynamic attractions continue to market our innovative and very talented engineering capability to diversify the company s revenue sources beyond the attractions industry and to continue to use its engineer s knowhow to develop new media based attraction ride systems for the meta verse and large theme parks and miniaturize its product line for the smaller parks and tourist locations dynamic structures the restructuring of the ride division dynamic attractions is largely complete with the ability to scale back up once market demand improves although we do not expect this to occur until 2023 and after update on financing another accomplishment during the quarter was the repayment of 4 3 million more of our debt we have been able to reduce our debt level by over 17 million in 2021 and through to the end of march 31 2022 our refinancing initiative was moving forward but the pandemic once again affected our company because the investor group we have been negotiating with are based in china and the lead investor is based in shanghai despite the delay caused by shanghai being locked down for over six weeks it appears that shanghai will be open by mid june allowing people to leave their residences employees to return to work and the banks to resume their business activities assuming the restrictions are lifted by mid june we expect to replace our senior lender by the end of june the goals of our financing initiative have not changed which are to improve our working capital in the ride manufacturing division and provide equity and project debt for our co venture division we expect the financing initiative will reduce overall interest expense making it much more manageable going forward and change our working capital position from negative to positive in 2022 in the meantime our senior lenders have been supportive extending the principal repayment terms of their loan facilities when needed our strategic investor s interest is being driven by the company s proprietary ip ownership of 50 of skyfly backlog of co venture prospects technical and creative knowhow proven reputation of creating and delivering innovative iconic ride systems and the company s substantial tax losses to shelter future profits amendment to senior loan agreement the company has executed an amendment to its loan agreement with its senior lender to extend the due date of the principal repayment in the amount of usd 10 4 million from may 31 2022 to the earlier of i june 30 2022 and ii 10 business days after the date on which the covid 19 restrictions imposed by the governmental authorities in shanghai china that are currently in effect are lifted which are preventing the strategic investor from initiating international wire transfers update on co ventures the company continues to be bullish on its ability to penetrate the tourist location entertainment market by leveraging its world class attraction ip it is the company s view that its co venture strategy being pursued by wholly owned subsidiary dynamic entertainment is well suited to capitalize on the entertainment opportunities in a post pandemic world as pent up demand and increased customer savings seek out memorable guest experiences guest satisfaction and value will be the key success factors for popular tourist locations that choose to complement their experience with our award winning world class media based attractions the company s first co venture sky fly soar america opened july 9 2021 and has continued to enjoy very good reviews and excellent attendance at the gateway to the smoky mountains one of the most popular tourist destinations in america the attraction itself was awarded the best new attraction for 2021 by usa today s readers choice awards replicating skyfly s success is the plan for dynamic entertainment our co venture business unit the company s pipeline of co venture prospects is geographically broad and is progressing despite travel restrictions our co venture offices in toronto and orlando have been able to cover north america uk and australia effectively and our office in shanghai has allowed us to continue to develop our prospects in asia we have three senior executives in asia and this is helping to continue to advance our prospects in this area update on ride business the company has continued to focus on reducing and aligning our cost structure in our ride division with the delayed projects in our contract backlog and the slower approach to awarding new ride contracts the company has continued to reduce its cost structure significantly throughout 2021 and into the first half of 2022 in response to the reduced backlog and the lower level of sales that are expected because of

so as the fifth week of the elon musk twitter takeover drama comes to a close let s just check in on how things are progressing oh it s bad nothing good to see here this week as musk maintains that his 44 billion takeover offer remains on hold due to questions over the accuracy of twitter s claim that 5 of its active users are fake twitter itself has faced its own drama connected to the takeover push having already lost several top executives either directly or indirectly stemming from the pending change in ownership as well as former ceo jack dorsey exiting the company entirely twitter is now facing a battle over its board members with silver lake partners egon durban resigning from the board after twitter shareholders blocked his re election durban was given a twitter board seat in 2020 following a push by elliott management group to buy up twitter shares and force jack dorsey out of his position as ceo elliott s view was that dorsey was underperforming and it partnered with silver lake to put pressure on the company to either improve its bottom line or accept a change in management that lead to twitter implementing tough new revenue and growth targets which it recently admitted that it s not on track to meet in addition to his work with twitter and various other public companies durban has also been a longtime ally of elon musk and earlier this week twitter shareholders voted to stop durban from being re appointed in a move that many viewed as a statement of protest of sorts from twitter investors but as with all things elon and twitter it s not that simple today twitter itself has refused to accept durban s resignation in a statement to the sec twitter explained that durban s board re election was likely rejected by shareholders due to him also serving on the board of six other publicly traded companies durban has vowed to take a step back from these other commitments which twitter says is enough to keep him on its team as per twitter while the board does not believe that mr durban s other public company directorships will become an impediment if such engagements were to continue mr durban s commitment to reduce his board service commitment to five public company boards by the remediation date appropriately addresses the concerns raised by stockholders with regard to such engagements accordingly the board has reached the determination that accepting mr durban s tendered resignation at this time is not in the best interests of the company why does twitter want to keep durban on it s hard to say especially given that musk has noted that he ll be looking to eliminate twitter s board if when he becomes the platform s owner the inclusion of representatives from key investors however may ensure twitter maintains a level of stability in case the deal goes south and there could be another key reason to maintain the link between twitter s board and musk on another front twitter shareholders are also mulling a class action lawsuit against elon musk over his twitter takeover push based on the allegation that musk has violated california corporate laws on several fronts with his twitter acquisition commentary effectively engaging in market manipulation as reported by cnbc in one potential violation they claim that musk financially benefited by delaying required disclosures about his stake in twitter and by temporarily concealing his plan in early april to become a board member at the social network musk also snapped up shares in twitter the complaint says while he knew insider information about the company based on private conversations with board members and executives including former ceo jack dorsey a longtime friend of musk s and silver lake co ceo egon durban a twitter board member whose firm had previously invested in solarcity before tesla acquired it maybe that s why twitter wants to keep durban in house due to both his past dealings with musk which may help ease the deal through or to assist shareholders in their class action durban s current participation likely doesn t hold any additional legal clout in this respect but there may be some linkage between these two aspects of the increasingly messy twitter deal and yes there is still a possibility that the musk takeover may not happen musk himself has repeatedly and publicly vowed that he will not pay for the company unless it can convince him that its data on fake profiles is accurate though twitter maintains that there s no such thing as the deal being on hold and it s continuing to prepare for the final transaction to be approved but there may also be other complications with the sec now investigating musk s conduct in the lead up to his twitter takeover push add to that his many public criticisms and disclosures which border on market manipulation as per the proposed shareholder action and there could well be a breakpoint for musk s twitter deal where authorities simply veto the process entirely due to his conduct could that be musk s plan various analysts have suggested that musk is looking for a way out of the acquisition and while the overall sentiment is that musk will eventually be forced to pay up and take ownership of the app there are still some legal cracks that he could explore that could end the transaction which would be a disaster for twitter while investors are unhappy with musk right now especially since his various comments and critiques have tanked the stock musk walking away would leave twitter in a much lesser state with many product leaders gone and a declining share price that would be difficult to correct given the various questions raised by musk about its processes could twitter get itself back on track and back to growth if musk were to abandon his takeover push in essence musk walking away would be a big public statement that twitter is not a good investment and as the media hype dies down that could see interest in the app decline even further harming growth for potentially years to come maybe that then is musk s real intent here to harm the company so much that it has no choice but to accept a lower offer price which could save elon himself millions in his takeover bid either way right now it s not looking good and there are many moving parts that must be keeping current twitter ceo parag agrawal up at night it still seems like the elon era is coming but when exactly is a whole other question
