president joe biden has asked people to encourage unvaccinated americans to get the vaccine but he didn t start a door to door push to force people to get the shot at a july 6 press briefing president joe biden said we are continuing to wind down the mass vaccination sites that did so much in the spring to rapidly vaccinate those eager to get their first shot and their second shot for that matter if they needed a second he continued now we need to go community by community neighborhood by neighborhood and oftentimes door to door literally knocking on doors to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus since the announcement of a five point plan to get more americans vaccinated online users have claimed a door to door campaign is a tactic to target unvaccinated americans one

sure people get the covid 19 vaccine and verify reader jeff asked if the door to door checks were an enforcement tactic the question is the president ordering door to door checks to force individuals to get the covid 19 vaccine the sources the answer no president joe biden did not launch a door to door campaign to enforce or mandate the covid 19 vaccine but he is encouraging those who have been vaccinated to encourage others to get the vaccine what we found dr saralyn mark the former senior medical advisor at the white house and current lead covid 19 spokesperson for the american medical women s association told verify the bottom line is that the white house is not going door to door to enforce vaccination there s not a forced vaccination what it is it s an opportunity to educate and to engage the public there is enough data out there that shows that people tend to listen to people that they trust whether it be their neighbor their local physician pharmacist someone in their community mark said at the july 6 press briefing president joe biden laid out a five point plan to encourage individuals to get vaccinated considering mass vaccination sites would be soon going away more than 40 000 pharmacy locations offering the vaccine without an appointment easier access to the vaccine at a local doctor or healthcare provider s office access for children ages 12 to 18 to get vaccinated at a pediatrician s office encourage vaccines at a place of employment or provide services for an employer to give an employee paid time off to get vaccinated more mobile clinics at special events like concerts sporting events etc happening now president biden delivers remarks on the covid 19 response and the vaccination program the white house whitehouse july 6 2021 at a july 8 briefing press secretary jen psaki said community outreach works with vaccination rates across alabama arizona florida georgia and texas states with some of the lowest vaccination rates growing thanks to community outreach outreach meant to encourage not enforce dr howard koh with the harvard t h chan school of public health told verify if the u s is going to reach herd immunity we have to reach every person even if it s one at a time so when vaccination started in this country the initial goal was to reach millions at a time but now we re at a point where the goal is to reach one at a time and that s what this announcement is all about it s really important in this critical juncture to make sure that everybody has had a conversation with somebody they trust somebody who can provide information koh told verify and so this door to door effort is to provide information education and empowerment and having a dialogue about the facts about understanding each person and how they re feeling about vaccination and people s willingness to join to help the entire united states get this pandemic behind us is critically important right now said koh the federal government has some

be endemic in our communities and it s also a revolving situation mark said so as case rates go up restrictions may have to go up as well and that s done really at the local regional level i think it

tried sending packages of tortillas home to friends and family but they spoiled before they got there after months of experimenting ashley discovered that placing a piece of parchment paper between

the editorial board operates independently from the u t newsroom but holds itself to similar ethical standards we base our editorials and endorsements on reporting interviews and rigorous debate and strive for accuracy fairness and civility in our section disagree let us know san diego mayor todd gloria s rollout last week of his homes for all of us package to spur the construction of more and less expensive housing is welcome in that it amounts to a fresh acknowledgment of one of california s most serious problems the cost of shelter is so high that it is not just a nightmare that causes homelessness among the poor it also prevents many middle income households from being able to save money and help their children with college bills and other expenses gloria wants to update city codes to make it easier to pursue affordable housing projects in particular on city owned properties and underused or vacant commercial sites amazon s toll on retail sales creates real opportunities for creative use of vacated buildings the mayor also hopes to set up a task force to come up with ways to persuade builders to focus on less expensive homes advertisement but in the big picture what gloria is proposing is akin to many proposals from around the state in the past decade since the census bureau released statistics showing california had the highest rate of poverty in the nation because of extreme housing costs proposals that yielded few gains yes new laws and policies promoting greater density and easing rules on accessory dwelling units being added to existing home parcels have promise yet the state has never had the break glass time that uc berkeley professor carol galante called for at a 2016 housing summit in which leaders resolved to pursue bold solutions construction unions have chilled lawmakers interest in perhaps the most obvious way to add housing stock inexpensive but safe prefabricated homes that are common and popular in many parts of the world especially japan in that nation about the same amount of new housing is built each year as in the united states which has triple japan s population advances in manufacturing technology have left behind old ideas about the quality gap between conventionally built and prefab homes and even the old prefab housing wasn t that bad many of the 150 000 plus steel quonset huts the u s military cheaply and quickly erected during world war ii are still in use yet it is not just construction union members who oppose break glass solutions in 2017 then state legislative analyst mac taylor issued a report on the housing crisis with the bland title do communities adequately plan for housing but the contents were far more grim taylor offered evidence that the lack of progress on housing reflected lawmakers belief that a strong percentage of their constituents didn t want more homes built and were indifferent to the fact that the cost of shelter hammered millions of their fellow state residents unless californians are convinced of the benefits of significantly more home building targeted at meeting housing demand at every income level no state intervention is likely to make significant progress on addressing the state s housing challenges taylor wrote this gets to one of the most fundamental contradictions of the golden state the failure by many to grasp how the housing and climate change crises are interrelated for years environmentalists have noted that having denser housing closer to work hubs is crucial to limiting greenhouse gas emissions you can t be pro environment and anti housing usc urban planning expert marlon boarnet told the los angeles times in 2017 you can t be anti sprawl and anti housing until such logic becomes clear to more californians the shelter status quo will endure those who oppose new housing but see themselves as environmentalists aren t doing the planet any favors

democrats are adding 10 billion to the pending 3 5 trillion reconciliation bill to help hide their huge amnesties from worried voters according to a report in axios the extra money would provide democrats with a 10 billion talking point to fend off criticism from local voters who recognize how an amnesty of roughly 8 million economic migrants would damage their wages wealth and communities sen ben ray lujan d nm a member of the senate budget committee road tested the rhetoric at axios com saying i ve consistently advocated for making smart modern investments when it comes to border security the spending would fund modernization of ports at our border and would require drug screening of passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles that come into the united states axios described the democrats plan for the next few weeks why it matters democrats already planned to include roughly 120 billion for pathways to citizenship for dreamers temporary protected status holders and undocumented essential workers the sources said there will be even more to address immigration with more direct infrastructure ties but even the 10 billion fig leaf would be covertly designed to accelerate migration into americans jobs neighborhoods and civic life axios reported what we re hearing details haven t been finalized but the funds could be put toward facilities for handling asylum claims additional staff for higher cross border traffic areas expanding immigration courts to address backlogs alternatives to detention programs and various ports of entry repairs three sources familiar with the negotiations say the 10 billion spending plan comes as the biden administration refuses to build any more border wall with money that congress formally appropriated in 2019 and 2020 the extra 10 billion is just one of the many ways in which the giant budget bill is used to hide the amnesty under massive spending programs for government healthcare daycare for children education programs for adults as well as a variety of climate related spending programs the democrats are hiding the amnesty in the gigantic spending plan because they do not have public support for their radical migration and amnesty agenda but also they do not want to offer concessions that would win over public support for careful amnesties so senate democrats want to pass their amnesties by burying them in a bill that sets spending levels under the no filibuster reconciliation process this maneuver could allow them to pass a fast track nation changing amnesty with just 51 votes instead of the 60 votes normally required to get bills through the 100 member senate the task is difficult in part because the senate rules say that a senior clerk in the senate must first ok the proposed spending as directly related to budgets the clerk titled the parliamentarian can reject pieces of the bill if they are related to policy debates instead of budget allocations so far no gop senator has broken ranks to say he will give for the democratic amnesty largely because the amnesty would raise government spending and eventually provide democrats will millions of voters democrats are going to do the best that we can to include amnesties in the spending plan sen bernie sanders i vt said in a july 20 interview with pbs well we re trying to cover people who have been in the forefront among other things of protecting our economy critical care workers dreamers and others i have believed for a long time as i think almost all the members of the democratic caucus and some republicans that the time is long overdue to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship so we can t do it completely the way i would like to do it in a reconciliation bill there are real constraints in terms of policy what you can do we re going to do the best that we can i believe we can draft a bill to get it done budget chief rep john yarmuth d ky tweeted on july 20 after the daca court ruling congress must step up as a member of the 2013 gang of 8 i am committed to comprehensive immigration reform as house budget chairman i believe we can draft a bill to get it done after all immigration through reconciliation has happened before rep john yarmuth repjohnyarmuth july 20 2021 even if the parliamentarian does strike the amnesty from the budget the 10 billion for border construction will likely remain a source told breitbart news overall investors want to import more migrants even very poor migrants because they spike consumer sales boost rental rates cut wages and so raise profits and stock values they also serve as clients for welfare agencies as eventually as voters for democrat activists but migration damages ordinary americans career opportunities cuts their wages raises their rents curbs their productivity shrinks their political clout and fractures their open minded equality promoting civic culture in general legal and illegal migration moves wealth from employees to employers from families to investors from young to old from children to their parents from homebuyers to investors from technology to stoop labor biden s decision to restart the economic extraction of valuable consumers renters and workers from poor countries also helps move wealth and social status from heartland red states to the coastal blue states within each state the extraction policy also helps move wealth and status from gop rural districts to democrat cities unsurprisingly a lopsided majority of americans oppose labor migration
president joe biden has asked people to encourage unvaccinated americans to get the vaccine but he didn t start a door to door push to force people to get the shot at a july 6 press briefing president joe biden said we are continuing to wind down the mass vaccination sites that did so much in the spring to rapidly vaccinate those eager to get their first shot and their second shot for that matter if they needed a second he continued now we need to go community by community neighborhood by neighborhood and oftentimes door to door literally knocking on doors to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus since the announcement of a five point plan to get more americans vaccinated online users have claimed a door to door campaign is a tactic to target unvaccinated americans one claim came from amy tarkanian former chairwoman of the nevada gop and wife of danny tarkanian an attorney and douglas county nevada commissioner biden just said that the government will be going door to door checking up on people who have not been vaccinated i did nazi that coming amy tarkanian mrst106 july 6 2021 verify viewer bee also asked is the president ordering door to door checks to make sure people get the covid 19 vaccine and verify reader jeff asked if the door to door checks were an enforcement tactic the question is the president ordering door to door checks to force individuals to get the covid 19 vaccine the sources the answer no president joe biden did not launch a door to door campaign to enforce or mandate the covid 19 vaccine but he is encouraging those who have been vaccinated to encourage others to get the vaccine what we found dr saralyn mark the former senior medical advisor at the white house and current lead covid 19 spokesperson for the american medical women s association told verify the bottom line is that the white house is not going door to door to enforce vaccination there s not a forced vaccination what it is it s an opportunity to educate and to engage the public there is enough data out there that shows that people tend to listen to people that they trust whether it be their neighbor their local physician pharmacist someone in their community mark said at the july 6 press briefing president joe biden laid out a five point plan to encourage individuals to get vaccinated considering mass vaccination sites would be soon going away more than 40 000 pharmacy locations offering the vaccine without an appointment easier access to the vaccine at a local doctor or healthcare provider s office access for children ages 12 to 18 to get vaccinated at a pediatrician s office encourage vaccines at a place of employment or provide services for an employer to give an employee paid time off to get vaccinated more mobile clinics at special events like concerts sporting events etc happening now president biden delivers remarks on the covid 19 response and the vaccination program the white house whitehouse july 6 2021 at a july 8 briefing press secretary jen psaki said community outreach works with vaccination rates across alabama arizona florida georgia and texas states with some of the lowest vaccination rates growing thanks to community outreach outreach meant to encourage not enforce dr howard koh with the harvard t h chan school of public health told verify if the u s is going to reach herd immunity we have to reach every person even if it s one at a time so when vaccination started in this country the initial goal was to reach millions at a time but now we re at a point where the goal is to reach one at a time and that s what this announcement is all about it s really important in this critical juncture to make sure that everybody has had a conversation with somebody they trust somebody who can provide information koh told verify and so this door to door effort is to provide information education and empowerment and having a dialogue about the facts about understanding each person and how they re feeling about vaccination and people s willingness to join to help the entire united states get this pandemic behind us is critically important right now said koh the federal government has some policies that affect each individual such as wearing masks on public transportation or in government buildings but the white house would not order individuals to enforce the vaccine one household at a time according to mark the states have a lot of responsibility and a lot of authority to help their local communities now i ve always seen this pandemic to be regional that different parts of the country as well as parts of the world would experience it differently at different times i saw the pandemic also being rolling meaning that we probably will see this virus for a very long time it will be endemic in our communities and it s also a revolving situation mark said so as case rates go up restrictions may have to go up as well and that s done really at the local regional level i think it s important to realize that we have to be nimble we have to be able to adapt and local communities and grassroots organizations and state level organizations can do that very well and very effectively

eliminated in 2023 the legislature will set up a committee to review the state s drug laws over the next two years to come up with a long term fix if no fix is implemented by 2023 the state would end all prosecutions for simple drug possession environmenttwo of the biggest bills attempting to fight climate change passed the legislature this session although neither goes into effect immediately the cap and trade program sets a cap on carbon and greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023 the largest polluters in the state would need to clean up to meet the cap or purchase allowances from the

clean fuels standard would require transportation fuels in the state such as those for cars trucks boats trains and aircraft to be cleaner over time starting in 2023 polluters must start reducing their emissions a little each year in order to hit a statewide goal of emissions 20 percent lower than 2017 levels by 2038 another new law aimed at creating a cleaner environment would require the

to meet an ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2045 california s policymakers are relying in part on forests and shrublands to remove co 2 from the atmosphere but researchers at the university of california irvine warn that future climate change may limit the ecosystem s ability to perform this service in a paper published today in the american geophysical union journal agu advances the uci earth system scientists stressed that rising temperatures and uncertain precipitation will cause a decrease in california s natural carbon storage capacity of as much as 16 percent under an extreme climate projection and of nearly 9 percent under a more moderate scenario this work highlights the conundrum that climate change poses to the state of california said lead author shane coffield a uci ph d candidate in earth system science we need our forests and other plant covered areas to provide a natural climate solution of removing carbon dioxide from the air but heat and drought caused by the very problem we re trying to solve could make it more difficult to achieve our objectives trees and plants draw co 2 from the atmosphere when they photosynthesize and some of the carbon ends up stored in their biomass or the soil california s climate strategy depends in part on enhanced carbon storage to offset some of the emissions from transportation power generation and other sources the combination of this natural carbon sequestration system and measures to promote green energy is hoped to help the state reach its target of not contributing net carbon to the environment by 2045 but the uci scientists suggest that an even more aggressive approach to curtailing emissions may be necessary the emissions scenario that we follow will have a large effect on the carbon storage potential of our forests said co author james randerson who holds the ralph j carol m cicerone chair in earth system science at uci a more moderate emissions scenario in which we convert to more renewable energy sources leads to about half of the ecosystem carbon loss compared to a more extreme emissions scenario coffield said that current climate models are not in agreement about california s future precipitation but it s probable that the northern part of the state will get wetter and the southern part drier he also said that coastal areas of central and northern california and low and mid elevation mountain areas sites of large offset projects are the most likely to lose some of their carbon sequestration powers over the next several decades in addition the researchers were able to estimate the effects of climate change on specific tree species they project that coast redwoods will be constrained to the far northern part of their range by the end of the century and that hotter drier conditions will favor oak trees at the expense of conifers while the study used statistical modeling to peer into the future of the state s ecosystems the research also highlights the importance of present day drought and wildfire as key mechanistic drivers of carbon sequestration losses other studies have estimated that the 2012 2015 drought killed more than 40 percent of ponderosa pines in the sierra nevada range another issue the researchers describe is the loss of trees from california s worsening wildfire situation we hope that this work will inform land management and climate policies so that steps can be taken to protect existing carbon stocks and tree species in the most climate vulnerable locations randerson said effective management of fire risk is essential for limiting carbon losses throughout much of the state joining coffield and randerson on this project were kyle hemes from the stanford woods institute for the environment at stanford university charles koven from the climate ecosystem sciences division at lawrence berkeley national laboratory and michael goulden uci professor of earth system science and ecology evolutionary biology the study received funding from the national science foundation the uc national laboratory fees research program and the california strategic growth council s climate change research program
in this aug 15 2012 file photo three variations of the ar 15 assault rifle are displayed at the california department of justice in sacramento hill is the ceo of reelcamo girl a community of women who have a passion for the outdoors she lives in poway last month the honorable roger t benitez issued a lengthy decision in the u s district court case miller v bonta declaring california s assault weapons laws unconstitutional while gun rights advocates cheered others stoked fears of california streets being flooded with so called assault weapons but as judge benitez stated in his decision this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes advertisement so what exactly is the big deal about assault weapons the pervasive message in the media is that assault weapons particularly the popular ar 15 which stands for armalite rifle its original manufacturer not assault rifle are deadlier than your average firearm the reality it is a semi automatic rifle that functions just like all semi automatic firearms one trigger pull equals one round fired best estimates conclude that semi automatic firearms make up at least 50 percent of all firearms in the united states functionally they are the same as almost all civilian owned firearms including revolvers bolt actions lever actions and pump actions one pull of its trigger results in one round fired the ar 15 s popularity among shooting enthusiasts comes from its ability to be modular fully customizable from top to bottom including stock length barrel length trigger style all the way down to the firing pin people afraid of ar 15s will tell you that its adaptability makes it deadlier for a criminal intending to cause harm but they ignore that this is the very thing that makes it a more effective self defense tool for self protectors of all sizes and statures particularly women who on average are shorter smaller and weaker than men its light weight and low recoil make it easier to handle and its barrel length makes it easier to shoot more accurately than a handgun combined these features make it optimal for the defense of my home and my family particularly in the not so far fetched scenario of multiple invaders advertisement this is my ideal defensive tool in a home invasion the u s department of justice reports that over 1 million burglaries occur each year with people inside the home and 26 percent of those people become the victim of a violent crime having access to the most effective self defense tool in existence a firearm and the easiest style to use a rifle gives me the best fighting chance to protect myself and my children the first time i held an ar 15 i could immediately see its advantages the collapsible stock meant that it could fit both me and my taller larger husband without any permanent modifications that adjustability allows both of us to reach the grip and trigger properly on the same firearm if needed with a single adjustment of the stock this feature and other cosmetic features prohibited by the california assault weapons control act allows me to use this firearm more easily and more importantly more safely i have struggled with finding guns that fit me since most guns are designed for the average man s hand proper fit is critical and it s important for each person to find what fits him or her best advertisement i have worked with many women who were initially intimidated by the thought of using an ar 15 they d heard the misrepresentations of its capabilities and worried that it would be too much to handle but when they worked up the courage to try one they loved its ease of use and low recoil and wondered why they hadn t tried it sooner i often hear the question why does anyone need an ar 15 women are painfully aware of the possibility of rape assault and being seen by criminals as easy targets but having access to one of the most effective self defense tools allows me to breathe a little easier the negative narrative about guns ignores the hundreds of thousands possibly millions of lives that they save each year firearms have been nicknamed the great equalizer because they give those who are most vulnerable a fighting chance to defend their lives being able to train and empower women is why this lawsuit is so important to me

needed to begin the bond buying taper however policymakers are expected to discuss the tapering plan going forward at next week s meeting and a signal toward a reduction in asset purchases before the end of the year is likely to lift the greenback nevertheless gold could stay resilient if a hawkish shift in the fed s policy outlook triggers a selloff in us stocks on the other hand the fed could opt out to adopt a more cautious tone due to the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus delta variant and weigh heavily on the usd by hinting at a possible delay in tapering on thursday the us bureau

treasury secretary janet yellen on friday warned congress that if u s lawmakers are unable to raise or extend the debt ceiling by aug 2 her department will have to take extraordinary measures in her letter to house speaker nancy pelosi yellen urged leaders to raise the federal debt limit as soon as possible or risk irreparable harm to the u s economy and the livelihoods of all americans the debt ceiling does not directly impact government spending but it sets a limit to how much debt the government can take on the treasury often takes what it calls extraordinary measures to avoid breaching the debt limit the united states so far has never defaulted on its debt however recent history shows that getting uncomfortably close to it can create chaos in 2011 house republicans refusal to pass a debt ceiling increase led to a downgrade of the u s sovereign credit rating that upset financial markets cnbc reported even the threat of failing to meet those obligations has caused detrimental impacts in the past including the sole credit rating downgrade in the history of the nation in 2011 yellen wrote to pelosi this is why no president or treasury secretary of either party has ever countenanced even the suggestion of a default on any obligation of the united states a default on the national debt could upend trillions of dollars in u s global commerce and financial holdings triggering a financial crisis we certainly expect congress to act in a bipartisan manner as they did three times under the prior administration to raise the debt limit jen psaki white house press secretary said on friday

critics say ventilation standards should be key part of ontario s back to school plan back to video this week the province s covid 19 science advisory table joined the chorus of experts education unions and parents calling for more attention to the importance of ventilation in preventing the transmission of the virus in schools article content the report said ensuring adequate air quality by upgrading hvac systems was one of the permanent changes schools needed to make along with vaccinations excluding students and staff with covid 19 symptoms from school hand hygiene and cleaning education minister stephen lecce has acknowledged the importance of the issue and says he s proud of his government s investments to improve ventilation at schools and to provide portable air filters for some classrooms advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics say it s not enough and are calling for standards that would apply to all schools the ontario government gave best practice guidance to school boards last year about how to improve ventilation and air quality but it s difficult to get a full picture of what has been done and what still needs to be done at schools across the province there s no consistency either for example lecce points with approval to schools in toronto where portable air filters were purchased for every classroom that s not the case at schools elsewhere what we ve seen so far are general guidelines and best practices but not real standards said ndp mpp marit stiles her party s education critic we need the government to be clear on the outcomes for reporting and we need to actually have assurances that each and every classroom that our kids will be in will meet those standards advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content boards have been working very hard to try to do the best they can with what has to be pretty limited resources it s pretty clear that we need to do more and we need to do it very very quickly the science table report recommended a systematic approach to identifying and prioritizing schools for ventilation upgrades as a starting point schools that don t meet the minimum ventilation guidelines from the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae should be given priority for upgrades the report said schools could consider exceeding that ashrae standard in rooms where more aerosols are likely to be generated such as music rooms auditoriums cafeterias and gyms the report said advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the report also provided technical guidance better ventilation alone won t prevent the transmission of the virus the report noted but it s one of the key layers that work together to make schools healthier and to reduce the risk of infection caitlin clark a spokesperson for lecce did not respond directly to questions on whether the province would implement the recommendations in the report whether standards on ventilation would be included in the school reopening plan and whether the government had identified how many schools now met ashrae standards clark said the government took the issue of air ventilation seriously and listed things that had already been done that includes 100 million provided for schools to make immediate improvements to ventilation systems and to buy air filters and 450 million awarded through the canada infrastructure program for 2 052 ventilation related projects at 1 670 schools and childcares located in the same buildings many of those projects are being done this summer including some at ottawa school boards advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content ventilation or air quality improvements have been made at all schools clark said that could include installing higher quality filters recalibrating hvac systems to increase the amount of outside air flow and repairing or replacing hvac equipment clark said 55 000 portable air filtration units had been purchased with 25 000 of them at schools in ottawa and the greater toronto area there are 4 844 schools in ontario part of the challenge is that there has been little attention paid in any sector to the importance of indoor air quality said jeffrey siegel a professor of civil engineering at the university of toronto who specializes in the subject area siegel is one of the co authors of the science table report on school reopening advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it s complex calls to improve ventilation are easy to state harder to do depending on the school siegel said he believes schools should meet the ashrae standards and even exceed them during a pandemic there are practical challenges the ashrae standards are embedded in building codes for new structures but there is no requirement that hvac systems be continually upgraded siegel said a school must comply with the ventilation standard in place at the time of construction there is no law requiring continuing to meet the standard and also the standard changes over time siegel also said he supported purchasing portable air filters for all classrooms calling the idea a no brainer the units clean the air and remove harmful particles advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the new york city public school system recently announced that every classroom would be equipped with two air purifiers next fall portable air filters are relatively cheap siegel said at around 500 plus new filters adding perhaps 200 a year they can be noisy and must be installed properly siegel also said it would be helpful for ontario to provide information to school boards about what devices worked to improve air quality and to provide training to building facility staff a wide variety of devices that companies claim improve air quality are marketed aggressively including to schools but many of them have no proven benefit he said jmiller postmedia com

president joe biden has asked people to encourage unvaccinated americans to get the vaccine but he didn t start a door to door push to force people to get the shot at a july 6 press briefing president joe biden said we are continuing to wind down the mass vaccination sites that did so much in the spring to rapidly vaccinate those eager to get their first shot and their second shot for that matter if they needed a second he continued now we need to go community by community neighborhood by neighborhood and oftentimes door to door literally knocking on doors to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus since the announcement of a five point plan to get more americans vaccinated online users have claimed a door to door campaign is a tactic to target unvaccinated americans one claim came from amy tarkanian former chairwoman of the nevada gop and wife of danny tarkanian an attorney and douglas county nevada commissioner biden just said that the government will be going door to door checking up on people who have not been vaccinated i did nazi that coming amy tarkanian mrst106 july 6 2021 verify viewer bee also asked is the president ordering door to door checks to make sure people get the covid 19 vaccine and verify reader jeff asked if the door to door checks were an enforcement tactic the question is the president ordering door to door checks to force individuals to get the covid 19 vaccine the sources the answer no president joe biden did not launch a door to door campaign to enforce or mandate the covid 19 vaccine but he is encouraging those who have been vaccinated to encourage others to get the vaccine what we found dr saralyn mark the former senior medical advisor at the white house and current lead covid 19 spokesperson for the american medical women s association told verify the bottom line is that the white house is not going door to door to enforce vaccination there s not a forced vaccination what it is it s an opportunity to educate and to engage the public there is enough data out there that shows that people tend to listen to people that they trust whether it be their neighbor their local physician pharmacist someone in their community mark said at the july 6 press briefing president joe biden laid out a five point plan to encourage individuals to get vaccinated considering mass vaccination sites would be soon going away more than 40 000 pharmacy locations offering the vaccine without an appointment easier access to the vaccine at a local doctor or healthcare provider s office access for children ages 12 to 18 to get vaccinated at a pediatrician s office encourage vaccines at a place of employment or provide services for an employer to give an employee paid time off to get vaccinated more mobile clinics at special events like concerts sporting events etc happening now president biden delivers remarks on the covid 19 response and the vaccination program the white house whitehouse july 6 2021 at a july 8 briefing press secretary jen psaki said community outreach works with vaccination rates across alabama arizona florida georgia and texas states with some of the lowest vaccination rates growing thanks to community outreach outreach meant to encourage not enforce dr howard koh with the harvard t h chan school of public health told verify if the u s is going to reach herd immunity we have to reach every person even if it s one at a time so when vaccination started in this country the initial goal was to reach millions at a time but now we re at a point where the goal is to reach one at a time and that s what this announcement is all about it s really important in this critical juncture to make sure that everybody has had a conversation with somebody they trust somebody who can provide information koh told verify and so this door to door effort is to provide information education and empowerment and having a dialogue about the facts about understanding each person and how they re feeling about vaccination and people s willingness to join to help the entire united states get this pandemic behind us is critically important right now said koh the federal government has some policies that affect each individual such as wearing masks on public transportation or in government buildings but the white house would not order individuals to enforce the vaccine one household at a time according to mark the states have a lot of responsibility and a lot of authority to help their local communities now i ve always seen this pandemic to be regional that different parts of the country as well as parts of the world would experience it differently at different times i saw the pandemic also being rolling meaning that we probably will see this virus for a very long time it will be endemic in our communities and it s also a revolving situation mark said so as case rates go up restrictions may have to go up as well and that s done really at the local regional level i think it s important to realize that we have to be nimble we have to be able to adapt and local communities and grassroots organizations and state level organizations can do that very well and very effectively

rodney crowell swings for the fences on his new album triage but he does it in a surprisingly unassuming way taking on topics including religion climate change and political and social upheaval crowell deftly weaves those ambitious themes into an album that s chock full of his inimitable brand of lyrical wit wisdom and a one of a kind observational sensibility about the world the human race and its foibles standout tracks including transient global amnesia blues something has to change i m all about love and hymn 43 which features crowell s ex wife rosanne cash her husband john leventhal and their son jacob leventhal ruminate on universal themes crowell addresses them in intimate personal ways gently probing into issues including greed apathy and how they impact the world religion environmental concerns and the overall arcing question of just how should we treat each other and the planet and while the subject matter is inherently difficult crowell manages to present it all in a low key manner as if to say come on guys we can all do better than this triage drops on friday july 23 and crowell spoke to taste of country in advance of the release in a wide ranging phone conversation crowell is the kind of interviewee who prefaces each new interaction with several minutes of personal back and forth about things that are unrelated to selling his current project when he finally comes around to the subject at hand the iconic singer songwriter says somewhat sheepishly i m wasting your time how can i be of service to you the resulting conversation follows taste of country well we should probably talk about the triage album rodney crowell let s do it this goes back to before the pandemic what was the first song you wrote for the project something has to change which i don t know if you d call it a lead single anymore i guess it s a lead track but that was a song that i had written a couple of years before on new year s eve 2018 i started working on the lyrics to the title track triage just filling up a notebook writing some pretty good lines and a lot of bad lines that were never destined to be but just to open up a flow and once that kicked in and songs like here goes nothing came in on the heels of it the songs started lining up kinda like a landing pattern at the airport like here they come they re coming in as that process went on i began to realize that the original version of something has to change was not on the same level as the new songs coming in so i took it apart and reimagined it and made it fit into the flow so triage would the song that triggered the album but something has to change was already there what was it about writing triage that made you realize it was an anchor track for an album claudia and i were somewhere down in the caribbean and you know you never really unplug from it i have a notebook and i m just writing writing and re writing and i began to sense that it s kind of intuitive i m going to need to work on really grounding the language that is coming to me mind you triage was originally i wanted to write something in honor of my friend joe henry who was a songwriter producer who i had worked with a good bit he d had a health crisis and he handled it admirably and inspirationally and i wanted to give him a song and if you know joe henry at all you know that he deserves your best i was drawing on that very hard to articulate the notion of universal love that a lot of religions have tried to substantiate over the years and a lot has been written in different forms to get some sort of language to what is unknowable or what you can t prove which in joe s case was a life threatening thing that he survived and quite well and based on his belief in himself and a higher call that s a long winded backstory way of saying that i sensed if i was going to write the songs that were knocking on the door i had to dedicate myself to really grounding the language so that if you have no interest in this subject and you just wanna flow along with the music and the sound of it all i wouldn t be asking you to suspend your disbelief i have to make this as concrete as i can in order for it to be valid in your song by song notes that you wrote for this album you state that monotheism climate change and cultural divide were three of the things that were most on your mind how do you even go about trying to tackle such gigantic subject matter in a song i would say carefully honestly maybe that s a more succinct way of saying what i just went the long way around of trying to articulate to write these songs very carefully because of the overwhelmingly complex even mystical side of the whole thing it s like do you believe in god yeah well prove it show me something that kind of thing and every take on it there are so many imaginable and unimaginable takes on the concepts that i m dealing with climate catastrophe as bill gates put it in his book right down to the catastrophe of human beings being so damn divided based on unsubstantiated information and i m one more guy putting out his ideology in the form of these songs how do we know what i have to say is the be all and end all i can t claim that it is or anyone else but i certainly can for myself and i ve found in writing songs that when i ve done a better job the songs work for other people and a song when it s well written it s no longer my song if it really works for them then it s their song or their relationship with that song but if i get it right for me then my belief or perhaps my hope is that if it resonates with someone else then the song becomes theirs which is all the more reason to be careful writing it you must experience this phenomenon that every writer experiences where you write one thing and someone else hears a different thing altogether they take what you wrote and turn it in a way that maybe isn t what you intended but that s what they think your song is about i experienced it early on i wrote a song long ago called i ain t living long like this and in it there s a line that says dad drove a stock car to an early death and my daddy said you know so and so asked me if i really died in a stock car did you really die in a stock car i mean that brought it home right there because people are going to interpret things in so many ways that are out of my control but i still have a job to do which is make it the best i can in some ways what people make of these songs once they re out there is none of my business there s nothing i can change when the pandemic hit you dropped some tracks and wrote some new ones which tracks pre date the pandemic and which ones came after i can go down the line let s see don t leave me now was pre pandemic triage pre pandemic transient global amnesia blues it was oct 9 2020 when that happened so that was the last song to go on the record and i wrote it and recorded it in a matter of a couple of days one little bird pre pandemic something has to change pre pandemic i m all about love pre pandemic here goes nothing pre pandemic the girl on the street was post but it s a song i wrote a few years back by then we were socially distanced so the actual production of that particular track is a bit different because it began with me recording just the vocal guitar performance and from that point on it was file sharing the drummer on it lives just up the way from me and so i could walk down to his place and i sat with him and we formed the drum pattern to go with it but after that we emailed it out and spoke by telephone to those who were contributing to it and that s how we put that together hymn 43 the pandemic was full on and i was working on my studio and i rang up john leventhal and said hey have you got any melodies that you want some words written to i m working on something and he said yeah i m interested in writing hymns right now melodically so i said send me something he sent me a melodic guitar piece and i wrote the words to it and recorded it and sent it back to him he put the rest on it including his wife rosanne and their son jake last but not least this body isn t all that i am was pre pandemic so what s the tally 7 3 yes once we started the process the pandemic also gave me the chance to consider a couple of things that i d recorded that were a bit preachy i was pontificating in a couple of songs and i came to understand that i was culling them and elbowed them out if not for the pandemic i might have wrapped this up and put it out when i had a moment to breathe i said ah i can see the error of my ways here you talk about the theme of universal love for this album and in the song i m all about love you stick a seemingly random cast of characters together as things and people that you love what was the intent behind that the intent behind that is in some of the aspects of buddhism that i put into practice i can t claim to be buddhist but i have read pretty extensively into what buddhism is and there s a lot of forms that it takes and i think that in the better part of any religion although i shun religion for the most part because it just seems to be such a controlling thing the concept being that if you believe in god then you have a responsibility some would say to see god in someone else even your enemy that was the central theme you know i don t like vladimir putin and i don t like donald trump but if i truly live by the golden rule of trying to see the deity in every human being every tree every animal then you ve got to put up or shut up cause it s really easy for to write a song in which i claim to love greta thunberg and vladimir putin in the same breath i wouldn t necessarily tell you that i live it but i can certainly write a song about it with a little nod and wink and a sense of humor about it you mentioned hymn 43 it s a pretty essential track on this record you could call it a skeptic s prayer almost it expresses some uncommon thoughts on the subject what was driving you when you wrote the lyrics i think you ve got the gist of it john and i were talking about a hymn and i grew up down in houston and my mother was pretty devout pentecostal sneaking around to drink beer from time to time but you know spoke in tongues and mostly adhered to the principles and more power to her i grew up in it and around it and pretty early i developed skepticism about it because there s a lot of show business involved in it which allowed me to step back a little bit from it so for me to write a hymn and be as truthful as i could about it you know so much about the teachings of jesus the simplest things about do unto others and ye who are without sin cast the first stone all of that stuff is solid spiritual wisdom it s what religion has done with the teaching that i m so skeptical of the original teaching i m with you i m down as far as for my soul to be saved all i have to do is confess and turn it over to the hierarchy of the church and everything s gonna be all good and i m gonna get into heaven i don t think so at the same time i don t have the final say on anything it might be very well that the folks who ve been perpetuating that doctrine for so long they may be right i can t say they re not right but it doesn t feel right to me a phrase that jumped out of the lyrics that i wrote down as i was listening is endless war human beings have been fighting each other all down through history over concepts that can t be proven the current divide between the left and right so much of the ideology is driven by doctrine that if i understand the basic spiritual principles of love thy neighbor more than thyself however that goes whatever religion is perpetuating certainly does not line up with that doctrine it perpetuates a kind of hatred which is so contrary to what i think i understand of the lessons of two thousand years ago however it was received wherever the wisdom was coming from whether it was coming from the buddha or the ancient chinese mystics it was never about hatred it was never about black and white divides and i don t mean that in terms of race i just mean you re wrong i m right end of story now let s fight it s hard to resolve it it really is and i could sit there and say okay now you re writing these songs and you re making some sort of attempt to resolve at least your take on all of this wow who do you think you are that could be the subtitle triage who do i think i am what do you hope the listener takes away from this collection of songs a sense of peace and a sense of harmony and in particular if i thought that the listener would move ever closer to some sort of harmony with nature with the planet with the trees with the grass with the birds then i would have succeeded at what i set out to do this planet that we live on that s so benevolent and so giving all you have to is walk outside and there s the sunshine bringing warmth and making things grow and yet we human beings take all of this so for granted and in our unconscious way treat it like a trash can it may be an over simplification or a pipe dream on my part but all i can tell you is i take the work as seriously as i can and i have a lot of gratitude that all of these years i ve made a living writing these songs and that there are still people who will follow me and people such as yourself who will let me speak and try to help me make sense of what it is and translate that out there into the world so thank you

earnings and unit costs excluding fuel and as usual we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable gaap and non gaap measures in today s earnings release over to you ben ben minicucci chief operating officer thanks emily and good morning everyone the results we published this quarter showed that we are successfully rebuilding our company and returning to profitability as emily shared our second quarter pre tax loss was 3 lining us close to breakeven as we had initially forecast during our q1 call margins improved significantly during the quarter as we exited march with a 41 loss and closed june with a pre tax income of 14 our q2 adjusted pre tax margin is the best in the industry among carriers who have reported so far this quarter we hit several milestones that validate our strategy is working the first milestone was our return to profitability exiting the quarter with solid double digit margins the second is that our business returned to positive cash flow generation of 351 million excluding any psp grant funding third we used our strong liquidity position to begin to delever bringing debt to cap down 6 points from the prior quarter to 56 and lastly with the strong return of passenger demand our productivity levels rebounded to near 2019 levels underlying these achievements is a dramatic return in leisure demand that began to gain momentum in march to a lesser extent business travel demand has been increasing more recently as well air group s passenger enplanements progressed from down 34 in april to down 18 in july we are consistently flying about 110 000 passengers per day and forward bookings are approximately 85 of 2019 normalized levels this progress and our second quarter results give us confidence that the worst of the downturn is behind us but the impact of the delta variant may pose some risk in the recovery trajectory to date we are seeing no signs of demand slowing but we will continue to watch booking trends carefully so that we can appropriately match capacity with demand with that in mind our plan is to return to 100 of 2019 flying levels by no later than the summer of 2022 however given that the recent surge in demand has been consistently strong and has not shown signs of slowing we may accelerate our return to pre covid levels accordingly to create flexibility for that faster ramp up in capacity we are planning to reactivate approximately 10 airbus aircraft and begin flying them this fall and winter this temporary return of several airbus airplanes allows us to create capacity quickly and protects against unforeseen events that could be outside of our control such as supply chain disruptions last quarter we spoke about deleveraging our cost structure fleet plans and commercial tailwinds to move back to a path of sustained profitability quickly it s clear from this quarter s financial results that our approach to managing the business is working for q2 we expect our pre tax margin load factor and unit revenues to be near the top of the industry as a result of our disciplined approach to capacity with growing passenger counts our productivity has increased one and a half times between march and june and is expected to be within a few points of 2019 levels in july and beyond this sets us up well to further close the gap on 2019 casmex levels as we look forward to the next six months we expect to deliver double digit margins throughout the third quarter and high single digit margins in the fourth quarter it s also worth noting that the gap between our 2021 and 2019 margins is closing each quarter i m proud of how quickly we ve returned to profitability and how as shane will detail we have begun reinforcing the fortress balance sheet that has been a hallmark of our business for many years our financial strength sets us up well for sustainable growth in the future impressively our operation performed near the top of the industry in on time arrivals and completion rates even with the rapid return in traffic during the quarter at our seattle hub where our flying is essentially back to 2019 levels already we have found that entry level labor pools are limited making hiring a challenge particularly for ramp workers with this staffing pressure along with record breaking heat waves during the quarter have put stress on our operations yet through these challenges we ve delivered for our guests with caring service creative solutions and teamwork i want to recognize the incredible efforts of our employees across the operation including airports ground handling contact centers in flight flight operations and maintenance teams many of whom have covered extra shifts to keep our operation and guest moving as peak summer travel got underway even our back office management employees at all levels have jumped in to help the operation in the past couple of months one of the things i truly love about this company is our culture and how our employees support each other and take care of our guests no matter what it takes while it is inevitable that we will encounter new challenges and uncertainty as the recovery advances our momentum continues to build our measured deployment of capacity allows us to maximize financial results while allowing our operations to scale up successfully it s exciting to see air group s progress as we rebuild our network and operation harvest savings from cost and productivity initiatives and reinforce our strong balance sheet i am confident that this is exactly the strong foundation we need to further grow our partnerships with oneworld america leverage our 737 fleet order and launch our upcoming commercial initiatives and with that i ll turn it over to andrew andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer thanks ben and it s great to be with you all again my comments this morning are going to center around three areas first we re going to be talking about our second quarter revenue performance but i ll focus on sequential monthly improvements in revenue versus quarter over quarter so that the trajectory of our revenue recovery is clear second i will provide capacity and revenue guidance for the third quarter and then lastly i ll be touching on revenue initiatives that are getting ready to take effect or will be rolled out in the future to further enhance our revenue performance starting with revenue this quarter our second quarter revenues were 1 5 billion down 33 from 2019 but nearly double the revenue we generated in the first quarter as ben shared this reflects material increases in passenger volumes as well as sequential improvement in yields this quarter we flew 21 below 2019 capacity levels with load factors climbing from 70 in april 75 in may and 86 in june this acceleration put us just above our load factor guidance range for the quarter and we expect load factors in the mid 80s for the rest of the summer i ll speak more to our guidance in a few minutes our rasm was down 15 and a half percent for the quarter but the improvement from the beginning of the quarter versus the end was dramatic our rasm was down 25 in april 18 in may and only five and a half percent in june much of this improvement was driven by passenger volumes but yield also played an important role which improved 8 5 points during the quarter from down 14 in april to down five and a half percent in june mileage plan revenues including commission revenues from our co brand credit card program and award redemption revenue showed particular strength during the quarter collectively mileage plan revenues represent nearly 20 of total revenues and were down just 9 versus the second quarter of 2019 with june down just 0 9 bank commission revenues were particularly strong for the quarter up 7 versus 2019 additionally we saw credit card acquisitions for the quarter exceed those of 2019 we re encouraged by loyalty program performance and it s clear that our guests are excited to engage with our program as they return to travel so turning to our network our strong sequential revenue performance was enabled by our network teams rebuild strategy air group has returned to approximately 80 of its pre covid network size but we prioritize seattle growth given the strength of demand here our seattle hub capacity in q2 was approximately 2 higher than in the second quarter of 2019 and the team also restructured the seattle hub to gain access to greater flow traffic which has helped fuel this growth as of july our pacific northwest flying is only down 4 from 2019 we expect to continue to grow pacific northwest capacity from here and hawaii capacity has also been returned more quickly than system average and was only down 7 in the second quarter from 2019 we ve reallocated some hawaii flying across different markets which includes adjustments to frequencies in both california and the pacific northwest which has proven to be a positive move our california capacity was down 40 in the second quarter reflecting the reality that demand in the states has been among the weakest in the nation as we shared last quarter we will add back capacity to california as demand returns which we believe has now started during the first half of the year there was an 8 point load factor gap that existed between our california and non california flying and with the state reopening mid june i can report that the gap has fully closed in the past several weeks with california load factors improving we re experiencing relative stronger pricing and yields on flights to touch california are now better than the rest of the system on a year over year basis as with our entire network our priority is to continue to match supply with demand and we fully expect to have returned 100 of pre covid capacity to california sometime in the first half of 2022 even though system capacity remains below 2019 levels we have been adding new markets to our network to maximize revenues as the recovery takes hold we ve seen a shift in demand during the pandemic to getaway destinations and cities with lower cost of living and our recent focus on growth in places like boise austin and florida due to this reality since the beginning of the pandemic we will have either commenced or announced over 50 net new markets which reflects the shifting demand landscape in our network booking momentum remains strong stabilizing at about 85 of pre covid levels this level of demand is consistent with our capacity plans which are also approximately 85 of pre covid levels and supports our objective of returning to 80 plus load factors and pre pandemic yields on the business travel front we ve been encouraged at what appears to be an acceleration of the return of business travel in fact over the past three weeks our indirect corporate bookings have reflected 40 to 50 recovery of 2019 levels and we re optimistic this will continue to improve similarly direct corporate bookings that utilize easybiz were over 50 recovered in the second quarter easybiz users generally skewed geographically toward the pacific northwest and state of alaska customers but provide a good indicator of recovery trends for small and medium businesses we mentioned on our prior call that we expect the business to recover to about 50 by the end of the year but with recent trends we expect it will reach sustained 50 or better ahead of that as i also mentioned last quarter oneworld and our partnership with american have opened the door to greater access to corporate travel just to give you a sense of our progress against that opportunity to date over 90 of alaska s top tier corporate accounts are being executed or are expected to execute a joint contract with alaska and american which will offer their travelers greater access to flight options more competitive fares and seamless elite guest benefits additionally we will soon be working with several tmcs in a much deeper way we have spent a fair amount of time over the last few quarters getting ready to fully leverage this distribution channel which will ensure we are well positioned to get at least our fair share of corporate traffic as business travel recovers in short we will be competing on a more level playing field and i ll have more to share on that soon with this backdrop i ll turn to our third quarter guidance for capacity we plan to fly 17 to 20 below 2019 levels given the strength we see in summer demand passengers are expected to be down just 15 to 18 and load factors will improve to 82 to 85 revenue is expected to be in line with capacity at down 17 to 20 versus 2019 which means our unit revenues will be close to flat looking beyond this year i ve shared that our larger share of corporate travel new revenue management system along with unique benefits available to us as part of oneworld will be critical to our return to sustained and profitable growth our team is in the process of sizing these and new commercial opportunities with a directive to deliver at least 300 million of incremental annual revenue to our pre covid revenue baseline we plan to provide a deeper look into these initiatives and our expected delivery time line at a future investor event as the next stages of this recovery play out i look forward to bringing clarity to our investors who are eager to hear about our growth plans june was a turning point for us and delivering an adjusted pre tax margin of over 14 gives me great confidence that our airlines revenue and cost model is configured to return us to industry leading margins as we climb out of this pandemic and with that i ll pass it over to shane shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance thank you andrew and good morning everyone as our results this quarter indicate the initial recovery of our business has been rapid and strong after a deep loss in q1 we saw margins improve substantially throughout the quarter posting the double digit margin in june that ben mentioned nonfuel costs increased just 9 versus q1 while capacity increased 29 and our revenues increased 191 the our results are solidly among the best in the industry which is worth noting particularly given that california was relatively later to reopen than the rest of the country our results underscore the strength of alaska s business model and our ability to execute as a company my comments will focus on our financial performance cash flows and liquidity cost performance and our plans for the rest of the year beginning with cash flows and liquidity we generated 840 million of cash flow from operations this quarter which is inclusive of 489 million in payroll support grants excluding psp grants we generated 351 million of cash flow from operations at the business most of the cash flow improvement was driven by atl growth which ended the quarter at 1 5 billion 385 million of our atl represents travel credits which guests continue to utilize for purchasing tickets in the quarter 185 million of travel was booked using credits versus our normal 40 million a quarter pre pandemic our on hand liquidity at june 30 was 4 billion up from 3 5 billion in march we shared last quarter that we had plans to begin retiring debt in the second half of the year but accelerated that plan given the pace of recovery of cash inflows debt retirements in the quarter totaled approximately 570 million including the repayment of our 135 million balance under our cares act loan we have now closed that facility and the underlying collateral that originally secured the facility is once again unencumbered the largest of which is our mileage plan program we expect to end 2021 with around 3 5 billion in on hand liquidity but we ll continue to reduce this balance throughout 2022 we have not yet determined a new normal level of on hand cash in the future but i do expect it will be somewhat higher than what we held pre pandemic the debt repayments this quarter as ben shared improved our debt to cap by 6 points from 62 to 56 it s worth noting that our adjusted net debt levels dropped to approximately 725 million this quarter given the excess cash we have on the books today if we reduce the cash by 1 5 billion to retire debt our debt to cap would be at 47 which is equivalent to when we entered the pandemic i share this only to give a sense of how strong our balance sheet is as we move into the recovery we do plan to use cash to pay down more debt this quarter including our 425 million 364 day term loan going forward we will move from focusing on adjusted net debt which was an important metric for us during the depths of the pandemic back to focusing on debt to cap and net debt to ebitdar turning to costs our cost execution was solid this quarter as productivity levels ramped total adjusted nonfuel operating expenses were 1 2 billion for the quarter up 9 from q1 while capacity increased 29 sequentially as i mentioned a moment ago we saw productivity levels rise from 42 below 2019 levels in march to 15 below 2019 levels in june and we expect july to be within a few points of 2019 levels our q2 unit costs were up 10 4 versus 2019 which was better than our mid june guidance and was helped by 15 million in onetime favorable adjustments to wage and benefit related expenses during the quarter we also accrued 34 million in expenses related to our performance based pay incentive plan as many of you know our approach to incentive pay is unique in the industry and we continue to see the value it has in driving clarity and alignment throughout our business on the goals we need to achieve to produce strong results as a company over the long term also during the quarter we were able to finalize three labor agreements including a new wage agreement with our horizon pilots and one year contract extensions with alaska s flight attendants and dispatchers i d like to thank our employees and their idt asa and twu representatives for their diligent work to develop and ratify these agreements looking ahead to the end of the year i expect that our casmex will continue to progress toward 2019 levels even though we re not fully back to 2019 capacity by year end with mainline approaching 2019 levels as we exit the year to recap our expectations for the third quarter we plan on flying 17 to 20 below 2019 capacity revenue should be down in line with capacity resulting in unit revenues that are approximately flat to 2019 we expect unit cost to be up 10 to 12 similar to our q2 performance given the relatively modest capacity increase quarter over quarter given these ranges we expect to achieve double digit margins for the third quarter cash flow from operations is expected to be between 0 and 100 million for the quarter the sequential decline in cash flow from operations is primarily driven by no psp grant inflows and normal seasonality that we expect to see in atl which tends to decline in the third quarter before we move on to questions we want to express our appreciation for all the employees who have tirelessly contributed to our success in recovery as you ve heard today folks in our operations have been working incredibly hard the improved financial results that we are excited to be sharing with you today would not be a reality without the hard work of the 22 000 employees who bring our airlines to life each day and with that let s go to your questions questions answers operator and our first question will come from catherine o brien with goldman sachs please go ahead catherine o brien goldman sachs analyst hey everyone thanks so much for the time andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer hey kate ben minicucci chief operating officer hey kate catherine o brien goldman sachs analyst hey guys so your june q cash flow came in quite a bit better than initial expectations in part driven by better forward bookings but your capacity cut for the third quarter is only i think 2 5 points narrower in the second quarter is that the max capacity you could produce given the fleet changes you ve made over the last year or is the demand uptick we re going to see that more in higher modes and yields andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer katie yes our capacity is sort of where it s going to be for the third quarter and so the loads and the yields is what s going to drive the revenue performance catherine o brien goldman sachs analyst and so when you say the capacity is where it s going to be does that mean that s kind of the max in terms of headcount and fleet availability andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer yes that s correct our capacity guide because what we ve tried to do when we set this up costs are always certain revenues is not so much so we ve set this up so that we ve got a very solid handle on our costs with a good level of capacity because there is room for growth on the yield front and the load factors and so that s where we re going to be for the third quarter in that range that i shared shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance yes katy i might just add i think we ve talked about this before we do want to get back to 80 plus load factors on a sustained basis we re not looking to see a lot of variation as we move from peak to shoulder and so this pent up demand that we re seeing in the summer it was we didn t know how much of that would follow into the fall so i think we ve been pretty methodical about capacity and that s how we ve set up headcount for the third quarter but we are going to reactivate these 10 airbus and if they come online and it looks like there s opportunity to use them the demand is there we will deploy them but it will probably be more fourth quarter for that catherine o brien goldman sachs analyst ok very clear and then just for my follow up like most of the industry has reported so far you re expecting capacity cuts to narrow a little bit in the third quarter versus 2q but casmex inflation to pick up a little bit sequentially is that all just ramp up costs tied to bringing on more capacity or what s driving that and how should we think about maybe some of those ramp up costs flowing or not flowing into the fourth quarter thanks so much for the time guys shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance yeah no thanks katie i ll speak to that a little bit i think there s a little bit of q3 cost that is ramp up getting ready for q4 next year but a couple of notes we outperformed our q2 guide heavily we did have this benefit of 15 million in onetime items there are also other areas like medical came in way under our original forecast it s a little bit hard to forecast right now when people are going to go to the doctor so volumes were down so some of that isn t in our q3 guide we don t expect onetime items we re sort of expecting medical to normalize but the biggest driver for us sequentially is selling expenses are now coming back in a big way asms are only up a few points quarter over quarter but passengers and revenue are up 25 30 quarter over quarter so we re starting to see commissions and credit card expenses rise also in the third quarter we ll have our full catering complement on board so more people getting more food and beverage similar to where we were pre covid so we ve got those are all variable costs they re not structural i m not worried about them at all but they re coming back with demand and they re all coming back in the third quarter pretty strong catherine o brien goldman sachs analyst make sense thanks so much operator the next question will come from helane becker with cowen please go ahead helane becker cowen and company analyst thanks very much operator hi everybody and thanks so much for the time so my first question is related to something you said shane i think you said that you were seeing bookings at about 185 million worth of bookings are using credits versus 40 million pre pandemic so as you think about going into the third and fourth quarter end and that would and working out those travel credits are you going to get back to that 40 million level or is there a new level that we should think about chris berry vice president finance and controller helane this is chris helane becker cowen and company analyst hey chris chris berry vice president finance and controller we won t get to that 40 million level this year because obviously the remaining travel credits are much more elevated over where they were pre pandemic we ve got about 25 of our total atl as shane mentioned in travel credits that still remain most of those do expire at the end of this year so we expect those to be used at a pretty heavy pace for the remainder of this year and then as we get into 2022 we would expect those to start to normalize then helane becker cowen and company analyst ok and then it normalizes back to around 40 million chris berry vice president finance and controller well i mean that s hard to tell i mean that s just what it was and yes we do have the element of no change fees anymore and so it may be higher than it has historically been but it will definitely level off from where it is now helane becker cowen and company analyst ok and then just for my follow up question i think ben you mentioned that you re having a hard time hiring ramp workers and i guess other nonunion or maybe they are part of the union but other workers so how should we think about like attracting people to the profession to the airline industry in general if they are unionized and you can t restarting pay or can you raise starting pay so that you can attract people and does that lead to wage inflation for you ben minicucci chief operating officer yeah good morning helane it s a great question i think this is a national issue as you re hearing a lot of companies talk about this labor shortage i would say the only place we re seeing it now we re not seeing it with pilots or flight attendants or a lot of labor groups where we re seeing it is really at the entry level position particularly in seattle there are spots across the country but particularly in seattle so what we re doing is really looking at the market i think we want to be prudent about this we re looking at the market we re looking at what it might be in september and october when the stimulus and the unemployment runs out this thing needs to find its water level so we re going to approach slowly what we ve done now and our operations team has done just a phenomenal job at some incentives to attract workers and so we re doing fine now but it s just something that s on our windshield and i don t think we know where that number is going to be for just a few more months helane becker cowen and company analyst ok that s helpful thanks guys ben minicucci chief operating officer thanks helane operator the next question will come from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi please go ahead duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst thanks and congrats on this outlook only because you gave it and i apologize for asking this because you gave good disclosure but just on june 14 can you put that in context like what is a june typically look like relative to kind of the rest of the second quarter shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance yeah and so duane i ll give you some context i mean if you look back at 2019 the june 14 this time is about 10 points lower than say it was in 2019 so june july august tend to be our highest margin months and they re typically in the 20s duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst got it i guess i was asking relative to the other months of the quarter because it just it sounds like you re saying you saw a much better kind of trajectory much better kind of sequential build in margin than you normally do andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer yes duane it s andrew i think the best way to describe that is the capacity was fairly even in april may and june but what you saw was load factors going from 70 to 86 and yield declines from down 25 to five and a half so the revenue and volumes really made the difference there over the quarter duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst that s great and then just with respect to 3q and this might just relate to what you just said maybe you can speak a little bit to kind of the visibility coming in and kind of the advanced book yields because it felt like the industry needed to overcome kind of the advanced book yields coming into 2q but they re in a much better place coming into 3q and maybe you could just comment on like your stage changes because this is listen this is not a massively long haul network that s contouring to be short haul like flat rasm in 3q feels a great outcome andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer yeah thanks duane on the top of my head i don t know our stage but that s not really the story i think to your point what we re seeing is and honestly as i look out that s why we shared flat rasm from what we ve seen today our yield position looks good and much better than it was in the second quarter and the bookings are coming in well i think on the business fare side the environment is still weak just to be frank the leisure is much better but i suspect as business travel demand returns i think we might see a strengthening there but as i look forward right now i feel pretty good about how we re positioned from both a load factor and a yield perspective and incremental improvement from the second quarter ben minicucci chief operating officer and in all i think we re just being disciplined on how we deploy capacity i think that s the big story for us we ve been very thoughtful from a year ago and how we re going to deploy capacity bring people back scale up the operation and i think we re going to do that through the third quarter and the fourth quarter and into next year as we ramp up to 100 we re going to watch what s going on watch demand and react appropriately duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst makes a lot of sense thank you ben minicucci chief operating officer thanks duane operator the next question will come from savi syth with raymond james please go ahead savi syth raymond james analyst hey good morning everyoe just to follow up on catie s question as you bring those kind of 10 airbus back this year and given your fleet order just where do you think not looking for guidance but what s the kind of the high level and the low level of where capacity can go in 2022 andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer hi savi it s andrew yes so if you look out these airbus aircraft start to return by the end of the year but if we flew them all at normal utilization so summer of 22 we could increase summer of 22 s capacity up to 8 versus where we are in 19 so as it stands today we ve talked about getting to flat but if we really needed to or wanted to we could get up 8 savi syth raymond james analyst that s helpful and then andrew i know you teased this a little bit on the 300 million incremental i was just kind of wondering if that s related to items that you have put in place today or if there is things that you have to actually turn on to start achieving that at some point i realize it s not 300 million next year but just from an execution standpoint what s involved related to that ben minicucci chief operating officer yes savi i ll start with that and then hand over to andrew so when we put our 2025 strategic plan in place prior to pandemic we ve built it up with a lot of strong commercial initiatives that had that 300 million and then the pandemic hit we kind of put everything on ice to address cash burn and get back on the path of profitability so at our recent offsite all these initiatives are being refreshed and i can tell you andrew is stoked on getting going so maybe andrew maybe just i just wanted to give you some background that these things are just not new these are things that have been in the hopper for at least 18 to 24 months but andrew maybe just a little color on that andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer thanks ben yeah savi i mean there s sort of seven categories and yes some of them were there pre pandemic that was ready but there s also been big changes in our business like corporate contracts tmc american oneworld merchandising and we ve got some network restructuring and changes so i think as we roll this out but i feel very confident that it s almost like we re on the runway barreling down at full speed and then the pandemic hit and we were so close to starting to roll some of these out and now that demand is returning and our businesses is reestablishing we re going to get to rolling these out shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance so savi i m going to jump in too so you get all three of us on this i just want to reiterate the plan is sort of a four or five year plan so we ll talk more about specific timing at an investor event which we ll hold at some point in the next quarter or 2 but the whole the cost restructure plan and the commercial plan is really predicated on 2025 ultimately getting there so i just don t want people to get too excited about next quarter on this stuff but we are excited about the initiatives that we re going to be undertaking savi syth raymond james analyst make sense that s all very helpful thank you shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance thanks savi operator the next question is from hunter keay with wolfe research please go ahead hunter keay wolfe research analyst hey hi hey andrew have you ever contemplated you and your team ever contemplated like a fully transparent or predictable revenue management strategy basically nondynamic pricing andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer hunter i think no is my short answer to that but if you want to expand on your question happy to give you more color hunter keay wolfe research analyst that s fine if the answer is no then it s no we ll talk about it some other time but andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer i think i would say like i think we do try to be simpler than a lot of other folks i mean it is you don t i mean you know this well it s a complicated sort of discipline but we were i think the first domestic airline to go to one way fares we have had a pretty small number of buckets relative to others we ve had sort of caps at the high end historically and we have tried to be fair and simple with a lot of this stuff but sort of a one price fits all or something like that i don t i think it s probably revenue negative so we haven t really looked at that ben minicucci chief operating officer and it s all good to hear i mean all similarly are thinking so maybe following this we can hear more hunter keay wolfe research analyst yes let s talk about it some moment time it will be i have some ideas but anyway one other question for you shane you talked about pulling the airbuses out you mentioned supply chain disruptions are you suggesting there s some risk to the max delivery schedule shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance hunter no i mentioned that we just met those i will tell i am 100 confident in boeing s ability to deliver our view is that there are things right now in the economy with supply chains that some of us can t even see out of our control out of alaska s control out of boeing s control and these airbus what it does it just gives us dry powder to either backfill any issues that we may experience because of it or like andrew said we can grow up to 8 for the next summer of 2022 so again with a prudent approach to capacity discipline so it s just more arrows in our quiver for us to manage going forward hunter keay wolfe research analyst ok yeah thanks ben appreciate it everybody ben minicucci chief operating officer thanks hunter shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance thanks hunter operator the next question is from joseph denardi with stifel please go ahead joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst thanks good morning shane just following up on an earlier question if capacity in summer 2022 is up 8 what does casmex look like in that environment shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance well i m just going to be careful if we re up about 8 is the question i don t know that it will be but i think our view is by the middle of next year with sort of the full ramp of our cost restructuring initiatives we re going to be in a really good place we do expect to be at or below pre covid casmex ultimately we ve said that from the very beginning i don t know if we would hit it by next summer but we should be there or getting very close to there but i don t think i ll be more specific than that it s i think we re going to have a really good cost structure one thing we know we re going to not do is lose sort of relative advantage to others in the industry so we re super focused on this cost discipline and execution the productivity stuff that we re seeing right now makes us very makes us feel very good about how we ve executed to date joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst ok that s helpful and then andrew can you just talk about kind of customer behavior you re seeing like are folks flying more are they spending more than they did in 2019 or is it just kind of compressing normal behavior into a tighter window i m just curious kind of what changes in behavior maybe beyond that you re seeing and the degree to which that speaks to kind of the sustainability of this leisure demand strength andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer yes thanks joe i was just talking to my team yesterday about this looking out into the fourth quarter i think what we re actually seeing at least from our network s perspective is actually people are booking earlier and further out than they were in 2019 so as we sit here today we re seeing good intake volumes for the fourth quarter and if you just take a look at our credit card spend and our loyalty portfolio in fact we have had we had the highest spend in this company s history this quarter on our credit card portfolio so we re just seeing sustained strength and honestly as i look further out it s still maintaining so that s what i see today joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst thank you operator the next question is from jamie baker with j p morgan please go ahead jamie baker j p morgan analyst hey good mornin so ben not so long ago you and i were talking about when you might reintroduce pre tax longer term pre tax margin targets and whether it would simply be the pre covid 13 to 15 or possibly something even better in your prepared remarks today i kind of thought that s where you were going but you stopped short what else do you need to see is it the macro environment is it alaska specific maybe it s related to future labor economics i don t know before you re comfortable replanting your margin flag so to speak ben minicucci chief operating officer jamie it s a great question i think what we need to see is just a little more stability in the economy like for example you got this delta variant there that might create some choppiness in the recovery so i think we just want to be cautious i mean just from my perspective i feel pretty confident that the worst is behind us i think we ve started with a strong pre tax profit in june and i think we should easily sustain it going forward but i think we want a little more certainty closer to the windshield see what s going on out there with labor markets with the return the strength of the economy there s inflation there s all these things we just want to see this stuff settle down a little bit and i think come investor day i think we ll give you more information on that we re giving more visibility but it s like you said we re slowly getting there and i think today is as far as we want to go jamie baker j p morgan analyst and as a follow up i think it was joe s ex fuel casm question can you just review for us what the headwinds and tailwinds are because on my list i have more entries in the tailwind category but of course not every entry is equally weighted i m just having a hard time coming up with anything that would prevent you from having modest to materially better ex fuel casm by next summer so just looking for a little more color headwinds to tailwinds thanks ben minicucci chief operating officer no thanks jamie i do think it s capacity at the end of the day the fixed costs are kind of stable we like where they re at a lot of the cuts that we did during the pandemic has held and we ll be very disciplined on that the variable costs are coming back as we would expect ratably and so to us capacity is the biggest thing just getting the asms back out there to cover fixed costs over there s not a major headwind we will see about there s going to be another sort of round of labor deals at some point i don t know when those will happen but a lot of groups were open across the industry pre pandemic and it s hard to say when all that stuff will get going again but my guess is that that s going to be relatively equalized throughout the industry so to us it s just once we get back to our pre pandemic level we re going to be in a really good position i think from unit cost jamie baker j p morgan analyst ok thank you gentlemen appreciate it take care ben minicucci chief operating officer thanks jamie andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer thanks jamie operator the next question will come from dan mckenzie with seaport global please go ahead dan mckenzie seaport global securities analyst thanks guys good morning so i wanted to follow up on that question as well returning to industry leading margins in the next cycle that s what caught my ear in the prepared remarks it sounds like from the last question that you can get back to your historical margins big picture what are the biggest drivers for getting there what are the biggest pieces to the alaska story for achieving that and i m just wondering maybe you could rank the revenue and commercial initiatives versus the cost initiatives i mean there s a lot of new things in play for you guys in this next cycle that didn t exist in the last cycle andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer yeah no i appreciate it one thing i ll just i just want to sort of go back to our performance this quarter and i know it s all sort of recovery driven but i do think posting the industry s best margin very close to breakeven in a quarter that started with very thin demand and very poor pricing it just underscores the strength of the business and our ability to execute and so we ve got a lot of confidence as we go forward i think dan we laid out 265 million of cost reduction initiatives that we re well on our way to capturing and then 300 million of revenue initiatives that we just talked about today some of that was contemplated because we thought maybe the demand environment like passed down terms would be a little dampened coming out of covid as it was in the last two big sort of industry downturns and we wanted to be able to get back to pre covid margins irrespective of whether demand was down a bit and it proves not to be down a bit but it s just more upside for the company and so i think those two 565 million or so of improvement to the business over the next few years relative to our pre covid baseline that s what s going to drive this ultimately we ve got a great product we have phenomenal employees great customer service we re on a good part of the country a growing part of the country so we re excited for things to stabilize like ben said normalized business get back out there and we re ready for the recovery dan mckenzie seaport global securities analyst ok understood second question here one of the industry s strongest balance sheet how are you thinking about using that in the next cycle is capital returns on the table sooner rather than later or does it make sense potentially to accelerate further accelerate some of the fleet replacement retirement upgauge to more efficient aircraft how are you thinking about that balance sheet nat pieper senior vice president fleet finance and alliances and treasurer dan it s nat thanks for the question i think from the balance sheet perspective as ben and shane said we re in pretty good shape from our historical debt to cap measures we ve got a 425 million facility we ll look to repay in the next 90 days or so and then i think going forward it becomes a dilemma against repaying other debt which really in our situation is pretty cheap rates further investment in our business and then as you know we ve got the restriction on shareholder repayment until the end of september next year due to some of the government aid so we ll balance all three of those things as we move forward dan mckenzie seaport global securities analyst ok thanks for the time guys nat pieper senior vice president fleet finance and alliances and treasurer thanks dan operator the next question will come from ravi shanker with morgan stanley please go ahead ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst thanks good morning everyone so maybe kind of a follow up to that question and maybe this also links to the revenue initiatives but just how far paced are you willing off paced are you willing to go kind of with some of the new revenue initiatives and kind of deploying that balance sheet kind of are you looking at just sticking to the existing mousetrap and try to maximize opportunity or are you looking at completely different things shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance this is sorry the revenue initiatives ravi i think most of it is that you would expect and andrew mentioned and he can jump in again but a new arm system which ours was 20 years old and we re excited to have the new one in place there s a few things i mean they re just we re not super excited to talk about but distributing our premium economy cabin indirect channels we only distribute prior and direct channels the american oneworld wci stuff those are all sort of on the list of things that are going to contribute i don t think we want to talk a whole lot about things that are new that we might be looking at or different today but if we get closer to an investor event we ll lay out sort of more clarity on all of these areas ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst got it i think you guys are doing a really good job of ramping up the excitement here so looking forward to that and maybe as a follow up kind of how would you describe the competitive environment out there right now i mean clearly there s a lot of demand still concentrated in relatively narrow regions and there s a lot of capacity kind of going into that region so how do you characterize the pricing environment this year ben minicucci chief operating officer ray i ll start and then i ll have andrew jump in i think we always expect competition in our markets is the west coast they re very competitive markets our mindset again as you see from where we were last year how we brought back capacity it s always been in a disciplined prudent approach and i think that s the approach we re going to take we have dry powder we can scale it up or scale it back we have a strong regional airline horizon that was just fantastic throughout this pandemic to fill in a lot of holes so our view is just again a disciplined measured approach over the next 12 and 18 months andrew anything does that make sense thanks ravi ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst thank you operator the next question will come from conor cunningham with mkm partners please go ahead conor cunningham mkm partners analyst hey everyone thanks for the time the revenue stuff s great i did have a question and i feel like you guys get basically every quarter i mean there s been a big push from a premium perspective but from other carriers and you had some recent changes in jfk so it seems somewhat topical with your focus just on higher yielding passengers and corporate in general has there been any reconsideration on revisiting the product in terms of dedicating more space to premium products or maybe even moving toward a live flat seat i would just imagine that corporates are asking for again and the reason why i bring it up is you mentioned this a320 subset of aircraft it seems like you could test something like that there i know you have money i know that will cost money but it seems like you have the balance sheet to do it just curious on your thoughts andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer conor it s andrew a couple of quick things just to be clear on the la movement we just redistributed jfk slots across the rest of our network we re still in newark so we still fly to new york city from la we ve just reallocated those i think on the product side of course like we re always looking at product but i think we ve got 12 and 16 seats in the front cabin and if we did live flat it would probably still be 12 and 16 seats but we have big airplanes to fill so i think where we re at right now is just to get back in the recovery stage we still feel really good about our front cabin product that we continue to improve we have the best pitch in the industry on traditional seats by none and then our premium class cabin is also very generous and i think a big thing for corporates too is our network utility and i did touch on network and i will say we ve done a lot of expansion on breadth over the years we re going to focus more on depth frequency conor cunningham mkm partners analyst ok great and then on the american partnership so i ve been thinking a little bit about this a little bit more but are you expecting your customers to build points and loyalty on your network and then burn them on americans or maybe it s vice versa or does that even matter i m just curious like how that dynamic may play out when that starts to really ramp andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer i think we have a lot of experience with this actually we ve had big relationships for decades and i think at the end of the day the customers will choose where they redeem and accrue miles under individual programs and again we just feel really confident and good about our west coast network and footprint and american has a big national and global footprint and i think they work very well together and i think both customers of advantage and mileage plan are going to be a lot of opportunity in choice conor cunningham mkm partners analyst ok great thank you operator the next question will come from mike linenberg with deutsche bank please go ahead mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst hey good morning everyone shane just a quick one right here as best as i can tell it seems like you re in the best position to get back to investment grade next is it a stated objective of the company to get to an ig rating where are you on that shane tackett chief financial officer and executive vice president finance it s a stated annoyance that we re not an ig company but yes no mike it s nat and i are going to be talking about this we need to go back in that direction and it s we ve got to figure out how to engage the agencies differently but it s probably a ways away as they ultimately make all those decisions but yes we haven t publicly put it out there but we certainly want to get there over time mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst yeah look the reason why i bring it out is there s a lot of carriers that they will tell you that they want to get back to investment grade like metrics and then they ll go out and lever up an airplane and borrow at a single a credit but never actually really do the work that they need to do on their balance sheet and so it does instill a level of discipline that i think many of us are hats off to a carrier like delta who wants to get to the ig rating so i m just throwing it out there then just a second question here to andrew andrew you guys have done a fantastic job i mean i don t want to beat a dead horse on this revenue but when i think about the fact that your entire carrier relies disproportionately on coastal hubs which have underperformed a lot of the mid con hubs so you re already starting from a difficult position revenue wise and yet you re right up there among the best in the industry now i know you threw out you made the comment that there s been recalibration to the network you talked about 50 net new city pairs i m curious how much of the revenue improvement is just a function of withdrawing from those markets that were underperforming so i know you gave us a net number but is there anything that you can give us to give us a sense of what markets that maybe you backed away from that just they weren t working and i know you mentioned like depth over breadth and doubling down on seattle so maybe i m answering your question it s a combination of all of that but any additional color on that front would be great andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer and every ceo ben and before have held this strong belief and i m just going to be very transparent with you on this one is its loyalty i will tell you that never in my career when you look at your network and specifically your areas of strength and there s unlimited seats given demand and when you look at the t 100 data and you see your load factors compared to your competitors load factors when there s unlimited seats to choose from and you see your loads on multiples you know loyalty is powerful and i m just going to be transparent moving networks around is good it s needed but the strength of our loyalty and our guests and their commitment to us and what we hope to continue to invest in them on service loyalty program and meeting their needs has just proven to be very very strong for us mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst great great thank you thank you for that operator the final question is from myles walton with ubs please go ahead myles walton ubs analyst thanks good afternoon i was hoping you could just clarify i think you said 4q you hope the mainline casmex would be in line with 2019 can you give us color on regional and then on the fleet side that 8 higher 2022 potentially is the exercise is that similar to the number in the fleet as well 8 higher than where you were or are you getting there through still down relative to the prior fleet levels andrew harrison executive vice president chief commercial officer yes so nat you can maybe close the fleet levels the 8 that was really enabled primarily by the reactivation of these airbus for a short additional period of time i just don t have the fleet count in my head for next year and then on q4 i just want to make sure we got it right myles we re talking about december exit rate really focused on mainline getting to very close within a few points of pre covid unit costs and i think we don t expect to have pre covid mainline capacity back yet regional side is a little bumpy the sort of very rapid regrowth and hiring of pilots around the industry puts a little bit more pressure on both the ability to deploy capacity on the regional side and also needing to get out and start the hiring for the funnel for regional sooner so we re still working through that those numbers in terms of how many pilots airlines are going to hire have been changing a bunch but that s going to be a headwind for the regional side of the business for a little bit here nat pieper senior vice president fleet finance and alliances and treasurer myles on the aircraft side we ve got net 2022 is a big delivery year for us with 31 737 9s coming in 13 regional jets as well and so as we look forward with that and then start to phase out the a320s we think those are all gone by the end of 2023 and with more 737 9s coming in there too so you ve got some replacement naturally that s going to happen and then some growth as well myles walton ubs analyst ok thanks guys operator and at this time there are no further questions i would like to turn the conference over to ben minicucci for any closing comments ben minicucci chief operating officer well thank you so much for everyone joining us this

refer to our filings with the us securities and exchange commission and the mexican stock exchange passenger traffic trends continued to show sustained improvements across the board with a total of almost 12 million passengers traveling to our airport during the quarter although these 14 below pre pandemic levels of covid 19 it represents an increase of over 13 times when compared with the same quarter last year puerto rico posted the strongest recovery with passenger traffic exceeding the second quarter 19 levels by 10 driven by a high teen increase in domestic traffic which more than offset a weaker international performance domestic traffic in mexico and colombia also contributed to show better trends although still below pre pandemic levels down 12 and 30 respectively versus second quarter 19 encouragingly cancun airport practically reached the same domestic travel levels that we posted in the second quarter 19 while showing improvement on the back of successful vaccination process in the us recovering international traffic continues to lag mexico delivered the faster recovery international traffic nearly 20 below the level reached in second quarter of 19 followed by colombia and puerto rico which post drops in the mid 20s and high 50s respectively when compared against second quarter 19 looking at our monthly traffic since march traffic has started to pick up again given the gradual roll out of vaccination campaign in mexico and further boosted by higher travel demand typical during the summer season on the downside traffic was negatively impacted by the travel restrictions mainly in canada which extended travel bans to the us and the caribbean until the end of august also impacting traffic are negative covid testing and self quarantine requirements in the us for passengers returning to their country next as we look ahead at emerging travel trends remember that operations at the majority of the airline serving the four regions we usually work with namely the us canada europe and latin america resumed at the end of last year in terms of international traffic we expect that the accelerated pace of the vaccination roll out in the us with 57 of the population were at least one dose will continue to translate in a travel recovery of international traffic in our mexican operations particularly during the summer season in the maya riviera that serves tourism travel and an improved outlook once the winter season arrives in the near term however we expect domestic traffic to continue with the slow recovery as countries gradually advance in their vaccination campaigns restrictions are lifted and economies with slower recovery by contrast we expect that the business travel will take more time to recover which could be the case for airports like merida veracruz and villahermosa in mexico and rionegro in colombia we also remain cautiously optimistic about global travel demand and expect traffic to reach the 12 month record that we achieved in february 2020 within eight to 16 months from now now let s move on the highlights of asur s financial performance more details can be found in the press release issued yesterday after market closed our strong balance sheet has allowed us to navigate the current traffic travel environment as well as ramp up operations as demand continues to gradually recover asur s financial position remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of mxn7 8 billion at the end of the quarter up 51 from december 2011 all countries of operation contributed to these higher cash position reporting increases mxn2 1 billion in mexico and mxn0 5 billion in puerto rico colombia contributed nearly mxn6 million in cash compared with the use of cash in the first quarter we closed the quarter with a total financial debt of mxn13 7 billion down 3 from the end of the year 2020 net debt to last 12 months ebitda was 0 9 times while interest cover ratio was five times our maturity profile remains healthy with only 3 of the debt maturing before the end of the year and approximately 26 next year with regards to account receivables we continue to receive payments from the three airlines aeromexico avianca holdings and latam airlines group that filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states on a sequential basis accounts receivables increased 26 mainly driven by a 61 increase in mexico reflecting revenue growth and contrast accounts receivables in puerto rico and colombia declined 16 and 5 respectively turning to the p l revenues ex construction increased 324 to mxn3 9 billion year on year and were just 4 below pre pandemic levels of second quarter 19 driven by declines of nearly 5 in revenues from non aeronautical service and 4 from aeronautical services mexico accounted 68 of total ex construction revenues while puerto rico and colombia represented 23 and 9 respectively on a sequential basis revenues ex construction increased a robust 43 on a per passenger basis commercial revenues reached nearly mxn119 up from mxn99 positive in the same quarter of 2019 it s still distorted by the sharp reduction in passenger traffic continuing down to the p l operating expenses ex construction cost increased 31 year over year mainly driven by a higher activity levels in mexico however consolidated costs were down 8 when compared to the second quarter 19 levels and slightly exceeded the decline in revenues in that period in mexico costs were up 64 year on year mostly due to the hard technical assistance and concession fees on the back of higher revenues and ebitda higher cost of services also contributed to this increase mainly reflecting the reopening of terminals 2 and 3 at cancun airport which were closed in the second quarter 20 compared to the second quarter 19 operating cost and expenses ex construction increased 8 2 by contrast in puerto rico declined 4 year on year benefiting from the reimbursement this quarter related to the cancellation of a security contract with the municipality of carolina together with the reimbursement from tsa in connection with offering security as required by the u s government comps also benefited from the cost reduction in the second quarter 21 as a result of a favorable fx translation impact and from a higher provision from our for bad debt in the second quarter 20 in connection with the covid 19 pandemic note that a total of 8 2 million remain available on the u s taxpayer grant as funds were not deployed to foreign expenses this quarter finally expenses in colombia were up 29 year on year mostly reflecting increases in concession fees to a lesser extent in cost of services resulting from higher traffic levels consolidated ebitda increased to mxn2 5 billion this quarter from mxn51 million in a year ago quarter which was fully impacted by restrictions worldwide to control the pandemic when compared to the pre pandemic performance ebitda was only 3 below comparables to the second quarter 19 levels which excludes the non recurring insurance recovery in that quarter both countries of operation reported ebitda gains with mexico contributing mxn1 8 billion puerto rico over mxn0 5 billion and colombia mxn157 million next is page 12 the adjusted ebitda margin improved to 65 in the second quarter 21 up from 6 in the first quarter of the year and 53 in the second quarter 19 when excluding the insurance recovery that benefited that quarter with regards to capex we invested just over mxn460 million in the quarter the lion s share of which was allocated to mexico while mxn60 million were invested in lmm airport in puerto rico in mexico we remain on schedule with the expansion of the terminal building in merida and the construction of the parallel taxiway of the second runway at cancun airport and starting the first phase of expansion of terminal 4 while in puerto rico we are undertaking major maintenance repairs to runways and taxiways to summarize my remarks asurs maintained a solid balance sheet that is enabling of the ramp up operations as our markets recover in long term we re confident in our ability to continue rebuilding our passenger base based on the encouraging growth trends we are seeing and supported by our attractive airport network in the meantime we continue to prudently managing cash and cash and variable cost while travel demand remains affected by the pandemic on the dividend front as previously announced last month our board of directors approved a payment date october 01 2021 for an ordinary net cash dividend of mxn8 21 per share that has been approved at our 2020 annual general meeting finally before opening the call for questions we recently published our 2020 sustainability report which is housed on our website we welcome you read it and learn about our recent progress and initiatives on esg products we remain committed to further enhancing our esg strategy and performance among all the objectives for our next sustainability report we intend to add esg framework to complement our reporting under the gre framework that concludes my remarks for today and sandy please open the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from alejandro zamacona at credit suisse alejandro zamacona credit suisse analyst my first question is in the airport fees increase so i mean in your extraordinary roe realization the maximum airport fees increased only probably 17 in the long term we noticed that some airlines in mexico have already updated their airport fees and some airports threshold that was from since july 16 so could you please confirm by how much airport fees are increasing and when should we expect it to reach the maximum fees thank you all adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer alejandro hi good morning well what are you talking about is the result of our extraordinary maximum tariff review process that was approved basically at the beginning of april so as you are mentioning 17 was approved and of course toward the year we re increasing our rates to be able to reach that 17 increase but of course what i can tell you is that this year we are not going to reach the maximum compliance level we re going to be below in comparison of our results in previous years due to the time it takes to increase our rates on the first place and second is because we received approvals in april as i mentioned so what we expect is next year to be able to comply with the maximum tariff compliance alejandro zamacona credit suisse analyst okay so thank you very much my second question is behind accounts receivable so i know that you the remarks you mentioned a 60 increase which is basically for mexico right my question each year is if this increased from 750 million in the first quarter of up to mxn1 2 billion in the second quarter it s all related to mexico or what can we comment about that thank you adolfo adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer i would say in general all the airlines are paying on time with the exception of course of v2 jets as i mentioned that amount has been reset but the increase that you re seeing in mexico is the result of an increase in the sales rate not in the lack of things alejandro zamacona credit suisse analyst thank you alejandro adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer you re welcome operator the next question comes from guilherme mendes at jpmorgan guilherme mendes jp morgan analyst hi adolfo good morning and thanks for taking my question i had two questions actually the first one is on the airlines front in terms of that we check if there is any significant impact related to the downgrade of the mexican aviation agency by the faa and the second question is what is the latest on the tulum airport thank you adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer hi good morning in terms of the downgrades we do not see any impact and we do not expect any impact from these because most of our passenger traffic there are travels to the us basically travels in us airline as i mentioned during last year 0 2 of our passenger traffic travels to the us in a domestic airline in terms of tulum airport i do not have more details than what you have in terms of what it has been said by the president of the country that he wants to construct a new airport in tulum that will be operated by the army that s all what we say that s all we said and what we know guilherme mendes jp morgan analyst okay very clear thanks adolfo adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer you re welcome operator the next question comes from rodolfo ramos at bradesco bbi rodolfo ramos bradesco bbi analyst good morning thanks for taking my question i have two questions the first one is on your traffic that you ve seen so far the mexico started to go through this third wave of covid 19 and the state of quintana roo was acutely impacted and this started toward the end of june beginning of july so not yet captured by your traffic reports and monthly reports so i wanted to see how have you seen this development impacting appetite for travel to cancun adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer well as you are mentioning these third wave is occurring to be honest i would say it s not the third wave in mexico it s the first wave in mexico because in reality we have been we have not been able ever to control the pandemic like it was controlling europe and asia so i would say that s the first you are right we are today at the highest ever in terms of the people that got sick unfortunately in terms of hospitalizations and fatalities we are below as we were before this means that vaccines are working and working well and i do not expect major impact or major effect as we shown over here in terms of the same numbers it is true that restrictions can be again enforced but i do not expect those to be as strong as they were last year rodolfo ramos bradesco bbi analyst thank you and just my second question is on your commercial revenue side as you mentioned during your initial march it s still quite distorted by the movement of volatility in traffic flow but why do you think it s a reasonable target for you i mean considering your expansion of different commercial sites i mean should we look at the mxn100 per passenger level that we saw back in 2019 i mean how do you think this could evolve in the following month especially as you approach this pre pandemic level of traffic adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer well as you have said in the second quarter 2019 we reached mxn99 per passenger we have seen nice results in some activities like car rental like ground transportation we do not expect a permanent effect after covid 19 is over if it s over i believe that these mxn119 that we are seeing today is still distorted because of lack of passengers you can see that affecting the case of colombia trying to compare how it was a year ago when there was almost no passenger with the number you are seeing today nevertheless we have seen nice results during the second quarter we will have to wait and see what is the new level after covid 19 but of course i do not expect permanent effects on these activities operator the next question comes from pablo monsivais at barclays pablo monsivais barclays analyst just wanted to hear from you what s the current situation in and your expectations for colombia traffic has kind of recovered but not quite much and still we have more optimistic expectations for the second half but what are you seeing on the ground do you think that we can reach pre pandemic levels in the first quarter of next year or what s your thinking adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer pablo in the case of colombia we need to recall that colombia was closed completely the country completely as from the third week of march up to the end of august last year so in comparison terms with mexico and puerto rico that never closed of course it s the latest one that s the first comment the second comment is most of the traffic in colombia i would say is business traffic related to medellin and bogota what i said during the remarks is that business traffic will recover later in comparison with tourism traffic and vfr traffic so vfr in the case of puerto rico you can see that puerto rico is above pre pandemic levels and tourism in the case of mexico mostly in my initial comments i said that we have to be we will have to wait more time to see the recovery process in cases like merida and villahermosa and veracruz and that is basically because of the business traffic it will take more time and i would say that my expectation is that we will have and we will see permanent effect on these activities around the world we are not going to travel in the same way as we were before the pandemic in terms of business traffic we will use technology and of course but just and companies are going to be restrictive and also the economic situation is not going to be the same for a while pablo monsivais barclays analyst one follow up and let me dig into this you said that you are expecting a permanent effect do you have any fear on your mind the ballparking i don t know to expect the structural 20 decrease in corporate travel or 10 what is your best estimate adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer well it s hard to say again but it will depend on the different regions and the economic the economics of those regions but you re right between 10 to 20 could be the permanent effect that doesn t mean that we are not going to reach the same numbers someday but what i m trying to say is that business traffic will recover later than the other travel and leisure and vfr but also that the amount of people that will be traveling in business for business will not be the same as it was the proportion is not going to be the same as it was so if you were traveling i don t know 30 times a year probably in the future you will travel 25 that s what i m trying to say operator the next question comes from javier gayol at gbm javier gayol gbm analyst hi adolfo congratulations on the results and thank you for taking my questions my question is related to capital allocation and cash generation you actually generated around mxn7 5 billion in operating cash flow and if we add up to that or we subtract the capex that you guys have plus the dividend we ll get to a number of around an excess cash around let s say mxn3 5 billion to mxn3 billion in our estimates so i want you and with a net debt to ebitda of 0 9 i wanted to understand how are you looking at asur s potential capital allocation are you more inclined toward lowering debt are you inclined toward refinancing or increasing debt and maybe through investments if you could give us some color on the strategy from that front that would be great for us adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer thank you well in general terms i would say it s too early to tell what i want to say here is that for me the pandemic is not over it is not yet i think that it will take two three months to be able to say that the world has been able to control this in the meantime as i said during the remarks we have to be cautious in terms of numbers you saw the mxn2 5 billion ebitda for the quarter it s true but also it was the dividend was or the date of the payment of the dividend was approved and was set for october the 1st and that is around mxn2 5 billion so for the moment that s what we are trying to do is to be cautious on one side second to approve the dividend and third in terms of new project new expansions we will have to wait javier gayol gbm analyst second question is as we see some recovery worldwide in terms of travel how have you guys seen the environment for new travel between your airports and some international places have you seen people more interested in coming to cancun increasing the routes is that a possibility that we should take into consideration adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer yes in the case of cancun in the case of mexico basically the problem we have today is travel ban and of course that we are in the summer let me be clear so we think about canadian traffic normally they travel from november up to april they normally do not travel during the summer due to weather conditions so today even with these travel restrictions we will not see canadians in cancun of course but that s why i m saying that s why i m saying that we will expect a better outlook for the winter season so i believe that this winter season will be better for us and we will be able to see all the regions contributing to the increase in traffic operator the next question comes from anton mortenkotter at gbm anton mortenkotter gbm analyst thank you for taking my question and congrats on the results i just have two quick questions one related to the capex development but i mean up to date you ve invested around mxn700 million out of the almost mxn3 billion committed in your capex plan strategy in the new mexican airport such as i was wondering if you could provide some more detail about the capex plan in the future quarters adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer of course well what i can say to you is that we have to comply with the mxn3 billion you are talking about of course it s something more than mxn3 billion but remember that our external mexican tariff revision was approved in april in that sense of course there was an adjustment in investment program

recent warnings from the us securities and exchange commission sec and the us congress could translate into more aggressive scrutiny of trading plans adopted pursuant to rule 10b5 1 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 exchange act in a speech delivered on june 7 2021 sec chair gary gensler identified several cracks in rule 10b5 1 trading plans that could allow for insider trading 1 a few days later the sec released an updated rulemaking agenda which includes amendments to the affirmative defense against insider trading provided by rule 10b5 1 to corporate executives and directors2 and based on his speech could include imposing a four to six month cooling off period between adoption of the plan and the first trade pressure to reform the insider trading law is also mounting in congress where a pair of senators recently reintroduced a bipartisan bill directing the sec to explore amendments to rule 10b5 1 3 the house of representatives also approved a bill which if passed would clarify insider trading prohibitions 4 benefits of rule 10b5 1 trading plans insider trading prohibitions evolved from case law interpreting the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws these provisions prohibit trading securities on the basis of material nonpublic information mnpi with an intent to deceive scienter and in breach of a duty of trust or confidence corporate insiders typically owe duties of trust and confidence to their employers in 2002 the sec adopted rule 10b5 1 under the exchange act to define when a trade is made on the basis of mnpi 5 this new rule also provided an affirmative defense against allegations of insider trading by defining when a trade is not on the basis of mnpi 6 for instance a trade will not be considered on the basis of mnpi if before becoming aware of the mnpi the person adopted a written plan for trading securities and that plan specified in advance the price amount and dates for the trade 7 trading plans created under this rule are passive and predetermined written investment instructions adopted when insiders are not aware of mnpi and allow holders of such plans to purchase and sell securities of their company during blackout periods under terms specified in advance since the adoption of rule 10b5 1 two decades ago the sec has brought very few enforcement actions involving rule 10b5 1 trading plans but has brought two highly publicized actions one against the ceos of enron corporation and one against the ceo of countrywide financial corporation in 2004 enron s ceo was charged with fraudulently amending his trading plans while in possession of mnpi regarding the company s deteriorating conditions and subsequently selling his shares 8 similarly in 2009 the sec alleged that countrywide s ceo created a series of trading plans while he was aware of the poor performance of the company and then illegally traded the company s securities 9 the rule has been subject to criticism over the years namely for facilitating legal yet questionable trading practices by corporate executives and wall street professionals 10 cracks in rule 10b5 1 plans identified by the sec based on recent studies showing that rule 10b5 1 plans often lead to abusive insider trading 11 sec chair gensler identified the following cracks in rule 10b5 1 trading plans and called for reforms no cooling off period between the adoption of the plan and the first scheduled trade under the existing rule there is no requirement for any waiting period between the adoption of the plan and the time of the first planned trade chair gensler is concerned that some bad actors could perceive this as a loophole to participate in insider trading 12 the empirical research used by the sec chair suggests that results from trades without cooling off periods show more favorable returns than plans with longer waiting periods 13 the sec chair also noted that bipartisan support exists for proposals that could impose a four to six month cooling off period 14 no limits on cancellation currently rule 10b5 1 plans can be terminated even when the insider is in possession of mnpi which seems upside down to chair gensler as canceling a plan may be as economically significant as carrying out an actual transaction 15 however as stressed by chair gensler even if permitted a cancellation can be used as evidence of bad faith which could jeopardize the use of the rule 10b5 1 affirmative defense 16 no mandatory disclosure requirement while some issuers and individuals voluntarily disclose the use of rule 10b5 1 plans whether in press releases sec periodic reports or insider filings with the sec rule 10b5 1 does not require the disclosure of the adoption modification cancellation and terms of rule 10b5 1 plans according to chair gensler such mandatory disclosure could promote confidence of the public in the markets 17 no limits on the number of rule 10b5 1 plans the chair observed that since rule 10b5 1 does not limit the adoption of multiple plans by companies or their insiders some may mistakenly think they have a free option to pick amongst favorable plans as they please 18 chair gensler therefore asked the sec staff to consider whether to impose such limits companies should expect enhanced scrutiny of corporate executives and directors trades and rule 10b5 1 trading plans the recent focus on insider trading and rule 10b5 1 trading plans by the sec and congress alongside recent news and empirical reports of potential misuse all suggest that the sec will take a more aggressive approach to rule 10b5 1 plans this enhanced scrutiny may lead to new rulemaking or request for public comments as well as enforcement division investigations into allegations of insider trading by abusing rule 10b5 1 plans sec chair gensler indicated that the agency would use all of the tools in our toolbox to ensure we are identifying and punishing abuses of rule 10b5 1 plans 19 the use of data analytics increasingly used by the agency will also help identify suspicious trading activity while many of the sec s proposals are generally aligned with best practices for companies and individuals adopting rule 10b5 1 plans companies should review their internal policies and procedures regarding their rule 10b5 1 plans this should include adopting alongside or within issuer insider trading policies clear policies for the adoption and oversight of rule 10b5 1 plans including 1 a limit on the number of plans adopted per individual and their affiliated family members or entities and 2 a mandatory cooling off period between a adopting a plan and trading under such plan and b cancelling a plan and such cancellation going into effect these elements should be included in addition to the standard confirmation that the person has no mnpi when entering the plan so long as issuers adopt implement and enforce such procedures under the current regulatory framework rule 10b5 1 plans should continue to represent a helpful mechanism to protect against insider trading liability and issuers should take proactive steps to adopt clear policies aligned with such guidance and emphasize them during regular trainings 1 chair gary gensler prepared remarks cfo network summit june 7 2021 2 press release sec announces annual regulatory agenda june 11 2021 in a june 23 2021 speech chair gensler also announced that the sec will explore amendments to enhance transparency related to companies buying back their stock this could include revision of share repurchase disclosure requirements such as regulation s k and item 703 chair gary gensler prepared remarks at london city week june 23 2021 3 on june 28 2021 senators chris van hollen and deb fisher revived the promoting transparent standards for corporate insiders act which was initially introduced in the u s house of representatives in 2018 and 2019 this bill requires the sec to carry out a study determining whether rule 10b5 1 trading plans should be amended to limit abuses the proposed bill also suggests several amendments the majority of which the sec is already considering other suggested amendments would limit the timeframe during which an insider can adopt a plan to certain issuer approved trading windows and would require boards to adopt policies governing trading plan activities and periodically monitor trading plan transactions h r 1528 promoting transparent standards for corporate insiders act 117th cong 2021 4 the insider prohibition act was passed in the house of representatives by a large bipartisan majority of 350 to 75 this act would add a new section 16a codifying insider trading law into the exchange act the new section 16a would make it unlawful for any person directly or indirectly to trade in any security while aware of

directly into customer accounts and reduced withdrawals from deposit accounts due to a change in spending habits as a result of covid 19 at june 30 2021 non retail cds which include brokered cds online cds and public funds cds increased 23 9 million to 211 9 million compared to 188 1 million at march 31 2021 due to increases of 16 7 million in brokered cds and 7 2 million in online cds the year over year increase in non retail cds of 16 8 million from 195 1 million at june 30 2020 was primarily the result of a 6 8 million increase in brokered cds a 6 5 million increase in online cds and a 3 5 million increase in public funds cds growth in non retail cds is directly tied to the company utilizing the wholesale market to manage interest rate risk and balance the funding of longer term asset growth through wholesale term certificates at june 30 2021 borrowings decreased 30 0 million or 41 4 to 42 5 million from 72 5 million at march 31 2021 and decreased 107 7 million or 71 7 from 150 3 million at june 30 2020 the decrease in borrowings from the linked quarter was due to the maturity of 30 0 million of fhlb borrowings replaced in part by the growth in non retail cds mentioned above management will utilize wholesale deposits when the cost of borrowings is higher than the cost of wholesale certificates the decrease in borrowings from the prior year is primarily due to the repayment of 63 0 million of paycheck protection program liquidity facility ppplf borrowings due in part to sba forgiveness of the underlying ppp loans and the maturity of the fhlb borrowings mentioned above total stockholders equity increased 1 4 million to 241 8 million at june 30 2021 from 240 3 million at march 31 2021 and increased 33 1million from 208 6 million at june 30 2020 the increase in stockholders equity during the current quarter was primarily due to net income of 8 5 million partially offset by dividends of 1 1 million and common stock repurchases of 7 0 million on june 25 2021 the company announced a two for one stock split in the form of a share distribution of one additional common share for each outstanding common share the stock dividend was distributed on

nonperforming loans quarter over linked quarter was primarily related to the payoff of a commercial construction and development loan of 1 9 million and a commercial business loan of 1 2 million the year over year decrease was primarily due to a commercial real estate loan of 1 1 million reinstated to accruing status loans classified as substandard increased 1 4 million to 22 3 million at june 30 2021 compared to 20 9 million at march 31 2021 and increased 9 9 million from 12 4 million at june 30 2020 the quarter over linked quarter increase in substandard loans was attributable to a 3 2 million increase in commercial and industrial loans partially offset by the payoff of the 1 9 million construction and development loan the year over year increase in substandard loans was primarily due to an increase of 6 2 million in commercial and industrial loans and one to four family loan increases of 5 9 million partially offset by a decrease of 2 1 million in commercial real estate loans there was no other real estate owned oreo property at june 30 2021 or march 31 2021 compared to one oreo property in the amount of 90 000 at june 30 2020 included in the carrying value of gross loans

3 4 million to 21 2 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 from 17 9 million for the three months ended june 30 2020 this comparable quarter over quarter increase was primarily the result of an improved mix of loans versus other interest bearing assets and increased balances in higher yielding loans funded by lower cost deposits interest income increased 2 1 million primarily due to an increase of 1 9 in interest income on loans receivable including fees impacted primarily by loan growth with low market interest rates on new loan originations including low yielding ppp loans resetting adjustable rate instruments refinances of higher yielding one to four family portfolio loans and sba forgiveness of ppp loans interest expense decreased 1 3 million primarily as a result of repricing deposit rates for the three months ended june 30 2021 the total recognition of net deferred fees on forgiven and amortizing ppp loans was 436 000 for the six months ended june 30 2021 net interest income increased by 6 0 million to 41 3 million from 35 3 million for the six months ended june 30 2020 in a similar manner as for the three month comparison described above with decreases in interest expense of 3 1 million and an increase in interest income of 2 9 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 the total recognition of net deferred fees on forgiven and amortizing ppp loans was 1 1 million the net interest margin nim increased 18 basis points to 4 09 for the three months ended june 30 2021 from 3 91 for the same period in the prior year and decreased five basis points to 4 04 for the six months ended june 30 2021 from 4 09 for the six months ended june 30 2020 the comparable quarter over quarter increase in nim was impacted by higher yielding loans including higher interest rates on new fixed rate real estate loan originations and adjustable rate commercial loans during the quarter ended june 30 2021 128 000 in premium was amortized on purchased loans with early payoffs partially offset by 271 000 in discount accretion from the anchor acquisition the slight decrease in nim between the six months ended june 30 2021 and 2020 reflects the change in our asset mix including increased investment securities commercial business loans and one to four family loans that carry lower yields than other interest earning products the average total cost of funds including noninterest bearing checking decreased 37 basis points to 0 54 for the three months ended june 30 2021 from 0 91 for the three months ended june 30 2020 this decrease was predominantly due to the decline in cost for market rate deposits and borrowings as well as a managed runoff of higher cost cd funding the average cost of funds decreased 48 basis points to 0 56 for the six months ended june 30 2021 from 1 04 for the six months ended june 30 2020 also reflecting decreases in market interest rates over last year management remains focused on matching deposit liability duration with the duration of loans assets where appropriate for the three and six months ended june 30 2021 the provision for loan losses was 0 0 and 1 5 million respectively compared to 4 6 million and 8 3 million for the three and six months ended june 30 2020 respectively the reduction of the provision for loan losses reflects improvements in watch classified loans that were downgraded based on the covid 19 pandemic and have shown loan level improvements at june 30 2021 compared to the same time last year during the three months ended june 30 2021 net charge offs totaled 141 000 compared to net recoveries of 3 000 for the same period last year the increase in net charge offs was primarily due to increased consumer loan charge offs including overdraft charge offs net charge offs totaled 439 000 during the six months ended june 30 2021 compared to net charge offs of 40 000 during the six months ended june 30 2020 due to the same reason mentioned above noninterest income decreased 5 9 million to 8 2 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 from 14 1 million for the three months ended june 30 2020 the decrease during the period primarily reflects a 7 0 million decrease in gain on sale of loans due primarily to a reduction in the amount of loans sold partially offset by a 1 1 million increase in service charges and fee income due to the company s prior period covid 19 related relief temporarily waiving on a case by case basis customer related service charges and fees during the current quarter a pool of united states department of agriculture usda loans with a principal balance of 2 4 million were sold with a gain on sale of 106 000 net of unamortized premium noninterest income decreased 1 8 million to 21 2 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 from 23 0 million for the six months ended june 30 2020 this decrease was the result of a 1 4 million decrease in other noninterest income due to the one time sale of class b visa stock shares of 1 5 million during the same period last year and a 1 2 million decrease in gain on sale of loans partially offset by a 933 000 increase in service charges and fee income noninterest expense increased 4 3 million to 18 9 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 from 14 6 million for the three months ended june 30 2020 the increase in noninterest expense reflects a 4 5 million increase in salaries and benefits primarily attributable to additional staffing costs to support growth of 1 3 million and a decrease in recognized deferred costs on direct loan origination activities of 3 4 million other increases included loan costs of 196 000 data processing of 152 000 operation expenses of 136 000 and professional and board fees of 118 000 partially offset by a reduction in the impairment of servicing rights of 799 000 noninterest expense increased 4 5 million to 35 3 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 from 30 8 million for the six months ended june 30 2020 the increase during this period was primarily due to increases of 6 6 million in salaries and benefits mostly attributable to increases in compensation and benefits of 5 0 million including incentives and commissions of 1 3 million partially offset by a decrease in recognized deferred costs on direct loan origination activities of 1 5 million other increases included 479 000 in data processing 259 000 in professional and board fees 220 000 in loan costs and 156 000 in operation expenses partially offset by the 3 4 million net change on servicing rights which reflect a recovery of servicing rights

as we are slowly emerging from the crisis of the pandemic the last thing we want to hear is bad news and the united states postal service is delivering some of that to consumers today officials with the usps say a price increase for stamps was approved earlier this week by the postal regulatory commission prc the agency that oversees postal operations in the united states the proposal was first discussed in may when officials said they wanted to raise the price of a first class stamp from 55 cents to 58 cents and now that price increase will go into effect on august 29 which will no doubt anger customers all across america the controversial head of the usps postmaster louis dejoy who was appointed by president donald trump is also proposing something that is going to affect americans drastically slower delivery but the postal regulatory commission tells cbs moneywatch via klfy that they are concerned that about 4 out of 10 pieces of mail would take two additional days to reach their recipients which would have a huge impact on rural and elderly customers prc commissioner ashley poling stated in a report from the agency via klfy that i do not believe that the postal service has proven its case for reducing service standards for all americans earlier this summer attorney generals from 21 states told the agency that the usps proposals were misguided and would negatively affect election mail mailings of essential documents such as passports and birth and death records and have a disproportionate impact on the elderly rural residents and the disabled so better stock up on those stamps now before the price goes up on august 29
here s what you need to remember the forrestal fire did lead to major reforms of the navy s firefighting procedures including better training in damage control for the crew at large in the next two years new firefighting devices that could flood the entire carrier deck with flame retardant foam were installed two deadly collisions involving u s navy destroyers in june and august 2017 may have cost the lives of up to sixteen sailors leading the navy to declare a day long operational pause to reflect upon its safety culture that such similar accidents took place in such close proximity reflects stresses and failings common to the maritime fighting branch in the 1960s the navy also suffered a series of deadly accidents aboard its carriers in their wake came major reforms addressing the inherent dangers of operating ships packed full of explosive munitions fuel and jet planes this three part series will examine why each of the accidents occurred how the crew responded and the lessons that were drawn from the tragedies throw those bombs away the uss forrestal was the united states first supercarrier and the largest ever built when it was commissioned in 1955 capable of launching larger more powerful f 4 phantom fighters on its thousand foot long flight deck using steam catapults the forrestal was deployed to yankee station in the gulf of tonkin in july 1967 to contribute its carrier air wing 17 to the intense bombing campaign over vietnam just nine months earlier the smaller uss oriskany experienced a devastating fire that killed forty four sailors and pilots all caused by a mishandled flare which triggered rockets stored in an ammunition locker misfiring rockets would also prove the bane of the forrestal but faulty bombs were more deeply implicated in the tragedy the navy was flying hundreds of missions every day over vietnam with its a 4 skyhawk attack jets typically carrying one thousand pound bomb under each wing in just four days of combat operations the forrestal s air wing flew 150 missions many targeting the thanh hoa railroad bridge in north vietnam that operational tempo depleted the munitions stocks at an extraordinary rate so old m65 bombs were dispatched to fill the gap everyone who laid eyes on the antiquated m65a1 bombs knew they were trouble when they were taken aboard on july 28 the korean war vintage munitions had been improperly stowed in humid conditions for more than a decade and were leaking liquid paraffin from the seams and coated in rust and grime due to their age ordnance technicians were afraid to handle them the short stubby bombs were armed with unstable composition b in a thin metal casing while newer mark 83 bombs used the more stable composition h6 in a thick casing a mark 83 bomb could endure eight to ten minutes in a raging fire before cooking off as demonstrated in navy instructional videos giving firefighting crews enough time to respond to their credit several officers did their best to prevent the weapons from being used the ordnance chief at subic bay in the philippines insisted that the weapons should have been destroyed not employed and only released them after making strenuous objections upon being loaded on the forrestal the carrier s ordnance chiefs expressed their concern to capt john beling beling agreed and requested different munitions from the ammunition ship diamond head but was informed that none were available feeling he had no choice beling made sure the bombs were stored on the flight deck rather in the ship s magazine as a safety precaution rockets on deck initially however it was not the bombs that sparked trouble at 10 50 a m on july 29 the day after receiving the old bombs a mark 32 zuni rocket mounted on a parked f 4b phantom suddenly ignited in its lau 10 launcher and shot off across the flight deck the unguided rocket was a staple weapon for ground attack missions over vietnam normally the weapon was only primed to launch shortly before takeoff with a pigtail plug connecting the rocket s circuits with the fighter however the forrestal was being requested to fly so many combat sorties that plugs were inserted early to save time an exception to procedure that had been approved because earlier missions had been delayed by faulty plugs most likely a power surge while switching to the phantom s electrical system had triggered the weapon s actuator the five inch rocket slammed into the side of the bomb laden skyhawk of lt cmdr fred white commander of attack squadron va 46 as he was queued up for takeoff the blast ruptured his plane s four hundred gallon external fuel tank and caused two wing mounted m65 bombs to fall onto the flight deck jp 5 jet fuel from the tank sprayed across the deck and immediately ignited the forrestal s damage control team swiftly responded to the accident however the nearest fire pump was already wreathed in flames and the second closest failed to generate water pressure the crew could only rely on a single hose spooled further up deck to begin spraying the flaming bombs with water even as the fire spread to engulf the next skyhawk beside white manned by john mccain the future senator from arizona seeing flames licking around his jet mccain climbed down the nose of his plane and jumped off the refueling probe though his flight suit caught fire upon landing as the bombs began to glow cherry red from the heat the damage control team s chief petty officer gerald farrier attempted to cool them off with a purple k dry chemical fire extinguisher a mere minute and a half after the rocket detonation farrier realized that that the casings on one of the bombs had split open and the munition was about to go off he shouted at his crew to pull back they had just begun to do so when the bomb erupted killing the chief and all but three of his crew who were left severely burned white also perished in the explosion while mccain was blasted across the flight deck the explosion spattered shrapnel and burning jet fuel across the rear of the carrier causing two more skyhawks loaded with thousands of pounds of fuel and unstable m65 bombs to be engulfed in flames unlike the fire on the oriskany this resulted in a dreadful chain reaction of explosions which rippled across the forrestal bomb blasts gouged out great chunks of the deck allowing up to forty thousand gallons of burning jet fuel to pour into the hangar deck and personnel quarters trapping crew members as far as three stories below you can see the video records of these horrifying events in the navy training film trial by fire starting with the zuni rocket unleashed at 3 17 at the five minute mark the bomb detonates when damage control crews rush back into resume combatting the fire they are met by two secondary explosions just thirty seconds later flames rush forth sweeping them from the deck flying shrapnel shredded many of the first responders while jet fuel seared the skin off others leaving survivors with horrifying injuries but despite the apocalyptic inferno the forrestal s crew charged into the flames to save the ship sailors began frantically jettisoning bombs into the water before they could go off then entire warplanes were pitched over before the flames could consume them one sailor drove a forklift through fire to toss a huge ra 5c vigilante reconnaissance jet into the ocean the nearby destroyer rupertus sailed to within six meters of the flaming carrier and sprayed it with fire hoses for three hours while rescuing personnel that had jumped into the sea more than a dozen bombs cooked off on the forrestal s flight deck nine of them within the first five minutes including all of the m65s with their sensitive composition b unfortunately the initial blasts had effectively wiped out the two trained damage control teams their untrained replacements understandably made mistakes some sprayed seawater into the blaze washing away more effective flame retardant foam and causing burning jet fuel to spill through holes into the lower decks however the conflagration finally came under control at 12 15 in the afternoon though the flames would continually flare back to life and were not fully extinguished until 4 a m the following morning meanwhile the ship s thirty eight medical corpsmen were overwhelmed by the 161 personnel wounded in the catastrophe only relieved with the arrival of the hospital ship repose in all more than 134 sailors and airmen perished in the explosions and spreading fires the following day mccain interviewed by the new york times stated it s a difficult thing to say but now that i ve seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship i m not so sure that i want to drop any more of that stuff on north vietnam in addition to the human cost eleven skyhawks nearly a full squadron were either consumed by or pitched over the side as well as seven of the high performance phantom fighters and three huge ra 5cs needless to say the forrestal was in no shape to continue combat operations after its near death experience and sailed first for the philippines for emergency repairs then to florida to drop off its crew before anchoring at norfolk for a six month repair operation that would cost 217 million equivalent to 1 6 billion in 2017 dollars
president joe biden has asked people to encourage unvaccinated americans to get the vaccine but he didn t start a door to door push to force people to get the shot at a july 6 press briefing president joe biden said we are continuing to wind down the mass vaccination sites that did so much in the spring to rapidly vaccinate those eager to get their first shot and their second shot for that matter if they needed a second he continued now we need to go community by community neighborhood by neighborhood and oftentimes door to door literally knocking on doors to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus since the announcement of a five point plan to get more americans vaccinated online users have claimed a door to door campaign is a tactic to target unvaccinated americans one claim came from amy tarkanian former chairwoman of the nevada gop and wife of danny tarkanian an attorney and douglas county nevada commissioner biden just said that the government will be going door to door checking up on people who have not been vaccinated i did nazi that coming amy tarkanian mrst106 july 6 2021 verify viewer bee also asked is the president ordering door to door checks to make sure people get the covid 19 vaccine and verify reader jeff asked if the door to door checks were an enforcement tactic the question is the president ordering door to door checks to force individuals to get the covid 19 vaccine the sources the answer no president joe biden did not launch a door to door campaign to enforce or mandate the covid 19 vaccine but he is encouraging those who have been vaccinated to encourage others to get the vaccine what we found dr saralyn mark the former senior medical advisor at the white house and current lead covid 19 spokesperson for the american medical women s association told verify the bottom line is that the white house is not going door to door to enforce vaccination there s not a forced vaccination what it is it s an opportunity to educate and to engage the public there is enough data out there that shows that people tend to listen to people that they trust whether it be their neighbor their local physician pharmacist someone in their community mark said at the july 6 press briefing president joe biden laid out a five point plan to encourage individuals to get vaccinated considering mass vaccination sites would be soon going away more than 40 000 pharmacy locations offering the vaccine without an appointment easier access to the vaccine at a local doctor or healthcare provider s office access for children ages 12 to 18 to get vaccinated at a pediatrician s office encourage vaccines at a place of employment or provide services for an employer to give an employee paid time off to get vaccinated more mobile clinics at special events like concerts sporting events etc happening now president biden delivers remarks on the covid 19 response and the vaccination program the white house whitehouse july 6 2021 at a july 8 briefing press secretary jen psaki said community outreach works with vaccination rates across alabama arizona florida georgia and texas states with some of the lowest vaccination rates growing thanks to community outreach outreach meant to encourage not enforce dr howard koh with the harvard t h chan school of public health told verify if the u s is going to reach herd immunity we have to reach every person even if it s one at a time so when vaccination started in this country the initial goal was to reach millions at a time but now we re at a point where the goal is to reach one at a time and that s what this announcement is all about it s really important in this critical juncture to make sure that everybody has had a conversation with somebody they trust somebody who can provide information koh told verify and so this door to door effort is to provide information education and empowerment and having a dialogue about the facts about understanding each person and how they re feeling about vaccination and people s willingness to join to help the entire united states get this pandemic behind us is critically important right now said koh the federal government has some policies that affect each individual such as wearing masks on public transportation or in government buildings but the white house would not order individuals to enforce the vaccine one household at a time according to mark the states have a lot of responsibility and a lot of authority to help their local communities now i ve always seen this pandemic to be regional that different parts of the country as well as parts of the world would experience it differently at different times i saw the pandemic also being rolling meaning that we probably will see this virus for a very long time it will be endemic in our communities and it s also a revolving situation mark said so as case rates go up restrictions may have to go up as well and that s done really at the local regional level i think it s important to realize that we have to be nimble we have to be able to adapt and local communities and grassroots organizations and state level organizations can do that very well and very effectively

updated cloudflare on friday accused competitor amazon web services of massive markups and hindering customer data portability even as it invited the cloud services giant to join its discount data initiative known as the bandwidth alliance aws s bandwidth pricing is bonkers said ceo matthew prince via twitter and they stand alone in the industry not discounting when their customers send traffic to peered networks prince and nitin rao svp of global infrastructure at cloudflare elaborated on that claim in a blog post that argues aws is charging customers orders of magnitude more than its costs and makes a mockery of its parent company s mission statement that amazon strives to offer our customers the lowest possible prices in particular prince and rao take issue with cloud giant s egress data transfer or bandwidth pricing what it charges to send data to external networks during the last ten years industry wholesale transit prices have fallen an average of 23 per cent annually explain prince and rao compounded over that time wholesale bandwidth is 93 per cent less expensive than 10 years ago however aws s egress fees over that same period have fallen by only 25 per cent they further note that since 2018 the egress fees aws charges in north america and europe have remained unchanged while wholesale prices in those markets have gone down by more than half aws is able to charge excessive rates they suggest because customers pay for delivered data volume while aws pays for bandwidth based on the capacity of its pipes this difference charging customers using a stocks model while incurring costs under a flow model leaves lots of room for aws to profit based on effective utilization of its resources the pair made various estimates for aws s data transfer profit margin using the aws simple monthly calculator ironically named they contend in reference to aws s famously difficult to understand pricing scheme they project for example that aws charges customers in the us canada and europe 80 times more than its operational cost what s more they argue the effective markup is likely to be higher still because when aws exchanges data with a network like cloudflare using a direct settlement free peered connection though a private network interface incremental costs are negligible and there are also rebates that amazon collects from colocation providers who charge cross connection fees to customers to consider welcome to the hotel california only aws however is in a position to provide data on its actual costs but the company has not done so most businesses keep such details to themselves prince and rao also suggest there s an anti competitive aspect of aws s decision to charge a premium for data leaving its ecosystem egress but not for data entering its ecosystem ingress they liken this to hotel california pricing a reference to a line from the eagle s 1976 song of the same name that describes a place where you can never leave the implication is this pricing model deters companies dependent on aws from choosing to move their data and business elsewhere even though google and microsoft also charge for data egress the only rationale we can reasonably come up with for aws s egress pricing locking customers into their cloud and making it prohibitively expensive to get customer data back out they said so much for being customer first some aws users have come to this conclusion too 324tb month can 100 be cheaper outside of aws within aws it s closer to 30k than 20k aws egress and all cloud providers is absurdly expensive and aws should publish the margins they make on those links it s also a hidden cost and dark pattern pricing pic twitter com ghxf2ykpax randall hunt jrhunt june 2 2021 however the pricing for data egress from google cloud platform 0 11 and microsoft azure 0 0875 per gb for 10 tb doesn t appear to be vastly different from aws 0 09 per gb at least on paper what makes cloudflare single out aws is that microsoft azure and google cloud while neither participate in the bandwidth alliance will substantially discount egress charges for their mutual cloudflare customers in short cloudflare is sticking it to aws in the hope the cloud service giant will play ball and play nice the bandwidth alliance cloudflare said in a separate post can save customers between 7 5 per cent and 27 per cent on egress data transfer charges presently the group consists of alibaba automattic backblaze cherry servers dataspace dns networks dreamhost heficed kingsoft cloud liquid web scaleway tencent vapor vultr wasabi and zenlayer the register asked amazon for a response the web titan expressed its intention to so do though its reply did not arrive by our deadline we will update this story once we hear back if we had to guess we d predict that cloudflare s negotiation via social media won t make aws abandon its cloud based printing press for cash and while the attorney general of washington dc recently filed an antitrust lawsuit against amazon over alleged retail market abuses its aws subsidiary remains for the moment unthreatened by regulatory intervention full disclosure the register is a customer of cloudflare updated to add in a statement provided to the register two days after this story was filed amazon pushed back against cloudflare s claims major cloud providers charge similar amounts for transferring data out of their clouds however not all clouds are the same an amazon spokesperson said it s important to note that data transfer costs are more than just bandwidth in addition to bandwidth our costs reflect the extreme levels of redundancy that our customers get in our data center and broader networks and the value of a purpose built backbone that reduces latency and improves throughput our pricing reflects the cost of network investments aws makes in equipment and network backbone in addition to bandwidth to provide a highly available performant and redundant network that scales to customer workloads while delivering unmatched value to customers we ve also made eight data transfer out egress related price cuts in the last 11 years and the majority of our heavy data transfer workload customers use amazon cloudfront aws s content delivery service to enjoy even more significant cost savings

reading time 4 minutes brazil s social gap which had seemed almost bridgeable in the 2010s is now a widening fault line that threatens the country s potential for growth unless long term structural and educational reforms are undertaken the pandemic wreaked havoc on the lives of the world s poor turning a bad situation worse for the rich across the globe the story was different and in brazil the country that already boasted the title of the most unequal in latin america the world bank s gini coefficient measuring inequality reached its highest number on record 0 674 in the first quarter of 2021 while earnings for the poorest 40 shrunk by a third in 2020 the top 10 of earners lost just 3 of their income in the meantime the stock market hit record highs and commodity prices drove up measures of economic growth it is a paradox said marcelo nery director of the center for social policies at the fundação getúlio vargas a brazilian think tank and higher education institution gdp was better than expected the currency appreciated the stock market is up even formal job creation has improved only these indicators hide deeper problems globally we see investors risk appetite coming back while investing is also getting cheaper in brazil bringing more people to capital markets said laura karpuska an economics professor at fgv são paulo but the economic fundamentals have been worsening and markedly so a milder than expected 4 1 contraction in gdp in 2020 was followed by a 1 2 increase in the first quarter of 2021 comparing to the previous quarter bringing brazil s economy back to where it was in 2016 at the bottom of a deep recession unemployment is at a record high of 14 7 and nearly 20 million brazilians can t find work or have given up looking even informal work is in short supply as covid continues to spread across the country the bulk of low income jobs are in high contact services where we have yet to see a recovery said otaviano canuto a former executive director at the world bank and the imf and there is a risk that changes in behavior such as entertaining at home could last much longer than the pandemic much of the optimism in brazilian capital markets and in macroeconomic projections is being propelled by the agricultural and mining sectors according to cepea a research institute the agribusiness sector grew 24 in 2020 and now represents slightly over a quarter of brazil s gdp brazilian exports of crops and meat totaled 100 billion last year while mining exports increased by 31 but experts warn that the agroindustry does not have a multiplying effect on the economy as a whole commodity production is not labor intensive and the more job rich manufacturing sector has been shrinking since 2009 meanwhile inflation is on the rise driving down the debt to gdp ratio a measure observed by financial investors but exacting a toll on consumers especially the poor emergency cash transfers of about 100 authorized by president jair bolsonaro s administration helped informal workers and the poor navigate the covid 19 crisis but hope evaporated when despite the still raging pandemic the payments were discontinued at the end of 2020 we saw poverty levels fall by half last year to 4 5 said nery only to triple after the transfers stopped by march 2021 16 of brazilians were at or below the poverty line we were generous but not wise said nery we did not prioritize testing or vaccines and basically dismissed education altogether the government s spending on transfer programs reflects for nery a predictable pattern in the lead up to presidential elections poverty numbers always fall followed by a rapid increase said nery adding that the risk now is government attempting grandiose solutions beyond our fiscal capacity the diverging realities in the brazilian economy improving macroeconomic numbers and income at the top while more brazilians fall into low income classifications including extreme poverty are compromising future growth potential the multidimensional reality of this gap in income wealth access and representation is a major cause of our existing vulnerabilities said karpuska inequality has even made an appearance on brazil s happiness index which suffered the largest drop between 2019 and 2020 in a comparative study of 40 countries around the world pushed by a sharp decrease of wellbeing among the poor today even the imf warns that inequality severely impacts long term growth and economic stability there is a direct link between masses that are able to consume and economic growth said canuto inequality s social cost social gaps breed social unrest as chile and colombia can attest they also rob countries of the creative and productive potential of citizens that is a vital source of future wealth less human capital will mean less productivity and capacity to grow without triggering inflation said karpuska future discrepancies are also likely to get a boost from pandemic related school closings and education budget cuts which primarily affected poor children the percentage of young brazilians neither working nor studying jumped from 20 at the start of the decade to 29 during the pandemic experts say that this pandemic generation deprived of the benefits of education will bring down productivity and impact the economy as a whole bolsa família a cash transfer program for families in extreme poverty has helped keep children in schools but without job opportunities families struggle to get out of the program canuto says only the children of current beneficiaries will have a chance to break the cycle of poverty if the public sector can offer quality education and healthcare to combat the destructive force of inequality brazil needs comprehensive long term policies especially in education and digital inclusion but amid an ongoing political and institutional crisis and on the eve of a presidential campaign concerted action seems unlikely brazil s share of the global economy has fallen from 4 3 in 1980 to only to 2 4 today if the country continues to sabotage the future of its own people this downward trend is sure to continue about the author tornaghi is

am i the first scots irish person on your cover senator john mccain asks yes but it s all the same dna he doesn t seem to hear me he s busy being photographed by kit defever i m about to tell him about scotland being the only place the irish ever colonized the scotti being gaelic speakers from ireland who settled in argyle but i stop myself i ve noticed in the past that for a scot the news that scotland gets its name from the irish scotti is equivalent to an irish american hearing that al smith was german and that s a story for another issue scots irish as senator mccain calls himself is a label that confuses many are you irish or scottish the phrase is actually american used to identify the ulster scots such as senator mccain s ancestors who immigrated to the u s from northern ireland mostly in the 1700s much has been written about the battles between the irish and the ulster scots whose descendants are still marching every july 12 to celebrate the protestant king william s victory over the catholic james ii in 1690 in this issue tom deignan writes about the famous orange marches in new york city in the 1800s and the riots that ensued but there is much that should be written about what the two groups have in common not least a shared history of famine pestilence and the sword foisted on us by the british the gaelic traditions brought over by those 4th century irish are still strong in the scottish highlands where they are displayed in a passion for music dance and storytelling of course ireland s own gaelic cultural revival irish literary renaissance was fueled in good measure by one j m synge who was of ulster scots irish stock a marathon staging of all of synge s plays is currently taking place at lincoln center see druidsynge page 72 and one cannot mention the cause of irish freedom without recognizing the contributions of protestant nationalists such as wolfe tone charles stewart parnell and roger casement of the things shared in common both the irish and the scots irish enjoy a reputation for not backing down from a fight my favorite line in braveheart is send in the irish they have fought each other and for each other if defeated everywhere else i will make my last stand for liberty among the scots irish of my native virginia said george washington and on both sides in the american civil war and to this day both traditions have a proud record of service in the u s armed forces senator mccain who may well be the next president of the u s comes from that military tradition in this issue he talks to niall o dowd about lessons he learned from his father and grandfather both four star admirals that helped him survive five and a half years of imprisonment and torture in north vietnam it is that same spirit of endurance that facing down of difficult challenges that we also admire in our wall street 50 as the fifth anniversary of the attack on the world trade center draws near on july 12 2001 irish america held its annual wall street 50 party at windows on the world just two months later the world would change utterly but i have wonderful memories of that night i remember how young chris duffy looked and how proud his father was of him what a nice irish face the chairman of keefe bruyette woods joseph berry had and how he and his wife held hands as they left the party how joseph lenihan also of kbw had sent back his bio for the magazine with the quote the harder you work the luckier you get now a simple memorial behind the reception desk of keefe bruyette woods new offices says it all it is a painting of an american flag with 67 names etched into the stripes these are the names of the employees the company lost in the attack and included on the list are joseph berry chris duffy and joseph lenihan it s a moot point to say the loss of so many left a big emptiness that can never be filled yet those who were left to carry on did so with a heroic determination that would have made the ancestors proud as writer pete hamill says it s not the knock down it s the getting up that matters and those men and women many of them wall street 50 honorees who lost friends and loved ones forty percent of those who died in the attack worked in the financial industry set about rebuilding they went back to work knowing that it was the best way to honor those they lost every day you go to work and do something meaningful it is a tribute to all the special friends that we lost says john duffy who lost not only his son chris but many friends in the attack and still went on to lead keefe bruyette woods after 9 11 we quickly realized that we had several jobs ahead of us the obvious task of rebuilding our fine company the moral obligation of taking care of this family especially those with children and the need to heal and go on john continues in an interview with turlough mcconnell in this issue and go on they did recently i attended the opening of seven world trade center 7wtc the new 52 story tower just north of the world trade center site and the first major project near ground zero the evening was hosted by wall street rising a group that came together in the wake of 9 11 to attract business back into the devastated area the building has i m told impressive safety features exit stairwells are much wider than in the old 7wtc and it s built so that if the exterior walls are compromised the load will shift elsewhere but it is so much more than a safe building it s a beautiful place and it was for me a poignant reminder of our wall street 50 and the last time i visited the world trade center through the floor to ceiling glass of 7wtc you can look down at construction on the freedom tower site and see the footprints of the memorial to come you can look also at the architects model which shows the proposed new transit hub that will look like the opera house in sydney and the new performing arts center also architecturally beautiful and in the still unfinished space of 7wtc you can get a sense of something mighty of endurance promise and hope for the future all the things that this country is built on

it s hard to know for sure how many records they ve sold but it s probably well in excess of 100 million they are one of the most influential bands in history and played all over the world several times over but the one place singer bruce dickinson keeps nagging his manager to get them booked in it s cardiff s principality stadium which he describes as just right for me twickenham is too tall and wembley is too flat but cardiff gets it just right it s got a roof and the vibe in there is absolutely fantastic but one of the things that excites me about coming back to cardiff and doing a show is the new arena he says i absolutely love cardiff i m also a big rugby fan and want to get back into wales to see a rugby match the principality is the greatest stadium in the uk and i keep trying to persuade iron maiden s manager that we need to do a gig in cardiff s stadium dickinson is a remarkable man the frontman of a world famous metal band that s been going since 1975 he is also a qualified pilot who flew them on a boeing 747 called ed force one for world tours and the 62 year old founded an aviation business in st athan outside cardiff formally known as cardiff aviation the company was re branded as caerdav in 2019 and mainly focuses on aeroplane maintenance and pilot training though bruce says cardiff aviation got off to a turbulent start he is excited about the company s status and future under its new branding he founded the business in 2012 the same year the maiden england world tour started he had been made redundant as an air captain and wanted to put his passion into something new image richard williams bruce said because i loved flying i was working for a company which had aeroplanes for hire and i was a captain there for several years the company went bust in 2011 and i had never been in a company that had gone bust before because of the other things i do it wasn t as though i was out on my ear and couldn t afford the price of a meat pie but it was really distressing to see we had close on 400 employees and to see all those people all of that training and all of that camaraderie all just vanish overnight i thought i never want to do that again when i was wondering what to do next this opportunity came up at st athan the facilities at st athan meant there was great potential to start a varied aviation business offering a range of services and training opportunities it wasn t entirely maintenance related he said we thought there was a possibility of having a training business and possibly having a small air line in the end we had all three we shot the small airline down the training business is holding its own today we ve got some simulators that work and pay the rent image richard williams but for caerdav the main specialism remains in maintenance something bruce said the company is looking to expand to create more jobs in wales there are currently 105 full time employees with between 30 and 50 contractors we maintain large commercial transport aeroplanes bruce said we have a sweet spot at the moment for boeing 737s and airbus narrowbodies the airbus a320 family however we also have capabilities for larger aircrafts like 767s and 757s we do everything from changing the engines and the landing gear to interior refits electronic upgrades and complete strip downs and rebuilds we ve been going into the idea of doing cargo conversions which is a very big undertaking which would require an expansion in terms of facilities and a doubling of the workforce we re hoping that could happen within the next year or so there is a real need for more freighters some of the stock of existing freighters is pretty old and with big emphasis on carbon emissions and trying to make everything more efficient we are also training our own workforce now so we have an apprenticeship programme starting in september they will become mechanics and would hopefully stay with caerdav and we ll keep rolling that on year on year that should be a

of rent for the facilities it occupies bruce said there was a period under previous management when the relationship struggled and that upset me a lot because it was never the intention i am now pleased to say that we are now working with them very closely and i m pleased the way we are going during the pandemic business had been going well for caerdav despite the aviation industry being hit particularly hard he said though pilot training had dried up a bit he was very confident that it was a temporary phase and would soon pick up again he said we are holding all our training approvals and pilot training in abeyance because there isn t much going on right now but there will be pilot training will really be picking up in the next few years because retirements have accelerated a lot of the most experienced pilots such as those in their 60s have been out of the business for two years and decided to retire early there is already a pilot shortage in america so the need will come back image graham young at times it has been a struggle to juggle his monumentally successful music career with his other projects but he kept his head above water with support from the people around him he explained i m juggling it constantly the idea was to not be juggling it quite as much as i ended up doing in the early and middle years i put a substantial amount of money into the company over the years and when it was known as cardiff aviation i think it s fair to say it had a few false starts two years ago we had to completely reorganise the company we changed the name and completely rebranded it much of the workforce stayed the same and they have been fantastic but i went from being one third shareholder to 100 shareholder the crucial thing is to always communicate as a team in terms of the business it s about running past ideas and representing the company as a chairman should do you rely on a team and you just can t do it on your own there have been quite a few occasions when there was a significant amount of personal pressure but that does go with the territory but the people who were around me in wales were very supportive it s the same with iron maiden we have a great team so when as a band we re thinking of doing music we re not worrying about who s going to rent the truck or who s going to sort out the permits we have a fantastic team who does that and we do the music image graham young though bruce who lives in west london has been locked out of wales for much of the last two years because of the pandemic he said he is itching to visit again soon for work and pleasure wales is a lovely place and a great workforce he said it has a really well educated and long history of aviation support and technology we have an international export led business and having it in wales makes sense iron maiden s senjutsu is released on september 3 via parlophone records get the latest welsh news to your inbox by signing up for one of our newsletters here

democrats are adding 10 billion to the pending 3 5 trillion reconciliation bill to help hide their huge amnesties from worried voters according to a report in axios the extra money would provide democrats with a 10 billion talking point to fend off criticism from local voters who recognize how an amnesty of roughly 8 million economic migrants would damage their wages wealth and communities sen ben ray lujan d nm a member of the senate budget committee road tested the rhetoric at axios com saying i ve consistently advocated for making smart modern investments when it comes to border security the spending would fund modernization of ports at our border and would require drug screening of passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles that come into the united states axios described the democrats plan for the next few weeks why it matters democrats already planned to include roughly 120 billion for pathways to citizenship for dreamers temporary protected status holders and undocumented essential workers the sources said there will be even more to address immigration with more direct infrastructure ties but even the 10 billion fig leaf would be covertly designed to accelerate migration into americans jobs neighborhoods and civic life axios reported what we re hearing details haven t been finalized but the funds could be put toward facilities for handling asylum claims additional staff for higher cross border traffic areas expanding immigration courts to address backlogs alternatives to detention programs and various ports of entry repairs three sources familiar with the negotiations say the 10 billion spending plan comes as the biden administration refuses to build any more border wall with money that congress formally appropriated in 2019 and 2020 the extra 10 billion is just one of the many ways in which the giant budget bill is used to hide the amnesty under massive spending programs for government healthcare daycare for children education programs for adults as well as a variety of climate related spending programs the democrats are hiding the amnesty in the gigantic spending plan because they do not have public support for their radical migration and amnesty agenda but also they do not want to offer concessions that would win over public support for careful amnesties so senate democrats want to pass their amnesties by burying them in a bill that sets spending levels under the no filibuster reconciliation process this maneuver could allow them to pass a fast track nation changing amnesty with just 51 votes instead of the 60 votes normally required to get bills through the 100 member senate the task is difficult in part because the senate rules say that a senior clerk in the senate must first ok the proposed spending as directly related to budgets the clerk titled the parliamentarian can reject pieces of the bill if they are related to policy debates instead of budget allocations so far no gop senator has broken ranks to say he will give for the democratic amnesty largely because the amnesty would raise government spending and eventually provide democrats will millions of voters democrats are going to do the best that we can to include amnesties in the spending plan sen bernie sanders i vt said in a july 20 interview with pbs well we re trying to cover people who have been in the forefront among other things of protecting our economy critical care workers dreamers and others i have believed for a long time as i think almost all the members of the democratic caucus and some republicans that the time is long overdue to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship so we can t do it completely the way i would like to do it in a reconciliation bill there are real constraints in terms of policy what you can do we re going to do the best that we can i believe we can draft a bill to get it done budget chief rep john yarmuth d ky tweeted on july 20 after the daca court ruling congress must step up as a member of the 2013 gang of 8 i am committed to comprehensive immigration reform as house budget chairman i believe we can draft a bill to get it done after all immigration through reconciliation has happened before rep john yarmuth repjohnyarmuth july 20 2021 even if the parliamentarian does strike the amnesty from the budget the 10 billion for border construction will likely remain a source told breitbart news overall investors want to import more migrants even very poor migrants because they spike consumer sales boost rental rates cut wages and so raise profits and stock values they also serve as clients for welfare agencies as eventually as voters for democrat activists but migration damages ordinary americans career opportunities cuts their wages raises their rents curbs their productivity shrinks their political clout and fractures their open minded equality promoting civic culture in general legal and illegal migration moves wealth from employees to employers from families to investors from young to old from children to their parents from homebuyers to investors from technology to stoop labor biden s decision to restart the economic extraction of valuable consumers renters and workers from poor countries also helps move wealth and social status from heartland red states to the coastal blue states within each state the extraction policy also helps move wealth and status from gop rural districts to democrat cities unsurprisingly a lopsided majority of americans oppose labor migration
quick take california s electric car rebate program is designed to steer consumers toward clean environmentally friendly vehicles unfortunately for buyers it s confusing unpredictable and underfunded sam dudley of encino knows that california government has gone all in on zero emission vehicles so has he he s all about cutting back on greenhouse gases in may dudley splurged on a new electric car a metallic black chevy bolt ev lt he loves it but now it s july and the after school program director 35 wonders when the state will make good on the ev incentive rebate money it owes him he figures he s due 4 500 he might have to wait until next year for a check to arrive he said a rebate program representative told him by phone and he was warned he and thousands of others might not get back as much money as promised or might not receive any money at all they re not making this easy for the everyday person who is living in california dudley said he s not alone dudley s name sits on a rebate wait list with about 8 000 other california ev buyers the long delay might seem counterintuitive california is the national champion in zero emission vehicle promotion and air quality regulation much legislation has been enacted to encourage the transition to electric transportation and many billions have been spent just how many billions is surprisingly hard to ascertain owing to the wide dispersal of accounting data across various agencies state sen bob wieckowski d fremont has complained that trying to find out is an easter egg hunt gov gavin newsom even ordered a ban on new sales of internal combustion passenger cars and trucks by 2035 but the state rebate programs that aim to make zero emission vehicles more affordable to californians have been plagued over the years by erratic funding rebate coffers are often left empty for weeks or months at a time forcing qualified car buyers to draw on reserves of their own patience as the state gets its funding act together it doesn t help that figuring out whether a buyer s income qualifies them for a rebate or whether the car they want to buy is covered becomes a complicated and time consuming endeavor a welter of different rebate programs with different requirements adds to the confusion the programs that must be evaluated the clean vehicle rebate project the clean vehicle assistance program clean cars 4 all they all sound the same dudley said several air quality districts also offer rebates which come with their own rules electric utilities provide financial assistance for home chargers how is the average person supposed to do all this dudley said low income potential buyers can t afford to postpone rebates he said waiting four to six months after purchasing a new ev is untenable for many people car dealers are frustrated as well they welcome the rebate programs of course but complain there s so much customer confusion and so much red tape followed by months of delay that the hundreds of millions of tax dollars being spent aren t as effective as they might be the rebate project has paid consumers nearly 1 billion so far the more complicated it is and the more delays there are the more difficult it is for consumers to navigate these programs said brian maas president of the california new car dealers assn you want to make it as simple and easy as possible and you want to as close to point of sale as you can he said the key problem is unpredictable state funding the clean vehicle rebate project ran out of money in april the assistance program intended to help low income buyers purchase an ev ran out of money in march applicants were put on a wait list but a spokesperson for the state s air resources board said with funds exhausted and no new money on the way the assistance program might have to close the list the rebate project though is the big kahuna it s financed with state general funds and by the state s greenhouse gas reduction fund the state legislature depends on inherently uncertain forecasts for ev sales to decide how much money to allocate to general fund if forecasts are too low the money runs out the size of the greenhouse gas fund financed by state cap and trade energy permit auctions can rise and fall like a yo yo causing periodic refund delays that can last for three months or more wouldn t an increased gasoline tax accomplish the same goal making it more economical to buy a zero emissions car without all the complexity yes said denny cullenward an energy economist and coauthor of the book making climate policy work but it s a political nonstarter the last thing anyone wants to do is be the politician that sets the price of gasoline a carbon tax was considered under the administration of former gov jerry brown but didn t draw legislative support that s how the state s greenhouse cap and trade system came about as a carbon tax alternative cullenward said he s a big proponent of clean vehicle rebates and other incentives but called the current state of california s myriad programs and the way they are administered a nightmare the new state budget signed by newsom on july 16 provides 525 million for rebates 100 million of that comes from the greenhouse fund staff are working to finalize grant documents that would allow a portion of the allocation to be infused into the program now to cover the wait list and the remaining allocation will be added to the program once staff brings their proposal to the board for approval this fall the air resources board spokesperson said by email potential electric car buyers who turn to the rebate project website see an image of a highway style triangle warning sign and a message that says it will take several months before rebate money is distributed the message also cautions that rebate terms and conditions might be changed by the time the money becomes available as a result it says there is no guarantee that you will be eligible for a rebate meantime the state is evaluating the structure of its rebate programs there could be dramatic changes in store or not a newsom plan to issue 1 billion in government bonds would provide incentives for sales purchase and deployment of electric vehicle charging stations the 66 million in annual interest payments would be financed in part by extending motor vehicle fees now due to expire in 2024 as electric cars take a bigger share of the market state incentives might have to shift from cars and trucks to public chargers an official with the california energy commission said at a state senate budget hearing earlier this year patty monahan the commission s head of transportation noted that the cost of electric vehicle batteries has fallen dramatically over the last decade within the next few years electric vehicle costs are expected to match internal combustion equivalents making vehicle incentives less essential for all but the lowest income buyers now the barrier is i live in an apartment building and i don t have a place to charge my vehicle so i m not going to get a zero emissions vehicle we want to make sure no matter where you live you re going to have access monahan said the increasing popularity of electric cars there are now about 800 000 on california roads now and electric passenger vehicles total more than 8 of the new car market means rapidly rising costs for the state if left in place the rebate program costs would run to several billion dollars a year later in the decade the air resources board is considering rebate program alternatives that range from changing income requirements for buyers to putting a ceiling on the number of rebate qualified cars a manufacturer can sell to eliminating the rebate program altogether how much attention consumer confusion will get is unclear and consumers aren t the only ones dealing with red tape sellers and buyers of zero emission trucks and buses must navigate an array of different programs in different agencies the state budget includes 3 9 billion to be spent on zero emission vehicle programs over the next three years there are 29 state agencies and sub agencies that have a stake in that money state sen henry stern of calabasas is pushing a bill that would create an executive director that reports to the governor to coordinate those programs bolt buyer dudley wants to make clear that although he thinks he s getting the runaround by rebate officials everyone i ve talked to has been sympathetic it s not the people he s upset with he said it s the system this story originally appeared in los angeles times

just under four years ago brothers joesley and wesley batista were in brazilian prison cells with concrete bunk beds their multibillion dollar meat empire near collapse in one of the world s biggest corporate corruption scandals today they re not only free men but their company jbs is worth three times what it was then operates in 20 countries and controls a quarter of u s beef processing the brothers worth 5 8 billion hold stakes in companies with 28 billion in assets towering over all other meat barons their lazarus like revival comes partly from the one two punch of pandemic food prices short supply soaring demand that is making many in food rich right now but it s more than that it s a testament to bare knuckles political deal making ruthless efficiency like using every inch of a carcass while pivoting to plant based alternatives and eyeing a u s listing jbs is a prime example of the brazilian way of doing business said luis andre azevedo a professor at fundacao getulio vargas s law school pointing to the company s deep longstanding political connections the real trick has been not only mining those connections but betraying them in 2017 the brothers turned on a network of politicians they d spent years cultivating through legal and off the books donations what followed was a scandal so widespread that it led to joesley day one of the worst market routs in brazil s history last month when jbs was targeted by a large scale cyberattack it paid an 11 million ransom in bitcoin putting an end to severe meatpacking disruptions in north america and australia this photo taken april 18 2020 shows the jbs usa pork plant in worthington minn the batista saga is steeped in proximity to power patriarch jose batista sobrinho 87 founded the company that bears his initials in 1953 and soon settled in the still to be built city of brasilia selling meat to the construction workers erecting the new national capital his sons soon joined him it was 49 year old joesley and wesley 51 who turned it into a global meat empire during a decade long 20 billion acquisition spree financed with stock and debt with the help of brazil s state owned development bank they targeted poorly managed companies around the globe and turned them around it s a combination of being very good in execution and good acquisitions that allowed them to diversify the business and generate good returns said leandro fontanesi head of food and agribusiness coverage at bradesco bbi it s also been about cold blooded choices in 2017 brazil was trying to root out corruption jailing politicians and businessmen joesley and wesley were knee deep in it and had a choice to make they described to prosecutors a network of bribes encompassing more than 1 800 politicians who allegedly eased access to government owned banks and pension funds at a time when brazilian authorities were shelling out cheap money to multiple companies hoping to create national champions the turmoil that followed nearly toppled a president the brothers who declined to be interviewed for this article were forced out of day to day operations while the family s holding company j f agreed to pay 10 3 billion reais 2 billion to brazilian authorities over 25 years followed by a similar deal with the u s department of justice last year for 256 million to appease creditors they shed 12 billion reais in assets including a flip flop maker a dairy producer and businesses in uruguay and paraguay in a complex debt restructuring that could have destroyed the company they also had to convince cattle ranchers to wait until they had the cash to pay them while persuading key executives like current global chief gilberto tomazoni to stick with the firm when all was said and done the batista family kept control of its prized meat packer among their holdings in minnesota are the jbs pork plant in worthington and the pilgrim s pride chicken plant in cold spring wesley and joesley never retook the reins of the business and disappeared from public life other family members are stepping in chief among them is wesley batista filho 30 who now handles key units at jbs and is being groomed for a top slot in keeping with family tradition he started out working in animal slaughter learning every part of the carcass of course the batistas aren t the only meatpackers doing well the pandemic has been disruptive and lucrative for many others outbreaks of the virus among meatpacking staff sent animal protein prices surging as consumers clamored for supplies while shutdowns spurred an unprecedented glut of livestock that squeezed ranchers and pushed down costs for slaughterhouses jbs has beaten most peers with a 69 surge in earnings before items in the past year according to data compiled by bloomberg brazilian rival marfrig global foods has also outperformed with a 38 jump marfrig s owner marcos molina agreed without acknowledging guilt to pay an indemnity in a bribery probe back in 2018 apart from taking advantage of the present the jbs strategy is to anticipate the future jbs and tyson are in the process of reinventing themselves as protein companies rather than just meat companies said jennifer bartashus a senior analyst for packaged food retail staples at bloomberg intelligence they are engaging more and more in plant based alternatives that has meant going back to serial acquisition mode snapping up smaller companies all over the globe including a german firm that makes plant based meat substitutes their endgame as many jbs executives have stated during the years is listing the meat giant in the u s its new york listed rival tyson foods is worth almost double even though jbs outranks it in nearly other metric to appease governance concerns the batistas have added several senior compliance and control positions to their flagship jbs since 2017 said flavia bedran credit analyst at s p ratings but there s one key change they ve yet to address the board is still made up mostly of family members and executives with ties to jbs she says they are also reckoning with criticism by environmental activists who say they re not doing enough to eliminate deforestation jbs has vowed to invest 1 billion over the next decade to cut carbon emissions and implement other initiatives while committing to tracking more effectively the origin of the cattle it buys so they are taking the right steps to improve the perception to investors and i think the listing will also help said bradesco s fontanesi it will be perceived as another positive step toward being more transparent better governance it may not go smoothly this year the batistas tried to take public in the u s a fintech side bet the family made in 2015 the transaction in which they sought an 8 billion valuation for their payments firm pics ltd was scrapped for now according to people familiar with it investors demanded a steeper discount the people said asking not to be named because the talks aren t public after giving up on the ipo the family has pledged to invest 3 billion reais in the firm known as picpay out of their own pocket until 2023 with plans to resume the ipo then a person familiar said a representative for picpay which is run by another batista family member jose antonio batista confirmed the transaction had been postponed without adding further details still a recent industrywide chicken price fixing scandal in the u s shows that investors tend to stay focused on the main product rather than on side deals or past turmoil argues bloomberg intelligence s bartashus in the meat industry people tend to move on from that she observed bloomberg s gerson freitas jr contributed to this report

economynext vietnam s central bank has promised the us treasury not to devalue the dong while insisting that the monetary policy was aimed at domestic stability though the america has extracted a promise to allow to improve exchange rate flexibility over time a dreaded modernization of monetary policy also looms perhaps backed by the international monetary fund which has been peddling flexible policy that could bring vietnam down in the future when the us tightens monetary policy in 2020 the us treasury falsely accused the state bank of vietnam of currency manipulation mercantilist speak to indicate country was undervaluing the dong to push exports the false treasury label was promptly amplified by the hurrah boys of the western financial press though it was withdrawn in 2021 related vietnam monetary policy for stability not trade pm tells trump after false us charges of dong manipulation the vietnam dong has been stable since 2010 when it collapsed followings stimulus in the wake of the burst us housing bubble though the sbv jacked up rates and intervened to try and stop it creating domestic downturn in the process including in property stable dong is for domestic stability not trade the sbv underscores that the focus of its monetary policy framework is to promote macroeconomic stability and to control inflation a joint statement issued after meeting a between sbv governor nguyen thi hong and treasury secretary janet yellen said vietnam confirms that it is bound under the articles of agreement of the imf to avoid manipulating its exchange rate in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage and will refrain from any competitive devaluation of the vietnamese dong in april 2021 the us lifted the false currency manipulator label on dong and also the swiss franc u s drops switzerland vietnam currency manipulator labels the false labeling of the swissie one of the strongest currencies in the world amused classical economists the absurdity of putting the swiss franc and the dong in the same basket brings back memories of may 1 2002 he us economist steve hanke wrote in december 2020 that s when i appeared before the senate banking committee along with then treasury secretary paul o neill to testify on exchange rates and the treasury s report on macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of major trading partners of the united states i was highly critical of both the entire concept and the particular methods used to label a country as a currency manipulator i indicated that the u s treasury s report was little more than an invitation for political mischief that would interfere with free trade in short i thought and think that the entire semi annual currency manipulator ritual is rubbish and should be trashed shortly before the us false charge the international monetary fund had had also claimed that the dong was undervalued though its real effective exchange index of over 130 citing a methodology using the country s current account surplus vietnam has a current account surplus partly due to dollar inflows sterilization and forex reserve collection by the sbv and partly due to vietnam firms investing in neighboring countries such as cambodia and laos backed by the strong dong vietnam billionaires have also been buying up assets in the us governor hong also stuck to her guns insisting that no dong undervaluation was going on the state bank of vietnam will continue to manage exchange rate policy within its general monetary policy framework to safeguard the proper functioning of the monetary and foreign exchange markets to promote macroeconomic stability and to control inflation not to create an unfair competitive advantage in international trade governor hong insisted in the joint statement over several years the imf has tried to push the vietnam to a flexible exchange rate with flexible inflation targeting a deadly discretionary policy framework that has destroyed countries like sri lanka and neighboring laos ahead of the us treasury false charge in 2020 the imf had also fuelled false propaganda against dong stability claiming it was undervalued despite the real effective exchange rate index being over 130 related vietnam reer ignored by imf buoying us mercantilists as sri lanka rupee falls the us had previously pushed japan to appreciate its currency with mercantilists at the treasury hoping it would reduce the trade deficit though the yen was pushed up from 360 at the break up of the bretton woods to around 110 now the trade deficit with the us has remained mercantilists fail to understand that america s foreign financed deficit spending and inward foreign direct investment is the reason for trade deficits dreaded modernization of monetary policy the us treasury however had extracted a promise from vietnam to allow greater exchange rate flexibility and modernize its monetary policy framework which could indicate flexible inflation targeting or un anchored monetary policy a flexible exchange rate lowers or destroys the credibility of the peg triggering capital flight and also panic among importers while exporters hold back the imf backed permanently depreciating flexible exchange rate put around 4 billion us dollars of capital in rupee bonds to flight the sbv is also making ongoing efforts to further modernize and make more transparent its monetary policy and exchange rate framework the joint statement said in support of these efforts the sbv will continue to improve exchange rate flexibility over time allowing the vietnamese dong to move in line with the stage of development of the financial and foreign exchange markets and with economic fundamentals while maintaining macroeconomic and financial market stability modernization of monetary policy is sri lanka with a flexible exchange rate and flexible inflation targeting or un anchored monetary policy had brought multiple currency crises and the indian ocean is now close to sovereign default the imf gave technical support to calculate an output gap a type of monetary stimulus that brought down the bretton woods system of soft peg and ended a centuries old gold standard that had been kept with floating two ways discount rates by many central banks for nearly three centuries vietnam also maintains its peg to the us dollar with a wide policy corridor and two way simultaneous repo and reverse repo auctions however mercantilists who study at keynesian cannot grasp the concept that exchange rates are determined by the monetary anchor in use and has nothing to do with the broader economy keynes himself cheered as the sterling floated and went off the gold standard in 1931 stability of foreign exchange rates was in their eyes a mischief not a blessing explained ludwig von mises a classical economist such is the essence of the monetary teachings of lord keynes the keynesian school passionately advocates instability of foreign exchange rates true to form the joint statement claimed that the vietnam dong should move in line with the stage of development of the financial and foreign exchange markets and with economic fundamentals implying that real economy factors read current account surplus and not the monetary anchor determines an exchange rate the sri lanka went through severe flexible exchange rate episodes in 2018 and early 2020 earning downgrades in both cases rating agencies have said the stability of the dong was a key criteria for growth and foreign direct investment related vietnam s stable exchange rate is key to fdi driven export economy moody s says as sri lanka downgraded vietnam bb outlook raised to positive by s p after imf says high growth with no stimulus sri lanka is now trying maintain a stable exchange rate but has no monetary policy to back it unlike vietnam sri lanka is printing money inflating the monetary base which is

tivoization your right to install under copyleft gpl two schools of thought about the purpose of copyleft have been at odds for some time simply put the question is are copyleft licenses designed primarily to protect the rights of large companies that produce electronics and software products or is copyleft designed primarily to protect individual users rights to improve modify repair and reinstall their software this debate quickly gets deep into complex policy questions in the last few years that general debate has slowly but surely focused almost entirely on the issue of users ability to make effective use of foss on their own hardware by reinstalling their modified versions historically these nuanced policy questions about copyleft requirements have generally been discussed only in semi public venues and often fall prey to the tactic du jour post fact politics i have realized in recent months that the failure to properly document and explain key historical narratives in copyleft history leaves software freedom activism at a disadvantage well resourced copyleft violators and their lawyers can use the ambiguity and confusion in the scant public record to spin false narratives and draw legal conclusions while such legal conclusions should not be drawn absent a court ruling companies have nevertheless pushed their views forward quite loudly recently to use herman and chomsky s insightful phrasing the incumbent power structures manufacture consent to their worldview to serve their interests merely by being the loudest and most commonly heard voices specifically on the issue of protections for the right to repair and reinstallation under copyleft licenses such as gpl i am fortunate to have been a direct observer to many of the events that now serve as the connective tissue to build these false narratives about the gpl however i admit i have failed to write down and impart that knowledge to the general public in adequate measure which has in turn inadvertently aided in promulgation of these false narratives so at least on the issue of scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable i hope this essay will serve as remedy i and everyone at conservancy all believe in intellectual transparency and we strive to provide it wherever possible the truth will out installation requirement under gplv2 recent debates on this issue focus on the question of what is required to comply with the first two sentences of gplv2 3 2 which reads the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable before explaining the historical understanding of these terms i will first of all point out that any company or lawyer that seeks to do the bare minimum for compliance is likely not prioritizing users rights to repair their software in all compliance related systems bad actors seek a race to the bottom rules like gpl are similar to environmental regulations workplace safety requirements and the like the more minimalistic the interpretation of the requirements the more companies can profit from only doing the bare minimum nevertheless it has been the goal of organizations that advocate for software freedom such as conservancy ourselves or fsf to state clearly our view about the minimum requirements as best we can i often wonder if this strategy has been beneficial to software freedom sadly the answer from the industry has primarily been to hear us clearly about the minimum requirements and then work over time to lower the gpl compliance bar even if it requires inaccurately quoting foss leaders and misleading the public about history most recently industry has engaged in this bar lowering process with gplv2 3 2 and installation information under gplv2 generally my hope herein is to fully explain the history of interpretation of gplv2 3 2 by pro copyleft advocates and explore the misdirection of arguments of those who seek to curtail users rights to install modified versions of their gpl d software fsf cle classes 2003 2004 i began volunteering for licensing and gpl enforcement work for fsf in 1997 and officially worked on my first gpl enforcement action in 1999 i became an fsf employee that year and worked there until 2005 i thereafter remained affiliated with the organization in various roles until my final affiliations ended with fsf in october 2019 most notably i was the executive director of fsf from 2001 2005 during that time i led fsf s gpl enforcement and copyleft education measures including the cle classes first taught in 2003 2004 in preparation for teaching those courses i began to write the tutorial which later became the copyleft guide to begin that effort i collected curated and verified interpretations and intent of the gplv2 with richard stallman bob chassell a key but oft forgotten leader of fsf during the 1980s and 1990s and fsf s legal counsels one of the many outcomes of that endeavor was that i wrote these words on 2003 05 09 gplv2 3 requires that the source code include meta material like scripts interface definitions and other material that is used to control compilation and installation of the binaries in gpl enforcement actions at the time during our complete corresponding source ccs checks we verified that the source code was not only complete but that it corresponded to the binaries on the vendors devices and that we could install modified versions of the software this was a standard part of any check to verify gplv2 compliance passing this check was required then and now by fsf and conservancy before distribution rights are restored after a violation that position was not controversial when i along with then fsf counsel daniel ravicher taught it to lawyers in 2003 and 2004 on fsf s behalf nevertheless today many act as if this interpretation and intent of gplv2 3 2 is a recent and novel phenomena rather than a long standing position held by all copyleft activists for at least 18 years today most companies and lawyers argue incorrectly imo that users have no rights to reinstall their gplv2 d software the 2003 tivo gpl enforcement action even before teaching those cle classes as then fsf s executive director i led the gplv2 enforcement effort against tivo i ve often seen those with only a passing familiarity with the subject jump to inaccurate conclusions about that enforcement action that tend to conveniently fit their policy agenda i herein recount the entire history regarding the tivo gplv2 violation and how it led to the tivoization rhetoric since that rhetoric is often treated as dispositive truthiness that gplv2 does not ensure the users rights to repair by reinstalling their modified gplv2 d software we should examine the actual facts that back the rhetoric and examine the conclusions that others make about gplv2 based on it first and foremost tivo s gpl violation initially had nothing specific to do with gplv2 3 2 tivo never raised any intention to not comply with that section in fact to my recollection tivo never disputed nor disagreed with fsf s interpretation on that section the initial violation was a standard gplv2 3 b violation wherein some distributions of the tivo device had an offer for source that could not be successfully exercised at the time acting on behalf of fsf i contacted tivo on 2002 06 11 to raise this issue and tivo responded favorably and indicated they wanted to resolve the matter as is usual practice in all gpl enforcement matters i and my then team did our due diligence to verify full compliance including any other potential issues under gplv2 eventually my fsf colleague david turner and i did a ccs check of tivo s software the procedures criteria and interpretations that turner and i used then are exactly the same as the ones that denver and i use today at conservancy to my knowledge based on recent personal conversations with fsf staff fsf still uses when these same procedures criteria and interpretations when fsf has the rare occasion to do gplv2 enforcement these days once the gplv2 3 b violation was resolved turner and i discovered as has been true in nearly every one of the hundreds of gpl compliance matter that i ve worked that the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable were incomplete when this was identified tivo s solution was to in fact agree with the interpretation that that such instructions are mandatory and must be provided and they provided them to my knowledge tivo was in full compliance with the gplv2 including the inclusion of instructions for installation as required under gplv2 people were able to reinstall linux on their tivo boxes thanks to our enforcement action community resources on how to take advantage of gpl reinstallation rights on tivos of that era are still readily available at the time tivo was doing the right thing in providing what the gplv2 requires including the ability to reinstall gnu and linux software onto the actual device keep in mind this enforcement action and the compliance achieved from it occurred years before the gplv3 process began understanding the tivoization rhetoric so what did tivo do that was so objectionable what was the behavior that stallman went to work drafting gplv3 to prevent that tivo was allowed to do under gplv2 it s not as others widely misreport that tivo forbade reinstallation of the gpl d software itself to my knowledge tivo never prevented such reinstallation no one involved including me stallman tivo or anyone at fsf at the time believed that gplv2 permitted tivo to withhold the installation information for the gpl d software itself fsf demanded that tivo provided its users the ability to reinstall linux and other gpl d software such as gnu bash what tivo later did which some software freedom activists including stallman found objectionable was that tivo designed the reinstallation process of that gplv2 d software to cause the proprietary tivo application to cease to function i recall this being widely discussed when tivo series 3 was released in mid 2006 and my understanding was that all series 3 devices had this particular anti feature there were rumors that some of the series 2 had this anti feature as well but not all models in other words if you decided to modify your copy of linux for the tivo device and reinstall linux the tivo userspace application would realize that cryptographic lockdown had been breached and that proprietary software would no longer function by exercising your reinstallation rights under gplv2 you d turn your tivo dvr into a stand alone server with some video processing equipment attached you could use kodi which at the time had a different name to turn that former tivo into a foss dvr but your ability to use the proprietary dvr software from tivo was lost likely permanently most have of course heard of the negative term tivoization that richard stallman popularized during the gplv3 process which was contemporaneous with the release of the tivo series 3 i nevertheless asked stallman to not use that term both then and many times since i still disagree with stallman s policy position on the narrow issue of preserving proprietary userspace functionality specifically i just don t think it matters if upon upgrading your copylefted software that the proprietary software that was to use gplv2 s terminology merely aggregated alongside the copylefted software continue to function i felt and still feel that it s actually better policy to break the merely aggregated proprietary software as gplv2 permits my policy view is that this breakage inspires and encourages users to install a foss alternative for the userspace applications after they ve reinstalled the foss operating system nevertheless stallman found this practice using crypto lock down to force the proprietary software to fail illegitimate he noted publicly that gplv2 didn t prevent this behavior and wanted and wrote as explained below a gplv3 draft that prohibited that behavior how discussion focused on cryptographic lockdown generally to this day i ll remain frustrated that many pro gplv3 advocates during the gplv3 drafting process saw fit to imply ideas that they had no basis to believe were true about gplv2 we all knew long before gplv3 drafting began that there was a clear installation requirement in gplv2 the word install appears prominently the training materials that i developed for fsf described above were vetted through stallman and fsf s legal counsel before using them to teach cle classes if anyone received a different impression it was surely a miscommunication due to the aggressive gplv3 is much better rhetoric of the time meanwhile much of the debate about cyptographic lockdown under gpl centered around the question of disclosure of specific authorization keys it was said probably correctly that gplv2 did not mandate disclosure of an any specific authorization key what was often left unsaid apparently in an effort to make gplv2 seem weaker than it actually was was what gplv2 did still require a functional installation method without disclosure of authorization keys for example it would in my personal opinion be entirely compliant with the gplv2 to simply disable the secure boot chain providing no path back to the vendor provided cryptographically signed firmware and allow the user to reinstall only the gplv2 d components on the device never to return to the stock vendor firmware i suspect such restriction would be prohibited under gplv3 since gplv3 clearly requires not that you just give a viable install path as gplv2 does but gplv3 additionally requires disclosure of the authorization keys we can debate whether this copyleft expansion under gplv3 was good policy what is not up for debate is the simple concept that more requirements added to a later revision of a licensing document does not change the intent or standing requirements in the older document that s true even if the authors of the original document for marketing or other reasons choose later to denigrate their own past work as it turns out historically we know what gplv2 intended because its author richard stallman talked so extensively about what he sought to accomplish by creating gplv2 going back to the early 1990s and contemporaneous with gplv2 s publication stallman himself has been quite fond of telling his experience with the broken mit printer for which he begged for the source code and didn t receive it stallman doesn t end this story with what i really wanted was to get the source code to that printer so i could build my own printer from scratch and then compile and make a fresh install of that printer software on a new printer no stallman was clear that his goal was to fix the bugs on the printer that mit already had using the source code for that very same printer stallman expected that the source code for the printer would include information sufficient for him to recompile and reinstall the software onto the very same device larger printers of that era were simply embedded devices of unusual size they have only minor technical differences from the tvs wireless routers and dozens of other linux based embedded devices we have today computers are tiny today when they were large before but their functioning and basic methods of operations have not changed install meant install then install means install now and fsf conservancy every software freedom activist and every legitimate copyleft theorist that i ve ever met still agrees with this the intent of the gplv2 is clear and always has been to allow reinstallation of modified versions of the gpl d software into the same place where the binaries were installed when you got the computer in the first place and to reap the benefits of that change it s ludicrous to suggest stallman meant anything other than that when he wrote gplv2 recent confirmation from fsf nevertheless opponents of users right to repair their software persist in their claims that gplv2 doesn t intend this we at conservancy hear it regularly gpl violators frequently send us a recently compiled dossier of curated comments by fsf quoted and some even misquoted completely out context that purport to prove that fsf does not want users to repair their embedded devices that contain gplv2 d software my affiliations with fsf had already ended by the time this dossier started making the rounds so we did what any reasonable person would do we asked fsf to clarify their opinion for us directly the opportunity to ask presented itself about a year ago in may 2020 when conservancy worked with fsf s executive director john sullivan fsf s licensing and compliance manager donald robertson and fsf s then legal counsel marc jones on a joint gplv2 enforcement matter against a pernicious and intentional violator who had infringed the copyrights of gnu bash and linux the violator was using a gplv2 d fork of bash we took the opportunity then to reaffirm our joint understanding of this 18 year old interpretation of the gplv2 as part of that specific joint embedded device enforcement action we discussed the matter at length and confirmed everyone s understanding remained unchanged from the prior fsf positions going back at least 18 years at the end of our discussions on 2020 05 11 i wrote to sullivan saying i just want to summarize what i believe was our mutual view on the phone call last friday if you could confirm that i have summarized correctly we ll use the below as a basis of our response to the gplv2 does not have any specific requirement for preservation of the ability to reinstall proprietary software centric vendor provided firmwares even if such firmwares contain some gplv2 d works on embedded systems provided that the downstream user i e the consumer with the device can build install and repeatedly and successfully reinstall a firmware containing only the copylefted components such as linux bash john replied on 2020 05 13 with bradley we suggest just a couple of small tweaks the gplv2 does not have any specific requirement for preservation of the ability to reinstall proprietary software centric vendor provided firmwares even if such firmwares contain some gplv2 d works on embedded systems provided that the downstream user i e the consumer with the device can build install run and repeatedly and successfully reinstall a firmware containing at least the copylefted components such as linux bash as you can see sullivan advocates inclusion of the term run which admittedly i had accidentally failed to include in my original draft it was a great addition and sullivan s statement matched exactly the historical interpretation that fsf espoused when i worked there in 2003 indeed it read to me almost exactly what chassell had originally taught it to me when i was volunteering for fsf in the 1990s furthermore the quote from sullivan above matches the position that i vetted with stallman throughout my time at fsf right up until the end of my affiliation with fsf in 2019 thus fsf s position as stated above on the question of installation under gplv2 has remained consistent from 2003 2020 this leaves me to wonder how is it that so many people came to conclude that fsf s view was that the gplv2 didn t speak to install at all i can only speculate but my view is that a people heard what they wanted to hear b a few but not most or even many linux developers spoke widely that it was their personal view that installation information isn t required by gplv2 notwithstanding the obvious textual requirement and c in their fervor to ballyhoo the gplv3 as an improvement some gplv3 advocates chose to denigrate gplv2 as not good enough in an apparent effort to frighten pro gplv2 copyleft activists to rush away from gplv2 as quickly as possible stallman on gplv3 installation information in april 2012 i started an email thread with stallman yet again about the term tivoization i again urged him to stop using the term because in my view what tivo did for gplv2 compliance was not bad for software freedom i wrote to stallman at that time to again remind him that upgrades of tivo s linux installation can be done successfully and at least for tivo product that fsf declared in compliance the only offense was one that gplv2 permits merely disabling the proprietary components from working after reinstallation of the gplv2 d components at that time stallman informed me that he had indeed designed the gplv3 to deal with this situation specifically i asked him on 2012 05 05 these words in gplv3 the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made mean that the proprietary software that is not a combined work with the gplv3 d work must also function stallman replied on 2012 05 06 with absolutely and i wrote it specifically to do that why this history must be told generally speaking long narratives of past events that have hitherto lived only in oral history usually have academic interest only they make for great podcast or post conference dinner fodder but they rarely make for good blog posts nevertheless i ve explained all this here in painstaking detail to counter the rising swell of opposition to users right to repair their gplv2 d software installations initially these efforts to curtail the right to reinstall under gplv2 have been done clandestinely for example by spreading the aforementioned misleading dossier recently however the effort has gone public in mid july 2021 a lawyer named mccoy smith who tries to make his living in part representing gpl violators published an article that makes outrageous and inaccurate claims about these long standing positions held by both conservancy and fsf we at conservancy don t fear transparency and we urge you to read mccoy s response to denver s article as well as denver s original article and then reread this one that responds to mccoy s argument you should decide for yourself who has the better argument and decide whether or not we ve adequately answered mccoy s outrageous and inaccurate claims in our view mccoy spins a false narrative about the differences between gplv2 and gplv3 regarding install and provides specious evidence for this claim i hope that the historical facts that i describe above clarify this issue a few of mccoy s fundamental arguments are easily disputed by the historical facts that i outlined above mccoy accused me and conservancy of historical revisionism by claiming my words about gplv2 3 were a recent effort to reinterpret the requirements of gplv2 i ve shown above using reliable and accurate revision history logs that those words which mccoy claims were recent were written and published in may 2003 mccoy states that the objection to tivo was regarding prohibition of reinstallation of the gpl d binaries i ve confirmed above that during fsf s enforcement action against tivo tivo agreed to allow reinstallation of the gpl d binaries but caused the proprietary software not to function and that fsf took the position that gplv2 required reinstallation of gplv2 d binaries to function mccoy claims that gplv2 s original intent was never to allow installation i ve shown above that stallman the author of gplv2 specifically knew about situations of embedded device proprietarization before gplv2 was drafted and in contemporaneous and ongoing rhetoric spoke clearly that he intended to preserve and advance users right to repair their software by engaging in truly functional reinstallation of gpl d binaries into the actual location mccoy claims that fsf does not share conservancy s position about installation under gplv2 i ve shown specific text written by fsf s executive director which was also verified by fsf s legal counsel and fsf s licensing and compliance manager as recently as may 2020 wherein conservancy and fsf are in full agreement i can also further confirm that i spoke with john sullivan on the telephone earlier this week and he reconfirmed that he still agrees with the paragraph as written as correct policy for the situation conclusion i then quote my 2012 exchange with stallman to point out clearly the installation information definition in gplv3 expands the requirements and does not reduce the existing installation requirements that we all saw as present in gplv2 from its first publication in 1992 mccoy s article contains a simple logical fallacy it assumes that since the installation information requirements in the gplv3 are in some respects more expansive than those in gplv2 that the requirement for installation information in gplv2 are non existent and or are diminished merely through public discussion of gplv3 s policy goals by fsf during gplv3 s drafting as i show above it s clear that stallman s rhetoric about extending installation information requirements in gplv3 had complex additional policy goals that don t exist in gplv2 specifically i don t think that gplv2 reinstallation requires that all merely aggregated works continue to function as designed upon reinstallation of the gplv2 works stallman has agreed with that gplv2 interpretation but differed from me regarding forward looking policy in that he finds such disabling of proprietary software deplorable and thus stallman wrote gplv3 to prevent that practice that gplv2 permits furthermore and most importantly i quote the may 2020 recent exchange with sullivan to point out that fsf policy regarding gplv2 and installation has not wavered since fsf established it during bob chassell s time which continued on into my time as fsf s executive director and then into peter brown s and john sullivan s time too as i ve shown this interpretation of gplv2 installation requirements is at least a 17 year unbroken chain from at may 2003 all the way through to may 2020 if bob chassell were still alive today i m sure he could account for that position remaining consistent in the 1990s too there is also a central and inherent flaw in mccoy s underlying argument the idea that fsf s view or linus view or any single individual s or organization s view is what matters the license says what it says if the license steward has a view it would not mean their view is dispositive and i say that knowing that their view happens to agree with mine indeed linus torvalds has stated he doesn t agree with fsf s views about gplv2 and has his own views which mccoy himself quotes i m not sure why mccoy thinks that forwards his argument because linus view differing from fsf undercuts mccoy s argument that what fsf said during gplv3 drafting is relevant other contributors to linux disagree with both fsf s and linus view many prominent linux developers have told me that they agree with conservancy and or fsf about this others have told me they have an even broader interpretation of the installation requirements under gplv2 than i do thus mccoy makes a classic appeal to authority fallacy as the center of his argument regardless of mccoy s mostly unsupported opinion i suspect even he would agree that only three things will really definitively matter regarding this issue a what the wronged party who didn t get their complete corresponding source code believes b what the entity refusing to give them that source code believes and c what the courts says when the former sues the latter all else is simply bluster full of sound and fury but signifying nothing finally as a reminder please keep in mind that as i already said in the text above i no longer have any affiliation with fsf since october 2019 and do not speak for them which is precisely why i quote the words they told me please note that i have not personally looked into tivo s gpl compliance since late 2003 as such it s entirely possible that tivo models released from 2004 onward may have violated gplv2 3 2 and failed to include required scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however any later non compliance is not capitulation by me fsf conservancy or anyone else that mccoy s and others interpretation of that clause is correct please be abundantly clear that even as i give an interpretation of what i happen to believe is correct at this given moment i m a flawed human being capable of error also ianal and tinla i can misspeak misstate and otherwise just be plain wrong about something one way or the other this is also true of fsf its representatives and all the other pundits like mccoy smith who opine on this question one of the horrible race to the bottom traps that gpl violators constantly lay for us is unrelenting pressure that we choose between a reducing what we believe a given license requires or b suing them to ask the court to uphold our view no one escapes that pressure cooker unscathed nearly every pro copyleft activist including me has fallen into this trap and succumbed to the pressure of a at least once i know even as i write this footnote that someday i m going to have a gpl violator s lawyer quoting this blog post back to me in a deposition about some esoteric race to the bottom issue of gpl compliance they re going to look for a way to twist my words to argue that somehow i ve given their client carte blanche to trample users rights that gpl protects everyone who stands up for copyleft faces this constant challenge now that intentional gpl violations are the norm rather than the exception conservancy simply will not capitulate when standing up for users rights to copy share modify repair reinstall and reinstall modified versions of their software on the devices they own

dade and broward counties have stronger requirements locally structures must withstand at a minimum winds of 130 miles per hour miami s strong building code helped minimized damage from category 3 hurricane irma in september 2017 miami dade county s housing stock had little to no structural damage from the storm a few miami neighborhoods flooded but the buildings were prepared for it with floodwalls and proper sewage miami dade county first county to require 40 year recertification process for buildings miami dade county was the first county in florida to enact a 40 year recertification process and subsequent 10 year recertification for buildings miami dade created the 40 year recertification requirement in 1974 and broward county adopted similar rules in 2005 it is above and beyond the florida building code most cities in the u s do not require this recertification miami dade county rules require owners of older buildings to submit reports from licensed engineers or architects certifying a building s safety or documenting needed repairs after 40 years then every 10 years after that to meet recertification standards many of miami s buildings were built using concrete and rebar a construction method that has stood the test of time south florida is a leader in climate change mitigation south florida has been investing in climate change research
