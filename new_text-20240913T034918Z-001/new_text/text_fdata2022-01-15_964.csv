richmond virginia a u s federal judge has ruled that gruyere cheese does not have to come from the gruyere region of europe to be sold under the name gruyere after the federal trademark trials and appeals board denied an application for trademark protection a consortium of swiss and french cheesemakers from the region around the town of gruyeres switzerland sued at u s district court in virginia the consortium stressed that gruyere has been produced in the region since the early 12th century and cheese made outside the region cannot truly be called the same name similar to the argument that champagne can only be used in naming sparkling wines from the champagne region of france however the u s dairy export council and other groups opposed the trademark protection noting that american consumers understand the gruyere name to be generic last week district judge t s ellis ruled against the european consortium deciding that american consumers do not associate the gruyere name with cheese made specifically from that region adding that while similar trademark protections have been granted to roquefort cheese and cognac brandy ellis said the same case cannot be made for gruyere he also highlighted that the food and drug administration regulates the use of the gruyere name and no requirements specify its place of origin the ruling has been appealed by the consortium according to shawna morris senior vice president for trade policy with the u s dairy export council the legal battle over gruyere is one in a growing number of efforts in europe to gain international trade protection for various products including gorgonzola asiago and feta cheese the consortium has not replied to an email seeking comment but in court papers its lawyers argued that swiss and french gruyere is painstakingly made from local natural ingredients using traditional methods that assure the connection between the geographic region and the quality and characteristics of the final product allowing others to use the gruyere name would confuse american consumers they claimed

bronco make ford segment suv for what is essentially a result of massive demand and limited supply getting your hands on an all new ford bronco is somewhat of a challenge however one lucky customer in alaska managed to get her hands on one very special example that was sitting on the dealer floor at msrp wendy huesties explains in a post in the bronco 6th gen facebook group that she has been creeping on the page for a few months with the desire to purchase a bronco most likely due to the stock shortage she figured that she would only be able to acquire one in a few years and thus opted for a 2021 cactus gray ford ranger last may to pass the time close this last weekend though huesties completely lucked out after scrolling through the website of her local ford dealership what came up was a cactus gray 2021 two door bronco with the badlands sasquatch package this was a brand new model with just 15 miles on the clock with a hint of disbelief she emailed the dealership and requested that they hold the unit for her she arrived at the dealership the next morning and learned that the car was in stock because the customer who special ordered it was unable to complete the purchase after their financing fell through with the keys in her hand she drove her newly acquired bronco through a snowstorm and confirmed that the uprated tires are phenomenal close the quick action from huesties and her ability to secure the product at msrp is commendable because it s well known that bronco stock does not sit on dealership floors for very long demand for both the bronco and bronco sport is so extreme that dealerships are taking advantage of the situation by marking up the prices by thousands of dollars certain desperate customers are even willing to pay cash for certain units ford itself has confirmed that as soon as an example enters a dealership you can expect it to be sold within seven days the bronco sport takes a bit longer with an average of 17 days the popularity of the bronco is expected to increase even more when the company finally introduces the raptor and everglades variants which are expected to debut sometime this year
richmond virginia a u s federal judge has ruled that gruyere cheese does not have to come from the gruyere region of europe to be sold under the name gruyere after the federal trademark trials and appeals board denied an application for trademark protection a consortium of swiss and french cheesemakers from the region around the town of gruyeres switzerland sued at u s district court in virginia the consortium stressed that gruyere has been produced in the region since the early 12th century and cheese made outside the region cannot truly be called the same name similar to the argument that champagne can only be used in naming sparkling wines from the champagne region of france however the u s dairy export council and other groups opposed the trademark protection noting that american consumers understand the gruyere name to be generic last week district judge t s ellis ruled against the european consortium deciding that american consumers do not associate the gruyere name with cheese made specifically from that region adding that while similar trademark protections have been granted to roquefort cheese and cognac brandy ellis said the same case cannot be made for gruyere he also highlighted that the food and drug administration regulates the use of the gruyere name and no requirements specify its place of origin the ruling has been appealed by the consortium according to shawna morris senior vice president for trade policy with the u s dairy export council the legal battle over gruyere is one in a growing number of efforts in europe to gain international trade protection for various products including gorgonzola asiago and feta cheese the consortium has not replied to an email seeking comment but in court papers its lawyers argued that swiss and french gruyere is painstakingly made from local natural ingredients using traditional methods that assure the connection between the geographic region and the quality and characteristics of the final product allowing others to use the gruyere name would confuse american consumers they claimed
starting this year 2022 most private domestic u s entities formed from and after january 1 2021 will be required to self report to the u s treasury s financial crimes enforcement network fincen certain basic information about themselves their beneficial owners and those individuals authorized to act on their behalf these new requirements were enacted on january 1 2021 as part of the corporate transparency act the cta they represent a major departure from the united states historic approach to business entity operation as most private companies have not previously been subject to any beneficial ownership reporting requirements outside the context of a business relationship with a regulated financial institution the stated purpose of the cta is to discourage the use of shell corporations as a tool to disguise and move illicit funds part of a broader federal initiative to prevent and combat money laundering terrorist financing and tax fraud the cta requirements apply without regard to the intended purpose of the newly formed entity starting a new business as an llc or non publicly traded corporation creating a vehicle through which investors can participate in a private placement raising capital forming an entity to acquire the assets of an existing company creating a holding company for real property in each case begin with the assumption that reporting will be required the cta is intended to ensure that u s law enforcement can identify who is behind every entity particularly those entities not already subject to substantial federal or state regulation the cta statute has been in place for over a year at this point but no reporting has been done to date as fincen has yet to promulgate the final implementing regulations and build the online infrastructure that will be necessary to receive information of the type and volume anticipated on april 1 2021 fincen released an initial advance notice of proposed rulemaking and on december 8 2021 the agency published its proposed rules the proposed rules in the federal register the proposed rules clarify which entities are subject to and which exempt from the cta s reporting requirements the rules also address some of the privacy concerns that had previously been raised by broadening the types of identification accepted from beneficial owners the comment period expires february 7 2022 with final regulations to follow entities formed prior to the date fincen issues the final cta regulations the regulation effective date will have a period of one 1 year following the regulation effective date to submit their initial reports entities formed from and after the regulation effective date will have to report within fourteen 14 calendar days of formation or incorporation who must file a reporting company for purposes of the cta is a corporation limited liability company or other similar entity created or registering to do business in the united states by filing a document with the secretary of state or similar office under the laws of a u s state or indian tribe fincen s commentary to the proposed rules indicates that fincen anticipates other similar entities will include lps llps lllps and business trusts also known as statutory trusts or massachusetts trusts most estate planning trusts will not qualify as reporting companies as they can be created without filing or registering with a secretary of state s office while the cta and the proposed rules address both domestic and foreign entities registered to do business in the u s this article focuses on domestic entities the proposed rules specifically exclude 23 types of entities from the definition of reporting company in general these exempt entities fall into three major categories a those already reporting beneficial ownership based on prior state or federal regulation b service providers and c tax exempt entities specifically the 23 exempt entity types are securities issuers domestic governmental authorities banks domestic credit unions depository institution holding companies money transmitting businesses securities broker dealers securities exchange or clearing agencies other securities exchange act of 1934 entities registered investment companies and advisers venture capital fund advisers insurance companies state licensed insurance producers commodity exchange act registered entities accounting firms public utilities financial market utilities pooled investment vehicles tax exempt entities entities assisting tax exempt entities subsidiaries of certain exempt entities inactive businesses large operating companies newly formed privately held entities will generally be considered reporting companies note that this remains true even for entities formed specifically for the purpose of acquiring the assets of a large operating company as the newly formed entity will not itself have the necessary federal tax filing history to meet the large operating company exemption this will also be true for a newly formed private entity intended solely as a holding company or as a capital raising vehicle to fund a downstream operating company or a holder of real property for the most part these rules will apply only to future cases existing entities have been grandfathered as exempt so may undertake similar activities without reporting who must be identified and what information must be reported about them each reporting company will submit to fincen information about a its beneficial owners b i the individual who files the document that creates or registers the reporting company in or with a u s state or indian tribe and ii the individual at whose direction such filing was submitted each person in subpart b a company applicant and c itself beneficial owners under the cta a beneficial owner is anyone who directly or indirectly through any contract arrangement understanding relationship or otherwise i exercises substantial control over an entity or ii owns or controls not less than 25 of the ownership interests of the entity the cta requires each reporting company to submit to fincen a report identifying each beneficial owner s full legal name date of birth current residential address and unique identifying number from an acceptable identification document if the foregoing has previously been submitted to fincen the report can include a fincen identifier instead the proposed rules make clear that the unique identifying number of an individual does not have to be his or her social security number but may instead be his or her passport number or drivers license number in each case with the underlying document scanned to fincen as part of the report these requirements will feel familiar to those who have previously completed know your customer questionnaires for a banking or escrow relationship but as discussed below cta reporting will likely capture information on more individuals and will identify more beneficial owners than would be the case for purposes of opening a bank or escrow account the proposed rules provide guidance on the two pronged beneficial owner definition substantial control prong exercising substantial control includes a serving as a senior officer e g ceo president cfo treasurer coo secretary general counsel etc of a reporting company b exercising authority over the appointment or removal of any senior officer or a dominant majority of the board of directors or managers or similar body of a reporting company or c directing determining or substantially influencing important matters of a reporting company the proposed rules also include a catch all provision which notes that control can take other forms beyond those specifically listed while the cta exempts from the definition of a beneficial owner an employee of a reporting company acting solely as an employee whose control over or economic benefits from a reporting company are derived solely from his or her employment status the proposed rules make it clear that a person who is a senior officer of a reporting company cannot use the exemption the regulations are silent as to whether a member of the board of directors or a manager of a reporting company exercises substantial control by virtue of performance of his or her duties but the commentary suggests that the number of members of the board and the voting rights of the members would determine whether or not substantial control exists for example an individual serving as the sole manager of a limited liability company would exercise substantial control and would thus be considered a beneficial owner an individual serving as one of seven board members of a reporting company without any other ownership or control likely would not be considered a beneficial owner fincen also indicates in their comments that a property manager or other individual running day to day operations for an entity holding real estate would not be considered a beneficial owner on these facts alone where such individual or entity has been hired by and reports to the owners of the property or real property holding company ownership prong an individual who directly or indirectly owns or controls not less than 25 of the ownership interests of an entity is a beneficial owner of the entity for purposes of the cta the proposed rules clarify that ownership interests should be read to include both traditional forms of equity stock units capital interests as well as profits interests convertible instruments such as warrants or options and if such interests enable the holder to exercise the same rights as one of the foregoing ownership interests debt instruments also using this fully dilutive approach may impact owners whose direct or indirect interests are near the reporting threshold either including them where they might not have been were incentives ignored for example or excluding them where the impact of an incentive program or debt instruments is dilutive to capital interests held in situations where both an intended operating company or property holding company and one or more intermediate holding entities are all formed for one transaction each of the new entities will be a reporting company in that case an individual who is not a beneficial owner of the operating company or property holding company may still be reported as a beneficial owner of the intermediate holding entity exceptions there are five categories of persons excepted from the beneficial ownership definition in the proposed rules minor children a parent or legal guardian may report their information instead indicating that they are the parent or legal guardian of the owner custodians or agents acting on behalf of another individual report the actual beneficial owner vs the apparent beneficial owner employees see discussion above inheritors persons named in a will as intended to receive ownership are not owners until such time as they become the owner and creditors unless exercising substantial control or owning or controlling 25 of the ownership interests of the entity directly or indirectly company applicants as previously noted company applicants include both those who submit to a state secretary of state s office or the applicable office of an indian tribe the documents forming or registering a reporting company as well as if different those who directed them to do so for example if an attorney or paralegal forms an entity on behalf of a client both the legal professional and the client requesting the services are company applicants as with beneficial owners reporting companies must submit to fincen each company applicant s full legal name date of birth and unique identifying number from an acceptable identification document for company applicants providing a business service as a corporate or formation agent e g registered agent services law firms the address to be submitted is the business address associated with the company applicant instead of the personal residential address of the company applicant from a policy perspective to the extent company applicants make a business of filing documents on behalf of many companies reporting the associated business address is more useful information for national security intelligence and law enforcement agencies than reporting a residential address particularly as the business address allows identification of patterns of entities created or registered by company applicants working at the same business address for company applicants seeking greater data security the option for use of a fincen identifier is available to company applicants who have previously submitted their information to fincen just as it is for beneficial owners once again the proposed regulations make clear that the unique identifying number of an individual does not have to be his or her social security number but may instead be his or her passport number or drivers license number in each case with the underlying document scanned to fincen as part of the report reporting company information finally to ensure that fincen can identify each reporting company the proposed rule requires each reporting company to provide to fincen its legal name any d b a under which it conducts business its business street address the jurisdiction of formation or for a foreign reporting entity the jurisdiction of registration and its employer identification number ein or other unique identification number if no ein exists for the entity where to start while publication of

tumbling on thursday and friday morning but the nasdaq which undercut its 200 day line again on friday led a partial rebound the dow jones tested its 50 day line on friday with the s p 500 holding below that key level the russell 2000 undercut monday s low threatening to break below a yearlong consolidation the major indexes are not far from their jan 10 lows closing below those levels could spell the end of the market rally which is already under pressure on the plus side after a vicious sell off in the prior week the major indexes ultimately didn t give up much ground in this latest week the stock market rally still could use a convincing win but like a team down 3 0 or 3 1 in a best of seven series a win wouldn t resolve the market s troubles beyond rebounding from or back above key moving averages the major indexes need to reclaim wednesday s highs for the nasdaq the 50 day line and its jan 4 peak would be further tests but dow futures suggest blue chips will open below their 50 day line again while the nasdaq knives below its 200 day the nasdaq composite has been lagging the s p 500 for 11 months that s despite megacaps such as apple stock tesla microsoft msft nvidia nvda and google parent alphabet googl which at least until very recently had all been outperforming the benchmark index it s a reflection of how weak the average growth stock has been highly

stocks may continue to struggle energy stocks remain strong along with most financials but friday s jpmorgan chase jpm sell off is a reminder that earnings season is back adding to a host of risks for individual stocks sectors and the broader market the 200 day average the last line of support what to do now investors should be defensive the major indexes are closer to breaking down than breaking out growth and tech stocks aren t working right now aside from apple and some chip names such as qualcomm don t rush to jump into the next bounce in growth after several head fakes investors should wait for real strength not another dead cat bounce energy and financial sectors continue to lead along with fertilizers and some other cyclical names but don t get too concentrated even here a

the so called blob that brought warm surface water temperatures to the gulf of alaska between 2014 and 2016 has passed but the effects of that blob and a subsequent heatwave in 2019 are not all in the rearview mirror and researchers are bracing for more as climate change brings with it more ocean warming for an area like the gulf of alaska definitely this is a topic we need to understand better said bridget ferriss a research fish biologist with noaa fisheries she edited this year s ecosystems status report for the gulf of alaska used by federal managers to inform fisheries policy in alaska last year researchers continued to track the impacts of recent heatwaves on alaska s marine species ferriss said a heatwave happens when the sea surface temperature on a given day is warmer than 90 percent of the temperatures on record for that same day five days in a row the gulf wasn t dominated by heatwaves in 2020 and 2021 like it was in the years before but some populations are still responding for better or worse forage fish some seabirds and humpback whales in prince william sound all seemed to see declines in the gulf related to warm temperatures with mixed rates of recovery herring on the other hand have done great since the heatwave since they thrive in warmer water salmon were likely impacted by the blob as well ferriss said decreases in salmon runs in 2020 track with low juvenile salmon survival in the years immediately following i think definite signs are that they were affected by the heatwave ferriss said we don t have a nice concise story yet to really what caused each one ferriss said noaa fisheries research biologist elizabeth siddon was the editor on the bering sea ecosystem report she s also taking the long view at how conditions over the years have impaced salmon runs that tended to be the theme in the bering sea this year she said is that many of the stories or the things we saw in 2021 were a result of conditions that these organisms fish or crabs salmon have experienced since 2014 when this new warm phase started or 2017 that first winter of really low sea ice in the bering sea siddon has been thinking about three coincident crashes in the bering sea snow crab salmon and sea birds she said having the historical perspective is important understanding the salmon crashes in the arctic yukon kuskokwim region for example requires following the run through the last several years what we re seeing this year could be the results of what happened this year she said could be the results of what happened two years ago or three years ago scientists who are monitoring the bering sea are looking at another important factor sea ice when the ice melts we get this cold dense water that sinks to the bottom of the bering sea siddon said and that cold water then changes the distribution of the fish in the bering sea she said when sea ice was low and there were no cold pools in the years after the wave species were freer to move into the northern bering sea now she said noaa is seeing different combinations of species living there than it has seen in the past reports like noaa s are used to inform policy decisions by the council that manages fishing in alaska s federal waters that group the north pacific fishery management council closed the pacific cod fishery in 2020 after the blob decimated cod stocks in the gulf ferriss said it s too early to tell if that species is recovering years after the fact it s still at a low level since the marine heatwave period she said and we re monitoring it and trying to make sure we re managing that fishery correctly so it can recover she said it s important for researchers and fisheries managers to stay up to speed on how changes like these impact species in the gulf since the area s changing so rapidly that s true now just a few years after the blob subsided but as heatwaves continue to increase in the north pacific as they are predicted to do it could be more critical than ever

midway through the station eleven pilot jeevan chaudhary has a panic attack as he realizes the world is about to permanently change his sister siya who works at a hospital has warned him to take shelter to find his brother frank and barricade themselves indoors jeevan goes to the grocery store with young actress kirsten for whom he has become an accidental babysitter and loads up numerous full carts of food as he dissociates through checking out the groceries the lone cashier asks him if the flu is worth worrying about jeevan tells the clerk in no uncertain terms to head home i still remember my last pre mask grocery store run an impulse trip to ralphs to stock up on essentials i ve always fallen on the anxiety side of things and one morning in the first week of march 2020 i decided to follow the impulses that screamed better safe than sorry i took a sick day from work it wasn t busy and people looked at me oddly as i made my mountain of purchases grabbing items with the fatalistic hubris that i d be compelled to eat them which means i have beans in a quantity that i am still working through it s the closest to anything i ve seen that lives at the knife edge of despair and hope of the last two years an elegy to grief and living beyond survival i haven t watched any kind of fictional pandemic media since march 2020 back when friends and family were worried about the impact of a few months of quarantine now it s the third year of the pandemic omicron variant caseloads are rising the american covid 19 test infrastructure is busted and hospitals are overburdened watching station eleven under these circumstances is equal parts punishment and a breath of fresh air it s the closest to anything i ve seen that lives at the knife edge of despair and hope of the last two years an elegy to grief and living beyond survival hbo max s station eleven adapts emily st john mandel s arthur c clarke award winning 2014 novel of the same name into a 10 episode limited series mandel s apocalypse results from a flu that has no incubation period and causes near immediate death the horror of this is only clearer after months of learning incubation periods of covid variant strains in the process of researching which tests can be trusted at what times after exposure a handful of communities rise out of these horrors making their way forward in the rubble of a now defunct society the show makes piercing work of this source material tracking the lives of various people there s kristen the young girl orphaned by the pandemic and jeevan the man who takes her in there s the traveling shakespeare troupe kirsten has become an actress with them years later that performs plays around the great lakes in a path they call the wheel there are the people of severn city airport in michigan a diverted flight that turned into a long term community of survivors as in mandel s novel these people s lives are intertwined their connections grow apparent over the course of the show as episodes shift time and subject between the more immediate collapse of society and life 20 years after this rhythm is an effective departure from the storytelling of the book putting various timelines in more consistent conversation with each other the show layers the act 1 scene 2 monologue from hamlet hamlet is still dressed in mourning for his father three months later over the scene of a child receiving a text message from a morgue it weaves together scenes where a character is dead immediately with scenes where that character is still alive across one episode often using similar framing techniques to create the impression that the pandemic is always at every point of its inception that every character lives in a liminal space where they are both alive and dead both corporeal and not these mixed timelines give actors space to perform the fear austerity and grit required of survival across numerous points in their life it s the show s indulgence and with any other subject it might have read as tacky or like naive camp in station eleven the effect is suffocating claustrophobic and unrelenting like the flu is always about to happen always happening always having just happened it s a lot like living through the past two years where the ground underfoot keeps shifting the rules of what we know about the pandemic change and what is considered safe or unsafe is under constant evolution only the bewildering sense of loss remains consistent loss of routine or the pleasure of being around other people loss of faith loss of life covid 19 has turned the contemporary plague novel into a kind of predictive totem though few have reached the kind of critical darling status as mandel s novel many of the poignant images in station eleven s opening episodes have real life analogues there s the constant vigilance against sickness and that moment you realize the people around you the bustling fabric of the crowd on public transit the friends in your apartment become a potential threat the show s post apocalyptic world never stops feeling real beautiful lush cinematography gives scenes a sense of contemporaneousness resisting the dour tones that often mark the apocalypse genre as the traveling shakespeare troupe rounds the wheel performing at various encampments their horses pull wagons that are in fact old pickup trucks costumes are made from salvaged materials lavish well stocked buildings an old country club a sprawling airport become hubs from which community sprouts pre pan members those who were alive before the pandemic explain artifacts of technology to the post pan there were phones and you could use them to find anyone and look up anything you could store all of shakespeare s plays on them many of these artifacts of civilization feel increasingly frivolous as the scotch tape holding together infrastructure peels off contemporary life is as inflexible as ever the indifference of capitalism an already established norm covid 19 has exposed the failures of that american infrastructure there s the absolute pressure on hospital staff even more strained after two years and other essential workers many of whom found themselves labeled heroes and yet lack meaningful work protections there s the lack of support for working parents and more broadly working people who need to find a way to pay rent and feed their families we truck on even as living under late stage capitalism increasingly feels like a performance that cannot continue we continue working because we have no other choice affecting normalcy even as things are radically difficult the show s finale aired near the two year anniversary of the first covid case being discovered in the united states though much has changed it s just as frightening to consider how much has stayed just the same contemporary life is as inflexible as ever the indifference of capitalism an already established norm in the third episode of station eleven miranda carroll danielle deadwyler travels to malaysia to pitch a work partnership opportunity in the logistics industry earlier that day she learns she s trapped there as the flu makes its way across the country she also learns her ex husband the man she loved and left who has since remarried and had a son has died on stage nonetheless she attends the business pitch what else is there to do the man i loved died last night and she says to the room suppressing a sob the man i loved died last night and i went to work the man i love died last night and i went to work instead station eleven is shaded by this trauma each person s story is approached from so many directions it feels like looking at them through a kaleidoscope refracting their experiences through the context of their entire personhood and the entirety of their grief but it s equally concerned with what it means to do more than survive grief is a condition without end one we must find ways of living with if never moving beyond people find various ways to cope they lie to protect themselves they lie to give others the dignity of hope they grow tougher they grow nostalgic they carry these heavy burdens they continue to wake up each day kirsten becomes fiercely protective of her found family in the traveling symphony and wields various knives for self defense which the show flashes as chekov s guns older timers cling onto the memory of civilization as it was before the survivors who form an enclave in severn city airport create a museum where technology from pre pan is put on display one of the show s primary antagonists the prophet spends most of station eleven insisting on erasing the past from this state of duress grow the seeds of life a shakespeare troupe a big box store converted into a maternity ward the severn city airport s makeshift classroom where children are taught station eleven is that rare piece of pandemic media that dwells less on the heroism of a solution or the thrill of a core cause and more on the idea of the persistence of community and the creation of art even as the show forges numerous circuitous connections between its characters much of its plot is left open ended the show s vignettes work out more like a collage that convey emotional tones survival is insufficient is more than a mantra painted on the side of the troupe s wagon it s a thread that binds episodes together it s a reason to stay alive at all station eleven is that rare piece of pandemic media that dwells less on the heroism of a solution or the thrill of a core cause and more on the idea of the persistence of community and the creation of art have i felt the same way in the past two years as i ve gone on my silly little walks attempted picnics in the park and picked up a dozen or so quickly abandoned hobbies joy has felt available if distant each brief moment a kind of ecstatic reminder of what it felt to move more freely worry less about the people in my life i ve grappled with the past two years by trying to create emotional distance between me and others between me and myself though ultimately i ve only ever found relief in making new friends where i can even as i ve struggled to see the friends and family who i care most about i still make time to read and write though i can t say if there s any meaning beyond clinging to what feels normal and collating my feelings in the medium that has always made the most sense to me as station eleven s society slowly rebuilds art remains worthwhile though true to shakespeare s anxieties art also outlives many of the show s characters for the traveling troupe performing remains a reason to keep going or a way to make meaning out of a horrible situation the airport community curates their museum processing the loss of the past miranda writes the graphic novel station eleven the show s book within a book to make sense of losing her family for kirsten and jeevan whose relationship contains the heart of the show in microcosm art ends up fostering their unlikely reunion these lucky survivors finally get the opportunity to say goodbye on their own terms this time knowing goodbye may only be temporary that seems reason enough to hope

netflix is raising prices again cnn your netflix bill is about to go up again the streaming media company said friday it is raising the prices on its plans in the united states and canada in the united states the subscription price for the standard plan rose 1 50 to 15 49 the basic plan went up 1 to 9 99 and the premium plan increased 2 to 19 99 in canada the price for netflix s standard plan also went up 1 50 to 16 49 canadian the premium plan went up 2 to 20 99 canadian its basic plan was unchanged explaining its decision netflix provided a statement to cnn that was identical to its comment from october 2020 the last time it raised its prices we understand people have more entertainment choices than ever and we re committed to delivering an even better experience for our members a netflix spokesperson said we re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options as always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget netflix s stock rose roughly 2 following the news the pricing increase comes a week before the streaming company is set to announce its fourth quarter earnings but the reason behind the company s move is pretty simple it has been spending billions of dollars on content and as streaming becomes more integral to the entertainment landscape growth for companies like netflix tends to slow and attracting new subscribers gets harder at that point revenue needs to come from somewhere raising prices on consumers is an easy way to get it case in point netflix said in october that it added 4 4 million subscribers bringing its global subscriber number to 213 5 million a good but not spectacular total this followed two consecutive sluggish quarters for the company netflix also reported in those earnings that it added roughly 70 000 subscribers in the us and canada that was improvement from a loss of subscribers in the second quarter but up only about 1 million subscribers from year earlier totals in those countries the company said it has 74 million members in the us and canada but that growth in those regions has become saturated the price hike was first reported by reuters

as the omicron variant continues to spread throughout the state many have started to mask back up but which mask provides the best protection against the variant example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video little rock ark you can see it in recent covid 19 numbers the omicron variant is spreading rapidly throughout arkansas it s led many to mask back up but that makes many question which face covering will best protect you against this new mutation it s also caused many to wonder how they ll buy a mask while avoiding those high prices it was something that was discussed a lot at the beginning of the pandemic and it s a topic that is taking center stage once again you re just more likely to encounter someone infectious with covid right now than any other time previously during the pandemic said dr joel tumlison outbreak response physician with the arkansas department of health so during this current surge what mask will protect you the best while you re out and about we asked dr tumlison if i could say what the best mask right now is it s the one that you have on your face covering your mouth and nose and can leave on he said wearing any mask is better than not wearing one at all that s the most important point that tumlison wants to get across but if you base it on the science n95 and kn95 masks are the way to go they just block more smaller size particles more effectively more efficiently from coming through the material the way they re made is very good for that he said this is something that we ve heard for the past two years with the next most effective being being the surgical masks and then the cloth ones if you re someone that likes the comfort and style of a cloth mask tumlison said stick with a multi layer one it is important that a cloth mask or a homemade mask have more than one layer of material because that just blocks more things tumlison said with all the talk about masks you ve probably noticed how the price tag has gone up especially for those n95 and kn95 masks this price increase doesn t surprise uca assistant economics professor jeremy horpedahl as these things change it s not all surprising the price will change he said horpedahl believes this is happening for two reasons the first being that the changes the cdc has made to recommendations has caused more people to want higher quality masks the second factor is simple it s the current spread of omicron the price of of the masks whatever kind they might be go up and down with with the severity of the pandemic at the moment he said so how do you get the best bang for your buck horpedahl said if you see a good price buy it now because it probably won t go on sale any time soon second shop around and use price trackers on the internet lastly know what you re willing to pay just think about is it worth it to me and if it is buy it and it ll protect you and then when you don t need it then you don t have to worry about it he said no matter your preference tumlison said the moral of the story is a mask you wear properly is better than a mask you don t wear right any mask that is over your mouth and nose is better than one that s not he said prices for masks are more likely to go up before they come down according to horpedahl

by dmitry zhdannikov ron bousso simon lewis and timothy gardner london washington reuters the u s government has held talks with several international energy companies on contingency plans for supplying to europe if conflict between russia and ukraine disrupts russian supplies two u s officials and two industry sources told reuters on friday the united states is concerned russia is preparing for the possibility of a new military assault on the country it invaded in 2014 russia denies it plans to attack ukraine the european union depends on russia for around a third of its gas supplies and u s sanctions over any conflict could disrupt that supply any interruptions to russia s gas supply to europe would exacerbate an energy crisis caused by a shortage of the fuel record power prices have driven up consumer energy bills as well as business costs and sparked protests in some countries state department officials approached the companies to ask where additional supplies might come from if they were needed two industry sources familiar with the discussions told reuters speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter the companies told the u s government officials that global gas supplies are tight and that there is little gas available to substitute large volumes from russia the industry sources said the state department s discussions with energy companies were led by senior advisor for energy security amos hochstein a senior u s state department official said also speaking on condition of anonymity the state department did not ask the companies to increase output the official added we ve discussed a range of contingencies and we ve talked about all that we re doing with our nation state partners and allies the source said we ve done this with the european commission but we ve also done it with energy companies it s accurate to say that we ve spoken to them about our concerns and spoken to them about a range of contingencies but there wasn t any sort of ask when it comes to production as well as asking companies what capacity they had to raise supplies u s officials also asked whether companies had the capacity to increase exports and postpone field maintenance if necessary the sources said it was unclear which companies u s officials contacted royal dutch shell lon conocophillips nyse and exxon nyse declined to comment when asked if they had been contacted chevron corp nyse total equinor and qatar energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment a second industry source said his company was asked whether it had the ability to postpone maintenance at gas fields if necessary a spokesperson for the u s national security council would not comment on u s discussions with energy companies but confirmed contingency planning was underway assessing potential spillovers and exploring ways to reduce those spillovers is good governance and standard practice the spokesperson said any details in this regard that make their way to the public only demonstrate the extensive detail and seriousness with which we are discussing and are prepared to impose significant measures with our allies and partners moscow has alarmed the west by massing troops near ukraine in the past two months following its seizure of ukraine s crimea peninsula in 2014 and its backing of separatists fighting kyiv troops in eastern ukraine biden has previously told russian president vladimir putin that a new russian move on ukraine would draw sanctions and an increased u s presence in europe russia denies planning to attack ukraine and says it has the right to move its troops on its own soil as it likes the united states promised to have europe s back if there is an energy shortage due to conflict or sanctions the second industry source said amos is going to big lng producing companies and countries like qatar to see if they can help the united states he added referring to hochstein if pipeline supplies from russia to europe are reduced european buyers would need to seek cargoes of superchilled gas to compensate u s exports of liquefied natural gas lng are set to soar this year to make it the world s top lng supplier europe competes for lng supplies from suppliers such as the united states and qatar with top consumers china and japan which also face an energy crunch

year to everyone i hope everyone and their families are remaining safe and healthy it s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 before i turn it over to larry i ll review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both gaap and as adjusted financial results as always i will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results throughout blackrock s history we have consistently and systematically invested in our business with a long term focus and commitment to serving clients employees shareholders and the communities in which we operate as a result of these long term investments in 2021 we grew organically at our fastest rate ever and continued to expand our organic growth premium versus the industry even as our assets under management reached new highs we have continually invested to develop industry leading franchises in etfs private markets technology our active investment platform and more recently in esg and in china these investments all reflect a singular focus on helping clients construct resilient whole portfolios and they are driving the record levels of growth we re seeing today blackrock generated net inflows of 540 billion in 2021 representing 6 organic asset growth and 11 organic base fee growth each of our strategic priority areas drove significant growth during the year importantly despite fourth quarter volatility we finished the year with strong momentum generating 212 billion of total net inflows reflecting annualized organic base fee growth of 9 continued strong flows from our entire active franchise along with record ishares flows which benefited from typical year end rebalancing and tax management contributed to the fourth quarter s robust organic growth we continued to build out our platform in 2021 as the strength and stability of our operating model allowed us to aggressively reinvest in our business deliver record financial results and return approximately 3 7 billion of capital to shareholders full year revenue of 19 4 billion was up 20 operating income of 7 5 billion rose 19 and earnings per share of 39 18 was up 16 versus 2020 for the fourth quarter blackrock generated revenue of 5 1 billion and operating income of 2 1 billion up 14 and 11 respectively from a year ago quarterly earnings per share of 10 42 was up 2 versus a year ago reflecting a higher effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income in the current quarter non operating results for the quarter included 86 million of net investment income driven primarily by mark to market gains in our private equity total investment portfolio our as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 25 driven in part by discrete items we currently estimate that 24 is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2022 though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of 4 billion was up 17 year over year primarily driven by 11 organic base fee growth and the positive impact of market data on average aum partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers versus a year ago and strategic pricing investments over the last year sequentially fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue was up approximately 1 our fourth quarter annualized effective fee rate decreased by 0 2 basis point from the third quarter as the continued positive impact of strong organic base fee growth was more than offset by the negative impact of divergent equity beta which accelerated into quarter end and lower securities lending revenue in the current quarter we incurred approximately 135 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers in the fourth quarter essentially the same as the third quarter bringing total waivers to approximately 500 million for the full year given the current prospects for higher rates in the near term we now anticipate most of these waivers would cease shortly after the first 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate resulting in a one half basis point increase to our annualized effective fee rate recall that approximately 50 of these gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors reducing the impact on operating income for the year we generated record performance fees of 1 1 billion which were increasingly diversified compared to a year ago and reflected strong alpha generation across our platform notably since a year ago performance fees from liquid alternatives have increased more than 150 and our unrecognized deferred carry balance has more than doubled to over 1 4 billion as our private markets platform continues to scale quarterly technology services revenue was up 11 year over year and full year revenue of 1 3 billion increased 12 annual contract value or acv increased 13 year over year and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering low to mid teens acv growth as demand for aladdin s end to end cloud based saas solution is stronger than ever we are heavily investing heavily investing to scale aladdin for its next leg of growth in order to extend our capabilities in high demand areas such as the whole portfolio private markets wealth and sustainability total expense increased 20 in 2021 driven primarily by higher compensation g a and direct fund expense for the full year compensation expense increased 20 reflecting higher base salaries and higher incentive compensation driven by growth in operating income and higher deferred compensation expense recall that year over year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine final full year compensation in the fourth quarter fourth quarter g a expense increased 15 year over year reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense which included higher t d expense higher occupancy expense partially driven by higher covid testing costs and higher portfolio services and technology expense for the full year excluding approximately 350 million of non core g a expense which included 274 million of aggregate fund launch costs core g a expense was up 15 compared to 2020 recall that we exclude the impact of fund launch costs when reporting our as adjusted operating margin the year over year increase in core g a was largely attributable to technology data and portfolio services expense all of which drive revenue growth increased technology and data spend was driven by our aladdin cloud migration market data investments to support our index and esg franchises and broader tech spend to support productivity improvements approximately two thirds of the increase in our 2021 portfolio services expense related to sub advisory costs associated with significant ocio wins and are offset by associated base fees 2021 direct fund expense increased 24 year over year primarily reflecting higher average index aum sequentially quarterly direct fund expense declined despite higher average index aum due to higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter finally full year intangible amortization expense increased 41 million year over year due to our aperio acquisition which closed in february 2021 our full year as adjusted operating margin of 45 2 was up 30 basis points versus 2020 our business has never been positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us and we remain deeply committed to investing responsibly and aggressively through market cycles so we can continue to generate differentiated organic growth over the long term consistent with this growth ambition we are once again targeting record investment in our people strategic priorities and platform infrastructure during 2022 at present we would expect headcount to increase by as much as 10 with a continued focus on optimizing our talent pyramid for more junior roles and growing our footprint and ihub innovation centers we would also expect core g a to increase by 15 to 20 as we continue to invest in technology to scale our operations and support future growth including completing aladdin s cloud migration delivering new aladdin capabilities and continuing to open the platform to promote client innovation we are also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position blackrock for continued success during 2021 we allocated 1 5 billion of new seed and co investment capital to support our growth and our year end portfolio now approximates 3 7 billion our strategic minority investments are reinforcing various elements of our strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for our shareholders and we continue to invest inorganically when we see opportunities to accelerate our organic growth in key strategic growth areas as we did through our acquisitions of the physical climate and transition risk models of rhodium and baringa which will be critical to building best in class esg capabilities within aladdin we also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and returned an aggregate 3 7 billion to shareholders in 2021 since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013 we have now repurchased over 11 billion of blackrock s stock reducing our outstanding total shares by 11 and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 20 for our shareholders at present based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions including the relative valuation of our stock price we are targeting the repurchase of 1 5 billion of shares during 2022 in addition our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 4 88 per share representing an increase of 18 over the current level finally in early december we completed the debt issuance to take advantage of current low interest rates and pre refinance our 750 million three and three eighths notes to june 2022 we successfully raised 1 billion of new 10 year notes with a 2 1 coupon the second lowest us dollar coupon in blackrock s debt stack as you will hear more from larry blackrock s strategy has always been guided by our clients needs we relentlessly focus on helping them meet their financial objectives and our deeper and broader relationships with more clients are driving growth across our entire platform fourth quarter total net inflows of 212 billion representing 9 annualized organic aum and base fee growth were led by flows into etfs and our top performing active franchise record full year net inflows of 540 billion were positive across all client types investment styles and regions and reflected records for both etfs and active strategies etfs generated 306 billion of net inflows in 2021 representing 11 organic asset growth and 9 organic base fee growth record fourth quarter etf flows of 104 billion reflected some seasonality but also reflected the diversity of our product and client segments and accelerating secular shifts occurring in the market we saw continued strength in core but our strategic product segments particularly sustainable and fixed income were the largest contributors to our fourth quarter flows sustainable etf aum of 150 billion nearly doubled during the year and our 750 billion fixed income etf platform grew organically by double digits even in one of the most challenging macro environments for fixed income in several years clients also continued to use our broad based precision exposures to express risk on sentiment during the year blackrock generated full year retail net inflows of 102 billion representing 12 organic asset growth and 14 organic base fee growth significantly outperforming the broader mutual fund industry retail flows were positive in both the us and internationally reflecting broad based strength across our active platform fourth quarter retail net inflows of 22 billion reflected similar trends but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains and dividend reinvestment we remain well positioned to meet investor needs for risk adjusted alpha end yield and our diversified fixed income platform with top performing strategies across total return unconstrained high yield and credit offers choice to investors in any rate environment institutional index net outflows of 118 billion in 2021 reflected equity net outflows including the previously disclosed 58 billion low fee institutional redemption in the second quarter partially offset by fixed income net inflows as many large clients rebalanced portfolios after significant equity market gains or tactically shifted assets to fixed income and cash blackrock s institutional active franchise generated a record 169 billion of net inflows in 2021 reflecting broad based strength across all product categories and the funding of several significant ocio mandates we are seeing strong momentum in our ocio business evidenced by another significant core fixed income funding in the fourth quarter we also saw continued growth in our lifepath target date franchise and remain committed to helping investors around the world plan and invest for retirement in the aggregate strong growth across active strategies led to 7 organic base fee growth for our institutional channel in 2021 across retail and institutional client types blackrock generated a record 49 billion of active equity net inflows for the full year led by top performing franchises in technology health sciences and us growth equities as well as quantitative strategies we remain well positioned for future growth in our active platform with over 75 of our fundamental active equity systematic active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or peer median for the trailing five year period overall demand for alternatives also continued with 27 billion of net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the year driven by credit infrastructure and our multi strat and global event driven hedge funds total alternatives fundraising notched a record in 2021 and we have approximately 36 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies representing over 230 million of future annual base fees and significant potential performance fees finally blackrock s cash management platform generated 44 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and 94 billion of net inflows in 2021 as we continued to grow market share in a persistent low rate environment by leveraging our scale product breadth technology and risk management on behalf of clients it has been another strong year for blackrock our global scale and diverse platform allow us to continue investing for the future whether in good markets or more challenging ones and our differentiated business model remains incredibly well positioned to sustain industry leading organic growth and deliver long term shareholder value our commitment remains to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible and we will do so responsibly to meet the needs of all stakeholders with that i ll turn it over to larry larry fink chairman and chief executive officer thank you gary good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call i hope you all have had a healthy and happy holiday season and that all of you are staying safe throughout blackrock s history we have relentlessly focused on helping our clients meet their investment goals and solve their most complex challenges we have continually invested and reinvested in our business to meet and anticipate our clients evolving and changing needs and to deliver the most comprehensive global investment and technology platform our 2021 results truly demonstrated the benefits of those investments blackrock delivered the strongest organic growth in our history even as our assets under management reached new highs we generated 540 billion in net inflows in 2021 representing a record 11 organic base fee growth we also ended the year with strong momentum with 212 billion of fourth quarter net inflows reflecting our seventh consecutive quarter of organic base fee growth above our 5 target and we have steadily expanded our organic growth premium relative to the industry relative to our competitors as our clients continue to entrust us with more of their portfolios importantly our growth is more diversified than it s ever been in 2021 our active platform including alternatives contributed 267 billion of inflows representing nearly half of our total net inflows etfs remained a significant growth driver with record flows of 306 billion and our technology services revenues grew by 12 reaching 1 3 billion this strong momentum across our entire business drove record financial results for the year blackrock delivered 20 revenue growth 19 operating income growth 16 etfs growth and at the same time we expanded our margins two years into the pandemic we continue to confront new virus strains we re confining divergent restriction approaches country by country and even an uneven economy worldwide meanwhile inflation has reached a 40 year high as we see several structural changes take hold consumer demand has shifted from services to household goods as people are spending more time at home and benefiting from higher levels of savings labor shortages are causing supply chain bottlenecks as people have more choice in the gig economy the quit rate in the united states has ever been higher reflecting the confidence of employees and we will need to recognize that the energy transition is inherently inflationary given the significant cost differential between clean and traditional technology today and that is why we are so optimistic about investing in green technology to move the energy transition forward blackrock has always focused on evolving and staying ahead of our clients needs as they navigate change and they are coming to blackrock more than ever before they value blackrock s insights they value the breadth of our solutions they certainly value our global footprint as a result blackrock is building deeper partnerships with more clients across our whole portfolio throughout the world we have strong conviction in our ability to continue generating differentiated organic growth over the long term because we have built a platform to help our clients as a fiduciary to meet their objectives in all market environments and we continue to invest ahead of their evolving needs and are swiftly and aggressively trying to embrace new market opportunities our long term strategy remains to be remains to keep alpha and performance at the heart of blackrock to accelerate growth in ishares to build out our illiquid alternatives that continue to differentiate our technology to deliver a whole portfolio solution and become the global leader in sustainable investing blackrock is a 2 6 trillion active manager and our multiyear investment in incorporating data science sustainability and new tools for portfolio construction is resulting in stronger growth than at any time in our corporate history we generated a record 267 billion of net inflows from active strategies in 2021 including a second consecutive year of record active equity inflows active strategies contributed over 60 of our annual organic base fee and our growth is significantly outpacing that of our peers and the broader industry as we take market share in this fragmented landscape blackrock s active mutual fund captured the no 1 share of industry flows in 2021 and our organic growth rate has tripled that of industry as gary discussed our investment performance remained strong with 88 of our taxable fixed income and 78 of our fundamental active equity funds above benchmark or peer median for a five year period and in the us nearly 80 of our active mutual funds are rated either a morningstar 4 or morningstar 5 positioning us well for future growth clients are increasingly increasing their allocation to alternative strategies as they search for diversification and higher returns blackrock has built a broad platform across infrastructure private credit real estate and private equity to meet that demand we raised a record 42 billion in client capital in 2021 and are confident in our ability to accelerate our growth as a leader in private markets infrastructure for example has significant secular tailwinds driving growth and will be an important engine of fiscal stimulus for economies looking to build for their future blackrock is incredibly well positioned to capture opportunity in this area we are one of the largest infrastructure managers in the industry with over 35 billion of client assets including one of the largest renewable power platforms we have grown our platform fourfold in the last five years and look forward to partnering with more clients as we raise new vintages in our flagship funds and launch new innovative strategies in this asset class ishares also had a record year as the global etf industry crossed 1 trillion in annual inflows for the first time growth was driven by greater adoption globally from asset owners asset managers wealth managers and more recently from many of the approximately 40 million first time investors who opened self directed investment accounts over the last two years blackrock and ishares etfs generated a record 306 billion of net inflows in 2021 we saw strength across each of our product categories including over 100 billion in net inflows into our core etfs for the first time and nearly 80 billion in our fixed income etf and more than 50 billion into each of our sustainable and precision etf categories we saw strong client demand for fixed income etfs despite a challenging macro environment for fixed income more broadly our growth benefited from the diversity of our product range across inflation linked bonds municipal bonds sustainability and emerging market exposures and the diversity of our client base many of whom are increasingly using etfs as part of their active portfolio construction worldwide etfs are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice for accessing a broad range of investment exposures both in a passive way and in an active way and as barriers for etf adoption comes down it is enabling a new generation of investors to access markets and more and more of them are looking to etfs as a default investment vehicle for those wanting to create more customized indexes our aladdin technology has long provided this capability to institutions and through our recent aperio acquisition we can now provide custom index capabilities to us wealth advisors following a breakout in 2020 momentum and sustainable investments continued and we generated a record 104 billion of net inflows in 2021 as client demand for sustainable strategies accelerated we now manage 509 billion in sustainable aum more than double from a year ago and remain committed to innovating and expanding choice for our clients one of the biggest opportunities of this generation will be helping our clients navigate the global transition to a net zero economy we have already seen 4 trillion of capital move from traditional investments to sustainability ones in the last two years alone and this is just the beginning the transition will not happen overnight and it will require significant investment in technology blackrock is working with companies across a wide range of carbon intensive sectors that are proactively transforming their businesses and whose innovation will be critical to the world s decarbonization agenda we believe these companies will present an important investment opportunity for investors blackrock is intently focused on helping our clients participate in these opportunities and understand the impact of the transition on their portfolios through better data and analytics our ambition is to move more capital into transition than anyone else our multi decade investment into aladdin technology platform continues to differentiate blackrock both as an asset manager and a leading fintech provider we generated 1 3 billion in annual technology revenues up 12 year over year we remain focused on continually evolving aladdin for the next decade and beyond we are innovating and extending our capabilities into areas of high client demand including whole portfolios wealth and sustainability the combination of aladdin and efront for example which allows a client to bring together their whole portfolio in one place and customize at scale has already been embraced by over two dozen clients and the pipeline is the strongest it has ever been and growing the breadth of blackrock s investment strategies our technology capabilities and our one blackrock culture are truly what differentiates us in providing whole portfolio solutions to our clients in my conversations with clients around the world i m hearing about the challenges they are facing and their desire to consolidate the number of partners that they work with they are increasingly choosing blackrock as their partner of choice for those large strategic complex relationships this is resonating especially in our work with insurance clients our strong fourth quarter inflows included a previously announced 49 billion of active fixed income mandate from a large strategic insurance client our role at blackrock is to leverage our insurance expertise and our diversified global platform across asset management technology sustainability advisory solutions to deliver fully and completely to our clients we see significant opportunity to work more closely with our insurance and broader ocio clients in 2022 and beyond our ability to address client challenges enables us to fulfill our purpose and drive long term performance that benefits all our stakeholders over the last five years clients have entrusted us with 1 8 trillion of net new assets that s our organic growth for the last five years we crossed 10 trillion in aum in the fourth quarter as with every milestone we reached over the decade we are incredibly humbled by our client support and their incredible trust they have placed on us all of us at blackrock feel and take this deep responsibility in managing every dollar our clients awarded us whether it is an individual investor using one of our etfs is their first portfolio or investment account or a very large pension fund entrusting us with their whole portfolio it is truly an honor that we recognize every moment and every day blackrock s consistent results are possible because of our dedicated employees i often talk about the importance of putting a company s purpose at the foundation of a relationship with all stakeholders our purpose is resonating with our employees more than ever blackrock employee base has remained stable over the last two years amid its turbulent environments and i m extremely proud of how passionate our 18 000 employees are in helping more and more people experience financial well being i want to take this moment to thank each and every one of our employees and every one of them individually for their continued partnership resilience and hard work and dedication through another difficult year everything blackrock does is rooted in our culture of focusing on the long term and we will continue to innovate we will continue to be using our scale and contributing to a more equitable a more resilient future to benefit more clients to benefit our employees and to benefit our shareholders and the people and communities worldwide where we operate i firmly believe that the efforts of 2021 will position blackrock to deliver value over the long run for all our stakeholders with that let me open it up for questions questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open larry fink chairman and chief executive officer hi alex happy new year alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everybody happy new year to all of you as well so maybe we could start with a question around just the active dynamics for blackrock in 2021 clearly a great year record year in active flows across the board equity etc how sustainable do you think this trend will be i guess into 22 and then i also was hoping you could expand on how faster increases in interest rates could also impact asset allocation decisions over the next 12 to 18 months larry fink chairman and chief executive officer sure excuse me i m getting over a cold from my grandchild our results in our active investment strategies is really one of the core transformations of blackrock over many years of work the history of blackrock was an active fixed income manager our acquisition of bgi with our fantastic quantitative approach to both fixed income and equity active strategies our development in our illiquid space where we built out that platform our recommitment and fortifying our fundamental equity teams over the last five years which led to great performance in addition over the last five years alex and you re aware of this our build out of our distribution team our build out in the ria channel having 102 billion of inflows from retail globally the large portion of that was active so it s not just building out our investment teams and fortifying them but it was building out also our distribution side of our businesses too that s all built led to a well positioned as active strategies continue to be a choice with more and more investors worldwide and let s be clear many of our flows in etfs were from active strategies too so across the board the 267 billion of inflows represented from great performance well positioned and i think that will continue to build in 2022 i would say the other major thing is and i talked about this quite a bit in my prepared remarks was our whole portfolio approach we believe more and more organizations are going to be looking to outsource large components of their balance sheets whether it s an insurance company a pension fund and endowment and we re looking for an organization that can position that quite well and because of our business model of having both active and index products across having the technology to interface with our clients we are as we are probably the best positioned organization in the world to meet those types of opportunities and so if anything i think that momentum in active is going to accelerate going forward especially in the ocio area and whole portfolios this is going to be driving more and more of our success obviously we saw flows in sustainability that continues to be driven our success in illiquids has really been a cornerstone of our 2021 results so i m extremely optimistic on our positioning for 22 and beyond in terms of rising rates it really depends on how rising rates are going to be resulting in are we going to see a flattening yield curve with rising rates are we going to see a steepening yield curve i tend to believe we re going to have more of a flat here on if central banks raise rates eight to 10 times which the forward curve suggests we could have a two and a quarter two and a half year let s say short term rate the real question is what does that mean for the 10 year rate those questions and how that plays out is going to be very important the biggest opportunity that we have is how blackrock is positioned and the opportunities we have i really do believe whether we have rising rates a flattening yield curve a steepening yield curve we will be part of the conversation with all our investors worldwide gary shedlin chief financial officer yeah larry maybe i can just jump in on the rates just one thing for alex i think obviously the dynamic between rates going up and our level of aum i think is well known but i would just highlight a couple of things one is we our 2 8 trillion is primarily institutional for sure and obviously those are very sticky assets that are both strategic and matched for liability so we think we have very sticky assets two is we re obviously very well positioned in terms of our broad based fixed income platform so whether it s unconstrained high yield total return or short duration i think we ve got that so we re ready for a rotation and more importantly i think really is if rates go up a bunch of cash is likely to come off the sidelines and so that will enable us to basically move that cash into other asset classes and as i mentioned in my remarks very importantly we waived 500 million of fees last year in our cash business that first 25 basis point move by the fed and as many people think that could come as early as the first quarter we think that will free up almost all of those waivers that will have about a half a basis point increase on our annualized effective fee rate and obviously we ve talked about while we share roughly half of that with our distributors that will drop a significant amount of incremental profitability to the bottom line operator your next question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler with bank of america your line is open larry fink chairman and chief executive officer hi craig happy new year craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst hey good morning larry rob gary hope you re all doing well first i just want to congratulate you on being the first asset manager to reach 10 trillion larry fink chairman and chief executive officer well it just a number thank you though craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst so my question is on the etf business we saw that the new york state insurance regulator just published an update on the capital treatment of fixed income etfs as bonds instead of equities i know this has been a focus for a while but do you think this could open the door to larger etf allocations from your insurance company clients larry fink chairman and chief executive officer let me give that to rob rob kapito president that s a great question craig as to catch everybody up toward the end of 2021 you saw the new york department of financial services published a rule which permits insurance firms to treat diversified liquid bond etfs like bonds for the purpose of risk based capital and this puts bond etfs on a level playing field with bonds in an insurer s portfolio so so far we are really excited by the initial client feedback and interest to etfs because of this rule we are very optimistic as how this could lead to future growth and this is just another sign of an unlock to come as etfs are gaining increased understanding and you know in the past we ve said that we expect by 2025 that etfs are going to reach 15 trillion from 10 trillion today we still believe that and even at that level etfs would still be a small part of the capital markets which is why we think there are decades of growth ahead and so we re very excited about the fact that insurers now will use more etfs to represent their bond portfolio but a good question and a good insight by you operator your next question comes from the line of michael cyprys from morgan stanley your line is open michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst hey good morning everyone happy new year thanks for taking the question just wanted to ask on aladdin i was just hoping you could update us on your number of aladdin initiatives you guys have a lot going on there from migrating to microsoft azure to the snowflake partnership aladdin climate maybe you could just expand upon the progress on those different initiatives where they stand some of them earlier stages than others what s been built out what s left and any sort of early feedback from clients maybe you could talk a little bit how you see that unlocking the revenue growth ahead larry fink chairman and chief executive officer let me tackle the scale of aladdin climate and i ll have gary comment on the progress with azure and snowflake as i said in my prepared remarks client demand for aladdin has accelerated especially with more and more remote working having a comprehensive platform a whole portfolio solution platform is really highlights the opportunities and the strength of aladdin and more and more investment firms asset owners and insurance companies are looking for aladdin as an opportunity to expand their ability to navigate markets as we built out on aladdin as you suggested michael the whole space of where aladdin is growing out whether it is aladdin provider connecting every aladdin user to its custodial relationship intersecting that aladdin wealth connecting aladdin to wealth managers and having them more connected and we are in the beta sites right now of rolling out with some of our aladdin users already on climate and that will continue to be in my mind one of the principal drivers for aladdin utilization going forward and then the greater utilization of alternatives the combination of aladdin and efront really extended aladdin across the entire investment ecosystem end to end and so with aladdin provider with aladdin wealth and now aladdin climate across all the portfolios i do believe it is going to drive accelerated growth for aladdin going forward i m incredibly optimistic about the opportunities we have and i truly believe as more and more regulators are asking questions related to climate and how do you quantify climate as a risk the need for aladdin is essential in terms of understanding that risk as one measurement i mean there are many other tools that people could use but it will be one of the measurements that people can utilize and i would also add one of the great strengths for aladdin over the last two years and why greater utilization is open aladdin we are now allowing every user of aladdin to put their own models in that are proprietary to them so aladdin as a risk management system is not a monolithic system what aladdin has become is more an operating ecosystem and helping the owners of money the asset managers of money to really navigate across asset categories communication to clients communication to the custodial bank and having your own proprietary risk system and that has been one of the great transitions of aladdin and then dovetailing that the infrastructure of aladdin related to azure and snowflake and i ll allow gary to talk about what we re doing in the infrastructure to create a more resilient aladdin gary shedlin chief financial officer thanks larry so mike i think you were specifically asking about cloud i ll give you just a couple of comments we are obviously migrating aladdin from blackrock managed data centers to the cloud and we think that that partnership with microsoft in particular brings a number of enhanced capabilities to both ourselves and aladdin clients i mean the big four for us are to localize data hosting as larry talked about really unlocking growth as a key part of our strategy to open aladdin where clients are really looking to use both data and apis in ways that differentiate them and help to express their own competitive advantage we re looking to accelerate innovation and finally migrating to the cloud is going to help us support greater computing scale and elasticity at our clients as we see client demand to use data clearly increasing more importantly though it s beyond just the cloud i mean we re making investments really to address the needs of what we consider the investor for the future obviously a focus on whole portfolio solutions you know about our acquisition of efront where we bring public and private capabilities together in one platform sustainability data and analytics which will be very critical we talked about flexible tech solutions and connectivity that we just talked about but also integrated data ecosystem that will allow clients to combine both aladdin and non aladdin data which i think is going to be important we re about two thirds complete with our client migrations that is ahead of our initial plan and we anticipate completing the remainder of those client migrations likely in the first half of 2022 operator your next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank your line is open larry fink chairman and chief executive officer hey brian brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great good morning good morning happy new year maybe just to circle back on sustainable investing it looks like that continues to be about nearly 20 of your organic growth and you re now at over 500 billion you re well on your way to making that 1 trillion mark well before the end of the decade if this type of pace continues but maybe larry if you could talk about how you re seeing recent trends in demand momentum in the us versus europe obviously europe has been more of the growth engine over the long term on sustainable investing but maybe you can just talk about that differentiation and then also just on carbon transition as well this is such a developing market i don t know if you have a view on what a longer term market opportunity for investment product could be from an aum size in that area and what sort of products you are targeting to do larry fink chairman and chief executive officer great question thanks brian well in 2020 we made a large statement related to the tectonic shift that we ve seen is going to occur in the investment world and we continue to see rising interest in sustainability worldwide and i think just by evidence of 2021 we saw 31 billion of flows in the us in sustainability 65 billion of flows from emea which you suggested more in europe 8 billion from apac and we went from about 100 billion in 2019 to 500 billion today i think what we re in different spots as evidenced by those flows as you suggested in europe if you do not have a sustainability lens you will not be awarded any mandates today it is a component of all i want to underscore all investing in europe today in the united states it s still quite mixed depending on the institution but it s growing it s growing because a we are able to create a customized portfolio and this is the power of aladdin for us customized portfolio for those clients who are looking to start looking at sustainability as an investment opportunity and an investment risk and i believe this will continue to be driving flows in the coming years the big opportunity and the greatest opportunity in this area is investing in new is a new technology as i said in my prepared remarks if we move to a green economy tomorrow without new technology it s going to lead to an unfair and unjust transition and as we witnessed in so many places already with rising energy prices we ve seen governments capping energy costs to the consumer even the european countries that are so focused on sustainability like france and spain have caps and heating and other things like that so this is going to be a very long as i discussed over the years a very long transition and very and it s not going to be a straight line the opportunity then is to be working with traditional hydrocarbon companies who are going to be part of the solution it s going to be working with agricultural companies who are part of the solution it is investing in new start ups whether it is to create blue or green hydrogen or blue or green ammonia to find new solutions for green cement and steel for investing in new opportunities and sequestering of hydrocarbons so we believe climate transition opportunities for renewable power for these new technology are going to be great and i do believe there s going to be huge investment opportunities going forward so it s a combination of navigating your current portfolio as a lens but also the opportunities in investing in side by side with hydrocarbon companies or investing in new technologies and new start ups gary why don t you carry on and talk about sustainability too please gary shedlin chief financial officer i think you got it larry i think you hit on all the key parts of the question in terms of just flows i mean unless brian there was anything specific you wanted additional color on the flows i think larry captured it emea was basically 65 of flows sustainability for the year larry mentioned the us being about 30 billion i think importantly the us was up 50 year over year notwithstanding that it s still only about one third of those flows but otherwise i think larry you captured it larry fink chairman and chief executive officer well then thank you ok operator all right ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions mr fink do you have any closing remarks larry fink chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator i

it s nothing but profit now if you don t have any money there goes the door it s not right despite the billions of dollars invested in solving the homelessness crisis across the region residents of l a both housed and unhoused are fed up with what they see as a lack of movement by the city to help people facing homelessness l a city controller ron galperin released a report wednesday that recommended 26 properties that the city owns that could be used immediately to provide a combined 1 7 million square feet of space for interim housing space that can be used for additional tiny home villages safe parking lots or support facilities such as showers restrooms and laundry with tens of thousands of people sleeping on the streets nightly the city must do more to alleviate homelessness by using the properties it owns galperin said in a statement the status quo is unacceptable these properties are big enough unused or vacant and could give shelter and services to thousands of unhoused angelenos i ve been homeless now going on three years sleeping in my car sleeping wherever and it s hard i m just trying to get me some type of housing so i can be stable so i can say yeah this is mine damon an unhoused man in los angeles galperin s office decided to move forward after finding that proposition hhh the 2016 bond measure voters passed to build 10 000 supportive housing units was not meeting its goals only 1 100 units have been built one of the largest recommended locations is in l a city councilmember marqueece harris dawson s district which happens to be right

ongoing medical condition one of the largest vacant lots in cd8 that can be used for immediate supportive housing the surrounding area is mostly businesses ethan ward laist asa grissett a 35 year old unhoused black man in watts said he s been waiting months to get into housing he said the land should be used for tiny homes since the land has been vacant for at least a decade if they are tiny homes then they shouldn t take that long to build grissett said i ll even help grissett said give me a job i ll work too grissett said the vacant land points to a lack of willpower from city council members who say they want to help and have plenty of open space but don t act it just goes to show how much help they re really trying to give us he said the cost of doing businesses across town in l a city councilmember kevin de león s district galperin s office recommended a parking lot that sits behind a busy business district on césar chavez blvd the site is currently used for metered parking guadalupe carrillo has lived in the neighborhood for 30 years and would prefer the city find another place to set up supportive housing or services for people experiencing homelessness we can t find no parking on the streets there s so many cars already on the streets so we need the parking lot carillo said adding that if there was absolutely no other option then it would be a good idea carrillo s concerns about parking for businesses was echoed in the valley jake flynn communications director for councilmember bob blumenfield said they are familiar with the sites recommended by galperin adding there are roughly 200 permanent supportive housing units currently under construction but their office has run into obstacles about how to use the lots the councilmember is looking at possibilities there with necessary replacement parking as this has been a big point that nearby businesses have stressed when we ve done outreach on this issue flynn said in an email adding that businesses heavily rely on those lots for their customers flynn said blumenfield would keep pursuing opportunities that are feasible and have community support angelina valencia dumarot communications director for l a city councilmember curren d price jr said the two recommended shelter locations on crocker are currently under development for permanent supportive housing that will bring 83 units to the area valencia dumarot said the parking lot on slauson is currently used by the vermont slauson economic development corporation a community nonprofit that helps businesses and entrepreneurs start and expand their small businesses they currently use the parking lot for their clients and employees according to valencia dumarot these two lots are currently under equipped to handle the needs associated with ongoing business activities in the village karly katona caretaker for council district 10 referring to lots at leimert park village a popular destination for afro centric culture and commerce the locations recommended by galperin for council district 10 which includes the neighborhoods of arlington heights mid city and west adams aren t the right ones to focus on according to karly katona caretaker for the district appointed by l a city council president nury martinez until a permanent replacement is made two of those parking lots serve leimert park village which is the center for afro centric culture and commerce in south los angeles according to katona these two lots are currently under equipped to handle the needs associated with ongoing business activities in the village as well as the adjacent crenshaw lax line station and 800 seat vision theater which are both slated to open this year katona said in an email another location galperin recommended was marlton square but the federal grants used to buy the parcels restrict the city from putting any form of housing on the property according to katona the site is currently accepting pitches for a development designed to create well paying jobs for the surrounding community of south los angeles katona said the office is exploring development of a lot in koreatown on vermont ave just south of wilshire for affordable and supportive housing and is working with the city s housing agencies to find other suitable sites conrado terrazas communications director for councilmember gil cedillo said their district ranks at the top of all council districts with the most affordable and permanent supportive housing citing data from los angeles city planning s housing and community investment department the city and our office are looking at city owned lots to increase affordable housing stock and will consider viable options for the particular needs of each community terrazas said we are diligently working to provide and build more housing for our unhoused neighbors throughout the city and our district l a city councilmember joe buscaino s district has eight lots the largest number recommended in the controller s report branimir kvartuc communications director for buscaino said they are thankful for the roadmap of where its office should be looking to address the needs of unhoused residents in the district and will look to see which are viable there s always pushback kvartuc said now it s about getting community buy in we ve gone through this process multiple times including with interim bridge homes the councilman has stood behind his calculation that the situation would improve and neighbors who push back would see the benefits and back off neighborhood council s weigh in jennifer corral president of the harbor city neighborhood council which is located in buscaino s district said they had no comment on the issue of possible locations that can be used for people experiencing homelessness tenesha taylor chairperson for the watts neighborhood council expressed concern about developing more housing in an area that is already congested and overpopulated she suggested the city look at empty lots in south l a that aren t in watts why is it that poor communities are asked to do more than wealthier communities like woodland hills said jamie york a resident of reseda who is also secretary for the reseda neighborhood council her comments were made in her private capacity as she isn t allowed to speak on behalf of the neighborhood council until they ve voted we want to see every neighborhood participating in solutions for homelessness she said adding that there are several lots in woodland hills that could be used that didn t make the report blumenfield had previously authored a motion in 2019 asking for several lots to be reviewed as potential places for permanent or affordable housing in may 2019 the city council s homelessness and poverty committee approved the sites and it was sent to the city council for a vote the reseda neighborhood council originally supported the motion but in august 2021 formally requested that any action related to the motion be stopped claiming any outlier data obtained through the economic impact study would be tainted due to the pandemic york said there was a lack of transparency from blumenfield s office over how data was gathered and they only found out about it after filing a california public records act request beyond that york expressed concern about the lots which are off reseda blvd s economic corridor we don t have to hurt other people to help unhoused people jamie york resident of reseda and secretary for the reseda neighborhood council if they close the parking lots people will do street parking more and it s already extremely dangerous york said citing how dangerous the street already is i constantly see accidents there is a concern for the safety and wellbeing of others when it comes to these parking lot closures york said the reseda community has otherwise embraced other measures to bring unhoused people off the streets such as the tiny home village and planned supportive housing and the purchase of motels there s a genuine fear among the business owners that if there is disruption for customers to access their business they can t absorb two years of depressed business york said adding the parking lots are the reason why they ve been able to survive during the pandemic we are lucky we have an abundance of mom and pop business but those mom and pop businesses are more fragile in what they can sustain as far as losses we don t have to hurt other people to help unhoused people said york claudia oliveira president of the downtown l a neighborhood council said the neighborhood council appreciates galperin s efforts in coming up with more cost effective solutions to help unhoused people we as a neighborhood council are always in favor of more permanent solutions including permanent supportive housing and we have supported many projects that are temporary because both solutions are needed said oliveira adding the council can t take an official stance either way until residents have a chance to weigh in in her private capacity oliveira said a bridge housing option at the former lapd headquarters at parker center another of galperin s suggestions would be perfect in

idaho wheat comparisons drought and high temperatures made for a difficult year for idaho wheat growers this year well as everybody knows we had a really hard year with the drought and so our final production was down about 32 said casey chumrau executive director of the idaho wheat commission and if you consider the fact that we were only about 1 lower on the planted acres that really tells the story that the yields took a serious hit from that severe drought and the extreme heats that we saw over the summer and that was across the board across the state and across all wheat classes added chumrau the irrigated and non irrigated people suffered probably not the same because obviously the dryland had no real irrigation options but the real severe temperatures also affected the irrigated growers a lot this year so we certainly saw some dryland areas have 40 of normal so they certainly suffered more and that s one advantage that we have here in idaho is that with the irrigation a year like this maybe we only drop 30 as opposed to 40 50 where some of our neighbors were in that category said chumrau it was a real stark difference in 2021 because it followed the record production of 2020 where we saw about 112 million bushels produced here in idaho and in 2021 we had just over 76 million that was about 97 bushels per acre across all wheat classes and this year we were down to about 68 bushels per acre so again 32 lower than the year before and that follows record yields record production and now we re probably the lowest production in maybe 40 years yeah we re seeing a classic example of supply and demand right now as world stocks get very tight with both lower production here in the u s and in canada and also russia continues to adjust their final production numbers lower and lower the world just can t buy enough wheat so prices have really skyrocketed and unfortunately for this region we don t have a lot of extra bushels to take advantage of those prices this year a lot of our growers of course smartly had committed their bushels and sold a lot of their production with contracts and unfortunately there s just not a lot left over this year to take advantage of those high prices we re expecting to see at least the same amount of acres if not maybe a little bit more idaho has a pretty consistent crop rotation and growers seem to stick to that for the most past they have a little bit a flexibility but we re certainly looking for more rain we need additional rain this year we ve seen a slight improvement the last few weeks with the rain that we ve received but we re still in really severe drought conditions so looking for probably the same amount of acres but hoping that we ll get some rain to help with the yields this year
with the surge in omicron variant cases comes a surge in demand for lab and rapid tests example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video boise idaho with the spread of the highly contagious omicron covid variant getting tested for the virus is again a popular activity just ask people like the team at crush the curve idaho yes we have been really busy this week we have been running a small community site at full capacity said maricela rios testing site coordinator for crush the curve rios says people stop by for a covid test for a variety of reasons but they ve found that a lack of rapid tests certainly pushes people to get a lab based pcr test through crush the curve yeah there s been some frustration that s been expressed like we are looking for a rapid do you know where you can get a rapid rios said rios says this past week they were very busy doing as many tests as possible during the day the plain truth is that rapid at homes tests are out of stock nationwide the only option some have is trying to get an appointment at a clinic testing is very busy it seems that throughout the course of the pandemic what we ve observed is every time there is a huge spike in positivity there is a corresponding increase in demand for testing said dr christopher ball chief of the idaho bureau of laboratories unlike the store bought rapid tests dr ball says idaho is seeing availability for people looking to get tested in a clinic and have their samples sent to a lab they seem to say that they have adequate pcr capability there may be some limitations for a lot of healthcare setting staffing has become an issue so i think that may be what is limiting some of the appointment times from what we are hearing there is pcr testing if people are willing to wait ball said the wait is for getting a test and for getting the result combined the wait can be a few days that s why rapid at home tests are so popular right now some good news this week the biden administration says they are ordering one billion rapid tests to send to americans for free it s important to note though that people who take rapid tests at home are not included in data metrics tracked by the state so as people continue to shift away from pcr tests taken at a clinic public health experts miss out on valuable data i think it s a real balancing act we definitely need to have people getting pcr tests so that we can continue to describe the dynamics of the pandemic but as we can move towards more convenient at home options i think it s better for people in terms of convenience and being able to hopefully limit transmission ball said dr ball says the at home rapid tests can be really helpful though if people take them seriously i would be willing to sacrifice a little bit of the visibility we have on the pandemic if people are actually going to take a test and isolate themselves if they re positive and take appropriate actions to limit transmission ball said so how does the state lab and public health experts adapt to people leaning more towards at home testing we in public health love to have data so that we can communicate to the public the reality of what s happening as we start seeing fewer and fewer people contributing to the test numbers that we can report on it does become more challenging to interpret what the pandemic really looks like ball said dr ball adds that the state is evaluating options for tracking the virus with other metrics like wastewater testing watch more local news

commentary this is what happens when you don t understand how the economy works or how businesses run early last year at the beginning of the biden administration s reign of terror the president signed several executive orders that reshaped the landscape of the energy industry designed to redirect the economy toward a green renewable energy path one clearly not ready for prime time president joe biden made a series of changes that have had an enormous impact on energy prices today i usually won t point the finger at an administration and blame them for economic shifts good or bad no president actually controls the price of gas or oil although their policies do set the tone for what s to come and biden s policies are pretty much tone deaf when it comes to the energy needs of the united states today making life hard for business the most notable action of his first day in office was to effectively shut down the keystone xl pipeline pipelines are the safest most cost efficient way to move energy product it s a simple reality of the business halting keystone xl didn t stop the flow of oil coming from canada it simply rerouted it via rail and trucks two more expensive and carbon emitting i might add means of transportation when you create a landscape that increases costs for business it s a disincentive to produce goods everyone who s ever sat in an econ 101 class knows this maybe the biden administration also knows it but that wasn t the only thing he did he ordered a 60 day pause on the issuing of drilling leases on federal lands cutting oil companies ability to produce he s also promised to make these permanent he reinstated methane regulations calling for substantial reductions in u s methane emissions which are estimated to cost the industry 600 million for compliance a death sentence for smaller oil producers he s initiated a study on the effects of closing another pipeline line 5 which supplies about 540 000 barrels of oil and gas to the midwest every day he s looking to eliminate tax deductions and regulatory advantages to hydrocarbon based producers including intangible drilling cost deductions and depletion tax breaks to call these actions unfriendly to the industry is an understatement to say the least fact of business life no 1 when the costs of production go up the costs of the end product will go up as well the price of oil has skyrocketed from its lows during the pandemic and as a result the resulting inflation is hurting everyone at the pump these days trying to make nice again in recent weeks the administration has been in talks with oil companies pressing them to increase production this effort came of course after the white house tried to get opec to increase production but apparently they re bombing at that too it s important for the american oil and gas industry to address near term energy demands while also recognizing that they need to begin transitioning their companies energy department spokesman david mayorga said in december that kind of solve our problem now while reshaping your entire business to meet our carbon goals talk literally doesn t help anything but again they don t realize this in a functioning economy higher prices are what lead to lower prices that means only higher prices will spur oil companies to increase production meaningfully eventually production will catch up with demand and prices will moderate but in the meantime rising oil prices will likely be the norm i could easily see oil prices in excess of 100 per barrel from a consumer s perspective things are about to start getting a good deal more expensive but energy investments should profit nicely energy related etfs such as the energy select sector spdr fund xle and the spdr s p oil gas exploration production etf xop should perform well in the coming months
menafn khaleej times published fri 14 jan 2022 8 41 pm little over a year ago the saudi central bank sama and central bank of united arab emirates cbuae agreed to jointly explore the creation of a central bank digital currency or cbdc project aber meaning crossing boundaries in arabic was a pilot to explore whether distributed ledger technology dlt or blockchain the technology stack underlying a cbdc could enable cross border payments the conclusion of the experiment was more than satisfactory a report detailing the findings co authored by sama and cbuae and released recently said the project confirmed that dlt can provide central banks the ability to reimagine both domestic and cross border payment systems in new ways and then added we are pleased by the promising results insights and learnings described in this report and trust that they will benefit the central banking community and broader financial ecosystem in visualising the potential of this new technology to transform the gcc gulf cooperation council financial markets and indeed our industry in the process both the uae and saudi arabia renewed the spotlight on a new trend sweeping the global financial sector and at the same time contributed to the learning quotient on cbdcs they are part of a growing list of 90 countries engaged in various stages of rolling out the cbdc which is nothing but virtual money backed by a country s central bank these include sweden south korea and cambodia who have launched pilots and countries like brazil china the united states and india who have signalled their intent together they are creating the quotient of experiences to ready for the launch a cbdc however first off the blocks was the eastern caribbean central bank which rolled out its pilot in april last year and then in early december 2021 they extended it to two more islands dominica and montserrat dcash the name of their cbdc was launched in the islands of antigua and barbuda grenada saint kitts and nevis and saint lucia other central banks are keen but are yet take the plunge the question then is why is there a sudden surge in interest among central banks all over the world about a cbdc the obvious logic from the outside looking in is the growing popularity of decentralised currencies like a crypto currency the usp of crypto currencies in offering frictionless transactions particularly those involving cross border transactions like remittances and simultaneously solving for trust the sine qua non of any central bank currency through the use of a transparent mechanism like blockchain is offering an alternative currency in short private currencies are poised to compete with fiat currencies this is something that could potentially upend the world of finance presumably central banks would prefer to be part of the solution in ensuring frictionless payments at low or no costs to consumers by tapping the same tech and thereby stay ahead of potential competition all the more since banning a crypto currency in a new world order where money in the form of code does not recognise geography is hardly an option addressing a recent webinar hosted by the vidhi centre for legal policy on the cbdc reserve bank of india rbi deputy governor t rabi sankar very candidly admitted as much it is not clear what specific need is met by these private vcs virtual currencies that official money cannot meet as efficiently but that may in itself not come in the way of their adoption if these vcs gain recognition national currencies with limited convertibility are likely to come under threat he said the blockchain logic it is important to keep in mind that the one aspect that is common to both cbdc and cryptocurrency is the underlying technology blockchain in short blockchain is the driver of this disruption and cryptocurrency is just an example of its application the technology can be used for a host of services including the delivering of social benefits like pensions poverty relief packages and unemployment benefits among other things it will eliminate leakages due to corruption the geeky definition sourced from ibm is it blockchain is a shared immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network an asset can be tangible a house car cash land or intangible intellectual property patents copyrights branding the key terms are shared ledger and asset essentially the technology enables the inter linking of a secure computer network to transact business where every entity who is part of it has equal knowledge about every leg of the transaction exactly why it is also often referred to as decentralised computing defi or decentralised finance is nothing but a blockchain application in finance this is a utopian world in which everyone knows what is going on information is power not by withholding it but by sharing it with every stakeholder so at one level it becomes that much more difficult to pull off scams without the cover of anonymity what this very obviously does is reduce traditional risks associated with a business transaction and of course usher in the cost efficiencies and unlike in a centralised system there is no single point vulnerability in the architecture at the same time it is prone to cyber attacks nonetheless scores of crypto currencies have started to emerge from less than ten a few years ago a guesstimate pegs them at just under 8 000 at present they are applying blockchain benefits efficiency and accuracy to the business of information the one factor influencing competitiveness as ibm succinctly explains the benefits the faster it s received and the more accurate it is the better keeping the definition of blockchain based on a shared digital network mentioned earlier a cryptocurrency is a digital currency created by a private entity who issues a token which then becomes the currency facebook for instance is calling its token diem think of the time when private currencies existed before they were replaced by sovereign currencies exactly the reason why cryptocurrency is seen as a threat to central bank currencies world over especially stablecoin one of the popular crypto currencies which mimics an official currency as its value is pegged to a reserve asset which can either be the us dollar or gold thereby it is less susceptible to volatility something that is the norm with most of the tokens in circulation unlike in the case of a cryptocurrency a cbdc is based on a private blockchain network and is essentially like an intranet in effect it will be like creating a pdf version of a print magazine the form is different but will not do anything more than a fiat currency which is physical a cryptocurrency on the other hand employs a public blockchain network which allows for decentralised computing something that is very similar to the worldwide internet architecture as david wessel senior fellow and director the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy brookings institution pointed out during a recent webinar a cryptocurrency combines network theory which promotes efficiency gain theory creates incentives through issue of tokens like bitcoins for all the participants in the transaction and cryptography which ensures security it is these foundations that are posing a threat to fiat currencies issued by central banks which is exactly why they are moving quickly to plug the efficiency gap faced by central currencies especially with cross border transactions entailing exports and imports any trade financed by a cbdc will be settled in real time as it is a fiat and won t need to go through the rigour of inter bank settlements this was also established by project aber initiated jointly by saudi arabia and the uae tipping point in global finance the subtext of this seeming faceoff between crypto currencies and the cbdc is as eswar prasad senior fellow brookings institution explained in his just released book the future of money a tipping point in global finance the era of cash is drawing to an end and that of central bank digital currencies has begun money banking and finance are on the verge of transformation physical money is becoming a relic the digital payment system is becoming the norm around the world banking is going to change as other forms of financial intermediation gain prominence much of the world s population will gain access to at least basic financial services improving lines and economic forecasts he writes interestingly several countries in the developing world are already pushing the envelope especially in enabling financial inclusion and real time payments in fact several of them are ahead of the developed countries like the united states in fintech innovation while m pesa in kenya enables a mobiles based money transfer unified payments interface upi from india and the most recent launch of pix the real time payments from brazil offer similar and efficient solutions all of them are also forcing a shift in consumer behaviour the death of the leather wallet as it were india s upi for example is capable of solving any denomination payment including for one rupee and a large volume of transactions at the moment upi s use is growing exponentially and averaging about 2 3 billion transactions a month but this transactional efficiency can be scaled if required to 2 billion a day in fact in value terms upi was just shy of logging a record 1 trillion worth of transactions in 2021 the proposed digital rupee to be issued by the rbi can instantly leverage the growing upi platform to reach 200 million users a difficult target for any country to match this could popularise the use of cbdc and enable the reserve bank of india reach critical mass in quick time addressing the seminar hosted by brookings prasad framed this competition between the cbdc and crypto currencies favourably something where the two systems may actually complement each other and creating a win win for all what is important in my view is really a new era of competition that could ultimately benefit both consumers and businesses but it s going to be in the form of digital payments of various sorts and this is going to be good not just for consumers and businesses within economies but cross border payments where there are a lot of frictions that affect say

median of 20 000 over last year s 15 000 despite the lack of any major dispersals the first sale of the year carried on momentum from a powerful often record setting market in 2021 overall we are very pleased said tony lacy keeneland s vice president of sales it was a continuation of the momentum we saw in september and november encouragingly we aren t seeing spikes and valleys which make the market narrow it has been quite broad in all respects photo anne m eberhardt l r tony lacy and cormac breathnach at keeneland led by the 750 000 purchase of 2 year old princesse lele as three chimneys

jr generating 13 5 million combined the rna rate was 21 3 for the 260 horses that failed to meet their reserve the clearance rate at 88 is a good indicator of the market lacy said people can trade horses out with the slightly higher rna rate seen in book 1 i think people were being a bit more protective of their stock they don t have to sell which is not a bad thing friday s final session saw 243 horses of the 385 on offer change hands for gross receipts of 4 020 700 a median price of 10 000 was achieved with a 16 546 average the 54 horses that failed to meet their reserve price represent

and she is now back under tack buchanan noted we will likely prep her for the spring races in new york or here at keeneland she still has allowance conditions left which is key buchanan made headlines

go this high said muth there is a lot of quality there she s a nice mare that will work out well i expected her right around that figure we maybe reached out a hair farther but i think she is worth it the day s third highest price of 135 000 was paid for constantina a racing or broodmare prospect consigned as eaton sales agent the 4 year old candy ride mare offered as hip 1287 comes from the

300 000 as a yearling she has a fantastic pedigree it s the best pedigree going back she got hurt in her first race and had to be retired she s a gorgeous individual eaton sales managing partner reiley mcdonald who finished the four days of selling as second leading consignor commented the racing stock will always sell well the made racehorse market is through the roof in private sales and in an auction format it s even bigger because you can acquire a much larger buyer base he continued one thing i have noticed here in the last couple of days if you bring a pretty mare up to the ring even with a limited pedigree people will pay a great premium like the case today we had the runhappy mare hip 1343 not a good racehorse but beautiful she brought 90 000 our candy ride mare hip 1287 was a beautiful beautiful mare she had an older family and limited first dam and brought 135 000 vino rosso colt tops fourth session short yearling division there were 726 short yearlings cataloged to this

421 yearlings sold for 14 958 600 overall at a 35 531 average if you do sell a short yearling at this time going into next year there are pretty high replacement costs said cormac breathnach keeneland s director of sales people are more willing to roll the dice on a little deeper in the year there were a lot of short yearlings in book one that traded around the 200 000 mark which is a sign that what was offered was popular a filly by darby dan s proven sire dialed in was the final session s leading short yearling filly selling for 49 000 to michelle redding indian creek consigned the kentucky bred as hip 1406 out of the smart strike mare lotta lolly a full sister to grade 1 winner square eddie i think pinhookers are looking forward to another strong yearling year september was extremely good with a record median among other metrics breathnach commented i think there is a confidence that the market is currently in a good state with supply and demand there is energy behind the sport with the new owners and money that showed up in september it s not an overheated market it doesn t feel that way it feels substantial primarily through the middle paramount sales was friday s leading consignor by gross selling 16 head for final figures of 449 000 perennial leading consignor taylor made sales agency capped the january sale at the top again after selling 126 horses for a gross of 5 814 800 photo keeneland photo taylor made sales agency emerged as the leading consignor at the keeneland january sale photo anne m eberhardt mark taylor at keeneland r larry johnson made the singular purchase of go big blue nation to emerge as the session s leading buyer friday cumulatively over the four days of selling oxo equine made six purchases for gross figures of 1 490 000 to be the sales leading buyer photo anne m eberhardt larry best was the leading buyer of the keeneland january sale with six purchases made for 1 490 000 we had a lot of happy sellers and buyers were a tad frustrated in certain places but they understand that is due to a competitive market which is good for everybody said lacy the day you buy is the day you sell and if they are both competitive you hopefully will reap the rewards i think you saw where some of the higher priced horses were fair they weren t extraordinary very rational lacy continued it s believable and more sustainable long term it gives me more of a feeling of confidence moving forward that there is viability to breed a nice horse whatever level it is you can get a return from it and get it moved along

merging its three lines alongside its recent public listing on the new york stock exchange to fuel future growth the new logo evoking road with yellow lane markings signifies the main road through the family reserve but also the road ahead i am sure that regardless of the bloody covid it will work out gildo zegna brand ceo said defiantly sartori has reinvisioned the suit for younger clients offering softly tailored outer jacket layered over with a longer tunic coat and trousers all in matching fabrics of differing weights a cashmere mock turtleneck unites them in sartori s vision buyers of the luxury menswear line will build their wardrobe season after season adding new pieces with the mainstay color palette in off white black and flannel gray offset this season by aubergine and a burnt umber shade he called vicuna for the camelid raised for its precious wool by contrast the dsquared2 collection beckoned for the road in a more prosaic devil may care way the layered looks featuring cropped puffers pleated plaid skirt tails and sequined shorts suggested hippies still in search of a grateful dead traveling show but happy to pass the time rock climbing or trekking through snow with the aid of removable crampons water bottle shoved in a front pocket the canadians needed no outdoor brand partnership to show that the wilderness is in their dna unlike another milan brand federico cina launched his brand just before the pandemic hit so it is perhaps fitting he made his runway debut as the virus continued its grip the long silhouette features free falling cable knit or ribbed knitwear that layer easily over wide legged pants the runway debut collection featured a leaf motif taken from a wood print from the coastal zones of the emilia romagna region i never thought of giving up cina said backstage especially as the fashion chamber is giving me this moment of visibility during milan fashion week it is just huge i never thought of not doing the show especially with the right precautions the italian fashion scene has been buffeted by the pandemic since italy recorded the first locally transmitted case of the virus in the west during in the middle of fashion week in february 2020 armani was the first to close his showroom to a live audience streaming the fall winter 2020 21 collection from an empty theater the digital trend continued with a handful of live runway exceptions until last september s womenswear previews for spring summer 2022 when vaccination rates heralded a return to live shows as the rule albeit with limited numbers and social distancing that was enough to offer promises that fashionistas in something closer to pre pandemic numbers could once again pack runway seating where they might discern first hand whether that shimmering fabric is silk or satin for this edition travel restrictions and concerns mean that many editors and buyers who had intended to travel to milan this month canceled particularly from the united states capasa said in addition swaths of asia and eastern europe important fashion markets are administering vaccinations not approved by european health authorities limiting travel to italy under current health guidelines fashion houses must allow for every guest four square meters just over 40 square meters a space that previously might have sat as many as eight in many cases that means something like one tenth of the pre pandemic audience requiring tough calls even if fewer people are traveling more protective ffp2 masks are being required in fashion terms the pandemic is now in its eighth season capasa noted with satisfaction that no outbreaks have ever been traced to fashion week we must learn to live with this virus and maintain a high guard on behaviors capasa said if we learned anything it is that we need to think very quickly and adapt to the situation colleen barry the associated press

wait for real strength not another dead cat bounce energy and financial sectors continue to lead along with fertilizers and some other cyclical names but don t get too concentrated even here a
