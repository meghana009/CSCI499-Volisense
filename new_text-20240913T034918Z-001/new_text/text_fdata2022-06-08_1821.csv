measures the company uses have limitations and may differ from those used by other companies now i d like to turn the call over to dan dan dan bodner chief executive officer thank you matt i m pleased to report strong cloud momentum in q1 with non gaap revenue and diluted earnings per share coming in ahead of our guidance in fact q1 was strong across all key metrics including new ple bookings growth and mix as the bookings continue to shift to saas looking ahead we expect strong cloud momentum and are raising our annual guidance to cloud revenue growth by 200 basis points to a range of 32 to 34 behind our strong momentum is our focus on helping brands close the engagement capacity gap with a highly differentiated customer engagement cloud platform we believe that closing the capacity gap has become more urgent for brands as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions including wage inflation challenges in hiring as well as post pandemic hybrid workforce dynamics on thursday this week we will hold our annual investor day and we will discuss this new workforce reality and dive deeper into our platform differentiation which helps brands reduce costs and elevate the customer experience today let s take a closer look at our q1 results including key cloud kpis our journey to the cloud continues to progress ahead of the plan that we outlined a little over a year ago at the time of the spin off of our security business let s take a closer look at our q1 cloud kpis first cloud revenue increased by 38 year over year driven by new logos customer expansions and strong cloud conversions second our booking mix continue to shift to the cloud with 58 of our new ple bookings coming from saas compared to 51 in q1 of the prior year the continued mix shift suggests strong market adoption for our cloud platform third new ple bookings increased 27 year over year a great start to the year and well ahead of our annual target of low double digit growth fourth we had 26 cloud orders in excess of 1 million tcv as the number of large enterprise customers shifting to the cloud continues to increase our 1 million cloud order included some of the more notable brands in the world such as wells fargo comcast marriott and zillow and finally during q1 we continued to win many new customers and added more than 100 new logos including eastman chemical kindercare education and sun jones university let s take a closer look at some of our competitive wins i would like to highlight three q1 wins the first order for 15 million was from a leading insurance company that expanded its relationship with us by consolidating applications for multiple vendors onto the verint cloud platform and also converted its perpetual licenses with very into the cloud verint was selected to help this customer close the engagement capacity gap we believe that this large order was due to our strong relationship differentiated ai capabilities and our ability to drive significant roi the second order for 3 million was for a customer in the healthcare industry that is expanding its relationship with us by replacing another vendor with additional solutions in the verint cloud platform we believe our open partnership strategy differentiated ai capabilities and platform scalability were key reasons we want this opportunity and the third win is a new logo for verint typically new logos start small and expand over time this win was relatively large for 2 million from a new customer in the banking industry the customer conducted a competitive process and we believe we were selected due to our leading ai capabilities and the open scalable architecture of our cloud platform behind these wins and our strong momentum is a cloud platform differentiation our investor day on thursday will focus on what makes our platform differentiated you will hear from multiple variant executives and we will cover the following topics recent market trends and the burnt opportunity to help brands close the engagement capacity gap our strategy to increase differentiation and deliver even more our eye to customers a cloud platform and a deep dive into da vinci ai and finally our financial model we think it will be a very informative session and hope that you can attend this event next week we will hold our annual engage customer conference which is also open for investors at engage we will unveil numerous innovations across the platform and i would like to briefly touch on two examples of our recent innovation to help brands close the engagement capacity gap the first one we call one workforce one workforce enables the entire customer engagement workforce across the enterprise to engage with customers in the right way at the right time by connecting workforce silos and automating business processes with one workforce we are helping people and bots work together as a unified workforce to increase efficiency and elevate customer sentiment the second one is very in da vinci ai which is at the core of the verint platform we are introducing very da vinci ai capabilities as api services this means our developer community consisting of customers and partners can now leverage verite to develop unique functionality with our cloud platform we are able to accelerate our pace of innovation which we will showcase at engage before concluding my prepared remarks i would like to briefly discuss our approach to guidance and investments in the current environment we are pleased with our strong start to the year with strength across all key cloud metrics we expect the cloud momentum to continue throughout the year and are pleased to be raising our annual outlook for cloud revenue growth behind our guidance is our strong start to the year combined with our cloud momentum and our recurring revenue visibility we plan to continue hiring and investing for the remainder of the year to support this growth guidance beyond this year we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow long term as we help brands close the engagement capacity gap and deliver strong roi now let me turn the call over to doug to discuss our financial results in more detail doug doug robinson chief financial officer yes thanks dan good afternoon everyone our discussion today will include non gaap financial measures a reconciliation between our gaap and non gaap financial measures is available as matt mentioned in our earnings release and in the ir section of our website differences between our gaap and non gaap financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions including fair value revenue adjustments amortization of acquisition related intangibles certain other acquisition related expenses stock based compensation expenses separation related expenses accelerated lease costs as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount and frequency from period to period for certain metrics it also includes adjustments related to foreign exchange rates as dan mentioned our q1 results came in ahead of expectations revenue growth came in around 8 5 or 218 million on a gaap basis and 219 million on a non gaap basis non gaap diluted eps came in at 0 52 up 18 year over year we generated 54 million of cash from operations during the quarter up 43 year over year regarding our stock buyback i d like to mention that we completed our previously announced approximately 100 million buyback program repurchasing 2 million shares the maximum amount were permitted to repurchase this year due to the tax free nature of the spin off in q1 our cloud metrics came in strong across the board cloud revenue increased 38 year over year we saw strength in both customers buying new cloud solutions as well as maintenance customers converting to the cloud new ple bookings increased 27 year over year well above our 10 to 12 target for the year 58 of our new ple bookings came from saas compared to 51 in q1 last year as our customers continue to shift to the cloud and the percentage of our software revenue that was recurring came in at 83 in q1 turning to guidance for the current year ending january 31st 2023 let me start with three key metrics we re raising our cloud revenue guidance again we now expect cloud revenue growth of 32 to 34 up from our initial guidance of 30 we expect 940 million of revenue for the year reflecting 7 growth year over year at the midpoint of our guidance and we expect non gaap diluted eps of 2 50 reflecting 10 year over year growth at the midpoint of our revenue guidance i d also like to mention that while the dollar has been strengthening we ve been able to absorb this within our guidance now let me provide you with some additional information for modeling purposes for the year starting with bookings we expect double digit new ple bookings growth in the range of 10 to 12 with approximately 65 coming from saas with respect to perpetual revenue as we transition to the cloud we expect it to decline to around 120 million this year compared to 138 million last year and with respect to or approximately 250 million maintenance base we assume 15 to 20 will convert to the cloud this year relative to margins we see some modest growth margin and operating margin expansion for the full year additionally we expect our cash flow from operations to grow more than 20 this year last year cash flow from operations was 180 million excluding nonrecurring items and this year we expect more than 215 million on the same basis this should drive our cash balance to around 400 million at year end and a net debt position close to zero as a reminder we have 45 million of debt comprised of 350 million of convertible notes at a fixed 0 25 interest rate and a 100 million term loan which is our only floating interest rate exposure in a rising interest rate environment based on our current cash position we expect the incremental interest income from our cash balances will be more than the increased cost of our floating rate debt now let s discuss some below the line assumptions for the remainder of the year we expect around 1 5 million per quarter of interest and other expense we expect about 300 000 per quarter of net income from the noncontrolling interest we have in a small joint venture we expect an approximately 11 5 cash tax rate for each quarter and for the year and we expect around 76 million of fully diluted shares flat with last year reflecting the effect of our stock buyback program for modeling purposes in q2 we assumed 225 million of revenue and 0 52 of diluted eps our q2 outlook reflects a gradual increase in gross margin and operating expenses we believe that our q2 outlook combined with our strong q1 results give us a great start to the year looking beyond this year we believe we are well positioned for long term growth and at our investor day on thursday we ll discuss some of our assumptions our long term financial model let me give you a summary of what we ll discuss first we ll discuss our opportunity to gradually improve gross margins over time we ll review how we re targeting non gaap gross margins to reach the mid 70s this is driven by an increase in recurring revenue which in fiscal 22 carried a 76 gross margin compared to 50 for nonrecurring revenue we ll discuss our expectation that gross margins will increase modestly over the next few years and then increase faster as recurring revenue crosses 90 of total revenue and we ll also discuss cash flow from operations and why we expect strong cash flow generation over the next few years in summary we re pleased with our strong cloud momentum we re tracking ahead of our three year plan we laid out last year and we re raising our annual outlook for cloud revenue growth we expect total revenue growth to accelerate we expect our margins to gradually expand and we re generating strong cash flow and have a strong balance sheet most importantly we believe our cloud and ai differentiation positions us well for long term growth and with that operator let s open up the lines for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from peter levin with evercore you may proceed peter burkly evercore isi analyst hi guys this is actually peter burkly on for peter levine thanks for taking the questions here you guys mentioned a couple of nice wins i think for an insurance company and a healthcare company so there might be actually some overlap here but just curious five9 on their last call highlighted that verint was a part of one of our largest deals to date with an insurance company so just curious specific to i wonder if you could share with us how long it took to close that deal whether you gave away any concessions with that and how many of those seats that you end up getting dan bodner chief executive officer ok sure regarding the five9 40 million in non scale so none of this was booked by verint in q1 so the numbers we reported do not include that deal and this is not the win that we discussed we expect to book this deal over time i m unable to discuss the specific scope and time line of the deal but i can say that this particular customer is already a variant customer and we did five9 win variant is expanding also the application relationship with the customer consolidating a number of different variant competitors into the verint platform peter burkly evercore isi analyst that s really helpful i appreciate that color maybe if i could just sneak in one more just given the stronger usd just curious how much of an impact fx is having on your guide and then maybe if you can just remind us how you price your contracts for customers outside the u s dan bodner chief executive officer yes so i ll start and doug if you want to give some more data but the guidance we gave today basically absorbs the fx changes that we saw in q1 so it reflects everything that we know today and we are predominantly doing business in u s dollars but we do have some exposure to revenue but also we have a hedge because where a lot of our resources are outside of the u s as well doug would you want to would you like to give more data on the mix the mix of our currencies doug robinson chief financial officer yeah sure about three quarters of our revenue is in u s dollars so that leaves a quarter in other currencies primarily euro pound to australian dollar are the big ones so as the dollar strengthened from a translation purposes it s going to hurt our top line and at current rates it s probably about close to 15 million of headwind which we ve absorbed it into our guidance from a currency perspective but as dan mentioned since we operate internationally we have a lot of expenses in those currencies as well so that 15 million of headwind translates to between 0 5 million and 1 million maybe of op income in the year if things were to play out at current rates so i think from an earnings perspective we re ok with respect to the foreign exchange movements but it just creates a little bit of a kind of a top line reporting headwind for us peter burkly evercore isi analyst that s helpful color thank you both dan bodner chief executive officer sure operator thank you our next question comes from samad samana with jefferies you may proceed samad samana jefferies analyst hi good evening it s good to see the solid results maybe first one just doug i think you mentioned in terms of the outlook for conversions being 15 to 20 can you maybe just help us understand how much visibility you have into that is that based on the company s efforts is that based on interest or indications from customers just how should we think about that range that you gave dan bodner chief executive officer yeah let me give the strategy for conversion and then you can give the numbers because i think it s important to understand how we drive conversions with our customer base so our strategy is to provide our customers the flexibility to move to the very cloud regardless of the conversion of the legacy solution so what does it mean it means basically that customers can buy new functionality that we have in the verint platform they can buy that in the cloud regardless of whether they want to maintain the legacy solutions on prem or they are ready to move their legacy solutions to the cloud so the architecture of the platform allows them to consumed a new functionality and obviously everyone is interested in moving up so they can consume new functionality already in cloud and when you look at our 38 growth in cloud revenue last year two thirds came from selling new functionality but also some of it to customers that didn t want to move to the cloud with their legacy and so a third came from customers actually are taking legacy solutions and moving them to be hosted by verint cloud and two thirds came from expansions new logos anything to do with innovation and not worried about whether the legacy is on prem doug anything you want to add doug robinson chief financial officer yes no i think you covered it i ll just say that through last year about 20 of our maintenance base had converted and this year we re kind of dialing in maybe another 15 or so in our numbers samad samana jefferies analyst yeah i mean i guess just the follow up again is that when you of the 15 that you re dialing up is that because the customers have like i guess why that number right are the customers indicating that they re willing to move or is that just kind of the estimate based on what you ve already seen doug robinson chief financial officer it s really based on dan bodner chief executive officer it s on discussions with customers that some of them are indicating that they re going to move this year some are looking for next year or even the year after so far customers have a multiyear strategy that is based on strategy that is bigger than what verint deliver what s their overall strategy to move to the cloud in phases so we are part of their strategy and we re able to kind of dial that into our outlook but you can see that for what doug said we have 65 of our new bookings will be in saas this year that s our projection 55 of our revenue will be in saas in cloud and only 35 will be as a result of conversion the 20 as doug mentioned we already have last year and the 15 we expect this year so that lagging the fact that customers don t really feel like they need to rush with variants because they re not dependent on the conversion in order to benefit from innovation we have the modules that they re buying the cloud and the modules they keep on prem are networked and they have all the integrations they need to run them as one platform so i guess in the way you would need to understand that our strategy is not to put pressure on customers to convert something that already works but to offer them innovation so they can move into the future with verint and obviously the future is more ai automation of business processes samad samana jefferies analyst great and then maybe just a follow up building on the prior analyst i know you guys talked about the guidance reflects what you re currently seeing but i m curious are you seeing any change in deal cycles or the number of people involved in approvals just anything in real time that reflects maybe the greater volatility that at least that we re hearing about in the world just curious what customer feedback is and what you re seeing dan bodner chief executive officer yeah i don t think we see any change at this point we saw more than 100 new logos also in q1 so there s clearly customers that are buying something that they need and it s very obviously new logos are competitive so we re able to win not any material change in terms of the buying pattern but clearly focus when it comes to our category which is business applications the focus has been and state is roi and that s how we sell and i want to remind you that we did talk i think it was a couple of quarters ago we had a forrester study on varying customers that they interviewed our customers and concluded that the roi was 391 and the payback was less than six months so we ve always been kind of focusing on our e driven sale process and i think now perhaps customers are even more focused on roi but it s not a major change from our perspective samad samana jefferies analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from ryan macdonald with needham you may proceed ryan macdonald needham and company analyst hi thanks for taking my question dan i d be curious as you re looking at the environment currently you talked about expectation for 15 to 20 migration but when you talk to customers are you seeing a sort of a shift in demand or a preference for full migration given the current state of the market versus just a continuation of bolting on additional cloud applications onto their existing legacy infrastructure dan bodner chief executive officer i think what customers tell us that look what we have is working and as long as our data centers are not fully depreciated we don t have to invest in building a new data center this is not a priority we re not going to get tremendous some are sometimes when they move to the cloud with legacy just saving their it personnel and so on but there s not a bigger eye such as what they re looking to get from innovation so usually focus is we ve been disrupted the customers say look we ve been disrupted by digital there s clearly more interactions we can hire because the labor spend is huge and also it s hard to find people and train them and then there s attrition and remote and hybrid workforce dynamics so everything is kind of getting very challenging for our customers in managing this very large labor so they definitely want to increase automation by introducing more bots but then they defined that the bots are operating as a silo so they really need one workforce of people and bots working together so that s more automation in terms of the business processes to get knowledge shared between people and box and get in than automation so that when the bad gets stacked the person can take over and continue all these things we didn t have in our legacy solutions so for customers to benefit from all this innovation that we offer to the market today they know they have to go to the cloud because we don t offer it on prem we only offer the new innovation in saas but as long as we are able to connect what they have on prem with what they buy is new we take the pressure off i need a big project i need to disrupt myself and i have to move everything or else i can t move forward so this is a big plus especially for very large customers they want innovation but they also cannot afford to disrupt their operations and we allow them to do that in a more organized and planned way so it s been working well for us i don t know if there s going to be acceleration in conversion i don t see a reason because there s no pressure but we do see acceleration in cloud overall both in terms of booking in q1 we had tremendous 27 growth in new booking and shift to saas so clearly there is a strong demand for saas solutions but not necessarily take the legacy into saas with urgency ryan macdonald needham and company analyst that s really helpful color and then maybe as a follow up great to see another quarter of 100 new logos onto the platform can you talk about what modules are driving the continued strong new logo adoption and whether they weight toward sort of some of the wfo solutions versus the cx solutions thanks dan bodner chief executive officer yeah no that s very interesting and we are obviously monitoring that very carefully because what we see and we talk about it is the engagement capacity gap so let me just kind of quickly explain why the important to respond to your question the capacity gap is based on the fact that with the increase in the number of channels and the number of interactions and the complexity around the workforce clearly they need more capacity and the capacity can be either in terms of hiring people or in terms of buying new ai based solutions those are the two options that customers have if they don t increase capacity they re going to start to lose customers because of poor customer experience and very low customer sentiment so our cx portfolio is very much integrated with our wfe portfolio into one platform which means you have to continuously measure the customer experience because as you make changes in operation it affects the customer experience and you need to really in real time figure out what was the good changes and what were the bad changes and make adjustments and that s the only way you can introduce changes which will reduce costs but at the same time ensure that your customer experience stay high so both are very much together and we see new logos are very excited about our ability to connect the two things because as you know mostly we compete with port solutions that are not connected into one platform and there are solutions that measure customer experience and provide you a indication of customers plant were up or nps go went up but why is it going up why is it going down and how do you can effect change and how can you change things in real time in your workforce processes that s not connected to the workforce solutions so new logos are interested in that combination that we have in the platform because that s the best way to actually close the capacity gap which is reduced cost but also at the same time elevate the customer experience ryan macdonald needham and company analyst thanks for the color congrats again operator thank you our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer you may proceed tim horan oppenheimer and company analyst thanks guys two qualitative questions i know that you won t have definitive answers but can you just talk about the quality of the product and the ai and ability to implement ai and your customers i guess ability to take advantage of it now versus maybe where you were a year ago or two years ago like how much of an improvement have we seen and then secondly on the bookings front can you just characterize your overall demand environment i know the bookings are up really really strong but have you seen this type of growth before and maybe is that continuing into the quarter this quarter thank you dan bodner chief executive officer yeah so ai is clearly in our view the future of customer engagement when you think about the technology spend and customer engagement it s 65 billion a year that s a big number clearly customer engagement industry knowledge technology is critical but in addition to the 65 billion that spend on technology the industry is spending 2 trillion on labor so now when you think about that 97 of the investment is in labor and 3 is in technology and with incremental ai that can obviously reduce the 97 of cost that s a tremendous opportunity for the industry and that s why verint is very passionate about closing the capacity gaps and this is our very focused objective after the spin is really we are focusing on this one thing introducing an ai powered platform to help customers close this gap and not have to deal with the 97 of the cost keep increasing because industry the industry needs to hire more people so that s the role of ai and why it s important now what s the state of ai i think that what many brands are trying to do now is to deploy in a very poor way and it s not to blame the ai it s really how it s deployed and how it s connected or not connected to the rest of the workforce because i cannot be a silo my own personal experience i tried to call vendor and i got a bot and the bot asked me 20 different questions which i answered very patiently and then bot got stuck so i try to ask for an agent which i didn t get and after several attempts to bot basically responded this service is now available in this channel which means that the bot doesn t even want to acknowledge that they are not able to respond and connect me to a person that s not a good implementation of ai the bot may be as smart as they wanted to bought to be but i will need to call an agent and i will need to answer the same to any questions again which will be a waste of time and definitely a source of frustration so the real issue with ai cannot be deployed in silos and what we did with the platform and i mentioned that as one workforce and we ll go through more details obviously on thursday in our investor day and also during the engage next week a customer conference and introduce what is one workforce how we actually break down the silos and create a unified workforce which is a huge source for increased capacity flexibility and agility and that s the correct way to implement ai which is to infuse ai through the business processes to automate business processes and companies need to really focus on this as customer engagement specific ai it s not a generic ai that can be implemented in finance in hr rpa type of solution because the customer engagement industry have very unique processes that need to be automated and we re able to do that by putting da vinci which is our ai engine at the core of the platform so we can infuse their eyes through every application that we sell and customers can actually benefit from ai not just when they implement the bot but in every business process when they schedule when they hire when they do quality monitoring any of the business processes needs to be infused with ai and that s what they have in the verint platform tim horan oppenheimer and company analyst great i m looking forward to thursday and this just qualitatively on the overall demand environment dan bodner chief executive officer so at this point we definitely are looking and monitoring the macro environment to see if there is an impact on the customer engagement industry we haven t seen any impact that we can report at this point we as variant we live through recessions before we definitely have the experience how to manage the company recession we know we have very sticky software so renewal rates are pretty high during recessions and customers continue to focus on roi and sometimes even more so we definitely already are very focused on roi and using ai to automate but we haven t seen any signs other than what does reported is fx moved in q1 but we absorbed that into our guidance and our guidance reflecting the current spot rates we haven t seen anything that we can report today tim horan oppenheimer and company analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brian essex with goldman sachs you may proceed unknown speaker this is on for brian i was hoping you can talk about spending patterns across your verticals what are where are you seeing the most traction thanks dan bodner chief executive officer so we don t have a vertical strategy but because we have the leading vendors in almost in every vertical that has customer service we have developed over time all kind of specific offering for verticals so just to recap for everyone verint has 10 of the top 10 banks as customers nine of the top 10 insurance companies with customers eight of the top healthcare companies as our customers and so on in retail and so we are the leaders in each vertical and the reason why this is important to your question is a lot of the ais to my previous ai discussion ai is as good as the data that you have to develop the ai models and we have been working with these customers for two decades and have been enjoying we have access to that data and developing ai models and those animals are perfected ongoing in our cloud as we get more data and new data we have machine learning that learn those patterns and improve the ai and what we noticed is that in different verticals there is some differences in ai sorry in the data that drives different ai models so and that s interesting because you would think that customer service is customer service it doesn t really matter which industry but in each industry there are nuances there is some difference in language models in terminology and sometimes in service offering so we are able working with the leading companies in each industry and using that data we re able to continuously refine our offering to the different industries unknown speaker great thanks and then have you seen any impact from wage inflation are people looking to you all to try to bridge that capacity gap or do you think it s more a future capacity gap that you could ultimately fell dan bodner chief executive officer yes our customers really are struggling now with wage inflation combined with high attrition difficulty to hire they really are looking for hiring tools and we introduced last quarter a new hiring ai based hiring tools to improve the hiring process and also people working from home in the new hybrid environment and they need coaching they need real time assistance at home so there s a lot of changes that the pandemic and now the wage inflation combined are causing to our customers wage inflation is one of them and that s what causing people to want to deploy more bits right because they feel like they can deal with the growth in interaction by hiring more people it s expensive and it s hard so bots are really very much in favor but as i mentioned before as some of our customers deploy many boss they start to see that they are working in silos and now they re looking for tools to connect the bottom people into one workforce unknown speaker great thank you so much operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to matthew frankel for any closing remarks matthew frankel investor relations thank you operator and thank you to everyone for joining us today as a reminder we ll hold our virtual investor day on thursday and

nimbleness and adaptability are needed to be able to scale production up quickly within the dynamic aerospace and defense sectors changes to part specifications and quantities are frequent and often unpredictable as a result clients require a machining partner who can nimbly and quickly adapt to design and production changes as they occur and be capable to scale up to lights out manufacturing when needed aerospace and defense customers may prefer large machining operations said tony doan ceo of halcyon manufacturing an advanced itar registered and as 9100 is 9001 certified machining shop based in san jose california but size alone does not equate to capacity smaller shops can have an advantage when a client needs a machining partner to also be nimble and flexible for our clients the ability to adapt and problem solve is incredibly important as complex manufacturing requirements frequently evolve and change aerospace machining involves a lot of low volume high mix work the reality is not every machine shop wants to take on small orders or highly complex jobs a client needs a machining partner who really embraces this kind of work in addition to the high volume orders when evaluating the capacity of a precision machine shop the capability to respond to changes in specifications and production quickly becomes a key factor nowhere is this more acute than when an aerospace client has a priority aircraft on the ground aog machining order until the aog gets filled an aircraft will not be able to operate making response time incredibly important unfortunately an aog order is never predictable and can happen at any time halcyon manufacturing building capacity through cross training staff cross training is one way a machine shop can improve their ability to respond to unexpected and time sensitive machining needs such as aogs while today s machine shops are filled with a mix of high tech precision cnc equipment each requires trained staff to manage maintain and operate a lot of aerospace machine shops will assign an operator to a specific cnc machine said doan this can create a situation where a particular operator has to be available and not working on other orders to operate a given machine having the ability to move people from machine to machine as well as from line to line and from shift to shift without interruption enables a machine shop to respond to changes in demand more quickly at halcyon where they machine bar grade 6061 aluminum brass copper titanium stainless steel and plastics they have cross trained their entire staff to work across all their equipment to maximize their capability for scale up we have not only cross trained our team but we all work multiple shifts and we have the same controls throughout our shop said doan it makes it easy for our people to be able to move around as needed so when a client needs something over a weekend we don t have to completely rethink how we re going to schedule we can easily plug in people for surge hours or to increase our manpower as needed the company made the decision to further enhance their cross training through their selection of machining equipment unlike shops that purchase a variety of types and brands of cnc equipment over time halcyon intentionally purchases the same model of high end 5 axis cnc machine from doosan machine tools with fanuc controls as they expand this further reduces the learning curve for their staff halcyon manufacturing lights out manufacturing capability nimbleness and adaptability are also needed to be able to scale production up quickly some machine shops such as halcyon operate on a 24 7 basis enabling customers to connect with them outside of traditional office hours lights out manufacturing takes scaling up production to the next level said doan cnc operators can set up the equipment to run on its own without supervision overnight this lights out capability means smaller shops can maximize their capacity without adding more staff it starts with culture the mindset that a machining partner brings to precision aerospace machining is also critically important it starts with the culture of the shop and the problem solving mindset they bring to a project particularly for complex precision parts explained doan you also need a machining partner to be proactive by engaging early in the process an aerospace machine shop can anticipate and resolve machining issues before any parts are produced in a recent example halcyon had a customer bring them what appeared to be a simple part but could not find a machine shop that wanted to take the job the part had a 6 threaded shaft with a hex head there was an 832 thread across the outside diameter od of the shaft most lathes aren t able to cut those threads across six inches said doan we had to get creative since we could not use round stock which is generally used when cutting od threads the team determined how to form the threads while accounting for the growth that occurs when threads are formed on plate steel to meet the tight requirements for it to run on a cnc machine they also had to create a modified thread using a cut die to create a formed thread we took the challenge on and were able to meet the client s deadlines with parts that met spec when no one else could do it said doan it takes more than the equipment and know how it also means really having an appetite to take on these kinds of complex challenges nimbleness and adaptability in precision machining represents a key consideration for aerospace clients as they seek partners to provide solutions to their complex design problems and production scale up needs through cross training lights out manufacturing and a problem solving proactive mindset smaller machine shops are well equipped to meet the demand halcyonmfg com

washington a panel of experts convened by the us drug regulator on tuesday recommended the novavax covid 19 shot a late runner in the fight against the virus that could nonetheless play a role in overcoming vaccine hesitancy three vaccines are currently approved in the united states pfizer and moderna which are based on messenger rna and johnson and johnson which recently received a recommendation against broad use becase of links to a serious form of clotting experts voted 21 in favour of the novavax vaccine with none against and one abstention despite some concerns it may be linked to rare cases of heart inflammation the food and drug administration which called the meeting is expected to issue an emergency use authorization soon then another agency the centers for disease control and prevention will weigh in with guidance on how it should best be used maryland based novavax was an early frontrunner in the global vaccine race but fell behind after being hit by manufacturing and regulatory delays the us was one of the few major markets where it hasn t yet received authorization while the eu uk canada australia are among many that have already given it the green light officials hope that the shot which is based on lab grown viral proteins could provide an alternative for people still hesitant of the mrna technology it also doesn t have the same cold storage requirements as pfizer and moderna s shots there really is a population of patients who are willing to take this and not going to take existing vaccines i think it s pretty compelling said eric rubin an infectious disease specialist who participated in the meeting explaining his vote in favour of the various vaccine technologies mrna has been subject to the most misinformation efforts possible myocarditis link novavax s vaccine was found to be more than 90 per cent effective against symptomatic cases of the disease but its trial was conducted long before the currently circulating sub variants of omicron were dominant and the company may yet have to add a booster or update its shot what s more six cases of myocarditis an inflammation of the heart muscle were detected in the group that received the vaccine against one case in the placebo group in a trial of around 40 000 people novavax says there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between the cases of myocarditis and the vaccine such a link has been established with mrna vaccines but it only became apparent when they were used on millions of people in the real world rather than tens of thousands in a trial the fda voiced concern over the myocarditis link on friday and a warning is likely to be included on the eventual label earlier trading in novavax shares on nasdaq was halted pending the meeting known as a protein subunit vaccine novavax is administered in two doses it is based on a lab created version of the spikes that dot the surface of the coronavirus to evoke an immune response the company uses a modified spike gene inserted into another kind of virus called a baculovirus which is used to infect moth cells which then produce the spikes on their surface these spikes are harvested and assembled into nanoparticles which are injected into patients

san francisco and suzhou china june 7 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 2 study of mazdutide r d code ibi362 a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp 1r glucagon receptor gcgr dual agonist in chinese participants with overweight or obesity this study clinicaltrials gov nct04904913 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity a total of 248 subjects were randomized to receive 1 5 3 0 mg 1 5 3 0 4 5 mg or 2 0 4 0 6 0 mg of mazdutide or placebo subcutaneously and once weekly for 24 weeks the primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in body weight at week 24 a total of 230 participants 92 7 completed week 24 mazdutide demonstrated superior weight loss efficacy in chinese participants with overweight or obesity compared with placebo in a dose dependent manner after 24 weeks of treatment the least squares ls mean percent change absolute change from baseline in body weight were 7 21 6 35 kg on 3 0 mg 10 56 9 07 kg on 4 5 mg and 11 57 9 85 kg on 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 1 05 1 08 kg with placebo the treatment difference versus placebo in ls mean percent change from baseline were 8 26 on 3 0 mg 11 60 on 4 5 mg and 12 62 on 6 0 mg p 0 0001 for all comparisons the proportion of participants with 5 body weight loss from baseline was 58 1 3 0 mg 82 5 4 5 mg and 80 3 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 4 8 with placebo the proportion of participants with 10 body weight loss from baseline was 19 4 3 0 mg 49 2 4 5 mg and 50 8 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 0 with placebo meanwhile mazdutide markedly reduced body mass index waist circumference liver fat content and blood pressure lowered lipid transaminase and serum uric acid levels and improved insulin sensitivity delivering comprehensive metabolic benefits for participants with overweight or obesity in terms of safety mazdutide was well tolerated only one participant discontinued the treatment due to an adverse event which was not related to mazdutide as judged by the investigator the overall safety profile was similar to those observed in early phase development and with other glp 1 based agonists and co agonists the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events were diarrhea nausea and upper respiratory tract infection mostly mild or moderate in severity and transient professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated in recent years the prevalence of obesity in china has increased rapidly and resulted in the increase of the prevalence of diabetes fatty liver sleep disorders and cardiovascular diseases therefore effective and safe weight loss drugs are urgently needed we are pleased to see the exciting results of the phase 2 study of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity suggesting that mazdutide could potentially be the best in class agent the half year treatment of mazdutide achieved on average 12 6 weight reduction from baseline compared with placebo which was comparable to the most cutting edge weight loss drugs under development in the world the excellent efficacy of mazdutide in weight loss and multiple metabolic parameters truly reflects the advantages of weekly formulation based on dual incretin receptor agonists i am confident and looking forward to the success of mazdutide in the upcoming phase 3 study dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated the phase 2 study of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity achieved the primary and all key secondary endpoints while showing improvement on multiple metabolic parameters including blood pressure lipids transaminase and serum uric acid these results demonstrate the great utility value of glp 1r gcgr dual agonist further demonstrating the potential to be the best in class agent and paving solid foundation for further clinical development of note the auto injector has been used in the phase 2 studies greatly improving the quality of life and compliance of participants while demonstrating the quality and capability of domestic enterprises in device development and manufacturing we will actively promote the development of phase 3 clinical study of mazdutide and anticipate more clinical data later this year striving to provide more convenient user friendly effective and safe drug for overweight and obese population as soon as possible due to the outbreak of covid 19 the data are being collected and under further analysis the data disclosed in this press release may have some deviation from the final results about obesity china has the largest obese population in the world with obesity rate likely to increase obesity can lead to a range of complications or related diseases that impact life expectancy and lead to a decrease in quality of life in more severely obese patients the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease diabetes and certain tumors increase significantly obesity is a chronic disease that requires long term management and there is a lack of long term effective and safe treatments lifestyle intervention is the first choice and basic treatment for patients with overweight or obesity however a considerable percentage of patients fail to achieve the desired weight loss goal upon lifestyle intervention due to various reasons and may require pharmacological intervention traditional anti obesity drugs have limited weight loss effects and are associated with safety issues about mazdutide ibi362 innovent entered into a licensing agreement with eli lilly and company lilly for the development and potential commercialization of oxm3 also known as mazdutide a glp 1r and gcgr dual agonist in china in parallel lilly is developing oxm3 outside china mazdutide is a long acting synthetic peptide related to mammalian oxyntomodulin oxm which uses a fatty acid side chain to prolong the duration of action and allow once weekly administration mazdutide is thought to exert its biological effects by activating glp 1 receptor and glucagon receptor in human beings which improves glucose tolerance and induces weight loss mimicking the effects of endogenous oxyntomodulin in addition to the effects of glp 1 receptor agonists on promoting insulin secretion lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight mazdutide may also increase energy expenditure and improve hepatic fat metabolism through the activation of glucagon receptor the treatment of metabolic diseases by activating multiple metabolism related targets simultaneously is currently the

washington a panel of experts convened by the us drug regulator yesterday recommended the novavax covid 19 shot a late runner in the fight against the virus that could nonetheless play a role in overcoming vaccine hesitancy three vaccines are currently approved in the us pfizer and moderna which are based on messenger rna and johnson and johnson which recently received a recommendation against broad use because of links to a serious form of clotting experts voted 21 in favour of the novavax vaccine with none against and one abstention despite some concerns it may be linked to rare cases of heart inflammation the food and drug administration which called the meeting is expected to issue an emergency use authorisation soon then another agency the centers for disease control and prevention will weigh in with guidance on how it should best be used maryland based novavax was an early frontrunner in the global vaccine race but fell behind after being hit by manufacturing and regulatory delays the us was one of the few major markets where it hasnâ t yet received authorisation while the eu uk canada australia are among many that have already given it the green light officials hope that the shot which is based on lab grown viral proteins could provide an alternative for people still hesitant of the mrna technology it also doesnâ t have the same cold storage requirements as pfizer and modernaâ s shots â there really is a population of patients who are willing to take this and not going to take existing vaccines i think itâ s pretty compelling â said eric rubin an infectious disease specialist who participated in the meeting explaining his vote in favour of the various vaccine technologies mrna has been subject to the most misinformation efforts possible myocarditis link novavaxâ s vaccine was found to be more than 90 effective against symptomatic cases of the disease but its trial was conducted long before the currently circulating sub variants of omicron were dominant and the company may yet have to add a booster or update its shot whatâ s more six cases of myocarditis an inflammation of the heart muscle were detected in the group that received the vaccine against one case in the placebo group in a trial of around 40 000 people novavax says there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between the cases of myocarditis and the vaccine such a link has been established with mrna vaccines but it only became apparent when they were used on millions of people in the real world rather than tens of thousands in a trial the fda voiced concern over the myocarditis link on friday and a warning is likely to be included on the eventual label earlier trading in novavax shares on nasdaq was halted pending the meeting known as a protein subunit vaccine novavax is administered in two doses it is based on a lab created version of the spikes that dot the surface of the coronavirus to evoke an immune response the company uses a modified spike gene inserted into another kind of virus called a baculovirus which is used to infect moth cells which then produce the spikes on their surface these spikes are harvested and assembled into nanoparticles which are injected into patients a compound of soapbark tree is added to the vaccine to heighten the response â afp
shanghai and hong kong june 7 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the phase i stamina 001 trial to evaluate atg 037 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in australia the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety tolerability recommended phase ii dose and preliminary antitumor efficacy of atg 037 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor cd73 is an immune checkpoint mediator 1 that interferes with anti tumor immune responses by generating adenosine which leads to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment atg 037 can reverse adenosine mediated immunosuppression2 it has demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with icis and chemotherapy agents in preclinical studies this compound overcomes the hook effect that is common in anti cd73 antibodies in addition glp toxicology studies indicate the compound has a potentially wide therapeutic window while icis are widely used in the treatment of various cancers many patients have resistant or refractory disease which has created a large unmet need said dr ganessan kichenadasse principal investigator southern oncology clinical research unit in adelaide australia mounting evidence suggests that adenosine plays a critical role in suppressing anti tumor immunoactivity cd73 can convert adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine atg 037 an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor can block the generation of adenosine we are excited to be a part of the stamina 001 trial this phase i study brings together a group of highly experienced australian investigators to collaborate with antengene we are excited to assess the therapeutic potential of atg 037 for patients with solid tumors as a single agent as well the exploring the opportunity for benefit with the addition of an icis developing agents that can act in the tumor microenvironment to reverse immunosuppression is one of the key focus areas for antengene said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer preclinical data presented at the 2022 american association of cancer research annual meeting aacr 2022 showed that atg 037 had a stronger ability to restore t cell function in higher amp environments compared with anti cd73 monoclonal antibodies these data highlighted the potential therapeutic advantages of small molecule inhibitors of cd73 over blocking antibodies either as a monotherapy or in combination with other immune oncological treatments we have been very pleased with the drug s performance in preclinical studies and are hopeful that in this phase i study atg 037 can demonstrate the tolerability and signals of activity that will allow us to move forward into a broader development program we are very excited about the start of this first in human clinical trial and look forward to next steps with atg 037 about the stamina 001 trial the stamina 001 trial is a phase i multi center open label dose finding study of atg 037 monotherapy or combination therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors subjects will begin with two monotherapy cycles and then be allowed to receive the addition of pembrolizumab the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atg 037 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and or recommended phase ii dose rp2d and or optimal biological dose of atg 037 monotherapy and preliminary efficacy secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 as a phase i study there will be intensive safety monitoring throughout the trial about atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available highly selective small molecule that completely blocks the activity of cd73 cd73 an ecto 5 nucleotidase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine adenosine production leads to significant immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment now recognized as one of the most important immunomodulatory pathways in the tumor microenvironment many human tumors overexpress cd73 and this expression is frequently associated with poor prognosis blocking cd73 has been shown to be effective in controlling tumor growth and metastases and cd73 inhibitors may increase the therapeutic activity of icis and chemotherapy agents clinical data so far indicate that cd73 inhibitors add little additional toxicity to standard of care treatments about antengene antengene corporation limited

san francisco and suzhou china june 7 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 2 study of mazdutide r d code ibi362 a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp 1r glucagon receptor gcgr dual agonist in chinese participants with overweight or obesity this study clinicaltrials gov nct04904913 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity a total of 248 subjects were randomized to receive 1 5 3 0 mg 1 5 3 0 4 5 mg or 2 0 4 0 6 0 mg of mazdutide or placebo subcutaneously and once weekly for 24 weeks the primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in body weight at week 24 a total of 230 participants 92 7 completed week 24 mazdutide demonstrated superior weight loss efficacy in chinese participants with overweight or obesity compared with placebo in a dose dependent manner after 24 weeks of treatment the least squares ls mean percent change absolute change from baseline in body weight were 7 21 6 35 kg on 3 0 mg 10 56 9 07 kg on 4 5 mg and 11 57 9 85 kg on 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 1 05 1 08 kg with placebo the treatment difference versus placebo in ls mean percent change from baseline were 8 26 on 3 0 mg 11 60 on 4 5 mg and 12 62 on 6 0 mg p 0 0001 for all comparisons the proportion of participants with 5 body weight loss from baseline was 58 1 3 0 mg 82 5 4 5 mg and 80 3 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 4 8 with placebo the proportion of participants with 10 body weight loss from baseline was 19 4 3 0 mg 49 2 4 5 mg and 50 8 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 0 with placebo meanwhile mazdutide markedly reduced body mass index waist circumference liver fat content and blood pressure lowered lipid transaminase and serum uric acid levels and improved insulin sensitivity delivering comprehensive metabolic benefits for participants with overweight or obesity in terms of safety mazdutide was well tolerated only one participant discontinued the treatment due to an adverse event which was not related to mazdutide as judged by the investigator the overall safety profile was similar to those observed in early phase development and with other glp 1 based agonists and co agonists the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events were diarrhea nausea and upper respiratory tract infection mostly mild or moderate in severity and transient professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated in recent years the prevalence of obesity in china has increased rapidly and resulted in the increase of the prevalence of diabetes fatty liver sleep disorders and cardiovascular diseases therefore effective and safe weight loss drugs are urgently needed we are pleased to see the exciting results of the phase 2 study of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity suggesting that mazdutide could potentially be the best in class agent the half year treatment of mazdutide achieved on average 12 6 weight reduction from baseline compared with placebo which was comparable to the most cutting edge weight loss drugs under development in the world the excellent efficacy of mazdutide in weight loss and multiple metabolic parameters truly reflects the advantages of weekly formulation based on dual incretin receptor agonists i am confident and looking forward to the success of mazdutide in the upcoming phase 3 study dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated the phase 2 study of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity achieved the primary and all key secondary endpoints while showing improvement on multiple metabolic parameters including blood pressure lipids transaminase and serum uric acid these results demonstrate the great utility value of glp 1r gcgr dual agonist further demonstrating the potential to be the best in class agent and paving solid foundation for further clinical development of note the auto injector has been used in the phase 2 studies greatly improving the quality of life and compliance of participants while demonstrating the quality and capability of domestic enterprises in device development and manufacturing we will actively promote the development of phase 3 clinical study of mazdutide and anticipate more clinical data later this year striving to provide more convenient user friendly effective and safe drug for overweight and obese population as soon as possible due to the outbreak of covid 19 the data are being collected and under further analysis the data disclosed in this press release may have some deviation from the final results about obesity china has the largest obese population in the world with obesity rate likely to increase obesity can lead to a range of complications or related diseases that impact life expectancy and lead to a decrease in quality of life in more severely obese patients the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease diabetes and certain tumors increase significantly obesity is a chronic disease that requires long term management and there is a lack of long term effective and safe treatments lifestyle intervention is the first choice and basic treatment for patients with overweight or obesity however a considerable percentage of patients fail to achieve the desired weight loss goal upon lifestyle intervention due to various reasons and may require pharmacological intervention traditional anti obesity drugs have limited weight loss effects and are associated with safety issues about mazdutide ibi362 innovent entered into a licensing agreement with eli lilly and company lilly for the development and potential commercialization of oxm3 also known as mazdutide a glp 1r and gcgr dual agonist in china in parallel lilly is developing oxm3 outside china mazdutide is a long acting synthetic peptide related to mammalian oxyntomodulin oxm which uses a fatty acid side chain to prolong the duration of action and allow once weekly administration mazdutide is thought to exert its biological effects by activating glp 1 receptor and glucagon receptor in human beings which improves glucose tolerance and induces weight loss mimicking the effects of endogenous oxyntomodulin in addition to the effects of glp 1 receptor agonists on promoting insulin secretion lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight mazdutide may also increase energy expenditure and improve hepatic fat metabolism through the activation of glucagon receptor the treatment of metabolic diseases by activating multiple metabolism related targets simultaneously is currently the

san francisco and suzhou china june 7 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 2 study of mazdutide r d code ibi362 a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp 1r glucagon receptor gcgr dual agonist in chinese participants with overweight or obesity this study clinicaltrials gov nct04904913 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity a total of 248 subjects were randomized to receive 1 5 3 0 mg 1 5 3 0 4 5 mg or 2 0 4 0 6 0 mg of mazdutide or placebo subcutaneously and once weekly for 24 weeks the primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in body weight at week 24 a total of 230 participants 92 7 completed week 24 mazdutide demonstrated superior weight loss efficacy in chinese participants with overweight or obesity compared with placebo in a dose dependent manner after 24 weeks of treatment the least squares ls mean percent change absolute change from baseline in body weight were 7 21 6 35 kg on 3 0 mg 10 56 9 07 kg on 4 5 mg and 11 57 9 85 kg on 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 1 05 1 08 kg with placebo the treatment difference versus placebo in ls mean percent change from baseline were 8 26 on 3 0 mg 11 60 on 4 5 mg and 12 62 on 6 0 mg p the proportion of participants with 5 body weight loss from baseline was 58 1 3 0 mg 82 5 4 5 mg and 80 3 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 4 8 with placebo the proportion of participants with 10 body weight loss from baseline was 19 4 3 0 mg 49 2 4 5 mg and 50 8 6 0 mg with mazdutide compared with 0 with placebo meanwhile mazdutide markedly reduced body mass index waist circumference liver fat content and blood pressure lowered lipid transaminase and serum uric acid levels and improved insulin sensitivity delivering comprehensive metabolic benefits for participants with overweight or obesity in terms of safety mazdutide was well tolerated only one participant discontinued the treatment due to an adverse event which was not related to mazdutide as judged by the investigator the overall safety profile was similar to those observed in early phase development and with other glp 1 based agonists and co agonists the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events were diarrhea nausea and upper respiratory tract infection mostly mild or moderate in severity and transient professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated in recent years the prevalence of obesity in china has increased rapidly and resulted in the increase of the prevalence of diabetes fatty liver sleep disorders and cardiovascular diseases therefore effective and safe weight loss drugs are urgently needed we are pleased to see the exciting results of the phase 2 study of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity suggesting that mazdutide could potentially be the best in class agent the half year treatment of mazdutide achieved on average 12 6 weight reduction from baseline compared with placebo which was comparable to the most cutting edge weight loss drugs under development in the world the excellent efficacy of mazdutide in weight loss and multiple metabolic parameters truly reflects the advantages of weekly formulation based on dual incretin receptor agonists i am confident and looking forward to the success of mazdutide in the upcoming phase 3 study dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated the phase 2 study of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity achieved the primary and all key secondary endpoints while showing improvement on multiple metabolic parameters including blood pressure lipids transaminase and serum uric acid these results demonstrate the great utility value of glp 1r gcgr dual agonist further demonstrating the potential to be the best in class agent and paving solid foundation for further clinical development of note the auto injector has been used in the phase 2 studies greatly improving the quality of life and compliance of participants while demonstrating the quality and capability of domestic enterprises in device development and manufacturing we will actively promote the development of phase 3 clinical study of mazdutide and anticipate more clinical data later this year striving to provide more convenient user friendly effective and safe drug for overweight and obese population as soon as possible due to the outbreak of covid 19 the data are being collected and under further analysis the data disclosed in this press release may have some deviation from the final results about obesity china has the largest obese population in the world with obesity rate likely to increase obesity can lead to a range of complications or related diseases that impact life expectancy and lead to a decrease in quality of life in more severely obese patients the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease diabetes and certain tumors increase significantly obesity is a chronic disease that requires long term management and there is a lack of long term effective and safe treatments lifestyle intervention is the first choice and basic treatment for patients with overweight or obesity however a considerable percentage of patients fail to achieve the desired weight loss goal upon lifestyle intervention due to various reasons and may require pharmacological intervention traditional anti obesity drugs have limited weight loss effects and are associated with safety issues about mazdutide ibi362 innovent entered into a licensing agreement with eli lilly and company lilly for the development and potential commercialization of oxm3 also known as mazdutide a glp 1r and gcgr dual agonist in china in parallel lilly is developing oxm3 outside china mazdutide is a long acting synthetic peptide related to mammalian oxyntomodulin oxm which uses a fatty acid side chain to prolong the duration of action and allow once weekly administration mazdutide is thought to exert its biological effects by activating glp 1 receptor and glucagon receptor in human beings which improves glucose tolerance and induces weight loss mimicking the effects of endogenous oxyntomodulin in addition to the effects of glp 1 receptor agonists on promoting insulin secretion lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight mazdutide may also increase energy expenditure and improve hepatic fat metabolism through the activation of glucagon receptor the treatment of metabolic diseases by activating multiple metabolism related targets simultaneously is currently the worldwide trend in drug

the president has called on congress to act now to reduce gun violence and save lives the white house said this legislation would make significant progress toward delivering on that call to action the package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things in the house speaker nancy pelosi will bring a more sweeping package of eight related gun control bills for a vote wednesday it s not expected to advance in the evenly divided senate murphy is part of a small bipartisan group of senators working to strike some type of deal to get 10 republican votes for gun legislation meanwhile president joe biden met with sen chris murphy a connecticut democrat on tuesday to discuss gun control negotiations in the senate following the new york mass shooting and a may 24 massacre in uvalde texas in which 19 schoolchildren and two teachers were gunned down extremism is still a sad reality in america we have to do everything to make america safer said dick durbin an illinois democrat and chairman of the judiciary committee buffalo new york was an illustration on why that s necessary witnesses during the hearing also predicted that the spread of white supremacy in the united states will increase acts of domestic terrorism my mom s life mattered he said your actions here will tell us if and how much it mattered to you whitfield talked about his mother and how it s impossible for his family to grasp that she was taken from them by someone full of so much hate it comes under the banner of white supremacy said garnell whitfield jr who lost his mother ruth when the 18 year old white supremacist traveled to a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo on may 14 and killed 10 black people the gunman in buffalo new york was motivated by the great replacement theory a racist conspiracy theory that claims growing numbers of immigrants and people of color will lead to the extinction of the white race according to the national immigration forum washington the son of a black woman shot and killed by a white supremacist begged members of the u s senate judiciary committee on tuesday to take action against such domestic terrorism no longer a fringe theory at the senate hearing two witnesses michael german of the brennan center for justice and robert pape a political science professor at the university of chicago warned senators that while the great replacement theory is not new it is no longer a fringe idea they said it has become mainstream because of media coverage on outlets such as fox news as well as claims by right wing politicians we need to prepare for potential political violence in the future said pape who is also the director of the chicago project on security and threats the department of homeland security issued a notice tuesday that stated because of the recent violent attacks against communities of color in coming months we expect the threat environment to become more dynamic as several high profile events could be exploited to justify acts of violence against a range of possible targets these targets could include public gatherings faith based institutions schools racial and religious minorities government facilities and personnel u s critical infrastructure the media and perceived ideological opponents the dhs summary said threat actors have recently mobilized to violence due to factors such as personal grievances reactions to current events and adherence to violent extremist ideologies including racially or ethnically motivated or anti government anti authority violent extremism the dhs summary said jan 6 attack pape said his research has shown that a key characteristic of the more than 800 people charged with participating in the jan 6 attack on the u s capitol is they are middle class whites residing in counties with the most loss of white population share exactly who would most likely fear the great replacement as described by prominent political and media leaders he said the white supremacist attack in buffalo was a prime example he added that the last time the u s saw middle class white americans involved in political violence was during the second expansion of the ku klux klan in the 1920s durbin said mass shootings targeting places of worship and communities of color are increasing adding that the first hearing he called on domestic terrorism was 10 years ago after a sikh temple was targeted seven worshipers died durbin asked pape what role social media plays as well as the easy access to firearms used in mass shootings weapons have combined with volatile ideas and beliefs in the mainstream pape said you ve got the combination of these two which is why we re seeing many more of these events in the united states this is a deadly cocktail that promises more violence coming forward pape added that media figures and politicians that either directly or indirectly embrace the great replacement theory are often rewarded from high cable news ratings to campaign donations pape said mass shootings related to the great replacement theory include the 2019 tree of life synagogue shooting in pittsburgh where 11 jewish worshipers were killed and the 2019 el paso shooting in a hispanic neighborhood where 23 latinos were killed while shopping at walmart german a former f b i agent said there needs to be a federal record of domestic terrorism adding that it s not something the department of justice tracks the failure to acknowledge the organized and interstate nature of violent white supremacists and far right militant groups forfeits intelligence that could be used to prepare for and perhaps prevent future attacks he said sen amy klobuchar a minnesota democrat also asked one of the witnesses justin herdman a former u s attorney for the northern district of ohio what role social media played in the spread of misinformation it certainly has not played a positive role in spreading disinformation and radicalizing people who would do harm to others herdman said sen mazie hirono a hawaii democrat said that a large factor in domestic terrorism is the accessibility of assault weapons free speech concerns the top republican on the committee sen chuck grassley of iowa said the threat of domestic terrorism is always shifting and can also include political violence we have to condemn all political violence he said adding that at the same time we have to protect free speech he pointed to the 2017 shooting at the congressional baseball game where republicans were specifically targeted by a left wing political activist as an example of extreme political violence sen marsha blackburn a tennessee republican also raised concerns about political free speech she asked one of the witnesses jonathan turley a professor at george washington university law school how law enforcement can make determinations between extreme speech and free speech the concern is if you tie a particular ideology to the f b i turley said adding that the u s has persecuted people for being communists and marxists senate republicans in late may blocked a bill that would require federal agencies to monitor domestic terrorism incidents including those related to white supremacy republican sen rand paul of kentucky said the bill would brand police and military service members as white supremacists sen cory booker a new jersey democrat said at the hearing that he was worried about the fate of the country on that fateful day in buffalo we realized the danger of allowing hatred in any form in our country to fester he said it tears at the overall fabric of our democracy will we be better at being a multicultural nation
shanghai and hong kong june 7 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the phase i stamina 001 trial to evaluate atg 037 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in australia the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety tolerability recommended phase ii dose and preliminary antitumor efficacy of atg 037 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor cd73 is an immune checkpoint mediator 1 that interferes with anti tumor immune responses by generating adenosine which leads to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment atg 037 can reverse adenosine mediated immunosuppression2 it has demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with icis and chemotherapy agents in preclinical studies this compound overcomes the hook effect that is common in anti cd73 antibodies in addition glp toxicology studies indicate the compound has a potentially wide therapeutic window while icis are widely used in the treatment of various cancers many patients have resistant or refractory disease which has created a large unmet need said dr ganessan kichenadasse principal investigator southern oncology clinical research unit in adelaide australia mounting evidence suggests that adenosine plays a critical role in suppressing anti tumor immunoactivity cd73 can convert adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine atg 037 an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor can block the generation of adenosine we are excited to be a part of the stamina 001 trial this phase i study brings together a group of highly experienced australian investigators to collaborate with antengene we are excited to assess the therapeutic potential of atg 037 for patients with solid tumors as a single agent as well the exploring the opportunity for benefit with the addition of an icis developing agents that can act in the tumor microenvironment to reverse immunosuppression is one of the key focus areas for antengene said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer preclinical data presented at the 2022 american association of cancer research annual meeting aacr 2022 showed that atg 037 had a stronger ability to restore t cell function in higher amp environments compared with anti cd73 monoclonal antibodies these data highlighted the potential therapeutic advantages of small molecule inhibitors of cd73 over blocking antibodies either as a monotherapy or in combination with other immune oncological treatments we have been very pleased with the drug s performance in preclinical studies and are hopeful that in this phase i study atg 037 can demonstrate the tolerability and signals of activity that will allow us to move forward into a broader development program we are very excited about the start of this first in human clinical trial and look forward to next steps with atg 037 about the stamina 001 trial the stamina 001 trial is a phase i multi center open label dose finding study of atg 037 monotherapy or combination therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors subjects will begin with two monotherapy cycles and then be allowed to receive the addition of pembrolizumab the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atg 037 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and or recommended phase ii dose rp2d and or optimal biological dose of atg 037 monotherapy and preliminary efficacy secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 as a phase i study there will be intensive safety monitoring throughout the trial about atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available highly selective small molecule that completely blocks the activity of cd73 cd73 an ecto 5 nucleotidase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine adenosine production leads to significant immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment now recognized as one of the most important immunomodulatory pathways in the tumor microenvironment many human tumors overexpress cd73 and this expression is frequently associated with poor prognosis blocking cd73 has been shown to be effective in controlling tumor growth and metastases and cd73 inhibitors may increase the therapeutic activity of icis and chemotherapy agents clinical data so far indicate that cd73 inhibitors add little additional toxicity to standard of care treatments about antengene antengene corporation limited

shanghai and hong kong june 7 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the phase i stamina 001 trial to evaluate atg 037 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in australia the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety tolerability recommended phase ii dose and preliminary antitumor efficacy of atg 037 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor cd73 is an immune checkpoint mediator 1 that interferes with anti tumor immune responses by generating adenosine which leads to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment atg 037 can reverse adenosine mediated immunosuppression2 it has demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with icis and chemotherapy agents in preclinical studies this compound overcomes the hook effect that is common in anti cd73 antibodies in addition glp toxicology studies indicate the compound has a potentially wide therapeutic window while icis are widely used in the treatment of various cancers many patients have resistant or refractory disease which has created a large unmet need said dr ganessan kichenadasse principal investigator southern oncology clinical research unit in adelaide australia mounting evidence suggests that adenosine plays a critical role in suppressing anti tumor immunoactivity cd73 can convert adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine atg 037 an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor can block the generation of adenosine we are excited to be a part of the stamina 001 trial this phase i study brings together a group of highly experienced australian investigators to collaborate with antengene we are excited to assess the therapeutic potential of atg 037 for patients with solid tumors as a single agent as well the exploring the opportunity for benefit with the addition of an icis developing agents that can act in the tumor microenvironment to reverse immunosuppression is one of the key focus areas for antengene said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer preclinical data presented at the 2022 american association of cancer research annual meeting aacr 2022 showed that atg 037 had a stronger ability to restore t cell function in higher amp environments compared with anti cd73 monoclonal antibodies these data highlighted the potential therapeutic advantages of small molecule inhibitors of cd73 over blocking antibodies either as a monotherapy or in combination with other immune oncological treatments we have been very pleased with the drug s performance in preclinical studies and are hopeful that in this phase i study atg 037 can demonstrate the tolerability and signals of activity that will allow us to move forward into a broader development program we are very excited about the start of this first in human clinical trial and look forward to next steps with atg 037 about the stamina 001 trial the stamina 001 trial is a phase i multi center open label dose finding study of atg 037 monotherapy or combination therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors subjects will begin with two monotherapy cycles and then be allowed to receive the addition of pembrolizumab the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atg 037 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and or recommended phase ii dose rp2d and or optimal biological dose of atg 037 monotherapy and preliminary efficacy secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 as a phase i study there will be intensive safety monitoring throughout the trial about atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available highly selective small molecule that completely blocks the activity of cd73 cd73 an ecto 5 nucleotidase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine adenosine production leads to significant immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment now recognized as one of the most important immunomodulatory pathways in the tumor microenvironment many human tumors overexpress cd73 and this expression is frequently associated with poor prognosis blocking cd73 has been shown to be effective in controlling tumor growth and metastases and cd73 inhibitors may increase the therapeutic activity of icis and chemotherapy agents clinical data so far indicate that cd73 inhibitors add little additional toxicity to standard of care treatments about antengene antengene corporation limited

immaculate 1979 ford bronco free wheeling features massive fuel injected v8 this stunning 1979 ford bronco free wheeling has a few modern upgrades to enhance its retro appeal while big bodied broncos have plenty of appeal as is many enthusiasts have also fallen in love with the somewhat obscure free wheeling package as of late which is essentially just an appearance upgrade that was available for a handful of blue oval products back in that era this trend has led to some folks adding the free wheeling package s signature colorful stripes to vehicles that didn t come with them in the first place because the retro look just fits these suvs so perfectly regardless this 1979 ford bronco free wheeling recently built by firehouse vintage vehicles in statesville north carolina is one of the nicest examples we ve ever laid eyes on this particular 1979 ford bronco free wheeling isn t stock by any measure but it has been modified in an extremely tasteful period correct manner with some modern drivetrain bits thrown in for good measure on the outside the big suv features flawless body and paintwork shiny enough to use as a mirror and perfectly complemented by those signature stripes the second gen bronco rolls on a set of equally vintage looking chrome wheels wrapped with beefy 35 inch bfgoodrich tires enhanced by a four inch lift for the perfect stance too thankfully firehouse also left the interior mostly alone because there s too much retro goodness here to change anything in our humble opinion thus the cabin is still full of lots of faux wood trim captain s chairs and seats with plaid inserts though this particular bronco also has some modern amenities like air conditioning and a sport steering wheel mechanically speaking this 1979 bronco has more than enough juice to get it going thanks to a massive ford 460 cubic inch v8 under the hood that big mill has been treated to a holley sniper fuel injection setup to make it extra reliable and efficient or at least as efficient as one of these monster motors can possible be firehouse notes that this big beautiful bronco build is for sale but hasn t listed any sort of price of course that means that the ages old rule of if you have to ask you can t afford it probably applies here but that won t stop us from admiring it from afar photos firehouse vintage vehicles
a recent poll of likely voters in el paso county and colorado springs found nearly all who rent think local housing costs are a significant problem and nearly half of all homeowners surveyed agreed the colorado springs chamber of commerce edc told county commissioners tuesday in december the chamber commissioned a poll of likely voters in the county and city to find out what local issues deeply concerned them its president and ceo johnna reeder kleymeyer said housing was a top answer she said it was unclear how many people were surveyed poll results presented tuesday show residents with household incomes of 100 000 a year or less were more likely to find it difficult to find affordable housing in colorado springs eighty nine percent of those surveyed with an income of 50 000 or less a year said housing costs created a big problem in finding affordable housing while 71 of residents earning between 50 000 and 100 000 annually agreed only slightly less than half 49 of those surveyed with a household income of 100 000 or more a year said they thought it was a problem i don t know about you but that blows my mind reeder kleymeyer said that s our new employee that s our recent college graduates that s our nurses that s our teachers that s our military families they are what she and other affordable housing advocates called missing middle earners they re people who make between 60 and 150 of the area s median income in this case residents with household incomes of between 50 000 and 100 000 a year missing middle earners increasingly struggle to afford satisfactory housing within the region s existing housing inventory said andrea barlow a member of the colorado springs housing building association s executive committee and the housing market in the colorado springs area has reached record breaking numbers a report from the pikes peak association of realtors released last week showed the median price of single family homes that sold in may climbed to a record high 487 000 the gazette previously reported that s more than the 484 450 mark set in april the report said and it s over 160 000 more than what would be considered an affordable purchase price for buyers earning 100 of the area median income or those earning around 64 712 a year according to the data presented by housing advocates an affordable home purchase price for those households is about 325 000 and affordable rent is about 1 618 per month barlow said for those earning 80 of the area median income or 51 769 an affordable home purchase price is about 256 000 and rent around 1 294 a month for those in the 60 range earning 38 377 a year an affordable home is around 191 000 and rent about 970 a month limited housing stock rising costs of business more remote workers an influx of new residents and people opposed to building more multi family housing in their neighborhoods are some contributing factors to the crunch housing advocates said ann kidd broker and owner of true north realty and chairwoman of the pikes peak association of realtors highlighted the housing stock shortage she told commissioners a client of hers searching for a 250 000 home in el paso county this week found only two on the market that fit their criteria after raising the purchase price to 350 000 only 11 homes in all el paso county were available we are in crisis mode here i have nothing to show buyers that are coming to the door kidd said sign up for free news alerts stay in the know on the stories that affect you the most sign up for free view all of our newsletters success thank you for subscribing to our newsletter view all of our newsletters laura nelson executive director of the apartment association of southern colorado said rental units are a very important part of this missing middle yet rents are high and supply is low in the second quarter of 2022 there is only a 5 vacancy rate in rental units or roughly 2 000 units in all of colorado springs she said the average rent is 1 500 a month that was with adding 228 units in the first quarter of 2022 she said we added 2 000 units last year the demand just keeps coming millennials between 26 and 41 years old and older members of generation z are driving demand nelson said because they re less likely to want to buy a home since they change jobs more frequently than older earners baby boomers who are retiring and choosing to live in rental properties and remote workers who moved to colorado springs from more expensive cities like denver are also driving up demand fewer multihousing options are on the market as well because people are generally disapproving of building new multifamily housing units near their neighborhoods nelson said a rental housing unit doesn t necessarily drive down the rate of their homes she said we haven t seen home prices drop with any addition of apartments in any area some developers like darsey nicklasson and her company dhn development are working to increase the availability of affordable market rate multifamily housing in the area when she found her own employees were having trouble paying their rents or finding affordable places to live nicklasson wanted to build more multifamily housing units and charge the lowest amount possible for them she said her company bought two pieces of land in southeast colorado springs where they plan to build two multifamily housing units with 373 total for rent apartments she said the apartments will offer one to four bedrooms to better accommodate middle earner families who are being priced out of the market the company will own the units for 10 years to control rents she said the units will cost 339 000 each to build expected rents are 1 600 a month between the 100 to 120 of area median income range the cost is higher than what might be expected because of a 30 increase in construction labor and materials and set development and general contractor fees constant regulatory increases constant price increases there s nothing i can do about that she said what i can do is set those rents and do our best to maintain those rents by minimizing operating costs and yet still provide a good place to live but the county can build itself out of this crisis said kevin walker a volunteer with the housing and building association there is no other solution but to build our way out of this he said if we want to make an impact on housing affordability we ve got to be able to build more houses and moderate that price issue other ideas for solutions include lobbying for a 40 year mortgage and working on lumber and other tariffs at the federal level among others at the state level making the best use of available federal american rescue plan act funds dedicated to housing and increasing tax credits among others and at the local level revising the county s master development plan to allow for more density and flexibility support annexations of especially enclaves and near enclaves and encouraging and

the u s supreme court found in 2008 that the second amendment protects individual gun possession for traditional uses such as self protection in the home a 2010 opinion expanded those protections to the states jim leach said he does not disagree with legalizing guns for hunting and protection in the home but the supreme court opinions laid a foundation for opposition to any restrictions on guns we re talking about semiautomatic weapons automatic weapons bump stocks guns that you know you can shoot dozens of bullets then reload in a second and kill the kinds of people we see killed on almost a weekly basis recently he said the supreme court s 2008 heller opinion was written by antonin scalia who noted that lawmakers could still impose regulations such as restricting sales and types of weapons and denying gun possession to felons and the mentally ill but leach said legislators in congress and certain states won t do that for fear of retribution south dakota s legislature considered a proposal in 2013 to deny gun rights to people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others the bill didn t make it past the first committee hearing our legislatures seem to be united in being terrified of the gun lobby and it s a sad state of affairs when even the most common sense restrictions are not even on the table cannot even be reasonably discussed he said the u s supreme court heard arguments in november on a century old gun law in new york that opinion has not yet been released and several challenges to other state laws are waiting to be heard

tokyo japan japanese prime minister fumio kishida is making plans to attend a north atlantic treaty organization nato summit to discuss russia s invasion of ukraine to be held in late june while kishida has repeatedly condemned russia in what he described as a war crime against ukraine attending the nato summit would be an unusually aggressive stance for a japanese prime minister as japan and russia have wrangled over decades old territorial disputes japanese leaders have previously maintained a careful line in their relations with russia as the nato summit will take place on 29th and 30th june in the spanish capital madrid it would likely overlap with the campaign for japanese upper house elections to be held on 10th july kishida is expected to make a final decision later accounting for japan s political situation nato has invited japan to the summit along with its partners in the asia pacific region which include australia new zealand and south korea kishida s attendance at the summit would deliver a strong message of international solidarity with ukraine according to observers

dax30 14556 62 97 19 0 66 by greg peel shock and awe given the current inflation pressures in the economy and the still very low level of interest rates the board decided to move by 50 basis points today the board expects to take further steps in the process of normalising monetary conditions in australia over the months ahead the size and timing of future interest rate increases will be guided by the incoming data and the board s assessment of the outlook for inflation and the labour market the board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation in australia returns to target over time after wall street had closed slightly higher yesterday morning and the futures were showing down a mere 5 points it was clear the asx was in for a quiet period in the lead up to the rba decision at 2 30pm except that the asx200 was down 50 points in the first half hour us futures had turned lower but it appears as if an uneasy feeling of dread had crept across the market around half of economists were forecasting the rba would go a full 40 points rate hike when only a bit more than a third said 25 a couple of fools even suggested 50 points by 2 30pm the index was already down 65 points the driving force were the banks never mind the benefit of increased net interest margins a rate hike and particularly a 40 points rate hike would bring australian households are already suffering from soaring food and fuel prices wages not keeping pace with inflation and household debt to income levels at historical highs so all australians need right now is a big jump in their variable mortgage payments when the rba statement was released the index immediately plunged to be down 124 points there was not much reprieve thereafter the financials sector closed down 2 3 not the biggest percentage move on the day but by far the most powerful technology fell 3 0 mostly because apple announced it was jumping on the bnpl bandwagon sending zip co zip down 14 4 to be the worst index performer on the day along with its peers real estate fell 2 9 as higher bond rates undermine reit dividends the aussie ten year yield rose 7 points to 3 55 the two year jumped 17 points to 2 76 consumer discretionary fell 2 3 with consumers forced to lock down their wallets even staples fell 1 6 the resource sectors tried manfully to hold on but in the end materials closed down 0 2 and energy 0 3 all sectors closed in the red the question now is will the rba do it again next month the board expects to take further steps in the process of normalising monetary conditions in australia over the months ahead another 50 pointer the size and timing of future interest rate increases will be guided by the incoming data anz bank economists for one who were in the 40 points camp suggest a 50 pointer in august is more likely than july given the june quarter cpi result will be known by then otherwise there s only monthly jobs numbers this implies only 25 in july but we know the rba is now on a tear to fight inflation nothing should really be that surprising a lot of potential buyers would have just stood aside and let it happen yesterday this morning the futures are up 45 points grim determination only three weeks after an earnings report that sent wall street into a tailspin us target downgraded its margin guidance last night the prior shock of weak june quarter earnings guidance was all about lockdown suitable inventory the chain couldn t shift it was stuck with trackie daks up to the eyeballs and garden lounges were clogging the aisles the only way to move it is to discount the dow fell 270 points from the open target s not a dow stock there is a wider implication yet after falling sharply early target clawed its way back to close down only 2 3 indeed wall street spent all session recovering and then pushing higher there will be no surprise when the fed hikes by 50 points next week nor any surprise when it follows up in july september remains up in the air no august meeting but wall street is coming to the conclusion that will probably be 50 as well this is very bad news for growth stocks but the nasdaq rallied 0 9 last night as did the s p500 the bottom line is most of those growth stocks had fallen as far as 60 70 or even 80 year to date how much further can they fall investors are looking for bargains and it didn t hurt that the us ten year yield slipped back below 3 last night by contrast the energy sector is up almost 70 year to date yet last night the sector again outperformed the index in rising a further 3 many on wall street remain convinced the market can continue to rally at least in the near term thereafter it likely depends on the trajectory of inflation plenty still believe the 2022 low is not yet in commodities spot

amid the most competitive job market in recent history numerous banks last year granted special compensation to their ceos and other high ranking executives in an effort to persuade them not to leave nearly one quarter of 59 large and midsize banks reported such awards in their latest proxy statements according to an analysis this spring by the consulting firm compensation advisory partners the special awards ranged in value from 100 000 to 52 6 million of the 14 banks that granted them 10 companies cited retention as at least one of the reasons it did so doling out such prizes delivers a strong message to chief executives and other corporate leaders who may or may not be currently engaged in employment discussions elsewhere said kelly malafis a founding partner at compensation advisory partners sometimes the individuals who get these awards are not even necessarily looking for a new job said malafis whose firm reviewed executive compensation packages at banks with at least 10 billion of assets but the management team and the compensation committee want to signal that they are important to the organization and hopefully shut down those discussions before they happen she said the battle for talent in banking which was facing a skills deficit even before the covid 19 pandemic disrupted the workforce continues to rage across much of the industry to combat hiring and retention difficulties banks are raising wages and salaries reskilling existing employees and accommodating employees growing demand for hybrid or remote jobs it s what we saw last summer times 10 said cameron boyd director of the financial services practice at the executive search firm smith wilkinson which works primarily with community and regional banks the market simply could not be any tighter at the c suite level retention awards are one way to encourage key executives to stick around when they might be tempted to retire or leave for another job said adam eckels the founder and ceo of aj consultants an executive search firm in kingston pennsylvania that works with banks credit unions and fintechs to fill open positions we re seeing a lot of premeditated stuff before a person says they are unhappy eckels said there s a plan as to how to keep them happy engaged and knowing what the next step is in most instances the awards should work in terms of hanging onto key talent eckels said it s very hard for somebody to walk away from a large guaranteed chunk of cash or stock compensation he said they call it golden handcuffs and they call it that for a good reason the 14 banks that made retention awards in 2021 range in size from banking giants jpmorgan chase and bank of america to regional banks such as citizens financial group in providence rhode island and community banks such as renasant corp in tupelo mississippi different banks took different approaches some awards were handed out as cash payments while others were structured as time vested restricted stock units or performance based stock units or as some combination of those award types the largest retention award went to jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon who last summer received stock options worth 52 6 million according to the company s most recent proxy statement the options have a 10 year term and cannot be exercised until at least mid 2026 the decision reflects the board s desire for dimon 66 to lead the company for several more years and reflects the unique inflection point in tenure and the importance of his continued leadership and support of the firm s succession plans according to the proxy statement dimon s award and a 27 9 million award to jpmorgan chief operating officer daniel pinto are outliers in comparison with the smaller awards given by other banks bank of america awarded 7 2 million in restricted stock units to vice chair and former chief financial officer paul donofrio and 2 4 million in rsus to current cfo alastair borthwick industry news bank ceos who got the heftiest raises last year the chief executives of keycorp comerica cullen frost first republic and bank of america all received pay bumps of between 31 and 64 in 2021 here s a look at the industry s top 10 finishers june 6 the charlotte north carolina company said in its proxy statement that the awards are based on record 2021 performance and the ongoing criticality of both men to the company in future years to receive full payment of the awards which were granted in february of this year both donofrio and borthwick must remain employed at bank of america through a four year back loaded vesting period that grants 50 of the awards in february 2025 and the remaining 50 in february 2026 the proxy statement said at old national bancorp in evansville indiana the executive leadership team including ceo jim ryan received retention awards for 2021 in part to motivate them to achieve performance and cost savings goals related to old national s recent merger with first midwest bancorp in chicago but also to support retention of certain leaders the proxy statement said the value of the old national awards which were distributed in cash and performance based stock units ranged from 628 000 to 5 3 million according to compensation advisory partners analysis atlantic union bankshares in richmond virginia recognized chief operating officer maria tedesco with a 250 000 retention award in the form of restricted stock the company cited tedesco s leadership and performance but also wanted to incentivize her to stay with the bank meanwhile bank of hawaii in honolulu gave awards to four members of its executive team citing an uptick in competition for banking executive expertise in the local marketplace its proxy statement said the awards to chief banking officer james polk chief risk officer mary sellers chief financial officer dean shigamura and sharon crofts who leads the client solutions group ranged from 1 million to 4 million and were a mix of cash and stock options the bank of hawaii awards only vest if the individuals keep working at the bank for a certain number of years and if they perform at least at a level that meets expectations the final award amounts depend on the company s performance relative to its regional bank peers industry news bank ceo compensation soared last year alongside surging stock prices total direct compensation for the chief executives at large and midsize banks rose by 21 5 up from a 5 increase in 2020 according to a new analysis strong earnings growth and a hot stock market were key factors june 2 across the banking industry retention awards were a fairly balanced mix of smaller time based awards and larger performance based awards said shaun bisman principal at compensation advisory partners linking the larger awards to future performance can be key to pleasing shareholders who pay attention to pay packages he said that s generally more palatable to shareholders and investor advisory firms when it s tied to performance or vesting over four years or more bisman said jpmorgan s retention awards to dimon and pinto were not related to the bank s 2021 performance the awards drew attention last month when just 33 of shareholders voted in favor of the company s executive compensation packages for 2021 the non binding advisory vote during jpmorgan s annual meeting came after the investor advisory firms glass lewis and institutional shareholder services recommended that shareholders reject the company s pay packages saying the one time grants to dimon and pinto were excessive the likelihood that retention awards will be handed out at the same pace during 2022 as last year is slim according to executive compensation experts so far this year the stock performance of banks is down from 2021 and it would be hard to justify such awards when banks aren t as profitable experts said all these banks can t keep pouring retention awards upon retention awards and still be where they need to be from a bottom line standpoint eckels said eventually it will peter out

chris horn director of liquids for the heavy restaurant group has been in the industry since the 90s he brings the perspective of having seen the industry thrown for a loop by the dot com bubble and the great recession to discussing the challenges of pandemic dining and the silver linings that have emerged how has this past year been for you challenging would be an understatement we thought 2021 was a mess 2022 has its own set of challenges we have had a really hard time attracting talent you know i went from having a team of 12 people that could take my job any day down to i have two sommeliers between the two restaurants now and that s it s bonkers i think that when the pandemic hit i really was super concerned about all my staff but they all found other things to do some moved to florida some moved to michigan some got jobs waiting tables somewhere else some left the industry altogether some went back to school on new opportunities and revising the wine list there is a silver lining you know i look at all our locations and and everybody s new i think i have four employees downtown who were on the staff before the pandemic and stayed it s an opportunity to readdress how we do things because you don t have that legacy culture you don t have that legacy knowledge you also don t maybe have the legacy of certain habits that you get into so you know it is an opportunity to bring up a brand new generation of hospitality professionals it s an opportunity to rethink how you teach things before the pandemic we were teaching at a very high level we had a wine class every week in all our locations and now these classes have taken a step back and are a little more about the basics i think that s not a bad thing to remember the nuts and bolts of wine and food and wine pairing and hospitality so there are some positive things that are giving us hope the fact that we ve gone from a wine list that was 140 pages to a qr code that people swipe their phone and look at it with gone from 600 bottles to 120 that has been a great opportunity as well because playing in a smaller sandbox makes you edit really thoughtfully yeah it feels bad to not be more inclusive especially when you are in a wine producing state i used to have hundreds of local wines now i can t do that and that doesn t feel as good certainly but from a guest perspective and actually from an education perspective for the staff it s a lot easier to sit down and taste all the spanish wines that you re serving by the glass and by the bottle so that the next time a guest has a waiter who attended that wine class about spanish wines they will have experienced them all and that s something you could not do before when you had dozens of iberian peninsula selections on pandemic changes i remember at the beginning we were all like yeah we need to support local restaurants we re all buying gift cards and doing to go food and there was this real feeling of like we re going to help people out we were selling wine at retail just to keep things going and people were super supportive now it s like people yelping about my to go food wasn t hot when it got to me you re like of course it wasn t because you live 20 minutes away and your uber driver stopped at five other places after they picked up the stuff from our place all that goodwill seems to be gone i don t know how that happened but i guess it s just that we re all tired of this thing and we all want to lash out and have something to blame on unexpected shortages for our bartenders our bar managers i ve basically had to say stop using cool ingredients because they re gonna be out of stock next week just last week st elizabeth allspice dram is gone and it s in a cocktail we couldn t get campari for a while we couldn t get aperol for a while i still can t get oban scotch there are so many scotches i can t get so yeah there s tons of stuff i couldn t get our well bourbon for a while so i was buying plastic bottles of it at the walkup store everything has had a supply chain issue especially in the bar especially spirits especially anything that has to come across the pond so what we ve ended up doing is relying on local vodka local gin trying to make sure that we re no longer putting money in the pockets of those people that are making our lives difficult on the future of the industry i ve always said that people love restaurants first and their discipline second that if you love wine more than you love restaurants you shouldn t be in a restaurant as a wine professional if you love spirits more than restaurants you shouldn t be a bartender i think that my hope is that this next generation of restaurant people fall in love with restaurants first and whatever subset of restaurants be it spirits or beer or wine that gives them juice is something they take seriously but that they take restaurants more seriously than they take their chosen shield of expertise i wouldn t mind there being less emphasis on testing and achievement through third parties i think that some of the best wine professionals i ve worked with are the best not because they took some tests and achieved some level of expertise that was verified by a third party i think the best people in restaurants are the people who love restaurants so i would hope that in the future people will stop asking me what level of somm i am because it doesn t matter you re not here to ask me about my work history you re here to have a good time and just trust that if a sommelier approaches your table and wants to talk to you about your selection tonight that you should not quiz them about what level they are i don t go to the mechanic and ask about what level of expertise he or she has to change my oil i don t go to the grocery store and before i check out ask the checker what level checker they are i think that we ve done a disservice to hospitality by building a pedestal underneath the job of sommelier i think that has created some confusion and misunderstanding of what the job is that not only attracts sometimes the wrong people to the job but it also diminishes the understanding of how much work actually goes into being a sommelier it s not just sitting around tasting wine and guessing what it is it is moving boxes it is doing spreadsheets it s getting the best deal you can get for the best wine for your guests it s tasting your food and pairing it with wine before your guests arrive so when they want something to drink with the thing they order you have that the job is so much more than what the media has painted that people don t have a clue about how backbreaking this job can be this is a w s web exclusive get access to all of our feature stories by signing up today

near previous bear market lows such is despite the sharp rally over the last two weeks despite hopes for a rally the national association of investment managers naaim shows the same bearishness with sentiment so negative one would assume that a bear market was in full swing along with an economic recession however while it seems investors are terrified of the market and its outlook the sell off since january has remained quite orderly as shown the s p 500 index took almost 6 months to decline nearly 20 from its previous peak however what is interesting is that if investors are terrified why are they not selling investors are terrified but no sign of fear despite nearly 6 months of continuous selling rampant headlines of impending doom and cnbc s constant market s in turmoil specials little fear remains below the surface a couple of different gauges provide a view of market stress the first is the volatility index or vix more commonly referred to as a fear gauge the vix is a financial benchmark operating in real time it gives investors an indication of volatility expectations in the market for the coming 30 days historically spikes in the vix correlate to market bottoms as investors dump equities despite the recent selling pressure in the market over the last couple of months volatility remains subdued suggesting little panic in the markets another measure of market stress comes from the bond market by calculating the difference in yields or spreads between various bonds one standard measure is the yield difference between junk and a rated bonds while that spread has risen as of late which one would expect with recent market stresses it remains very low by historical standards when markets were in the grips of a bear if the market were indeed in the grips of a capitulatory selling event i would suggest both measures of market stress would be substantially higher that suggests that even though the media and investors are highly concerned about the markets they aren t doing much about it investors aren t selling over the last decade repeated rounds of monetary interventions created a sense of moral hazard in the financial markets what exactly is the definition of moral hazard noun economicsthe lack of incentive to guard against risk where one is protected from its consequences e g by insurance the massive federal reserve interventions bailouts and zero rates provided a perverse incentive to take on extreme forms of risk from speculative ipos to spacs to cryptocurrencies investors believed the fed was protecting them from the consequences of risk in other words the fed effectively insured them against potential losses the lesson taught to investors was that the fed would bail out any market decline therefore the fear of missing out overrides the need to get out we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us as shown below the aaii investor allocation to stocks bonds and cash tells the story despite aaii investor sentiment at very bearish levels the allocation to equities remains very high while bonds and cash remain low interestingly seemingly terrified investors are still unwilling to sell for the fear of missing out i should qualify that statement while investors aren t selling just yet it doesn t mean they won t there is a point at which every investor will sell for some it may be a 10 decline for others it may be a 40 decline however at some point everyone sells since 2009 every time the market dipped weaved or bobbed the federal reserve ran to the rescue by increasing monetary interventions not surprisingly many investors hope they will do so again sooner rather than later the problem for the market comes when investors begin to realize that with inflation running over 8 annually the fed may not be coming to the rescue anytime soon eventually everyone sells as noted there is a price where everyone sells the emotional strain eventually erodes investor confidence in their previous decisions this is crucial because there is generally no investment strategy or discipline the herding effect and loss aversion are the most significant behaviors that compound the issues of investor mistakes over time as markets rise individuals believe the current price trend will continue indefinitely the longer the rising trend lasts the more ingrained the belief becomes eventually the last holdouts finally buy in as the market evolves into a euphoric state as markets decline there is a slow realization that this decline is not a buy the dip opportunity as losses mount the need to avert loss increases until individuals seek to avert further loss by selling this behavioral trend runs counter intuitive to the buy low sell high investment rule such is the point investors now face as losses mount on financial statements and every decision made seems to be wrong given the lack of panic capitulation and discouragement it is highly likely this particular market cycle is not yet complete we continue to suggest using rallies to reduce risk rebalance allocations and increase cash levels opportunistically such generally provides better outcomes than forced selling when markets fall apart as noted the biggest challenge for most investors is the lack of an investment strategy or discipline from the outset such provides the basis for investment decisions based on fundamental technical or statistical analysis rather than emotion of course if you don t know what an investment strategy or discipline comprises that may be the best place to start

via birchgold group from peter reagan at birch gold group this week your news to know rounds up the latest top stories involving gold and the overall economy stories include the parallel collapse of stock and bond markets reminds us of real safe havens jeremy grantham and ray dalio dive deep into economic woes and gold remains the primary inflation resistant asset for an interesting reason bond investors might be surprised that their safe haven is failing but our readers are not the editor in chief of moneyweek merryn somerset webb recently wrote a financial times editorial to gently break some news to newer or forgetful investors if you have only been knocking around in markets for say 15 years you are seeing the collapse of everything that you have been told is true and have also observed to be true about markets the timespan she provides is an interesting one 15 years in the investment sphere might be a cycle for someone like ray dalio but for many it might very well be the entirety of their exposure to the markets the truth is that one doesn t need dalio s tenure in the markets to in so many words know better our readers don t need five years just one is plenty enough to alert those who are paying attention to market reality she continues outlining some of the false narratives that fueled the everything bubble for so long it turns out that quality growth stocks do not always outperform that the federal reserve will not always step in to protect your wealth and that the prices of the growth stocks in your portfolio have long been more a function of loose monetary policy than the priceless nature of innovative thinking in other words prices matter overpaying for overvalued assets doesn t make them worth more it just makes them cost more especially when the so called fed put is dead with our nation s central bankers demonstrating their willingness to stand back and watch while stocks and bonds tank together in response to their too little too late attempts to deal with inflation speaking of stocks and bonds finally it turns out that the idea of sticking with a long term portfolio consisting of 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent bonds does not mean everything will always be fine in 2019 we placed special emphasis on bonds going into negative territory when many ignored the issue the bond market was already in a historic crisis the treasury was being squeezed as the only sovereign bond offering a yield and a historically low one too the deutsche bundesbank offered bonds at a negative interest rate even before inflation that means owners of german bonds were literally paying the government for the privilege of loaning the government money in subsequent years we reported the growing movement away from the 60 40 portfolio model toward one that treats gold as a necessary diversification large cap money managers were coming around to this perspective possibly too late so far this year the s p 500 is down about 17 shockingly the 40 of the traditional 60 40 portfolio is down sharply as well if we consider the ishares 10 20 year treasury bond etf tlh as a proxy for the bond component 60 40 investors lost 16 so far this year on the safe part of their savings many americans are surprised i m confident regular readers of my columns are a lot less surprised the point of bonds in a 60 40 portfolio is to diversify away from risky equities unfortunately in this case diversifying away from equity risk has brought with it a slew of totally different risks including interest rate risk duration risk default risk inflation risk how can a safe haven perform its role when its market is in a historic crisis we discussed this last week here in the segment bonds fail to protect we also discussed verdad s research on gold s performance in such an environment our readers will also know that the consensus is that the stock market s losses so far are not the end of the bear cycle that we d expect to come after the longest bull market in history that cycle we expect will make 18 losses look minor like verdad s analysts last week webb also turns to history to discover what works during such market crises the only good news is that while all this feels new and is new to most market participants it is not actually new much of it mirrors the conditions of the 1970s another time in which everything seemed to change at once everything is not completely the same but there is enough that is to be worth checking on the few things that then made people richer not poorer so what are those things that then made people richer not poorer webb s answer hold gold if you agree that history provides examples of similar episodes and what worked then should work again today this is very likely sound advice bridgewater s dalio and gmo s grantham on the end of the everything bubble when it comes to long term money management experience what more can we ask for than bridgewater s ray dalio and gmo s jeremy grantham their in depth conversation covered virtually all topics relevant to the economic situation and the financial implications the theme of an everything bubble is once again overarching and it s being mixed with several other anchors to drag individual wealth down these include factors like russia and china s soft exit from the global commodity market and its effects of worsening inflation and straining supplies of goods the world has become dependent on but it also covers some not exactly new albeit intensifying issues where ideology is clashing with growth grantham highlighted how the world has grown extremely vulnerable to supply disruptions not just of goods but of labor as well we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us and that is the world we d better get used to living in we re going to have a world of increasing number of bottlenecks and shortages and the same applies to food the un food index is higher today than any time in its history over the last 50 years since it started so you have price pressure on raw materials metals food you have price pressure long term on labor this surely feels like a new era in which inflation will be part of the background music just like it was in the 20th century and perhaps more so in other words grantham sees this not as a typical market cycle but as a totally new paradigm a new normal to use the oft abused phrase a world in which food and raw materials permanently cost more and inflationary pressures don t go away regardless of the fed s interest rate decisions both money managers are very much concerned with the debt bubble breaking and the stock market collapsing with dalio pointing out that stocks are now running on a 14 year long bull market until recently this was propped up by historically loose monetary policies of an almost unimaginable magnitude this is old ground and not an idea we ll explore further today grantham on the other hand believes the coming market meltdown will fall into line historically we have a market today which feels superficially like 2000 and i think it s going to play out initially like 2000 then the deflationary effects on the economy and the stock market will result in a world rather like the 1970s where all assets are simply much lower priced than they are today dalio thinks that wealth itself may need to be redefined that may sound radical but in dalio s defense all of the world s major sovereign nations are suffering from the same systemic problems specifically systemic problems are the easy money policies that fueled the everything bubble that happens by creating money and credit which creates debt and that dynamic means that you must have a decline in real wealth measured by that because the financial wealth has become enormous relative to the real wealth everybody who s holding bonds or assets and particularly the debt assets believes or financial assets in general which are just journal entries they re claims but they believe that they can take that buying power and sell it and buy goods and services one extremely important point here financial assets in general are just journal entries or claims in other words an iou from someone these in dalio s view are completely different from real wealth which is not a claim or an iou gold is pretty much the only investment that meets dalio s real wealth criteria dalio calls gold both an asset and a currency and believes allocating 15 of your savings to gold has a negligible impact on returns while serving as a massive insurance policy why gold dalio says gold is the third largest reserve currency held by central banks and in periods of time of war or such periods of time of credibility it is the medium like they say it s the only asset that you could have that s not somebody else s liability that means you have to be dependent on them giving you money or giving you something and it is international it can be moved and it s tried and true this is probably the best description of gold s safe haven status i ve ever seen gold s price doesn t really change in forbes contributor john tamny recently made a bold assertion gold s price doesn t move what we see as fluctuations in gold s price well those are simply tracking the value of the dollar it s not a matter of supply or demand but rather how the currency itself is faring he says a major contribution to this misunderstanding of moves in gold price comes down to a fundamental misapprehension of what inflation is to begin it s useful to stress up front what s not stressed in just about every media discussion of inflation it s not rising prices there s a major major difference between rising prices and inflation inflation is a decline in the value of a currency period rising prices are a consequence of inflation or better yet can be a consequence but they re not inflation itself to presume that rising prices cause inflation is the equivalent of asserting that wet sidewalks cause rain causation is reversed stop and think about this tamny s perspective stems from bitcoin s inability to outperform gold during the latest bout of rising inflation despite having a more limited supply indeed the two assets have been compared often over the last year or two with bitcoin taking some heat from a lot of analysts and called digital gold by others we d like to offer a more tempered view that falls somewhere in the middle i think of bitcoin as both a hedge and an anti inflation tool the main consideration here is that it is a hedge and an anti inflation tool gold on the other hand is both the hedge and the anti inflation tool in tamny s words to be clear gold doesn t rise as a result of inflation rather gold s rise is the signal of inflation when the dollar weakens gold reflects this weakness gold s rise is the inflation to understand why it s crucial to understand that the price of gold itself doesn t move repeat the previous truth over and over again gold is the constant and it s the constant due to highly unique stock flow characteristics such that increases in supply or demand for the yellow metal don t move its price whether one invests in bitcoin for speculative returns oriented reasons or even inflation protective reasons they are making a bet it a bet similar to the ones made on stocks and for that matter bonds but it s also fundamentally different stocks and bonds have a track record well over a century old as we discussed above how stocks and bonds behave in economic situations like these are a matter of historical record we can look it up bitcoin s historical track record is much shorter and no one knows with certainty how such a novel asset will react when economic situations change take one example 30 day volatility figures for bitcoin 65 and gold 8 45 this tells us that over the last 30 days bitcoin s price has moved about 8x more than gold s price what does it tell us about tomorrow next month nothing now if we were to take a much longer term view comparing rolling volatility periods over years over different economic environments we might begin to unearth useful information alas in this particular case we can t regardless of the amount of history an asset has we can t know how any asset will perform as circumstances change we can merely guess for assets with a long history our guesses are more likely to be correct or at least closer to reality on the other hand those who own gold can have confidence their investment will pay off so long as they invested for the right reasons savings protection and risk management gold s returns can disappoint growth minded investors however it s important to keep gold s primary purpose in mind if you buy gold as an inflation resistant safe haven a reliable long term store of wealth you re unlikely to be disappointed

in some cultures life and sentience are believed to exist for only certain beings such as humans animals and plants in other belief systems however places and objects are also believed to have some level of sentience this is the case with animism the belief that all things including plants animals objects locations and even concepts are spiritually alive animism is fascinating as it is not necessarily a religion in and of itself but a belief that is a part of many different religions it focuses on the soul of all beings and emphasizes a spiritual connection between all things both scientifically living and non living animism is an incredibly common aspect of many indigenous cultures worldwide and provides a common link between some of these cultures in many indigenous cultures animism is so interwoven with their way of life that they don t even have a term for animism it is the basis of their entire worldview any event that occurs in the world is attributed to these supposed spirits if a natural disaster such as a tornado earthquake or drought occurs it indicates displeasure or dissatisfaction amongst their respective spirits in some religions individuals believe that humans can impact the mood or responses of these spirits in others the behavior of the spirits is out of their control and they must rely on them for survival but where did animism come from and how has it evolved over time the anthropologist edward tylor wrote the book primitive culture where the concept of animism was first coined public domain from old to new a brief history of animism even though animism as a concept has existed for years identifying the concept and giving it a name took quite a while in 1871 english anthropologist sir edward tylor wrote the book primitive culture in which he describes and compares groups that he considered primitive or civilized though the book is often considered unsubstantiated by modern anthropologists it was a key piece of anthropological literature in the late 1800s in this book tylor coined the term animism which he described as the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general an idea pervading life and will in nature tylor at the time had believed that animism was a primitive form of religion and possibly the oldest religious concept though this has been widely debated it is clear that animism is a significant part of ancient religions such as hinduism and buddhism even if the idea of one ancient global religion has been dismissed by other archaeologists tylor s book and his definition of animism is considered one of the earliest defining moments in the subject of anthropology the study of humanity and human behavior other budding anthropologists at the time considered animism to be the primary religion of primitive groups around the world it was believed when comparing primitive groups with civilized groups that there was an inverse correlation between civilization and animism in essence they believed that as civilization in these primitive groups increased belief in animism decreased other theories about animism began to arise throughout the 1900s in the early 1900s swiss psychologist jean piaget proposed that individuals are born with an innate belief in animism that they grow out of as they develop and learn about the world around them in the later 20th century american anthropologist margaret mead proposed the opposite that individuals are not born with an innate belief of animism but instead developed this belief as their culture guided them to the same way as other religious and cultural beliefs in the early 2000s an updated definition to tylor s was proposed stewart guthrie an anthropologist from yale university defined animism as the attribution of spirits to natural phenomena such as stones and trees he also claimed that the development of animism originally may have been in response to evolutionary instincts in humans since early humans needed to be on high alert to survive in the face of predators and natural disasters they may have begun anthropomorphizing or spiritualizing natural objects as a way to protect themselves against them however this theory has ultimately not been proven many modern anthropologists use guthrie s definition and have gone a step further by studying how animists see themselves in relation to nature and the world itself according to modern anthropologists most animists don t see themselves as a superior being above the objects around them instead they consider themselves an equal part of the earth living in it while also being their own separate species like a piece of one big puzzle meditation in nature to attain harmony is a common practice amongst buddhists a belief which is rooted in animism song_about_summer adobe stock tying cultures together though animism is a concept in and of itself it can look slightly different between cultures as a result some anthropologists have debated whether animism is a single religion in and of itself similar to christianity with its different denominations or if each culture has its own individual religion with belief in animism as a singular part debate is still ongoing though many consider it an aspect of various religions since religion can differ greatly between cultures even if animism is a common theme between them in africa many sub saharan african religions emphasize some element of animism in addition to other beliefs such as polytheism and ancestor worship in the northern saharan region of africa the berbers make up the predominant religion the berbers are northwestern africa s largest indigenous ethnic group and they practice several different religions one of which is the traditional berber religion this traditional ancient religion has aspects of polytheism shamanism and of course animism asian cultures on the other hand have an even stronger basis in animism in many indian originating religions for example animism is a dominating theme buddhism for one has a significant emphasis on coexisting with nature meditation amongst nature is a common practice amongst buddhists who believe that meditating amongst nature will result in harmony this spiritual understanding of nature is rooted in animism sikhism is similar sikhism is an ancient religion with origins in india which focuses on living a practical life of truthfulness fidelity self control and purity like buddhism it also has a significant relationship with nature and shares the belief that humans are spiritually sensitive to nature and the natural world respect for and harmony with nature is an essential aspect of sikhism as the sikh holy scripture even says air is the guru water is the father and earth is the great mother this is a clear example of animism as one of sikhism s many core beliefs other indian religions also focus on worshipping specific trees such as the bodhi and bonsai they may also revere sacred rivers mountains and other landscapes as part of their beliefs in the spirituality of nature during vat purnima women tie thread around banyan trees to disply their love for their husbands georgeburba adobe stock some tree species are more sacred than others and may be used in specific religious rituals or grown at places of worship for example vat purnima is a hindu celebration held by married women during this celebration women use a banyan tree to publicly display their love for their husbands these women will come together to tie a thread around the tree to represent their love they may also offer copper coins to the tree as a combination of coins and regular celebration with the thread is thought to please the tree and give their husbands health and longevity in addition to this ceremony the leaves of the tree are seen as highly sacred krishna a major hindu deity is believed to live on the leaves of banyan trees because of this they are planted in important areas and treated with the utmost care by those who practice hinduism in the philippines indigenous religions that worship anito ancestral spirits and bathala a major deity in the region also believe in animism in anito worship especially it is believed that there is an alternative spiritual world that exists alongside the physical world where the deceased remain those that believe in this believe that the spiritual world often interacts with the spiritual world which results in natural objects such as grass trees and rocks having their own spirits outside of india and the phillipines japan pakistan and korea all hold similar beliefs in their own native religions no matter which country you look in most will have some sort of indigenous history which includes animism after analysis it becomes clearer that animism is a common string tying many different religions together even if they aren t correlated with one another whether it s the beauty power or wonder of nature it s clear many people of many different cultures have attributed unique spirituality to it indian woman worshiping a tree ashish_wassup6730 adobe stock isn t dying anytime soon animism is still mostly practiced by indigenous groups worldwide though some modern religions have continued to incorporate animism into their beliefs for example modern day pagans have outwardly claimed to be animists and demonstrate this by showing immense respect and reverence for nature and other living things they also believe that humans share the world with spirits and that these spirits should be respected though animism may not be considered a mainstream belief it is still incredibly common in different regions throughout the world understanding the beliefs of others gives us a greater insight to the cultures and priorities of other people and can show us how human thought has evolved over time even those that don t worship using animism may find that they hold something in common with animistic beliefs such as respect for nature even if you don t believe it has a spirit the next time you re exploring nature consider its beauty and its power perhaps you ll come to understand just why some people consider it a spiritual force of its own top image the concept of meditating in nature is based in beliefs in animism source ittipol adobe stock by lex leigh

as the number of monkeypox cases rises around the world the biden administration is ramping up its ability to dispatch thousands or potentially millions of vaccine doses to fight what has quickly become the largest outbreak of the virus in history but troubling early indicators of groups that may be at high risk for contracting could mean that the guidelines dictating who is eligible for those vaccines may need to shift on monday the department of health and human services instructed the manufacturer of the latest vaccine for the virus to deliver 36 000 doses from an american stockpile in europe once delivered the centers for disease control and prevention will be able to distribute them to a dozen states where cases of the rare illness have been confirmed since mid may the swift request of tens of thousands of vaccine doses comes as the number of known domestic cases reached 31 on monday according to the cdc part of a pair of outbreaks that have seen more than a thousand cases across nearly three dozen countries the request as well as the swift creation of guidelines for who will receive doses of the vaccines public health experts said showcases that some of the lessons learned from early missteps in the covid 19 pandemic response have been put into practice advertisement advertisement but with several superspreader events related to lgbt venues and events in europe some public health experts are hoping for a more aggressive posture on who will be able to receive a vaccine even though no public health experts are calling for a covid esque mass vaccination strategy i applaud the biden administration in securing additional doses of the vaccine but it needs a more coherent strategy for identification of cases and close contacts and for determining which individuals or populations should be offered the vaccine said lawrence gostin director of the o neill institute for national and global health law at georgetown law center i worry greatly that we will see an escalation of cases especially in high risk groups such as men who have sex with men i also worry that we are repeating the errors of the aids epidemic by stigmatizing these communities and driving them underground sex at european raves could explain monkeypox outbreak who adviser the monkeypox virus which despite its name primarily affects rodents has previously been restricted largely to central and west african communities although an american outbreak in 2003 infected more than 40 people after the virus found a reservoir in prairie dogs in the american southwest but this most recent outbreak is the widest in the known history of the virus with more than a thousand confirmed cases as of tuesday largely in western europe and the united states advertisement advertisement monkeypox is not dissimilar from chickenpox and smallpox with symptoms including fever headaches and soreness as well as swollen lymph nodes eventually leading to fluid filled lesions that can leave permanent scars all of the people who have contracted the illness in the latest outbreak have recovered but the long term side effects of the illness are not well understood we are prepared but i ve always learned it s wise to face infectious disease threats not with overconfidence but with humility dr raj panjabi the white house s senior director for global health security and biodefense told reporters in a call on friday a monkeypox outbreak of this scale and scope across the world it has not been seen before although president joe biden called the outbreak something that everybody should be concerned about on may 22 he later sought to dampen concern about the virus particularly for pandemic weary americans concerned about another virus i just don t think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with covid 19 biden told reporters last month but i think people should be careful advertisement advertisement an hhs spokesperson declined to comment on the record but noted that the request for increased vaccination doses from the american stockpile is intended to give public health agencies the ability to respond to any future needs rather than in response to any anticipated increase in case numbers we will continue to work with jurisdictions to support their response dawn o co nnell hhs s assistant secretary for preparedness and response wrote in a blog post announcing the vaccine instruction on monday however at this time we do not anticipate the need for widespread mass deployment of vaccines and treatments if there were such a need the u s is sitting on an enormous stockpile of the vaccines currently held in storage in europe there are actually about 1 5 million doses that have been produced freedman said they re in single vials fda approved ready to go advertisement advertisement the 36 000 doses requested by hhs on monday will come from that repository and will be distributed to state health authorities by the cdc previous outbreaks outside of central and west africa have primarily been limited to zoonotic transmission that is direct transmission from an animal to a human but the current outbreaks appear to have been spread by human to human transmission making the swift implementation of a vaccination strategy of critical importance to prevent the illness from becoming endemic in new human populations it s unlikely based on what we ve seen so far that a mass vaccination strategy of the general population is going to be required the thoughts now are to continue with a so called ring vaccination strategy said dr david freedman a professor emeritus of infectious diseases at the university of alabama and an expert in tropical diseases you identify a case and then identify anybody they came into contact with for seven days or 14 days before they actually got sick and then vaccinate those people effectively freedman said you re vaccinating a ring around those people to prevent the virus from spreading advertisement advertisement the ring however can be quite wide including not just close physical contacts like family members roommates and sex partners but also the medical staff tasked with treating confirmed cases monkeypox is spreading during sex and that is actually a relief but while infectious disease experts note that monkeypox is far less contagious than smallpox the related virus that was once a global scourge but was effectively brought to extinction in the late 1970s by a worldwide vaccination campaign several apparent superspreader events in europe most of them popular with transgender people and men who have sex with men have raised concerns that this outbreak is more effective at human to human transmission the biden administration told the daily beast that the increase in doses requested from the national stockpile roughly 1 200 of which have already been administered has nothing to do with an expected strengthening of the outbreak or the possibility that the guidance on who is eligible for these vaccines will change to include members of high risk groups advertisement advertisement but as pride month kicks into gear in the united states freedman said the cdc s current guidance on who is eligible for vaccine doses could be expanded particularly after apparent amplifying events in europe a sauna in madrid a rave in antwerp a pride festival in the canary island were linked to a high number of monkeypox cases many of them apparently transmitted through sexual contact if more events like that come to light it would make sense to say that if you attended this event you d be eligible freedman said the cdc has not gone so far as some other national health organizations in emphasizing the risk that monkeypox presents to men who have sex with men but a newly published guidance on social gatherings safer sex and monkeypox includes recommendations on safer behavior at raves parties clubs and festivals as well as clipart of people waving rainbow flags at a parade sample guidance a rave party or club where there is minimal clothing and where there is direct personal often skin to skin contact has some risk the world health organization is still finalizing full guidance for national authorities on the best approach to vaccination in the management of monkeypox said tarik jašarević a spokesperson for the who advertisement advertisement u s guidelines however are already in effect currently the cdc s guidance for monkeypox vaccination calls for doses to be distributed to confirmed cases as well as the ring of people who have had unprotected contact with a known case s skin mucous membranes or bodily fluids as well as close enough physical proximity to risk infection by aerosolized saliva that strategy is known as post exposure prophylaxis or pep perhaps best known as a treatment course following potential exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus that so far is the extent of those eligible for a monkeypox vaccination said dave daigle an associate communications director with the cdc s office on public health preparedness and response we are not currently recommending a second ring which is the recommendation of vaccination of contacts of contacts daigle said until we know more we will be using available vaccine stocks for people who ve had close contact with known cases and people at highest risk for exposure through their jobs like healthcare workers treating monkeypox patients dr timothy brewer a professor of epidemiology at ucla s fielding school of public health and of medicine noted that the ring vaccination strategy was a successful tool in the fight against smallpox strengthening the administration s argument that targeted vaccinations are an effective tactic in combating the outbreak so far advertisement advertisement identifying cases and vaccinating contacts was the approach the who used to eradicate smallpox a more transmissible virus for humans than monkeypox brewer said given the success with smallpox limiting vaccination to direct contacts of cases and individuals likely to be exposed to monkeypox because of their jobs is a reasonable initial

zvamaida murwira senior reporter farmers who deliver maize and traditional grains to the grain marketing board before the end of next month will now get an extra us 90 a tonne over and above the 75 000 a tonne producer prices set recently for all four summer grains with the same us 90 a tonne incentive given for deliveries of the pricier sunflower and soya beans the cabinet agreed to the extra incentive bonus yesterday which will be backdated to the beginning of april when the marketing season opened so farmers who have already delivered will the getting the extra the bonus is an incentive for farmers to push their harvesting drying and delivery timelines government yesterday described the package and pricing as the most competitive in the region the announcement was made after yesterday s cabinet meeting by information communication and technology postal and courier services minister dr jenfan muswere who was standing in for information publicity and broadcasting services minister monica mutsvangwa the measures to reward the most efficient farmers were tabled before cabinet by lands agriculture fisheries water and rural development minister anxious masuka zimbabwe started the new marketing season with large carryover stocks from last season on april 1 when the gmb was ready to take deliveries from the new harvest there were stocks of 453 717 tonnes carried over from the previous season as a strategic grain reserve cabinet also approved a review of the price of maize to ensure farmers viability dr muswere said cabinet resolved that cotton will now be treated as an export crop just like tobacco with prices being determined by fair pricing based on international lint prices this should motivate growers to produce more in the coming seasons he said he also gave a status report on wheat and tobacco and tobacco sales so far commenting on the producer price structure dr masuka said the 75 000 a tonne paid for maize sorghum millet and rapoko coupled with the us 90 incentive adds up to the equivalent of us 350 a figure he said was competitive if you look at the import parity price for maize and if you look at this price framework this is a very lucrative arrangement for farmers it is giving them the equivalent of us 350 which is comparable if not better than anywhere else in the region farmers should take advantage of this generous offer from government said dr masuka soya farmers are paid 171 495 a tonne and sunflower farmers 205 794 52 a tonne according to the gmb website and they will now be getting the extra us 90 a tonne if they deliver early fertiliser will now be sold in foreign currency in an open market since some components are imported but those accessing it using the government schemes the majority would pay in local currency reacting to the incentive one farmer organisations the zimbabwe women farmers trust has welcomed the incentive saying it will encourage them to deliver their crops early zimbabwe women farmers trust president mrs depinah nkomo told the herald last night that the incentive is welcome i think it is a good way of promoting the early delivery of maize to the gmb we commend the government for this but we recommend that this incentive should be offered every year from now so that farmers know that when they deliver their crops early they will get an incentive said mrs nkomo meanwhile commenting on why the government was not fully dollarising finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube said there were a number of challenges some very serious that would arise if this was done including the destruction of the banking sector and local industry will no longer be competitive and will be cut back sharply the last time zimbabwe went for dollarisation many factories closed or cut back on production and staff as imports took over this is what will happen on day one if you adopt the united states dollar as the only currency something nasty is going to happen four things as a minimum will happen you will wipe out the entire banking sector because you need to convert their zimbabwe dollar balances into us dollars banks will have negative balances you will have a crisis you will have no banking sector secondly very quickly you will have a cash crisis because you cannot print us dollars and there will be a divisibility problem the small denomination notes will be in short supply and you will start to have cash queues in the banking sector said prof ncube the advantage of having a domestic currency circulating with us dollar is we will have to manage the cash crisis we have been through this before if you remember we had to create something called the bond notes but that was before i arrived in order to deal with some of the cash crisis he said he said the economy particularly the manufacturing sector will lose its competitiveness if the domestic currency is done away with also you will do away with the monetary policy you need both fiscal and monetary policy or you will be walking with one leg so something nasty will happen if you just use the united states dollar said prof ncube on constant fuel price increases prof ncube said the situation would be worse if the country was not blending with ethanol
