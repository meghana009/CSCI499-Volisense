genetic genealogy utilized to identify murder suspect on may 2 1988 diane lynn dahn did not arrive at work for her shift at the san diego transit corporation a coworker went to diane s apartment in the 8700 block of graves avenue in santee and discovered her body inside her bedroom at around 1 30 p m her son was found wandering in the apartment complex the san diego county sheriff s homicide unit responded and assumed responsibility for the investigation an extensive investigation was performed to identity a suspect the county medical examiner s office conducted an autopsy on diane she had been bludgeoned and stabbed the cause of diane s death was stab wounds to the chest and the manner of her death was homicide in october 2000 dna was identified from samples taken from diane s fingernails unfortunately the profile did not yield a suspect further testing was done in 2001 but the profile was insufficient to place into a federal database of dna from unsolved crimes or combined dna index system codis in june 2010 the sheriff s homicide unit s cold case team reviewed diane s case for additional leads and use of new technology a hair which had been found in diane s hand was processed a profile was developed and submitted to codis with no results the profile was consistent with the sample found under her fingernails in may 2020 the cold case team in coordination with the sheriff s crime lab started working on diane s murder using investigative genetic genealogy after a year and a half of dna testing and collection of familial samples detectives developed investigative leads and identified a suspect warren robertson an intensive investigation into warren robertson s life reveals he was born in arkansas but spent most of his younger life in the san diego region in 1988 robertson lived in the same apartment complex on graves avenue as diane did robertson worked as a local tow truck driver soon after the murder robertson left his family and moved to lakeside before moving to indiana in late 1989 robertson lived in indiana until his death in a house fire on november 25 1999 robertson was 39 years old at the time of his death through further dna testing robertson was determined to be the donor of the previously unknown dna the investigation revealed substantial and convincing evidence that robertson had murdered diane cold case detectives did not determine robertson and diane knew each other however both were known to be race enthusiasts and attended stock car races at the el cajon speedway during the time of her murder the sheriff s homicide unit only utilizes investigative genetic genealogy when all other methods have been exhausted this technique combines the science of dna with the art of genealogy in this case the goal was to find relatives whose own dna profile matched those of an unidentified suspect in diane s murder the suspect s profile was developed and uploaded into commercial genealogy sites that allow law enforcement agencies to participate only people who gave consent to participating with law enforcement are visible to detectives the cold case team then formed family histories in the form of trees which led detectives to other potential relatives of robertson this process was so exhaustive nine family trees were constructed with nearly 1 300 people connected to robertson either through blood or marriage when speaking with relatives detectives identify themselves tell the person what they are investigating explain the process and ask for their assistance this process eventually led investigators to closer relatives and ended with contacting robertson s direct relatives who provided dna samples which confirmed the identification this murder would likely have gone unsolved if not for the use of investigative genetic genealogy the sheriff s department would like to thank everyone who spoke to us and provided valuable information throughout our investigation acting sheriff kelly martinez says the san diego county sheriff s department is committed to bringing answers to families no matter how long ago the crime occurred i commend the sheriff s homicide unit and crime lab for doing an amazing job of collecting and preserving evidence nearly 34 years ago that was able to be used today i also want to thank our cold case detectives and analysts in the sheriff s homicide unit for relentlessly pursuing justice they kept reviewing dahn s case using modern dna technology i hope this brings some sense of peace and healing to the victim and her family the family of diane dahn reflected on their grief and the years spent wondering who was responsible for the murder of their loved one they thanked everyone in the sheriff s homicide unit who worked on the case victoria dahn minter says 34 years is a long time to be in a state of grief and immense sorrow not knowing almost consumed me my sister was an amazing person she loved life and always played the violin and guitar it s unfortunate my nephew never had the chance to know his mom she was a great mother the detectives did such a wonderful job they were persistent whenever i would call to follow up they knew diane s name and her case right away i didn t think anything was ever going to happen it doesn t make the pain go away but at least there s an answer mark beyer was only two years old when his mother was murdered he was found wandering the apartment complex when deputies arrived at the crime scene he has no recollection of the incident but was glad to finally get answers just two weeks after what would have been his mom s 63rd birthday looking back some of the struggles you go through is you feel alone because of what you went through you lost your mother you know you have family you know you have family who loves you but sometimes you do feel alone all the time just good work for the homicide unit that i was so blown away when i heard the story of how it actually transpired like how you go from what little information you have to building a case like that was truly impressive the answers that my family received is closure and closure is everything even after so much time had passed to watch the full video statement of mark beyer and additional photos of diane for broadcast or publication of a news story click here this is the fifth time the sheriff s homicide unit has used

after three weeks of fighting russia is beginning to deploy increasingly brutal tactics in ukraine including indiscriminate shelling of cities and medieval siege warfare other elements of its military strategy however are conspicuously absent cyberwarfare among them russia has a history of employing cyberwarfare tactics which some experts believed could feature prominently in its invasion of ukraine the cyberattacks launched by russia in the conflict so far have been relatively minimal though and far less damaging than they could have been while ukrainian government websites were the target of distributed denial of service ddos attacks shortly before the invasion for example a larger attack possibly knocking out ukraine s power grid or other key infrastructure hasn t taken place i think the biggest surprise to date has been the lack of success for russia with cyber attacks against ukraine stephen wertheim a senior fellow in the american statecraft program at the carnegie endowment for international peace told vox this has not been a major part of the conflict that s particularly odd since the threat of cyberwarfare by russian entities was already a major concern for the west even before the recent escalation of the russia ukraine conflict it was widely established that russia may have significant cyberwarfare capabilities following successive cyberattacks it launched against ukraine after russia s 2014 annexation of crimea notably a pair of attacks in 2015 and 2016 took out power in parts of ukraine albeit at a relatively small scale since then according to a politico story from february the united states and allies have attempted to bolster ukraine s power grid but nobody thinks it will be enough in 2017 kremlin linked hackers launched a different kind of a cyberattack in ukraine a ransomware program known as notpetya which encrypted any data it reached leaving the data s unsuspecting owner locked out from accessing their own files victims were told to pay a ransom of 300 in bitcoin if they wanted access to their data returned but the ransomware attack spread beyond ukraine s borders infecting computer networks of companies around the world according to a former us official the attack resulted in more than 10 billion in total loss in damages and the notpetya attack is now regarded as one of the worst cyberattacks in modern history the us has not been safe from such cyberattacks either in 2021 for example a group of russia based cybercriminals hacked into the it network of colonial pipeline a major oil pipeline system that carries gasoline and jet fuel to the southeastern us the company was forced to pay a ransom of 5 million in exchange for the extracted files despite the apparent vulnerabilities in ukrainian and western cyberdefenses though more sweeping cyberattacks haven t to date been a part of russia s war in ukraine why hasn t russia launched major cyberattacks yet the lack of full scale russian cyberattacks is a phenomenon that has surprised some experts including wertheim on some level he said the reason russia launched a full scale war against ukraine is precisely that it didn t think cyber means were sufficient but one might have expected the war itself to have involved more cyber operations it s difficult to know exactly what is behind russia s behavior but experts have speculated about a number of potential reasons why russia has hesitated to launch any stronger attacks some have theorized that russia s cyberwarfare capabilities may have been inflated which is why it has not thus far launched a more sophisticated cyberattack against ukraine or its western allies however a more likely reason may be that russia is still weighing its options carefully and is simply waiting for the right time to respond it could be that russia fears retaliation that would set its cause back at least at this point said wertheim noting the relative lack of progress by russia s armed forces so far perhaps over time if and when russian leaders believe that the situation is stabilized then russia would be better able to absorb retaliation it could launch a cyberattack then it s possible given the setbacks that russia has encountered on the battlefield combined with the notable resistance by ukrainian forces that have held steady against russia s attacks for the last three weeks it may also be a matter of russia prioritizing its military actions according to wertheim there might just simply be a kind of finite attention problem operating for he said according to olena lennon an adjunct professor of political science and national security at the university of new haven setbacks for russia include the loss of junior and even some higher level commanders among its military personnel which may be affecting its operations on the ground we re definitely seeing some leadership deficiencies that could explain some of these surprises lennon said the us could also be a target of russian cyberattacks us authorities were already wary of a possible cyberattack from russian hackers as a potential response to us support for ukraine that concern has only increased following major sanctions imposed on russia by western powers as well as escalating rhetoric from russian president vladimir putin putin described the sanctions as akin to declaring war and russian government officials have warned there will be swift action from russia in response us officials warned public and private entities of potential ransomware attacks after president joe biden announced initial sanctions against russia late last month dhs has been engaging in an outreach campaign to ensure that public and private sector partners are aware of evolving cybersecurity risks and taking steps to increase their cybersecurity preparedness a dhs spokesperson said in a statement to the press but the strong response against sanctions that russian officials have warned of has yet to materialize in the weeks since although it s certainly possible that russia will react to us sanctions at some future point the absence of action so far is notable according to wertheim it s very hard to sort of assign exact probabilities to these kinds of things wertheim said but it s notable that there hasn t been a response and i think it remains a real possibility that even if the west does nothing more to escalate in a conflict that russia could do so by undertaking what it believes is retaliation that could be particularly likely as the impact of already imposed sanctions continues to mount sanctions have had an enormous effect on day to day life inside the country the value of the ruble russia s official currency has plummeted to less than 1 cent and russian citizens have already seen price surges particularly for electronic goods and appliances the early price hike has motivated many residents to stock up on items in case prices continue to rise as the conflict rages on for the past few days it s been like christmas for us one electronics shop staffer told the financial times people are ready to buy things even we have been raising prices every few hours based on the forex situation with heavy economic sanctions already in place wertheim says there are potential risks to pushing putin further into a corner which in itself could motivate russia to take more drastic measures including potentially cyberattacks as the war continues what i most worry about is a circumstance in which vladimir putin thinks that his regime may be teetering and that he has to do something dramatic to change the status quo in order to maintain his grip on power wertheim said and thus perhaps his own personal survival correction march 20 9 am a previous version of this story misstated the year of the colonial pipeline hack it was 2021

going to tell you exactly how i save over 1 000 a year using coupon codes while shopping online 1 000 is no joke think about what you could do with an extra grand for me that s two months of rent it s

and a manufacturer s coupon on the same item it will help you save even more money and score some great deals just make sure you check the fine print before making your purchase so you know whether or not it is allowed by the retailer or manufacturer buy clearance items and use them when they go on sale again look for items that are already clearance priced in stores but also have a coupon

four coupons for pasta sauce and no coupons for pasta then it might not be worth it to stock up on the sauce if you can t use it right away they want to sell you things this can benefit both parties as long as you keep these three things in mind when clipping your coupons don t buy something just because it s on sale or you have a coupon for it you re still spending money and that s the opposite of what we re trying to accomplish here if there s no name brand version of the item don t buy the store brand version just because it s cheaper do some research and find out which one is better and actually cheaper after the coupon don t buy extra items just because they are on sale or you have a coupon for them i know this sounds silly but i see people do it all the time i ve been guilty of this myself i m at the cash register with my one item and then see that i can get another box of cereal for free with this great deal uh no thanks do i really need another box of cereal no i don t similarly if there are two different pasta brands on sale this week one only cost 1 but is twice as much as the other brand that s 50 cents off then it s better to buy the cheaper brand even though it costs more out of pocket today you ll get more pasta in total which means more money saved if this seems like too much math remember you don t have to do all the work yourself there are plenty of apps that will help you compare and contrast different products check your store s weekly ads before you shop look through the weekly ads for the stores you normally shop at and find the best deals for your family this helps me plan my meals for the week and allows me to choose recipes based on what s on sale stack coupons with sales for maximum savings stacking coupons with sales is one of my favourite ways to save money when i shop combining a coupon with a sale price will result in even greater savings at the register when grocery shopping i normally check store websites social media pages and printable coupon sites like coupons com or smartsource before heading out to shop so i can pair them both up with sales a grocery coupon code is a great way to save money and an even better way to get free stuff but there are a few things you need to know before you start cutting into savings here s how to use grocery coupons the right way collect coupons from sunday newspapers mailers magazines the internet and the store itself use discount coupons for items that are already on sale at the store you ll find out about sales when you look at the weekly ads buy in bulk save money by

russia ukraine conflict what it will take to capture kyiv military analysts say capturing the city would require a furious and bloody conflict that could be the world s biggest urban battle in 80 years a view of the central square following the shelling of the city hall building in kharkiv ukraine file photo andrew e kramer the city of kyiv covers 840 square kilometres and is divided by a broad river it has about 500 000 structures factories ornate churches and high rise apartments many on narrow winding streets roughly 2 million people remain after extensive evacuations of women and children to the northwest and to the east tens of thousands of russian troops are pressing towards the city ukraine s capital backed by columns of tanks armoured vehicles and artillery inside kyiv ukrainian soldiers and civilian volunteers are fortifying the downtown with barriers anti tank mines and artillery advertisement kyiv remains the biggest prize of all for the russian military it is the seat of government and ingrained in both russian and ukrainian identity but capturing it military analysts say would require a furious and bloody conflict that could be the world s biggest urban battle in 80 years what we are looking at in kyiv would dwarf anything we ve seen since world war ii said david kilcullen a retired lieutenant colonel in the australian army who has extensively studied urban combat if they really really want to level kyiv they can he said of the russian leadership but the level of political and economic damage would be tremendous for comparison one of the largest urban battles this century was the nine month siege of mosul iraq in 2016 and 2017 to oust its islamic state occupiers mosul covers 180 square kilometres and had a wartime population of about 750 000 people a fraction of the numbers for kyiv where the metropolitan area s pre war population was 3 6 million negotiations over a ceasefire are continuing and a long heated battle over kyiv is not inevitable despite superior numbers and firepower russia has not achieved a breakthrough a western official in a briefing with reporters this past week said the russians had taken heavy casualties been unable to establish any meaningful off road presence and perhaps most surprising failed to achieve dominance in the air but the first stages of the battle have already begun with cruise missile bombardments troop movements to encircle the city and a fight to gain air superiority savage street by street gunfights akin to guerrilla warfare have broken out in northwestern suburbs like irpin an important gateway into the city it could be the beginning of a long drawn out siege using hunger and street fighting to advance towards the city centre after three weeks of fighting in the suburbs ukrainian soldiers and volunteers who are operating in loosely organised small units and relying heavily on ambushes are growing more confident in the city s defence part of their strategy is to make the assault so costly for the russian army in lives that it will exhaust or demoralise its troops before they reach the city centre there s no talk of capitulation for kyiv said lt tetiana chornovol the commander of an anti tank missile unit operating on the outskirts of the city everything is going far better than we thought lt chornovol 42 is a former activist in ukraine s street protest movement who sent her two children to safety before reporting for duty as a reserve officer she commands two teams of a half dozen or so people each firing ukrainian made tripod mounted missiles which they transport to ambush positions in their personal cars lt chornovol drives a red chevy volt electric hatchback which she calls an ecologically clean killing machine interviewed beside a burning grocery warehouse in the suburban town of brovary the lieutenant popped the hatchback to reveal a beige tube holding a stugna p missile it has a range of 4 8km and hits a target within a diameter of one foot seemingly unfazed by combat lt chornovol described the ukrainian tactic of ambushes that has defined the early phases of the battle for the capital last week she said she blew up a russian tank a few miles east of brovary on the m01 highway we look for firing positions where we can see a stretch of road lt chornovol said adding that we know a column will drive on the road eventually with her car parked some distance away covered in camouflage she and her team lay in wait in a tree line for three days before a russian column came rumbling down the road when the command came to open fire she used a laser to lock in on the tank pushed a button then watched as the tank lit up in flames before she rushed back to her car to escape return fire i shoot at armour she said when asked about the human toll if they climb inside it s their fault the tactics lt chornovol described are indicative of the city s defences which rely on a blend of sophisticated air defence systems army troops civilian volunteers and paramilitary organisations an urban environment favours booby traps ambushes and lightly armed but mobile defenders against a regular army ukrainians have laid out pie sized anti tank mines on the shoulders of roads which can be quickly dragged across streets to block advances in cities the urban grid channels the invader s armoured vehicles into narrow streets where they become vulnerable the russians also have a formidable force but of a different nature they rely on superior troop numbers and powerful but less mobile weaponry russian tanks for instance are moving methodically in long columns through small towns outside kyiv rarely straying from roads at times the vehicles are creating gigantic traffic jams on the dnieper river s west bank soldiers and vehicles from two siberia based combined arms armies parlance for large russian military groupings are creeping forward said michael kofman the director of russia studies at the cna a research institute in arlington virginia russian special forces units or spetsnaz have turned the once tranquil suburb of irpin into a battle zone he said on the eastern bank russia s 41st combined arms army has been probing into outlying towns like brovary where lt chornovol blew up a russian tank why the russians are advancing tanks into the urban landscape of kyiv s outskirts where they are vulnerable to ambush is something of a mystery kofman said they are trying to make quick progress down roads while the ukrainians are trying to engage them in cities rather than out in the open fields he said and time is not on the russians side kyiv is surrounded by bogs thawing now with the coming spring and hampering any efforts by the russians to fan out with their heavy weapons around the city s perimeter tanks that venture off roads are already sinking into the mud it remains unclear whether the russian army will attempt a full urban assault kofman said but the movements so far suggest plans to at least encircle kyiv that will require gaining dominance in the sky which russia has unsuccessfully been trying to achieve ukrainian and russian pilots have clashed in dogfights over kyiv and a russian jet crashed into one neighbourhood sometimes the plumes of ukrainian surface to air missiles can be seen rising into the sky russia has failed to control the sky over kyiv analysts say because it has not destroyed the city s air defence missiles or all the secretive air strips in western ukraine used by ukrainian pilots in flights to defend the capital to fully encircle kyiv the russians must engage in several more suburban battles at that point two options would open for the russian military according to kilcullen the expert on urban combat starve the city or try a block by block assault modern cities typically have limited stocks of food as grocery stores rely on regular deliveries and kyiv is no exception but severe food shortages would most likely not begin in kyiv for at least a month according to kilcullen for now a highway to the southwest remains open for supplies of weapons and food street fighting on the other hand would cause significant casualties for the invaders the russian military might also skip some steps of a classic urban assault trying for example a special forces raid on the city centre or a battle before the encirclement is completed kilcullen said and despite ukrainian tactical successes in the battle for the suburbs using small units like lt chornovol s ambush teams the russian force remains a formidable threat said dima adamsky an expert on russian security policy at reichman university in israel it is adapting he said and it is continuing to fulfil its operational plans new york times news service
decisive david schwimmer says london has been quick to act over war as a former goldman sachs banker in moscow david schwimmer ought to be the right person in the right job as chief executive of the london stock exchange group the combative american not to be confused with his more famous namesake who plays ross in friends sharply rejects any suggestion that the lseg home to more than 40 listed russian companies was slow off the mark when it came to suspending trading in their shares or expelling them from the main london indexes i think that perception is wrong schwimmer tells me as he jolts around in the back of a taxi on a post covid business trip to new york we have implemented the changes very quickly and worked very closely with the regulators and government he says a vocal advocate of the lseg s role as a pillar of the city he contrasts the speed of reaction of london and his markets with what has been happening in his native us it s probably worth taking a bit of perspective on this when the us implemented its sanctions on february 24 and 25 it gave the markets until may 25 to get out of these securities so three months my point is that we and the markets moved very quickly to suspend trading on the london stock exchange to remove the security from the index data the war on ukraine the risk to global financial stability and making the financial sanctions against russia bite are top of the stock exchange boss s agenda at present but since taking over from his controversial predecessor xavier rolet in 2018 he has been laser focused on building the lseg into a world leading trading and information presence the depth and breadth of the lseg has been transformed by the 20billion acquisition of refinitiv the trading and data group carved out of reuters thomson it may prove to be the ultimate defensive wall against the array of bidders from the us germany and even scandinavia which over the years have been repelled by his predecessors a harvard educated anglophile who makes no secret of his preference of london to new york schwimmer 53 is a powerful advocate of retaining derivatives trading and settlement in the square mile post brexit he is working closely with government in an effort to restore the listing of cambridge based tech champion arm holdings to the london market where it belongs tempting it away from new york he regards much of the comment about new york s nasdaq being better for ipos than the london exchange as silly for the moment schwimmer s eyes are focused on the conflagration in ukraine putin s brutal war has underlined the value of lseg owned world check one of the little noticed enterprises which came as part of the refinitiv deal the financial markets are relying very heavily to comply with sanctions on our world check content institutions all over the world are using it to show that they are not dealing with sanctioned individuals schwimmer says world check is regarded as the leading database used by banks companies and ngos for background checks when bringing aboard new customers and making sure they comply with anti money laundering know your customer and sanctions rules will the sanctions work in taming the russian bear the sanctions regime put in place has been far more effective and more aggressive than we have seen in the past and i would speculate more aggressive than the russian government expected argues the lseg boss it is very effective in creating economic stress within russia and sending a clear message that russia will not be participating in the global economy as a result of this behaviour schwimmer broadly believes the global financial system is better able to absorb the shock caused by sanctions than it was in the autumn of 2008 when a us government decision to allow the investment bank lehman brothers to go into chapter 11 bankruptcy triggered a financial catastrophe we actually had a default by vtb capital on the london clearing house part of lseg as a result of sanctions but everything worked and the collateral we had from the defaulting banks covered positions the financial system may not yet have crumbled as it did after lehman but you never know where weakness will show up you have to be cautious whenever there is fragility and disruption as we are seeing right now because there may be some weaknesses in the system or some unintended consequences we are not yet aware of schwimmer warns looking across the global landscape schwimmer is less than sanguine even though he claims not to be in the prediction business he sees risks coming from the war in ukraine surging commodity prices and in the background he points to covid and the impact that is having on chinese equities there are a number of risks and more pressures on the market than on economic activity when it comes to tech flotations the shaven headed pugnacious stock exchange boss fiercely rejects the view put about by former bt boss gavin patterson the hut group s beleaguered founder matt moulding and others that london is not the right place we have a healthy market in london and we also have a very strong environment for private equity capital london continues to be a very very robust and successful financial centre the american insists he challenges the fashionable notion that new york and the nasdaq market in particular would be the best place to float arm holdings so far that appears to be the route advocated by billionaire masayoshi son the founder of arm s owner softbank i think the narrative about tech always having an easy run and spectacular performance in new york is a bit silly the performance of for example the biotech sector in new york has been abysmal schwimmer adds he also thinks it is important that a company like arm which has its hq in the uk and where its business mainly operates should be in london if it wants to be in the key indexes schwimmer discloses he is working closely with government to make sure london remains competitive and in more normal market conditions attracts big companies to the city the ukraine russia conflict may also be a turning point for esg investing he says in the last couple of years investors have taken the view that if they pull cash out of fossil fuel companies they have ticked the esg box given the hostile geopolitical climate in his view as steward as one of the world s largest markets for natural resources esg is not an appropriately sophisticated way to think about the challenges as the architect of one britain s largest and most ambitious takeovers of recent times the reshoring of refinitiv schwimmer ought to be a national hero instead he faces the slings and arrows of investors with short term vision the ukraine crisis volatility and the trading profits it has landed have made his deal look smarter for investors in the lseg and polished the square mile s appeal as europe s financial hub

midas share tips reap rewards from loans to fruit farmers with cordiant global agricultural income set up to increase supply but keeping costs low uk consumers munch their way through more than 650million avocados every year almost two million a day most come from peru and chile which also produce piles of the blueberries grapes oranges and mandarins found on our supermarket shelves russia and ukraine may be known as the breadbasket of europe but latin america is the world s fruit bowl blessed with warm climes and fertile land the continent exports tons of fruit and vegetables annually as well as coffee sugar and crops such as soy corn and millet which are key constituents of vegetable oil and animal feed as such agriculture plays a crucial role in the latin american economy and is expected to continue in that vein for the foreseeable future fortunately too trade ties between the uk and south america date back for centuries cordiant global agricultural income will allow investors to take advantage of latin america s bounty and help farmers to grow more with less the group is listing on the stock market early next month targeting a 4 per cent dividend yield in the first year rising to at least 6 5 per cent by 2024 share price growth should take annual returns to at least 10 per cent making this flotation well worth a closer look cordiant managers have been investing in latin american agriculture for years focusing on brazil mexico chile and peru over that time they have come to understand how the market works and where the opportunities lie they discovered that many farmers even those with large estates and multi million dollar turnovers find it hard to access the cash they need to expand in the past these large established producers would rely on banks to finance their growth but long term loans have been in short supply since the financial crisis this is where cordiant steps in the group lends money to farmers to help them become both more efficient and more sustainable the firm intends to focus on farms with an established record multi generational expertise and extensive tracts of land some as big as manchester with cordiant funds and advice these farmers can construct clever drip irrigation techniques which reduce water use by around 90 per cent and can almost double yields per acre they can acquire kit to convert by products into energy buy low emission machinery and adopt precision farming which uses technology to boost yields in an environmentally conscious way loans will range from 5 3 80 to 50million though most will be around 25million to be repaid over four to seven years demand is substantial so cordiant can afford to be very choosy turning down many more requests than it accepts with a team of about a dozen on the ground cordiant will also keep a watchful eye on creditors to make sure they are using their money wisely in addition the group will only lend to farmers who have end customers in place from huge trading groups such as cargill in the us to supermarket chains including sainsbury s waitrose and lidl cordiant will start out with eight loans worth more than 115million but managers have identified a pipeline of almost 1billion so they should be able to lend out the proceeds from the float pretty swiftly global trade in crops is conducted almost exclusively in dollars so cordiant is offering its shares at 1 each and hopes to raise 300million investors will also receive one bonus share for every five they buy midas verdict food prices were already soaring before the ukraine war looking ahead further increases seem inevitable cordiant global agricultural income has been set up to help farmers increase supply while keeping costs low over time that should feed through to more stable prices in the shops and in the shorter term cordiant offers investors access to the agricultural sector generous dividends and the prospect of steady share growth at 1 the shares are a buy to be traded on mainmarket ticker cai contact cordiantagtrust com or 02081585829
south korea s recent presidential election was unprecedented not only for its closeness but for the non appearance of the leading candidates wives in the run up to the polling but of course we have never seen spouses engulfed with so much scandal that they are reduced to a public apology and completely marginalised upon confirmation of his victory yoon suk yeol visited his campaign staff and party echelon at the people power party where he made a brief announcement in the wee hours around 4 am small crowds of supporters welcomed him outside his home and the party headquarters however they couldn t cheer the nation s next first lady kim keon hee she was nowhere in sight

if you want to get rich get elected this truism is the worst kept secret in america as npr observed young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips that racket was reported six months ago and nothing has changed since members of congress still enjoy unprecedented access to inside information and whenever there s a crisis they are quick to cash in on it the latest example involves russia s invasion of ukraine while congress was debating economic sanctions military assistance and billions of dollars in emergency spending to deal with this crisis in ukraine reports cnbc s ylan q mui more than a dozen members reported trades either their own or by their spouse or by their child in sectors that were directly affected by the war in ukraine cnbc estimates the total trading activity since feb 1 to be about 7 7 million putin killed trump s america first movement it looks like congress saw this as a gold rush fox news jesse watters observed last week they knew what sanctions could be coming down and all they had dollar signs in their eyes members from both sides of the political aisle poured money into the market so as ukraine burned to the ground congress got rich waters pointed out that florida rep debbie wasserman schultz a democrat bought energy stocks in late january that shot through the roof since their purchase maybe she knew something we didn t watters concludes and unfortunately she s not alone the day before russian tanks crossed into ukraine gop rep marjorie taylor greene tweeted war and rumors of war is incredibly profitable and convenient she s right greene later revealed that just two days before russia s invasion she bought stock from a major defense contractor an oil company and an energy company in a statement to business insider greene said that her investment advisor has full discretionary authority over our accounts i guess we ll have to take her word on that this behavior is all too common when it comes to profiteering members of congress never let a major crisis go to waste consider some recent history on sept 16 2008 treasury secretary hank paulson and fed chairman ben bernanke held a secret conclave with members of congress as business insider noted in 2011 congressmen privy to this information reacted not by dropping everything and drawing up a plan to save the economy but by dumping stock and avoiding the losses everyone else would take in the coming month others bought stocks in financial firms that would later be saved by the federal government many americans learned about this from an episode of cbs s 60 minutes which first aired in november of 2011 during the health care debate of 2009 members of congress were trading health care stocks including house minority leader john boehner steve croft of 60 minutes said just days before the was finally killed off boehner bought health care stocks all of which went up as is the case with marjorie taylor greene boehner s spokesperson said the trades were made by boehner s financial advisor who he only consults with about once a year the 60 minutes report led to congress passing the stop trading on congressional knowledge stock act which prohibits any members or employees of congress from using any nonpublic information derived from the individual s position or gained from performance of the individual s duties for personal benefit how well did the new legislation work fast forward to the covid crisis when gop sen richard burr of north carolina one of only three senators to vote against the stock act was also one of four members of congress who made suspicious stock trades in 2020 the trades were made after receiving classified reports on covid 19 but before the general public realized the severity of the pandemic according to cnbc on february 13 2020 burr unloaded stock shares worth 630 000 to 1 7 million with 33 individual trades made on that single day the shares he sold represented a significant portion of his financial portfolio a week later the stock market began plummeting the fbi seized burr s phone and he stepped down from his committee chairmanship however the trump justice department ultimately decided not to charge him or any of the senators we shouldn t be surprised it s nearly impossible to prove that someone acted solely on insider information and even if someone is found to have violated the law and according to business insider s dave levinthal at least 57 members of congress have mind you that s just the ones we know about the penalties are puny biden can t let putin draw a red line over aid to ukraine the good news is that there is emerging bipartisan support for banning members of congress and their immediate families from investing in the stock market after opposing such efforts house speaker nancy pelosi who profited handsomely from curious stock market opportunities has now backtracked from her previous opposition to the idea in a perfect world virtue and a sense of responsibility would prevent most lawmakers from using their office to feather their nests absent that something has to be done to stop the appearance of impropriety because it is contributing to a sense that the game is rigged as the wealth gap between lawmakers and regular americans continues to widen trust in government has continued to erode i m not suggesting there is a direct correlation but anyone who cares about conserving american democracy should be concerned about these trends major problems in government don t often have easy solutions that s not the case here the right thing to do is obvious it s time to ban stock trading for members of congress and their families read more at the daily beast get the daily

yakobchuk istock via getty images investing in clean energy stocks climate change concerns are prompting nations around the globe to alter their power sources carbon based fossil fuels are valuable sources of energy that supply approximately 85 of the world s energy needs in addition to the price of crude oil skyrocketing near 140 barrel the aim to decarbonize the global economy is becoming more important but not all green energy stocks and etfs are created equal as evidenced by etf first trust nasdaq clean edge green energy qcln which is down more than 17 5 ytd it s crucial to pick green energy stocks that have good valuation frameworks and underlying metrics renewable energy is crucial to the energy transition and why i have selected two energy stocks with solid fundamentals on

renewable stocks are hot commodities and outperforming returning approximately 159 since the end of 2019 compared to the s p 500 s 29 with these numbers and the s p 500 and other indices on a rollercoaster ride the spike in oil and gas prices on the heels of russia s invasion of ukraine coupled with the suspense behind raising interest rates the case for why alternate energy sources should be the topic of interest is clear in 2020 despite the consumption of fuels declining renewables were the only energy sources with increased demand thus as global economies recover from the pandemic and other crises like russia ukraine will clean energy stocks expand quicker because renewable energy derives from natural sources like wind and sunlight global warming and geopolitical factors set to impact economies going forward should drive its usage as the cost of energy increases many companies including utilities can pass expenses directly to the consumer and consumers don t have much choice other than to pay the move higher in global natural gas and power prices is potentially a longer term catalyst for acceleration of development of renewable energy capacity globally across a variety of technologies including solar wind and green hydrogenâ these energy sources will be viewed as more price competitive in a higher for longer scenario for energy prices said ameet thakkar energy transition and infrastructure analyst at bmo nations want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while increasing output efficiency decreasing maintenance costs and ensuring less pollution given the 45

the new normal moving forward with china as the largest manufacturer of solar panels wind turbines and supplier of raw materials used to build them china also accounts for more than 50 of its global renewable capacity growth companies and nations are following suit and policy changes and investments into the industry are helping meet climate goals as nato and nations consider fuel options going

loved as did my 11 year old angela los angeles ca this is so good i made it two days in a row yesterday i wasn t reading the recipe that closely and inadvertantly minced and sautéed the ginger and shallots before adding the broth it turned out great so i stuck with that method for the second batch as well i ve been a long time fan of chinese style congee but i think i am going to end up making this more flavorful version from here on out thanks for the great recipe sara portland or made this for the second time last night i look forward to having leftover bones from grilled and roasted chickens so i can make stock and have an excuse to make this soup again it s so comforting i used cilantro instead of scallions just because that s what i tend to have on hand and used a mixture of fresno and cobra chilis that i grow in my garden but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter happy to hear from lao kitchen in a comment below that this recipe is fairly authentic anonymous los angeles ca this is one of the best chicken soups i have ever had i did make a few adjustments mostly out of necessity i didn t have any peanuts or fresh thai chilies i had dried thai chili s that i added when i was cooking the chicken legs again no thighs instead of chopping the ginger into matchsticks i chopped it fine and did not marinate it after plating it with the scallions and ginger i added a bit of cilantro and chili crisp from ba to die for this is going to be my go to next time i m feeling under the weather thank you andy your recipes never disappoint minnie s mom los angeles this is my culture s traditional soup our go to comfort soup when your family is sick or to warm up on a cold day about every asian country has a rice porridge soup version that are very different from one to another i highly respect bon appétit for keeping this recipe close to the traditional lao flavors i see some people have questions and tips first off one user added gojuchang miso lemongrass chinese five spice and even more cinnamon you are over doing it and mixing korean chinese japanese and thai flavors which are all completely different you don t just go adding everything you find in the asian aisle into a recipe what can you use instead of fish sauce salt it s not going to have the salted taste but that s okay it you take away fish sauce peanuts chili peppers and lime then you are very close to the chinese style there is also vegetarian fish sauce taste is spot on pro tip after soaking rice and draining the water gently squeeze the rice to break it by hand but not crumbling it like 2 squeezes this will cut the cooking time this soup is supposed to have a porridge texture not like watery canned chicken and rice soup laokitchen chicago i love this soup and have made it at least three times now my one issue with the recipe as written is that the amount of rice called for completely overtakes the soup to get the rice cooked enough it soaks up all of the broth so that it s more like a rice porridge i now just need to remember to cut the amount of rice i put in in half maybe ba kitchen uses a better quality rice than i am i can t think of why this would happen every time otherwise the flavors are fantastic and i do plan to make this again and again sarahdianephilli los angeles ca this is so good that i made a batch for a sick friend and instead ate the entire thing myself i made this soup after catching a cold upon some earlier than expected cold weather that hit houston this week i recommend adding the ginger to the cooking liquid rather than using it as a garnish at the end the chicken thighs are super tender the fish sauce gives it nice umami add a green vegetable at the very end for some added nutrition i added baby broccoli halllu houston tx a great soup alizarae new york this soup is delicious but it is definitely better the 2nd and 3rd day after it has time to sit a bit longer like someone else i used canned green chiles and they were delicious next time i will probably use a combo of mild and hot green chiles as i only used mild this time i used fresh leeks from the farmer s market and carmelized them before putting them in my homemade bone broth with the chicken delicious i skipped the peanuts because i don t like peanuts added to other foods i m definitely saving this to make again with a bit more spice next time anonymous bay area ca i make this with rice noodles instead of rice it s very very good anonymous milwaukee my go to chicken soup my husband ives this soup beyond reason tonight i made it but had no chilies on hand i added a small can of diced green chilies it made it even better my favorite part is the ginger matchsticks i also kept the shallots janet monahan wyoming great soup heart warming and filling i followed the recipe exactly except that i didn t discard the shallots didn t think that was necessary justeat washington d c amazing anonymous boulder co

by noriyuki suzuki kyodo news mar 20 2022 11 20 all japan feature the yen s value may further slide and test the tolerance of price sensitive consumers and japanese policymakers the biggest driver would be the divergence between the u s federal reserve which has apparently entered a rate hike cycle and a dovish bank of japan with repeated commitment to keeping powerful monetary easing for an extended period surging crude oil and commodity prices in the aftermath of russia s invasion of ukraine have pointed to the worsening of the current account balance of the resource poor japan supporting yen weakness more broadly the prospect of yen depreciation underlines the fragility of the world s third largest economy with low growth potential analysts say the yen is currently facing a perfect storm said martin schulz chief policy economist at fujitsu ltd the divergence of monetary policies among the boj the fed and the european central bank has added to the momentum for yen weakness with the u s dollar in particular gaining from its show of strength during global financial sanctions against russia schulz said the dollar has hit a six year high above 119 yen after the fed s first rate hike decision since 2018 market watchers say the psychologically important 120 yen line is in sight before what is perceived as boj governor haruhiko kuroda s defense line of 125 yen the finance ministry and the boj cannot defend the yen against depreciation when demand is also driven by geopolitical trends schulz said adding that a further slide in the yen is possible a weaker yen however would deal a blow to consumers who are sensitive to price hikes as a growing number of companies have already been passing on higher energy and raw material costs it would also become a sensitive issue for prime minister fumio kishida in the lead up to this summer s upper house election as ruling party lawmakers are ramping up their calls for additional stimulus to help households hit by higher energy food and other prices amid uncertainty about the war in ukraine price hikes are good news for the boj as long as they are accompanied by strong wage growth so consumer demand will not be hurt commodity inflation is a mixed bag as core consumer inflation looks headed toward the boj s 2 percent target but as the governor has said the sustainability of such upward momentum is in question bolstering the case for no change in monetary policy so far kishida has not taken aim at the yen s weakness pushing up import costs saying that surging commodity prices are more to blame the fed is scrambling to tame inflation projected at 4 3 percent this year with six more rate hikes seen likely japan s consumer inflation has been picking up but at a much slower pace the core consumer price index excluding volatile fresh food items rose 0 6 percent in february from a year earlier for the united states a strong dollar is favorable when the biggest challenge is to curb inflation for japan a weak yen is good when the boj is aiming for the 2 percent target said masafumi yamamoto chief currency strategist at mizuho securities co yen weakness will likely continue as the gap between u s and japanese long term interest rates widens though the momentum may ease later this year if the pace of the fed s rate hikes slows in line with lower inflation analysts say facing lawmakers from the ruling liberal democratic party at its recent convention kishida sought to assure them that he is mindful of the negative impact from rising fuel and food prices on voters but he emphasized that japan is not in a state of deflation because of former prime minister shinzo abe s economy boosting program that entailed bold monetary easing by the boj my administration will build on the results of abenomics try to maximize them and create a sustainable economy kishida said as he called for party unity heading into the key national election likely to be held in july the prime minister has expressed hope that the boj will continue to guide its policy with the aim of achieving the 2 percent target kuroda said cost push inflation will not prompt the boj to change its policy and powerful easing will be in place until the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable way the central bank has been seeking to keep borrowing costs low for consumers and businesses with its yield curve control program inflation may accelerate toward 2 percent in april but it by no means will necessitate a modification of our current monetary policy kuroda said friday after a two day policy meeting with a recent announcement to buy an unlimited amount of 10 year japanese government bonds at a fixed rate kuroda has already made it clear that the boj will step in if japan s long term interest rates near its upper limit allowed under the yield curve control program as the boj has maintained ultraeasy monetary policy the yen s real effective exchange rate has fallen to its lowest level in half a century with analysts saying that reflects the relative decline of japan s economic power japan has failed to change into a high growth economy and the yen has weakened as a result there are limits to what monetary policy can do to make the economy stronger mizuho securities yamamoto said the ball is not in its court now related coverage boj keeps easing policy steady amid low inflation

i can t count the number of stories i ve written in recent years about longtime upper valley family businesses that have shut down because their owners retired and no one was interested in carrying them on so it is heartening to see two well known businesses both with deep roots in their communities but whose owners are retiring after decades of unremitting labor have found new owners to step in and in each case with promises of expansion including investing in online sales platforms to stay competitive charlie and kathy welch have sold welch s true value hardware in south royalton to massachusetts based aubuchon hardware which describes itself as the oldest family run hardware store business in the country and with stores in windsor and newport n h and formerly bradford vt is a familiar name in the upper valley meanwhile connecticut businessman dave manning has acquired green mountain smokehouse in windsor from koreen and jake henne rescuing the business at the last minute when the hennes had decided after two decades to retire and would have closed the smokehouse if a buyer hadn t stepped forward charlie welch began working at his family s hardware store in south royalton when he was in high school in the early 1960s joining full time in 1974 before eventually taking over the business from his father and uncle and moving it from chelsea street to its current route 14 location in 1988 he oversaw an expansion of the business that now has about 20 employees and until it closed in 2018 a second store in west woodstock on route 4 although he said the past two years business has been up and down his reason for selling the business to aubuchon is strictly a personal one i m 72 it s time he said last week crediting his wife kathy for being a significant part of this organization the store was rebranded aubuchon hardware as of march 14 according to will aubuchon chief executive of aubuchon hardware and the fourth generation of the family to run the business since it was founded in 1904 we are passionate about carrying the flag forward what charlie built is unique aubuchon said adding rule no 1 is to do no harm the only changes he foresees is broadening the inventory in the store and integrating the south royalton location into its online sales platform we are committed to the long term aubuchon said welch s like others in the building and tools industry has suffered from supply chain issues over the past couple years but aubuchon said his company which has 107 stores in the northeast commands considerable clout in obtaining products a few years ago aubuchon ended self distributing and contracted with third party warehouse distributors that greatly increased the number of products at its disposal to stock stores the most obvious change will be a lot more inventory people shouldn t worry that because it s an aubuchon store now whatever was there before is not going to be there now that s not the case at all he said aubuchon said the store will continue to draw on true value for some products although it will no longer be the south royalton store s principal supplier he also noted that charlie welch carried some products that aubuchon s does not normally sell such as lots of animal feed and that will continue we just want to keep it local and it s a total privilege to pick up the flag from charlie and his family aubuchon said quest for road food yields surprise discovery one day this winter manning the connecticut businessman and a self proclaimed foodie left his ski vacation home in ludlow in search of what he calls road food those out of the way spots along byways and back roads that offer distinctly american regional cooking and food manning knew exactly where he was headed green mountain smokehouse in windsor a small smokehouse operation run by the hennes that sells smoked meats and vermont maple syrup cured hams from its route 5 location and at a handful of markets around the upper valley when manning arrived he struck up a conversation with the couple who have run the smokehouse which also has commercial clients like robie farm in piermont since 2000 i said i d been meaning to come here for a year recalled manning who first learned about green mountain smokehouse on the blog roadfood oh you re in luck then manning said they responded because we re retiring and closing up that s when i let my mind wander and here i am manning said last week from green mountain smokehouse where he was working to familiarize himself with operations after buying the business last month manning a manufacturer s representative and owner of a medical instruments distribution company said his intention is to capitalize upon green mountain smokehouse s vermont roots in marketing he s redesigning the logo developing a website for online sales and adding three positions to the current five including a production manager moving up from north carolina to oversee the operation i can run the business side but jake specifically said to me i don t want you to buy the business unless you can find someone to run the production side manning said so he snooped around and discovered master smokers are a niche community but they will travel jake and koreen left a great foundation and strong business manning said i m interested in taking it to the next level the majority of the sales are within 50 miles but i want to try and take it national the hennes declined to comment other than to say that after 22 years they are looking forward to retirement contact john lippman at jlippman

by laura legere pittsburgh post gazette pittsburgh in the quest to avoid catastrophic climate change a movement is rising to put out the little fires burning in homes every day each flame fed by natural gas propane or oil in furnaces water heaters and stoves is a small source of greenhouse gas emissions all together burning fossil fuels for heating and cooking in homes and businesses adds up to roughly 13 of total climate warming emissions in the u s the push is on to switch to energy efficient electrical appliances powered by an increasingly cleaner grid even in southwestern pennsylvania where cold winters abundant natural gas and leaky aging homes make the transition a challenge in fact the pittsburgh homes of researchers policymakers and remodelers have been unofficial laboratories where failing furnaces and home improvement projects have inspired strategies for how the transition can happen here a key tool in this fight is an unglamorous household appliance the modern electric air source heat pump which efficiently moves heat rather than generating it for temperature control in buildings heat pumps are essentially air conditioners that can heat and cool spaces through whole house ducted systems or ductless mini splits for individual rooms in water heaters heat pumps take heat from the surrounding air and transfer it to water in the tank they are also effective dehumidifiers heat pumps are typically three times more efficient than fossil fuel heaters according to the international energy agency based in paris no more gas furnaces electrification advocates are seizing the moment to promote a switch that climate scientists say is critical for curbing warming in its pathway for the world to reach net zero energy related carbon emissions by 2050 the iea said sales of new fossil fuel furnaces should end in four years princeton researchers found that for the u s to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 the share of homes with electric heat pumps should more than double within this decade electrify everything is also being pitched as an opportunity to address energy costs especially the disproportionate burden that utility bills pose for low and moderate income households the pandemic exacerbated that burden a study by researchers at carnegie mellon and other universities found that school and business closures and other early covid 19 mitigation measures decreased commercial electricity use while increasing it by about 5 in the residential sector with low income and minority populations experiencing a larger impact prices for natural gas heating oil and propane reached decade high levels this winter as economies began to emerge from the pandemic pushing energy bills higher this winter if you had a heat pump to heat your home across the u s your heating costs will go up but 20 as opposed to 500 for fuel oil 600 for propane 160 for gas alex laskey co founder and executive chair of rewiring america told an audience at carnegie mellon s scott institute for energy innovation in december by our analysis 104 million households would save on their monthly bills if you could replace their existing heating technology with a new heat pump he said and it s disproportionate low and moderate income households have the most to save running hot and cold the technology needed to electrify homes can be deployed widely now an appealing factor when so much climate tech like carbon capture or green hydrogen needs huge investments and technological leaps before large scale deployment will be possible a recent study by researchers at the university of texas carnegie mellon and the university of michigan found that heat pump adoption makes sense everywhere in the u s in existing single family homes if reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the only goal that fit shrinks to about a third of u s homes when other considerations are taken into account including the cost of installing and running the systems and the health effects of conventional air pollution released by coal and gas fired plants powering the electric grid in pittsburgh about 5 of single family homes have heat pumps but it would make both economic and environmental sense for nearly 25 of the city s homes to adopt them the researchers found parth vaishnav an assistant professor at the university of michigan s school for environment and sustainability said some of the inspiration for the study came as he was preparing for the inevitable failure of his 20 year old furnace at his house in swissvale when he worked at carnegie mellon heating ventilation and air conditioning technicians discouraged him from considering a heat pump as a replacement heat pumps are also a good fit for households considering installing or replacing standard air conditioning he said summers in the region are getting increasingly hotter pennsylvania s most recent climate impacts report forecasts that southwestern pennsylvania will have between 41 and 62 days over 90 f by midcentury with a heat pump you ve got an air conditioner but for a couple thousand dollars extra you now have a very efficient heater which will actually reduce your heating costs for most of the year except when it gets really cold he said and when it gets really cold you can switch to a furnace manufacturers can also make air conditioners heat pump ready for a few hundred dollars extra which will help homeowners take incremental steps toward electrification the future in phases some experts agree pittsburgh s old and leaky housing stock requires a more nuanced approach than electrify everything all at once lucy de barbaro an energy efficiency advocate recommends installing heat pump water heaters whose costs are quickly recovered through savings and promotes induction cooktops which are safer more efficient and don t release indoor air pollution like gas ranges but she rarely recommends replacing boilers or furnaces with heat pumps because the region s aging homes lose so much of their heat through leaks and poor insulation she has encountered homes where the heating needs far outpaced their heat pumps capacity forcing them into their least efficient operating mode the owners ended up locked into paying as much as hundreds of dollars more in monthly electric bills it is just not a good solution unless you have dramatically improved the performance of the home to begin with if the home is old she said in most old homes air sealing and insulation should be the first investment to reduce energy demand she said and that can carry a considerable upfront cost that s what grant ervin chief resilience officer for the city of pittsburgh learned when he had an energy audit done on his century old house i couldn t successfully electrify my home until i was able to address insulation which also required me to address wiring he said there s a domino effect still he saved up to rewire and insulate his home and added split heat pump systems to provide cooling and supplement his existing furnace now he saves about 250 a month on his energy bills he said aj stones a penn township based contractor who specializes in energy efficient home remodeling said he almost exclusively installs heat pump water heaters when he s doing replacements but few other contractors buy them which means few warehouses stock them the hvac industry is experiencing a retirement wave and the aging workforce isn t apt to learn new systems he said he sees opportunity in a younger generation of both contractors and homeowners if we could start by just fixing these houses now at this phase everything would be in place for the next phase to move to electrification when we re ready he said consumers will have to prepare for the switch before their existing systems fail people don t make decisions until the water heater s flooding their basement he said the debate on new construction one area where experts agree electrification makes the most sense is in new buildings for new construction especially multifamily new construction heat pumps are a no brainer we should require that we build those buildings to be all electric vaishnav said you don t have to bake natural gas into an asset that s going to last 50 60 or 100 years we don t need to do that and we shouldn t the heat pump water heater in the home of toni walker

emergency measures such as working from home lower speed limits and car free sundays in cities should be used to cut oil demand and avert a crippling supply crisis caused by the war in ukraine the international energy agency has said it also suggested business flights are curbed public transport made cheaper or free and that motorists set their cars air conditioning systems to 3 degrees warmer in summer the measures are part of a ten point plan designed to cut fuel usage in order to avoid the biggest oil supply shock in decades reports the times sanctions and boycotts of russian oil are likely to remove 2 5 million barrels a day from the markets creating a real risk that markets tighten further and oil prices escalate significantly in the coming months as demand for oil typically peaks in july and august the agency said oil prices hit 139 a barrel earlier this month although the international benchmark brent crude was trading 1 2 per cent higher at 107 93 a barrel in new york on friday night march 18 it is believed such measures would cut global oil demand by 2 7 million barrels a day within four months oil markets are in an emergency situation and it may get worse fatih birol the agency s executive director said the world may well be facing its biggest oil supply shock in decades with huge implications for our economies and societies founded in 1974 the agency has 31 members that include britain america germany japan norway and australia birol called on members to take action on demand to avoid the risk of a crippling oil crunch many of the measures are aimed at reducing driving including working from home three days a week which has been proven successful in many cases during lockdown and could save 500 000 barrels of oil a day car free sundays could save around 380 000 barrels a day and access to cities could also be restricted to even or odd numbered registration plates on alternate weekdays other recommendations include cutting speed limits by at least 10km h saving 290 000 barrels of oil a day for cars and a further 140 000 from hgvs the agency suggests an increased use of car sharing and other measures to optimise fuel usage including urging drivers to restrict their use of air conditioning systems which account for four to 10 per cent of total fuel consumption for those car users who can we therefore propose a temporary 3c increase in the temperature setting to give an immediate improvement in fuel economy and cut fuel bills it said around two in every five business flights could be avoided by using virtual meetings as an effective substitute saving about 260 000 barrels of oil a day and about two per cent of all journeys made by jet could be shifted to highspeed rail the agency proposed it said that the world s advanced economies accounted for 45 per cent of global oil demand demand restraint is one of the emergency response measures that all member countries are required to have ready as a contingency at all times and that they can use to contribute to an iea collective action in an emergency it said the agency has co ordinated the release of emergency oil stocks by its members to help to ease prices a government spokesman said there is absolutely no need to apply this guidance in the uk and the recommendations are not under consideration we have no issues with either gas or oil supply unlike europe we are not dependent on russian energy imports for more stories from where you live visit inyourarea

last week the u s labor department admitted that inflation is running at nearly 8 the highest rate in 40 years since the government s inflation measures have been revised many times in those 40 years to diminish the calculation of price increases and thereby mislead the public some experts outside government maintain that the real inflation rate is 15 or even 20 also last week connecticut s members of congress boasted about all the goodies earmarks they had inserted into the 1 5 trillion federal appropriations bill the legislation according to connecticut s delegation all democrats is providing 144 million for 122 projects in the state altogether the legislation is said to have more than 4 000 earmarks among connecticut s are 2 5 million for the boys and girls club in milford 105 000 for an after school program in waterbury 2 million to start a worker owned commercial laundry in new haven 1 5 million to replace a bridge in middletown 1 8 million for water and sewer pipes in manchester 900 000 for johnson memorial hospital in stafford 34 000 for south windsor s emergency operations center and with perfect irony 160 000 for waste and sludge disposal in west haven whose city government lately has been full of waste and sludge the insiders who looted several times that amount from the city s most recent federal grant nobody in authority in connecticut last week put the record inflation together with another bloated appropriations bill or any recent appropriations bill nobody in authority linked the goodies to an increase in federal taxes for congress has discovered that federal taxes are obsolete because the government can create money to infinity as long as the federal reserve is ready to monetize government bonds and as long as nobody cares about the devaluation of the currency that results when the increase in the money supply outruns not just national production of goods and services but since the dollar is the reserve currency for the world international production as well instead the biden administration blamed the record inflation on russia s invasion of ukraine though the new inflation figures were calculated before the invasion and before economic sanctions disrupted international markets at least inflation has become a political issue in connecticut with governor lamont and both democratic and republican state legislators aiming to suspend or reduce state taxes on gasoline now that gas has reached 4 50 per gallon and seems likely to go higher while state government has a large financial surplus yes people deserve some relief but will anyone in authority in connecticut note that from its beginning three years ago the current democratic state administration and many democratic state legislators were openly striving to drive up the cost of conventional energy in the hope of making green energy more viable with gas approaching 5 a gallon the democrats now are getting exactly what they wanted or what they wanted until they got it if markets return to normal the democrats may return to their agenda of higher energy costs even though green energy is far from able to replace much conventional energy will anyone in authority in connecticut risk telling people that nice as some of the earmarks in the federal appropriations bill are few are relevant to the responsibilities of the federal government and that most are arbitrary patronage pork and will anyone in authority tell people that the pork is not really free that people are paying for it not through regular taxes but through currency depreciation inflation which is a tax as regressive as the gas taxes politicians now want to suspend chris powell writes for the journal inquirer in manchester

if you want to get rich get elected this truism is the worst kept secret in america as npr observed young investors have a new strategy watching financial disclosures of sitting members of congress for stock tips advertisement that racket was reported six months ago and nothing has changed since members of congress still enjoy unprecedented access to inside information and whenever there s a crisis they are quick to cash in on it the latest example involves russia s invasion of ukraine while congress was debating economic sanctions military assistance and billions of dollars in emergency spending to deal with this crisis in ukraine reports cnbc s ylan q mui more than a dozen members reported trades either their own or by their spouse or by their child in sectors that were directly affected by the war in ukraine cnbc estimates the total trading activity since feb 1 to be about 7 7 million it looks like congress saw this as a gold rush fox news jesse watters observed last week they knew what sanctions could be coming down and all they had dollar signs in their eyes members from both sides of the political aisle poured money into the market so as ukraine burned to the ground congress got rich advertisement waters pointed out that florida rep debbie wasserman schultz a democrat bought energy stocks in late january that shot through the roof since their purchase maybe she knew something we didn t watters concludes and unfortunately she s not alone the day before russian tanks crossed into ukraine gop rep marjorie taylor greene tweeted war and rumors of war is incredibly profitable and convenient advertisement she s right greene later revealed that just two days before russia s invasion she bought stock from a major defense contractor an oil company and an energy company in a statement to business insider greene said that her investment advisor has full discretionary authority over our accounts i guess we ll have to take her word on that advertisement this behavior is all too common when it comes to profiteering members of congress never let a major crisis go to waste consider some recent history on sept 16 2008 treasury secretary hank paulson and fed chairman ben bernanke held a secret conclave with members of congress as business insider noted in 2011 congressmen privy to this information reacted not by dropping everything and drawing up a plan to save the economy but by dumping stock and avoiding the losses everyone else would take in the coming month others bought stocks in financial firms that would later be saved by the federal government many americans learned about this from an episode of cbs s 60 minutes which first aired in november of 2011 advertisement during the health care debate of 2009 members of congress were trading health care stocks including house minority leader john boehner steve croft of 60 minutes said just days before the was finally killed off boehner bought health care stocks all of which went up as is the case with marjorie taylor greene boehner s spokesperson said the trades were made by boehner s financial advisor who he only consults with about once a year the 60 minutes report led to congress passing the stop trading on congressional knowledge stock act which prohibits any members or employees of congress from using any nonpublic information derived from the individual s position or gained from performance of the individual s duties for personal benefit how well did the new legislation work fast forward to the covid crisis when gop sen richard burr of north carolina one of only three senators to vote against the stock act was also one of four members of congress who made suspicious stock trades in 2020 the trades were made after receiving classified reports on covid 19 but before the general public realized the severity of the pandemic when it comes to profiteering members of congress never let a major crisis go to waste advertisement according to cnbc on february 13 2020 burr unloaded stock shares worth 630 000 to 1 7 million with 33 individual trades made on that single day the shares he sold represented a significant portion of his financial portfolio a week later the stock market began plummeting the fbi seized burr s phone and he stepped down from his committee chairmanship however the trump justice department ultimately decided not to charge him or any of the senators we shouldn t be surprised it s nearly impossible to prove that someone acted solely on insider information and even if someone is found to have violated the law and according to business insider s dave levinthal at least 57 members of congress have mind you that s just the ones we know about the penalties are puny advertisement the good news is that there is emerging bipartisan support for banning members of congress and their immediate families from investing in the stock market after opposing such efforts house speaker nancy pelosi who profited handsomely from curious stock market opportunities has now backtracked from her previous opposition to the idea in a perfect world virtue and a sense of responsibility would prevent most lawmakers from using their office to feather their nests absent that something has to be done to stop the appearance of impropriety because it is contributing to a sense that the game is rigged as the wealth gap between lawmakers and regular americans continues to widen trust in government has continued to erode i m not suggesting there is a direct correlation but anyone who cares about conserving american democracy should be concerned about these trends advertisement major problems in government don t often have easy solutions that s not the case here the right thing to do is obvious it s time to ban stock trading for members of congress and their families

menafn asia times as part of its deadly assault on ukraine russia has taken the rare step to use intellectual property rights as a war tactic in early march the russian government issued a decree saying that russian companies are no longer obliged to compensate owners of patents utility models and industrial designs from unfriendly countries these are the western states who have issued sanctions against russia including the uk and us this means that russian businesses can use intellectual property such as patented inventions or fashion designs without having to pay or seek the consent of the rights holders affected companies cannot enforce their patents and designs against russian imitators this effectively legalizes intellectual piracy in a country already known for failing to adequately protect intangible assets last year russia was added to a us government priority watch list of countries which do not sufficiently protect us intellectual properties vladimir putin s move is clearly a reaction to the west s economic sanctions and suspension of russia s trade privileges it is also an answer to many multinational companies decisions to cease doing business with russian companies sanctions and boycotts have massively affected the russian economy to the extent that the country is now on the verge of bankruptcy with interest rates having doubled the stock market has remained closed for weeks and the rouble has fallen dramatically unprecedented attack on intellectual property the suspension of intellectual property rights as an economic weapon in the context of a conflict is unprecedented at least in recent decades historical examples date back to the first world war when the us introduced the trading with the enemy act this act seized copyright and patents owned by enemy countries including the patent to aspirin famously a german invention following the war the aspirin trademark owned by the german pharmaceutical company bayer was given up to the us france uk and russia as part of germany s war reparations agreed in the treaty of versailles russian officials have hinted that other intellectual property rights owned by western countries may be soon restricted including software and trademarks this could allow local entrepreneurs to appropriate and exploit without permission and for free brands such as mcdonald s one russian restaurant chain has even recently adopted and applied to register locally a logo very similar to the famous golden arches mcdonald s perhaps the most famous western trademarks now at risk of intellectual piracy in russia photo al geba shutterstock the sanctions have also led a russian judge to dismiss a copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit brought by the british company that produces animated series peppa pig andrei slavinsky said in court that the unfriendly actions of the united states of america and affiliated foreign countries influenced his decision ukraine for its part has not been inactive in this intellectual property battle its ministry of defense recently hacked and leaked confidential documents it claimed to have taken from a russian nuclear power station does it violate international law russia s suspension of patents and other intellectual property rights owned by western companies may violate international treaties which protect these assets at a global level all countries of the world trade organization wto need to respect these laws and guarantee that foreign businesses can enforce intellectual property rights against imitators countries damaged by the russian measure may bring russia to a wto court and ask for additional sanctions to be imposed this would again hit russian businesses especially those which rely on brands and patented technology as well as the creative industry sector the only way russia could justify the measure would be to rely on a security exception made available by the wto itself this exception allows countries to take any action they consider necessary to protect their essential security interests in times of war but it has never been invoked by any state in the context of an armed conflict and therefore never tested before the wto judges if russia is expelled from the wto club as has been proposed that would paradoxically insulate it from global intellectual property challenges no country would be able to bring russia before a court of an organization it is no longer a member of these are predictions of what could happen if the war continues it goes without saying that a prompt end to the conflict may instead relax the tension between the west and russia and put an end to the current intellectual property battle enrico bonadio reader in intellectual property law city university of london and alina trapova assistant professor in law and autonomous systems university of nottingham this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original article

michael hicks special to the star press over the past year i ve had a friendly disagreement with a couple colleagues together we ve authored several studies about economic development our work focuses on the role quality of life plays in population and job growth this work uses statistical models to tease out how families and businesses rank every county in the u s on quality of life the way this works is fairly intuitive but it benefits from an economic thought experiment suppose every home in america were identical with the same construction color scheme size and appliances in that case the difference in home prices would tell us how much residents valued the community containing the home higher prices mean nicer communities and lower prices mean less attractive communities now suppose every worker in america were identical with the same education and experience and only one occupation were available in that case any wage difference would reflect how desirable the location was workers would demand a wage premium to live in an unpleasant place and take a lower wage to locate somewhere nice these dynamics are known to every realtor and human resource professional in america more from michael hicks economic lessons from america s most experienced avon lady of course we don t have identical homes or workers but we can create statistically identical homes and workers by controlling for those things we know affect the price of a home or worker wages using that statistical model of home prices and wages we can predict fairly well what the home price and wage will be in almost every county but the part we cannot predict the unexplained home price and wage tells us how american families and businesses value each county in the nation this modest little measurement isn t perfect but it explains a large proportion of population growth and an even larger share of employment growth among u s counties in fact it explains more job growth than differences in tax rates tax incentives economic development spending highways or infrastructure spending combined this measure is much like a stock market price for every county by itself this measure doesn t explain why families and businesses are choosing these places to why they chose each place we correlated our measure of quality of life against roughly 500 different measures of amenities and local conditions this was the interesting part that causes the friendly disagreement among the research team some of the results made sense such as a slightly warmer january temperature or cooler july along with mountains there s not much for a policymaker to change here we found higher quality of life in places that had more arts and recreation establishments more grocery stores and more recreational establishments these are the big things that mother nature and the private sector provide however none of these things really explained much of the difference between quality of life in the united states the most significant factor was the share of the county gdp spent on k 12 education number two was a low crime rate and our third largest effect was a healthy environment as measured in resident average health these findings weren t surprising economists have known for half a century that school quality alone accounts for about 30 of the price differences in homes we ve also known that crime reduces the value of a home while places with more recreational opportunities affect home prices what surprised us was how large these effects were and the best example was school spending and hilliness our model suggests that a 10 increase in school spending has a larger effect on quality of life than moving pike s peak into your county these results are not the source of our friendly disagreement we agree on the math which remains relatively immune to political disagreement we also believe the results are not precisely measuring school spending crime or local health the spending is really a symptom of something more fundamental in local government the reason for this is that places with good schools also have low crime and healthier people also nicer places spend more money on their schools and better funded schools are nicer places to live again that isn t my feeble opinion it is the result of a statistical model that revealed household and employer preferences in more than 3 100 u s counties of course some readers will doubt the value of statistical models and we acknowledge their imperfections looking at the results the least desirable county in the nation which has lost 85 of its population is found in strip mined west virginia the nation s most desirable county includes a hawaiian beach more impressively our model identified several outliers these were places that did hugely better or worse than expected we did this as a way to identify which places to visit to learn what our data might be missing the big outlier we found was initially a big puzzle it has mountains a nice lake and airport a local college and decent schools after some digging we found that it is the national headquarters of the kkk that s pretty good work for a statistical model of unexplained variation in home prices and wages the friendly disagreement among coauthors comes in how to interpret these results in a political context my coauthors are progressive and passionate about progressive ideas i am a conservative and value limited government and free markets our friendly debate centers on their belief that the quality of life issues we identify result in progressive policy options on this they are mistaken to be sure higher government spending on schools hiking trails or blight removal are popular among progressives but fundamentally quality of life policies are classically conservative rather than progressive traditional conservatism in the united states always cherished local governance local institutions and the sovereignty of the individual this is the conservatism of james madison s vision of government edmund burke s description of civic life and adam smith s description of free markets the ideas about quality of life aren t just conservative political theory they are conservative in practice for example the state of indiana calls for knowledge and learning essential to the preservation of a free government and calls upon the legislature to fund and encourage education this is hardly the cry of progressivism and with crime rates ranking as the second most important factor there are no calls to defund the police in our statistical model moreover about half of indiana s counties have higher quality of life measures than san francisco that should surprise no one familiar with the deep failings of san francisco s local government still we hoosier conservatives must admit to ourselves at least that we are focusing too few resources on the most important parts of quality of life that is why most of our state bleeds people one thing my progressive colleagues and i agree upon is that if we don t do better we should expect a smaller poorer state in the years to come michael j hicks is the director of the center for business and economic research and the george and frances ball distinguished professor of economics in the miller college of business at ball state university
menafn swissinfo swi swissinfo ch in switzerland the price of gas is now 12 times what it was last summer have you ever seen such a price increase rené bautz no its an absolute record the rates have climbed to 345 chf356 per megawatt hour mwh they used to average 30 however europe still has enough gas with stocks at 30 russia still supplies 250 million cubic metres a day the price increase is mostly just an emotional reaction it s not very cold now and the temperatures will warm up with the start of spring our forecasts say that prices will increase considerably this summer and go down again next winter external content swi how can we cope with price spikes in the markets r b once spring comes gas companies will be filling up their underground reserves in france italy belgium germany and so on the biggest reserves in europe are held in these underground storage tanks the reserves that gaznat has acquired in france mean we can be more or less independent for several weeks next winter consumption in winter is five or six times higher than in summer so we will have to invest more in storage in switzerland projects are going to be starting up again such as in the underground chambers of upper valais region and the rocky massif of the grimsel which is a chf400 million 425 million project but it s not just gas electricity production in the main european countries also depends on russian coal all the energy sources coming from russia are at stake more more what the ukraine war means for switzerland s energy policy this content was published on mar 19 2022 mar 19 2022 switzerland gets almost half of its gas from russia an analysis of how the country s energy policy is being affected by the war in ukraine swi washington has decided to do without oil and gas from russia the european union also says it wants to reduce its dependence but can europe get by without russian gas r b the us are actually exporters of gas whereas the proportion of russian gas imported by the europeans is as high as 40 for 2021 in the gaznat zone which includes western switzerland we think it s about 25 the russian contribution is even bigger in german speaking switzerland to shut down all russian gas would mean a big challenge for replenishing our stocks this summer there would have to be new long term contracts and major investments in liquid gas in europe which would take three to four years bern has asked the swiss gas industry association to examine the security of supply we re dealing with a major policy shift here it s going to be a watershed external content swi what supply alternatives are there r b there s north africa the caspian sea and the north sea with the baltic pipe under construction to link norway to poland via denmark there s another project in egypt with deposits discovered in the mediterranean it would also be feasible to increase imports of liquid natural gas but there would need to be ports able to liquify that gas at 163 c to compress its volume then warm it up at destination germany which imports 49 of its gas from russia hasn t a single one swi how much of an increase should the swiss consumer expect r b it really depends on the distributors and their policy on managing price increases the price of gas includes the price per molecule transportation taxes mineral oils and co2 which have increased steeply and not forgetting vat of course these taxes amount to some 30 one solution would be to reduce vat 7 7 temporarily and bring down some of the other taxes one of our main fears is seeing a growing number of consumers who have trouble paying their bills even if there is not yet a problem in switzerland 100 million european consumers are in this situation petroleum gas and electricity everything going up at once what will be the situation next autumn we just don t know a tanker carrying cooled liquified natural gas at a temperature of 163 c gaznat swi will gas distributors make a profit from rising prices r b they mostly belong to public utility companies each one has its own pricing policy if gas is dearer the higher costs will have to be passed on to the customers to a certain extent if it goes above a certain level that may reduce demand people may start to use less energy insulate their homes or even adopt other alternatives but there are risks such as electricity black outs swi gas is now more of an issue for the federal government isn t it r b bern is studying the idea of building three new high performance power stations using gas with eight of the potential sites in french speaking switzerland in the end two or three of the proposed sites will be approved and shared between french and german speaking regions of switzerland if possible near a gas pipeline and an electrical switching station in the existing industrial areas the administrative procedures and timeframes will have to be fast tracked more more join the discussion climate change simon bradley what s the most promising future energy source we d be interested to hear your thoughts on the potential benefits and drawbacks of renewable energies swi is it still going to be feasible to abandon fossil fuels by 2050 as the government has planned r b gas is not out of the picture yet even though it has been called into question in the long term we will have to decarbonise our fossil energy bit by bit and develop renewable energies as well as vegetable based biomass which is a potential switzerland has hardly looked at yet electrifying everything wouldn t work and would cost too much it would be

raising interest rates once is unlikely to have a major impact but the cumulative effect could spell trouble the federal reserve just raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 in an effort to contain inflationary pressures that have reached a forty year high the federal reserve s move appears to have many americans on edge but greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com told cnbc that one single quarter point rate hike from near zero levels will have a minimal impact on household finances however if the current inflationary environment continues the federal reserve also penciled in rate increases at each of the six remaining meetings this year which would point to a consensus funds rate of 1 9 percent by the end of the year the cumulative effect of rate hikes is what is really going to have an impact on the economy and household budgets mcbride added borrowing costs the rate hike will surely be bad news for potential homebuyers the average thirty year fixed rate home mortgage is now above 4 percent and will likely trek steadily higher going forward according to cnbc a 300 000 30 year fixed rate mortgage would cost you about 1 432 a month at a 4 rate if you paid 4 5 instead then the same loan would cost 131 a month more or another 1 572 each year and 47 160 over the loan s lifetime potential car buyers should note that a quarter percentage point difference on a 40 000 loan is about 5 a month or another 300 over the life of a five year loan it s also smart to keep a close eye on credit card interest rates which could start climbing higher within a billing cycle or two if you owe 5 000 on a credit card with an apr of 19 and put 250 a month towards the balance it will take 25 months to pay it down and cost you 1 060 in interest charges the business news outlet noted if the apr edges up to 20 you ll pay an extra 73 in interest affecting investments higher rates going forward could also have major impacts on stocks and cryptocurrencies according to some experts the prospect of elevated rates is already creating higher volatility in the market the stock market is forward looking so just the expectation of higher rates has had an impact caleb tucker director of portfolio strategy at merit financial advisors in the atlanta area told bankrate com since the start of this year the s p 500 has fallen about 12 percent while the tech heavy nasdaq composite has dropped by 18 percent assets that have benefited most from ultra low interest rates think high octane growth stocks with earnings well off into the future and non cash flow generating assets like cryptocurrencies have been most susceptible to a pullback given the prospect of higher interest rates mcbride said ethen kim lieser is a washington state based science and tech editor who has held posts at google the korea herald lincoln journal star asianweek and arirang tv follow or contact him on linkedin image reuters
menafn afp two years ago the american liquified natural gas lng company tellurian was in free fall its stock price collapsed it laid off 40 percent of its staff and suspended a key project in louisiana now executive chairman charif souki says investors are lining up at the door to ask me can we finance your project at the annual ceraweek energy conference in houston souki told afp that lng projects have been boosted by the renewed emphasis on energy independence after russia s invasion of ukraine global market demand and the desire of the europeans to divest from their reliance on russian gas those are all positive market signals which will obviously help stimulate those projects and get them moving towards final investment decisions said charlie riedl vice president of the natural gas industry s advocacy group on march 8 the united states banned all imports of lng petroleum and coal from russia and has for years encouraged its european allies to decrease their dependence on their eastern neighbor the white house in a statement also argued that federal policies are not limiting the production of oil and gas to the contrary the biden administration has been clear that in the short term supply must keep up with demand it added eight lng terminals operate in the united states pumping out 14 billion cubic feet 400 million cubic meters per day and fourteen other terminals have already been approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that s the case for driftwood lng tellurian s future liquefaction plant and export terminal south of lake charles louisiana stalled for a year and a half the company will finally break ground on the massive project next month once completed the site will be able to export 3 6 billion cubic feet per day charif said that in principle we should be able to provide lng in 2026 to the oil companies shell vitol and gunvor the gulf coast will see plant construction accelerate in the coming months five projects have already been approved by ferc in louisiana with seven more in texas and mississippi faster regulatory approvals since its first exports in 2016 the gulf coast has become a key hub for global lng shipments a network of pipelines connects the states ports to gas fields across the country from the permian and haynesville basins in the south to the marcellus the country s largest onshore reserve in the northeast once the gas arrives on the coast it is liquified and transferred onto lng tankers most of which head off to europe earlier this month not far from the future tellurian site venture global lng saw its first tanker depart from its brand new calcasieu pass terminal the export terminal and its accompanying liquefaction plant were built off the coast of louisiana in just 29 months a record time for such a project according to the company s ceo mike sabel he added that in his estimation the government s regulatory approvals for both calcasieu and another project near new orleans have been faster than they were before the war in ukraine they re being very supportive so i m very optimistic that they re going to approve projects more quickly he said a lose lose lose proposition in a room reserved for him at the ceraweek convention sabel shows a few journalists a video of tugboats which he said were named after his children maneuvering near the new plant he notes another reason for the sector to celebrate in early february the european commission ruled that gas could under certain conditions contribute to the fight against climate change that s a big deal for banks that are sensitive to policy pressure and public pressure to support the infrastructure investments he said according to the natural gas supply association each liquefaction plant requires an investment of 10 to 20 billion only nuclear power plants require more up front capital however not everyone is so happy about the gas sector s bright future expanding gas production in the us is a lose lose lose proposition for communities in the gulf of mexico europe and the climate nikki reisch of the center for international environmental law ciel told afp lng has all the climate impacts of fracked gas plus the added emissions from energy intensive liquefaction cooling and transportation what s more it puts the health and livelihoods of people on the fencelines of extraction and export at risk she added the war should be an impetus for increasing investments in renewables electrification and efficiency not doubling down on dirty energy sources she said

take lyme s first carbon project which it developed a decade ago in mountains east of nashville when the company acquired a huge swath of land there in 2007 it agreed to sell a restrictive easement to the state of tennessee on almost 5000 acres about 2023 hectares this restriction barred lyme from doing any timber harvesting and it protected the habitat of several vulnerable species including the cerulean warbler a sky blue songbird zero impact when a carbon project developer informed lyme several years later that it could sell carbon credits on the already protected land hourdequin could scarcely believe it after all the company had already been compensated to safeguard the forest it was legally prohibited from cutting any of the trees any carbon revenue it received would have zero impact on the atmosphere we kind of scratched our heads and said really you can do this hourdequin says in fact they could and it was quite common the project was enrolled in california s carbon market which requires polluters in the state to shrink their emissions and allows them to purchase offsets including from out of state projects such as lyme s in tennessee to achieve some of their reductions chevron which operates several oil fields and refineries in california purchased more than 20 000 of lyme s tennessee credits to meet its requirements this means some of chevron s pollution cuts are in fact fictitious chevron declined to comment the brisk sales of meaningless offsets is leading to widespread claims of climate progress that isn t actually happening as bloomberg green previously reported environmental groups such as the nature conservancy and the national audubon society have sold credits for protecting trees that weren t in danger of being harvested leading to misleading claims of emissions reductions by walt disney jpmorgan chase and other companies meanwhile north america s largest carbon reforestation project greentrees has sold credits for trees that were already planted through government programs sometimes more than a decade earlier resulting in inflated carbon reduction claims by bank of america and many others the nature conservancy audubon and greentrees all said their projects followed the market s rules while disney jpmorgan and bank of america each declined to comment jim hourdequin near the lyme timber office in l anse michigan bloomberg there s a distinct possibility that a great deal of existing carbon offsets are effectively fake says robert mendelsohn professor of forest policy and economics at yale hourdequin isn t the only one who sees that the market is at a crucial inflection point kyle harrison who closely tracks carbon offsets as the head of sustainability research for bloombergnef a clean energy research group published a report in january that offered wildly divergent scenarios for offsets if the market undergoes substantial improvements delivers higher quality projects and fetches higher prices it could soar to us190 billion in value by 2030 but the offsets industry could also wither away and die without substantial changes the current design of the voluntary carbon market is doomed to fail harrison wrote advertisement hourdequin is fully aware that there are downsides to speaking out by essentially admitting the company has abetted corporate greenwashing and undermined efforts to tackle climate change he exposes lyme to criticism and risks losing business from offset buyers who may prefer to purchase credits from forest owners who stubbornly insist their projects are exemplary the spouting whale gets the harpoon hourdequin acknowledges but he says a transformation can t happen without an honest self appraisal his hope is that the market will tighten its rules and force landowners to change their behaviour so they can deliver true carbon savings if this happens he expects carbon prices to soar and companies such as lyme to start managing forests for the value of carbon as much as they do for timber i want carbon offsets to be respected as a solution hourdequin says the future of this market is going to be about behaviour change we re all going to have to design projects that are going to actually change practices and remove co₂ from the air as an undergrad at dartmouth college hourdequin spent a lot of time beneath the canopies of forests he studied ecology and evolutionary biology and spent several summers building trails in new hampshire s white mountains when it came time to write his senior thesis he examined how young stands of northern spruce fir regenerate after college he started a logging company with two partners cutting up trees with chainsaws and actually managing forests was a much more exciting endeavour than research he says hourdequin joined lyme after finishing business school in 2005 and he took over as ceo in 2016 when the company began exploring its first carbon deal in tennessee a decade ago the market was in its infancy and in some ways the requirements seemed daunting counting the carbon sequestration for the next century lyme would need to pay tens of thousands of dollars every six years to have foresters come and measure a sampling of its trees to quantify how much carbon was being locked away if lyme ever sold the property the requirements of the offsets deal would transfer to the new owner hourdequin had no clue if these added obligations would torpedo the land s value we were basically scared out of our minds he says he rationalised the project s lack of climate benefits as a necessary first step people thought these were the things that were needed to get this market started hourdequin says you ve got to make it an easy win for the landowner to sign up for a 100 year obligation nobody really knew what they were getting into advertisement lyme began developing a string of carbon projects but hourdequin was struck by how often they received large volumes of lucrative credits for creating few additional climate benefits one deal netted lyme about us20 million about 26 9 million for minor changes to a forest in west virginia after purchasing a huge hardwood forest there in 2017 it put together a carbon project on 47 000 acres about 19 000 hectares of forbidding terrain some of the land is so rugged and steep hourdequin says the trees can be extracted only by helicopter which is prohibitively expensive nonetheless california s carbon market would pay lyme handsomely to preserve these little threatened trees to entice landowners with richly stocked forests california gives valuable upfront credits for these bigger than average trees the landowner must then preserve this larger volume for a century seemingly a win for the climate for lyme though us20 million wasn t necessary to maintain this higher volume of trees because it didn t make economic sense to cut them society probably didn t need to pay us for that hourdequin says lyme has since scaled back some of its harvests in west virginia to collect higher annual carbon payments which could help the atmosphere but in total the company has received credits for the property that vastly exceed the climate benefits pacific gas and electric chevron and pbf energy a petroleum refiner have all purchased hundreds of thousands of credits from this west virginia project to meet california s emission requirements pg e and pbf also both declined to comment although the project has been a dud for the climate hourdequin strongly denies that lyme is a profiteer even carbon projects with scant climate benefits can be expensive he says it costs money to measure the trees and the carbon rules limit a company s ability to sell off or develop parts of the land landowners must also apply some of california s more stringent forestry rules to their carbon acreage which can mean less fertiliser and smaller clear cuts these rules stick with the land for a century and lower its value with carbon prices hovering around us10 13 47 to us13 17 50 per ton hourdequin says the payments are far too low to cover both this lost value and any changes to how lyme would manage its forests big payouts for little benefit to get around these challenges a budding industry of carbon project developers has worked shoulder to shoulder with landowners including lyme to pinpoint the tracts of land that can generate the largest quantities of carbon credits for the smallest changes to the forest this tactic deprives the atmosphere and the public by finding the biggest payout for the tiniest climate benefit advertisement unfortunately the market is now awash in these types of projects according to grayson badgley who examines offset projects as a research scientist for the nonprofit carbonplan the way the market is currently constructed it just does not promote quality he says the atmosphere gets left holding the bag last year hourdequin began tinkering with a simple idea to fix the market instead of looking for forests that can generate lots of offsets with few changes what if this whole approach was flipped on its head start with honest to goodness carbon savings by planning to cut fewer trees and see how much it would cost to implement hourdequin and his staff set to work looking at a half million acres about 202 000 hectares of michigan forestland it began acquiring in 2019 the previous owners had aggressively harvested the land and lyme was planning on a similar model hourdequin asked what if lyme reduced the planned harvest by about 15 per cent per year his team spent days digging into their forest models and spreadsheets they calculated that simply implementing the offset project such as paying for measurement of the trees and restricting their ability to sell small parcels of the land would cost about us30 40 40 per ton then the carbon benefits from cutting fewer trees would cost another us30 per ton all told it would require 60 per ton to set up an offset project that could have real climate benefits could they actually sell credits for that much price signals from the us1 billion about 1 35 billion trade in offsets aren t promising ecosystem marketplace which tracks the industry reported an average price last year of us3 37 4 54 per ton some buyers are willing to pay more microsoft says it averages us20 26 94 per ton and bill gates spends us600 808 per ton to neutralise emissions from his private jet but many others are paying less delta air lines declared itself carbon neutral last year after purchasing 13 million offsets at a cost of us30 million 40 4 million or about us2 31 3 11 per ton undaunted hourdequin pitched his idea to a forest industry conference in october with a speech titled you get what you pay for he immediately got to the point telling his audience of fellow forest managers that offsets weren t delivering on their promise it can be argued he said that carbon markets have paid the landowner to not do what they were not going to do he conceded that us60 80 80 per ton was substantially out of market but in effect he was challenging the industry to raise its standards the speech didn t make waves a recording on youtube has garnered only about 100 views a handful of attendees sent hourdequin polite messages afterward expressing agreement but carbon market observers hold out hope that a major seller of carbon credits such as hourdequin could help push the market toward improvement our belief is that transparency is good says matthew potts chief science officer at carbon direct which advises companies on carbon reduction strategies it s nice that producers of projects are speaking out advertisement big offset buyers haven t exactly jumped at lyme s new us60 credits the company pitched its project to a major bank which hourdequin won t identify the bank declined hourdequin then discussed the idea with a couple of large tech companies one praised his speech and expressed an interest in future collaboration but both companies have thus far demurred even if hourdequin were to find buyers at us60 per ton it s not clear that lyme s new approach to offsets would be good enough reducing harvests on working timberlands could cause another landowner somewhere else to cut more trees to fill the demand for lumber a phenomenon known as leakage various carbon market rules try to address this by docking the number of credits granted to certain forest projects by anywhere from 10 per cent to 40 per cent but many experts say the actual leakage rate is much higher if somebody in topeka wants to build a deck they re buying those two by fours from somewhere says michael raynor a managing director at deloitte services hourdequin agrees that leakage is a major issue that hasn t been adequately sorted out but he says harvest reductions can still have a positive climate impact lyme isn t the only outfit exploring different ideas to improve carbon offsets the science based targets initiative considered the gold standard of carbon reduction efforts published guidance in october that urged companies to limit offsets to projects that actually remove heat trapping gases from the atmosphere this kind of project would include new tree plantings and machines that pull co₂ out of the air while the initiative is seeking to tighten the pool of credible offsets it hasn t yet defined whether projects such as lyme s would make the cut meanwhile the taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets an initiative launched in 2020 by united nations climate envoy mark carney recently spun out an integrity council which says it will produce tools to help assess the credibility of offset projects later this year pachama a carbon technology company has been working for two years to write a new carbon protocol which it says will use satellite data and machine learning to better quantify a project s true climate benefits the start up claims this protocol will more accurately compare different types of landowners closing loopholes used by projects today to inflate the number of credits they receive deloitte meanwhile is developing types of offset transactions that it says could funnel large sums of money to quality reforestation projects it s too soon to tell whether any of these new initiatives will improve the market but a key first step hourdequin says is honestly taking stock of how carbon projects have performed ten years into this market i think it s fair to be asking whether these projects are delivering climate mitigation he says if they re not it s fair to begin demanding that they do bloomberg

about these assets the basics of precious metals silver silver is a precious metal with both industrial and perceived value which makes its price sway in the market to a point of being more unstable than gold while silver will trade in line with gold as an item to be hoarded the industrial supply demand equation for the metal exerts an equally strong influence on its price silver is 19 times more abundant than gold in the earth s crust and is the best natural reflector and conductor of heat and electricity among all metals therefore although it has a long history as money over the last century it has evolved into multiple innovative and strategic uses that effectively consume the majority of newly mined silver silver s use in batteries superconductor applications and microcircuit markets silver coins when it comes to buying silver there are several options however people are opting to buy coins since not in vain in addition to their undoubted profitability as an investment silver coins are tremendously attractive and eye catching making them a highly sought after target for collectors silver coins made before 1964 in the u s contain about 90 of this precious metal which means that the sheer amount of silver in them set their value with silver coins as it is with silver bullion investors make money every time the price of silver soars since the actual metal does not generate any cash flow that s the only way of getting it to yield profit collectible coins are also available and very much sought after by collectors however by being special pieces they are more expensive and you could end up paying more for the actual silver amount in it as gold and silver coins are highly coveted items you must be sure to protect yours very well from thieves and scammers junk silver coins made of 90 silver are coveted by investors and dealers who pay for how much silver there is in each one of them other coins have lower percentages of silver content and are therefore less valuable these are junk silver which refers to any high silver content coin that is not considered collectible and that has no numismatic value there are several examples the war nickels produced during ww2 only contain 35 of silver while 40 of the kennedy half dollars minted between 1965 1970 is considered a precious metal in general lines silver coins made before 1965 are considered junk silver they can often be most easily distinguished from lower silver content coins by appearance the edge will not show the telltale copper streak but will appear silver all the way through silver rounds rounds are minted by private mints and have no face value they re not intended to ever circulate as currency in this sense silver rounds store value based on how much silver content they have hence silver rounds are cheaper than silver coins especially those considered collectible they pretty much resemble a coin with their oval shape but cannot be used as legal tender and come in different sizes small 1 10 oz large 5 oz two of the most recognized brands in the u s are sunshine minting inc and silvertowne mint with the former adding counterfeit technology a few years ago gold gold is the holy grail of precious metals as it is durable it doesn t oxidize malleable and is a great electricity and heat conductor despite being widely known for its application in jewelry and as a currency it is also used in several industries especially electronics and dentistry gold coins when it comes down to gold coins you should be interested in their intrinsic value as a gold coin can be valued in three different ways the first one is the intrinsic value of the currency which is based on its amount of gold coins whose value depends primarily on their weight in gold are known as bullion coins face value is its value as legal tender except for the south african krugerrand all gold coins have some value in the currency of the country of issue numismatic value is the value of a coin according to its history or rarity the price of the coin can skyrocket if it is no longer manufactured or is in demand by many collectors when buying bullion coins it is important to pay attention to the year of issue of the coin coins issued during the current year typically have a higher premium than random year coins gold rounds like silver rounds gold rounds are minted by private mints and have no face value they re also not intended to ever circulate as currency gold rounds are an effective way to invest in physical gold especially if you intent to store them in a renowned insured precious metals storage facility also if you have a working use for the gold such as in electronics manufacturing or the arts these large gold bullion bars are the most cost efficient way to buy it however if you don t plan to use them in any way gold rounds could be expensive to liquidate when taken out of the storage facility you may encounter assay refining or just handling fees in trying to liquidate that size gold bullion bar copper it is a reddish precious metal with bright hues it is malleable ductile and a good electricity conductor which makes it a great option for industrial usage it was one of the first metals to be used by humans in prehistory times besides its high electrical and thermal conductivity it is highly resistant to corrosion and has a great ability to form metal alloys copper has ease of hot and cold deformation so it can be molded into wires and plates or sheets just like gold silver and platinum copper gets made into bars and ingots copper bars are typically minted to high levels of purity and come in varying sizes typically small bars are one ounce in size but mints also produce copper bullion bars in sizes as large as 10 pounds platinum and palladium platinum is an especially rare precious metal and 30 grams of pure platinum requires 10 tons of platinum ore purifying platinum can take up to 5 or 6 months south africa is currently the largest platinum producer followed by russia and zimbabwe given the strength and durability of platinum most platinum jewelry 85 to 99 is made of pure platinum the rest is complemented with iridium ruthenium or cobalt platinum rings marked 900 or 950 are made of 90 and 95 pure platinum respectively as with other precious metals one way to invest in platinum is to simply buy physical platinum in either coins or bullion regarding the former it should be said that several mints around the world mint platinum coins a downside to buying physical platinum however is that in most countries you have to pay vat this is in contrast to gold whose investment products are often vat exempt platinum has become substantially cheaper compared to gold over the last two decades until the 2008 crisis the ratio was around 2 this means that one ounce of platinum allowed people to buy two ounces of gold similarly palladium is a precious metal with very high value it s soft and malleable when heated and greatly increases its strength and hardness when cold processed at room temperature palladium has the unusual property of absorbing up to 900 times more hydrogen than its own volume this is one of its valuable qualities and makes it so sought after by the automotive industry although not as well known as other precious metals such as gold silver and platinum palladium offers strong potential investment opportunities the most popular reasons that are driving more and more people to invest in palladium are its wide industrial use protection against inflation the growing demand of the automotive industry and the rapid price growth selecting a silver bullion company shipping costs shipping costs are certainly a key element in the equation when buying silver from a silver bullion company depending on the quantity or the cost of your purchase some companies can offer you free shipping at a minimum premiums over spot this aspect depends on what type of silver you re buying silver rounds offer a low premium only behind silver bars on the other hand silver coins have the highest premiums but also the amount you purchase will play a key role everyone wants a deal but for some silver stackers buying silver at spot price isn t necessarily about saving a dollar or two on an american silver eagle many are prospectors at heart hunters in spirit fees for certain types of payment methods regarding fees and commissions this is something you would have to be very careful and research the small print before every purchase as it depends on what you re buying for example the professional numismatists guild says that the average retail commission for one ounce american eagle or maple leaf gold coins is roughly 5 or 6 check or bank wire usually get discounts so you should keep an eye on them before buying buy back rates if spot prices rise silver bullion companies can buy back precious metals depending on how much the price fluctuates the soaring price reduces the supply of certain bars coins or rounds so dealers may want to get their hands on as much of the metal as possible buy back rates are something to consider as bullion and coin dealers are always aware of the market s movement and are willing to buy back at their stated buy back prices locked in prices usually bullion firms will lock prices once you place your order so be aware of this feature for a peaceful purchase insurance silver bullion firms with safekeeping options offer insurance against fire theft or any disastrous event depending on the conditions if you are to take the safekeeping option this is something you must look at why purchase silver dollars pros purchasing silver dollars has several advantages they are definitely an investment as well as an inflation hedge while stocks bonds and other financial products are good investments they are still digital promissory notes susceptible to depreciation silver on the other hand is a tangible asset even in an economic collapse silver has always held value cons silver dollars can leave you vulnerable to theft unlike most other investments such as stocks further as dave ramsey says the prices of gold and silver are so unstable and have been over time that the only use for them in an economic crisis would be to hope someone would take your silver coins or watch in exchange for a pack of toilet paper or a can of gas faqs where is the best place to buy silver at the best price there is no single answer to this as you would want to buy silver from the company that offers you the lowest spot price insurance free shipping lower fees and commissions if you find it and it s exactly what offers what you re looking for it will certainly be the best place either online or brick and mortar where is a trusted place to buy silver any of the places mentioned above are well renowned if you want to invest in physical silver still you can check user reviews on platforms like trustpilot to check for the most reliable places what is the best silver to buy right now silver coins command a higher premium hottest options right now include silver american eagle arguably the most popular silver us coin to invest in silver canadian maple leaf canadian maple leaf chinese silver panda and the 1964 kennedy half dollar what is the cheapest way to buy silver silver bars are usually the cheapest way to buy silver very often coins trade just above the spot price while silver bars can be purchased a few cents above thereof gram for gram silver bars are the cheapest way final thoughts silver bars gold bars silver bullion coins and even rare coins are a good investment option any precious metal doesn t depend on any government and by being limited resources the price can only go up however some of them can fluctuate significantly so it s best to educate yourself on how to trade with them
a vision driven product begins with a clear picture of the change you want to bring to the world this vision must then permeate every aspect of the product s design get the full ray dalio series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on ray dalio in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q3 2021 hedge fund letters conferences and more tesla s model 3 vs gm s chevy bolt for a great case study on how a vision driven product is fundamentally different from an iteration led one consider the comparison between tesla inc nasdaq tsla s model 3 and general motors company nyse gm s chevy bolt sandy munro a well known automotive expert shared a detailed comparison of the model 3 and the bolt after taking apart the two cars and painstakingly analyzing each component munro summarizes his findings in an autoline after hours interview describing the bolt as a good car but he was far more excited by the model 3 tesla has the best design for electronics the best harness design the best driving experience the best motor everything apart from the skin is brilliant his only criticism of the model 3 was the body an area where tesla has admitted to having problems munro gives an example of tesla s vision driven innovation a smaller cheaper and more powerful engine he says he had heard about the hall effect in electric motors which can make the motor 40 percent faster but had never seen it used in electric vehicle ev engines in his teardown comparisons to date tesla was the only carmaker using the hall effect for its engine it required tesla to invent a new manufacturing process to glue together magnets of opposing polarity under high stress munro had never seen anything like tesla s magnets before and couldn t figure out how anyone could mass produce them compare that to his description of the approach gm took to build the bolt gm doesn t have a lot of money to spend on designing every vehicle from scratch so they started with a spark chassis outsourced the battery and got a car to market quickly gm was iteration led and found a local maximum in the bolt the difference between how tesla and gm approached the race to build commercially viable electric cars is evident in the vision behind these two cars tesla s model 3 was driven by a radical vision of building an affordable car that didn t require a compromise from the driver to go green when gm designed the chevy bolt it was driven by the vision of beating the tesla model 3 to market with an ev that would have a range of more than 200 miles between charges radical product thinking tesla designed the model 3 as a mechanism to create the change it wanted to bring to the world accelerating the transition to electric cars by making them more affordable that s radical product thinking this clear purpose was translated into every aspect of the car one team designed a more efficient electric motor using the hall effect another designed a new magnet with varying polarities another figured out a process to manufacture this innovative magnet the connection across these roles and tactical activities is that the items were all thinking about a radical product driven by a common vision as munro summarized his view on the model 3 this car is totally different this is not inching up this is revolutionary thinking radically about a product is often reflected in the organization s structure take the cooling system in the model 3 a single system that cools the entire car including the batteries cabin and motor it was designed as a single system to be as efficient as possible in the bolt as in traditional cars separate systems cool the different areas of the car as munro points out at gm each of these systems is someone s domain and fiefdom while creating a single cooling system has been talked about a lot in detroit it would require crossing over too many lines at tesla the radical vision transcended organizational boundaries gm was able to find local maxima it got a new model to market quickly and it was a pretty good car at a lower price point but tesla found the global maximum a breakthrough vehicle that has been outselling the mercedes c class bmw 3 series and audi a4 combined tesla used iterations to refine how to get where it was going tesla s first iteration the roadster ran on battery packs made of 6 831 off the shelf lithium ion cells used in laptop batteries today tesla s model 3 battery packs contain cells that were developed by the company with panasonic munro views tesla s batteries as the best among the evs they provide the longest range and fastest charging times while occupying the least space the company continues to iterate on its product tesla has acknowledged issues in manufacturing the model 3 and continues to improve the design of the body and manufacturing processes gm in contrast used iterations to define where it was going by starting with the same chassis as the spark even the same layout of the engine in the front gm was preserving what it knew best gasoline cars and guaranteed that the bolt would be evolutionary but not revolutionary gm launched its first ev well before tesla but wait you might say tesla had a lead on evs given more time and iterations wouldn t gm have found the same global maximum that tesla found fortunately we can use historical evidence to answer this question coming up with a visionary solution wasn t a matter of iterating for long enough it turns out gm had launched its first electric vehicle the ev1 in 1996 well before tesla was conceived gm leased the ev1 as a market test to customers in california who loved the product in fact when gm wanted to shut down the program citing liability issues and discontinuation of parts customers sent checks to gm asking to buy their leased cars at zero risk to the company gm didn t even have to commit to servicing the cars their owners wanted to keep using them regardless gm returned the checks and chose to shut down the product line because an electric car has fewer moving parts and requires fewer parts to be replaced in the car s lifetime the ev1 would have cannibalized the spare parts business while gm had come up with an ev well before tesla their iterations weren t vision driven and it settled for the local maximum ironically gm s cancellation of the ev1 program led elon musk to start tesla and eventually build the visionary model 3 tempting local maxima despite their shortcomings local maxima are often tempting because they can help you optimize for your corner of the chessboard they can help you maximize profitability and business goals in the near term as gm did by scuttling its ev program since the 1980s the ideology of shareholder primacy where a company s primary goal is to maximize shareholder value has become entrenched in business culture academics argued that managers would best serve companies and society by working to maximize shareholder value often this means delivering financial results every quarter to meet shareholders expectations of profits and growth you re incentivized to optimize for just a few pieces on the chessboard startups too have similar incentives for a short term focus to demonstrate progress to investors and raise your next round of funding you need to show quick results in terms of financial metrics or key performance

tech stocks led by alibaba rallied the strongest on liu s list of market salves partly because the sector had been the most painfully bludgeoned by china s recent measures and partly because the promise of an agreement between beijing and washington on the regulation of us listed chinese companies should more generally juice valuations caught in the maelstrom was a jpmorgan chase report last monday that downgraded more than two dozen prominent chinese internet stocks describing the basket as unattractive with no valuation support in the near term fun was poked at the report because of the rally a few days later another theory is that the report s prominence and negative tone helped to prod beijing into declaring a floor sooner rather than later placed against the optimistic view of china s move however are a number of factors jpmorgan s note emerged from a remarkably rough patch for chinese stocks an extended sell off that had scythed valuations far below their february 2021 peak the russian invasion of ukraine along with the associated geopolitical turmoil meant there were few visible brakes on the downward spiral china s move in that context was less a grand shift of mindset than an emergency circuit breaker triggered as policymakers hit their pain threshold as traders pointed out thursday s rally was driven by hedge funds and a squeeze on short sellers the long only money foreign and domestic has yet to make definitive bets adding to its hesitancy is that the signalling from liu and the financial stability and development committee that he chairs has met near total silence from the tech companies and other corporations the market rally maps the joy of someone who has been told their grim looking medical condition is easily treatable the companies reaction is more a fool me once glower looming menacingly above this however are dynamics that beijing cannot change although chinese confidence boosting spasms are rare they are not unprecedented they have parallels in the successful experiments following the global financial crisis and after 2014 when panics related to domestic growth or us trade wars took hold on previous occasions however the chinese confidence booster was fired into markets where globalisation still felt fundamentally unstoppable and decoupling seemed a remote risk neither can be said with confidence now even before the invasion of ukraine heightened the deglobalisation and decoupling concerns technology nationalism the redrawing of supply chains and other megatrends were revising calculations about investing in chinese stocks the ambiguities of beijing s positioning with moscow have not abated xi s remarks on friday in a call with us president joe biden that the international community should work for peace and tranquility were superficially soothing but are unlikely to shift the underlying concern about decoupling investor hesitancy on china continues to have plenty of valid excuses last week s actions by beijing are important for neutralising some of the more idiosyncratic concerns related to domestic policies that hit certain sectors of the stock market but that leaves the chinese market as a more direct proxy for investors views on the future of globalisation financial times

beijing march 20 ani as the war between russia and ukraine continues china is quietly distancing itself from moscow as its economy is being slammed with sanctions from the us and its allies last month both countries proclaimed that their friendship had no limits that was before russia launched its war in ukraine beijing has refused to condemn russia s attack on ukraine but wants to avoid being impacted by the sanctions it has repeatedly denounced as an ineffective way of resolving the crisis cnn reported fears that chinese companies could face us sanctions over ties with russia had contributed to an epic sell off in chinese stocks in recent days that slump was reversed on wednesday when beijing promised it would pursue policies to boost its sputtering economy and keep financial markets stable us officials told cnn that they have information suggesting china has expressed some openness to providing russia with requested military and financial assistance china dismissed that as disinformation citing analysts cnn reported that china is attempting to strike a delicate balance between supporting russia rhetorically but without further antagonizing the united states chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to us dollars and many chinese industries cannot afford to be deprived of us technology the most significant help china could offer russia is through the usd 90 billion worth of reserves moscow holds in chinese yuan wrote alicia garcia herrero chief economist for the asia pacific at natixis in a research report according to cnn it further reported that russia s finance minister anton siluanov this week said that the country wanted to use yuan reserves after moscow was blocked from accessing us dollars and euros following the invasion of ukraine the world bank has halted all its programs in russia and belarus it hadn t approved any new loans or investments to russia since 2014 and none to belarus since 2020 according to cnn more surprisingly is the decision by the beijing based asian infrastructure investment bank to do the same in a statement earlier this month it said it was suspending all its activities related to russia and belarus as the war in ukraine unfolds the move was in the best interests of the bank it added the aiib s decision to suspend activities in russia means usd 1 1 billion of approved or proposed lending aimed at improving the country s road and rail networks is now on hold cnn reported on friday local time us president joe biden held a video call with his chinese counterpart xi jinping and warned china of implications and consequences if beijing provides material support to russia president biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion including by imposing costs on russia he described the implications and consequences if china provides material support to russia as it conducts brutal attacks against ukrainian cities and civilians a white house readout informed meanwhile the two leaders agreed that a diplomatic solution to the present conflict in ukraine is the most desirable outcome as of now ani
owning strong resilient companies can help smooth out market volatility and stabilize portfolios let s face it the market has been pretty tough so far in 2022 year to date the s p 500 is down 7 and the nasdaq has dropped 16 drops like we ve seen this year are completely normal and part of the regular cadence of long term investing that said it never feels good to see a portfolio full of red in times like this it helps to have some anchor positions in your portfolio strong established resilient companies will still see ups and downs along with the broader market but owning some of these stalwarts can blunt the impact of larger market movements let s take a closer look at three companies that can help solidify your portfolio 1 berkshire hathaway when growth stocks were rocketing to all time highs throughout 2020 and early 2021 it was easy to think berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 time had passed why invest in a boring conglomerate like berkshire when there s parabolic growth happening in the tech sector well the answer to that question is now apparent as of this writing berkshire is up 53 from the beginning of 2020 compared to the s p 500 s 42 gain to be fair we have the benefit of hindsight this would have been more difficult to foresee when berkshire finished 2020 trailing the s p 500 by 16 for the year the point is that diversification is important to any portfolio and berkshire provides the kind of slow steady growth that only becomes evident over the long term berkshire grew its earnings 111 in 2021 but it s important to realize that was an outsized gain based on favorable comps because of how rough 2020 was on berkshire s business earnings were still up 10 compared to 2019 which isn t terrible for a business of berkshire s size zooming out even further berkshire s earnings are up almost 300 over the past five years looking forward berkshire has a balance sheet that gives it a lot of options when looking for companies to invest in or acquire fiscal 2021 ended with 144 billion on the balance sheet ready to deploy whenever management sees fit after decades of stellar capital allocation i m inclined to trust that warren buffett and charlie munger will continue to make decisions for berkshire that will be accretive to shareholder value 2 apple year to date apple aapl 2 19 is down 8 trailing the s p 500 which has dropped 7 while that doesn t sound like the performance of a resilient company it s a very small sample size taking a step back apple has been one of the best long term performers over the past five years beating the return of the s p 500 by over 280 apple s recently reported q1 2022 results were impressive and showed the company s dominant position in the tech sector revenue for the quarter was a record 124 billion up 11 from the year ago quarter this growth came from both its product and services sectors of particular interest was the 24 gain in the services segment this includes high margin revenue from apple s various subscription services and speaks to the company s success at monetizing customers once they ve purchased a hardware device and entered apple s ecosystem it s not only the continued growth and track record of returns that makes apple a stock worth owning the company has been very shareholder friendly with its capital allocation strategy apple paid 3 7 billion in dividends to shareholders in q1 and repurchased 14 billion of its shares over the past five years apple has repurchased 22 of its shares outstanding thus increasing by that amount the value of every share owned by apple s investors apple presents the best of both worlds for investors it s still a company at the forefront of technology growing revenues and profits in impressive ways it s also large and established enough to provide some stability in your portfolio 3 old dominion freight line while not as ubiquitous in the world of investing as berkshire or apple old dominion freight line odfl 0 53 is a company not to be ignored it is a leader in the less than truckload ltl trucking space put simply rather than operate a fleet where each truck delivers a single load to a single location old dominion operates a highly efficient network of trucks that make many stops and transfers delivering to several locations along its routes old dominion is one of the largest companies handling this specific type of trucking in north america 2021 was another strong year for old dominion compared to 2020 revenue increased 31 operating income grew 53 and net income was up 54 the balance sheet is also solid with 717 million in total cash and only 203 million in debt old dominion s business is picking up steam in q1 after ltl tons per day increased 14 in q4 a recently released q1 update pegged that growth at 18 this metric was attributed to a 20 increase in ltl shipments per day it s clear that old dominion s position in the ltl trucking space is only getting stronger like berkshire and apple old dominion has been reducing its share count over the past five years shares outstanding have been reduced by 7 the company also pays a dividend that currently has a modest yield

emergency measures such as working from home lower speed limits and car free sundays in cities should be used to cut oil demand and avert a crippling supply crisis caused by the war in ukraine the international energy agency has said it also suggested business flights are curbed public transport made cheaper or free and that motorists set their cars air conditioning systems to 3 degrees warmer in summer the measures are part of a ten point plan designed to cut fuel usage in order to avoid the biggest oil supply shock in decades reports the times sanctions and boycotts of russian oil are likely to remove 2 5 million barrels a day from the markets creating a real risk that markets tighten further and oil prices escalate significantly in the coming months as demand for oil typically peaks in july and august the agency said oil prices hit 139 a barrel earlier this month although the international benchmark brent crude was trading 1 2 per cent higher at 107 93 a barrel in new york on friday night march 18 it is believed such measures would cut global oil demand by 2 7 million barrels a day within four months oil markets are in an emergency situation and it may get worse fatih birol the agency s executive director said the world may well be facing its biggest oil supply shock in decades with huge implications for our economies and societies founded in 1974 the agency has 31 members that include britain america germany japan norway and australia birol called on members to take action on demand to avoid the risk of a crippling oil crunch many of the measures are aimed at reducing driving including working from home three days a week which has been proven successful in many cases during lockdown and could save 500 000 barrels of oil a day car free sundays could save around 380 000 barrels a day and access to cities could also be restricted to even or odd numbered registration plates on alternate weekdays other recommendations include cutting speed limits by at least 10km h saving 290 000 barrels of oil a day for cars and a further 140 000 from hgvs the agency suggests an increased use of car sharing and other measures to optimise fuel usage including urging drivers to restrict their use of air conditioning systems which account for four to 10 per cent of total fuel consumption for those car users who can we therefore propose a temporary 3c increase in the temperature setting to give an immediate improvement in fuel economy and cut fuel bills it said around two in every five business flights could be avoided by using virtual meetings as an effective substitute saving about 260 000 barrels of oil a day and about two per cent of all journeys made by jet could be shifted to highspeed rail the agency proposed it said that the world s advanced economies accounted for 45 per cent of global oil demand demand restraint is one of the emergency response measures that all member countries are required to have ready as a contingency at all times and that they can use to contribute to an iea collective action in an emergency it said the agency has co ordinated the release of emergency oil stocks by its members to help to ease prices a government spokesman said there is absolutely no need to apply this guidance in the uk and the recommendations are not under consideration we have no issues with either gas or oil supply unlike europe we are not dependent on russian energy imports for more stories from where you live visit inyourarea

barksdale federal credit union of shreveport announced recently it will jump into arkansas with a deal to buy a greenbrier bank the first ever acquisition of a credit union taking over a bank in the state barksdale s bid to purchase homebank of arkansas which has five branches and about 78 million in assets likely won t be the last purchase of a bank by a credit union in the state and industry analysts say similar transactions could be coming soon they cite a growing trend across the nation of credit unions acquiring banks this year is projected to set new records for the crossover transactions i think you will see more activity in arkansas said randy dennis president of dd f consulting group in little rock there isn t any question there will be more opportunities for credit unions in arkansas as well as across the country dennis company has put together deals in alabama and wisconsin involving credit unions and banks credit union bank transactions have raised objections from the nation s largest banking industry trade groups which contend credit unions enjoy an unfair tax exempt status that helps stockpile cash to fuel the acquisitions one of the quirks of the crossover transactions is that they are all cash deals since credit unions don t have stock they are owned by their depositors or members arkansas federal credit union of little rock the state s largest with 1 8 billion in assets has considered several acquisitions of banks but has yet to settle on one that fits culturally and matches the organization s growth strategy we ve gotten to the second layer of due diligence on all of those said president and chief executive officer rodney showmar once you get into it they didn t meet our level of expectation or with our strategy so we moved away from those we re not opposed to it we ve had three or four opportunities and we ve not pulled the trigger on one yet the potential acquisitions all were banks operating in arkansas across the nation credit union bank acquisitions have picked up over the past few years and reached a high of 13 deals last year with total assets of 5 96 billion according to s p marketing intelligence efforts continue to build on that momentum and five deals including the barksdale and homebank transaction have been announced in the first few months of 2022 industry consultant mike bell is projecting upwards of 25 deals this year i m most certain we ll break a record this year for the most ever of these deals said bell partner in the financial practices group at honigman llp and is based in kalamazoo mich bell was involved in the first credit union bank transaction in 2010 and has worked on about 45 of the 50 deals that have occurred since he said though the deals continue to gain traction bell points out that bank to bank acquisitions will dwarf those involving credit unions we will remain always the minority of these deals he added for example there were 190 bank acquisitions last year the lowest level excluding the 2020 pandemic year when there were only 99 transactions since 2011 according to data from the banking analysis team at stephens inc stephens is projecting more than 220 transactions this year increasing acquisitions by credit unions has drawn criticism from both the american bankers association and the independent community bankers of america icba which have called on congress to strip away the tax exemption for credit unions credit unions were established to support lower income consumers and focus on local communities banking industry officials contend in the past few years credit unions have been expanding on that statutory mission said michael emancipator icba regulatory counsel it doesn t seem like the tax exemption is warranted if they re expanding beyond that very narrow purpose of why congress gave them the tax exemption credit unions if given free rein to buy and compete with banks should be subject to the same regulatory supervisory and tax requirements as banks banking industry officials say the industry has had some luck at the state level iowa and colorado have barred state banks from selling to credit unions lawsuits are pending in nebraska and tennessee to block deals announced last year arkansas emancipator said has not been a focus to seek regulatory aid most industry efforts are focused on the handful of states with the most credit union bank acquisitions since 2015 florida has had the most deals with 12 followed by georgia and illinois with seven apiece while alabama indiana and wisconsin all have had five deals according to s p capital arkansas bank commissioner susannah marshall declined comment on the credit union buying trend since the department has to rule on the proposed barksdale homebank acquisition terms of the deal were not disclosed and it is projected to close in the third quarter four variables are moving credit unions to acquire banks according to bell credit unions want to expand their footprint boost loans and deposits to diversify add bank trained talent and make sure the transactions are revenue positive from day one those are the four key strategies that drive the majority of these deals bell said banks are interested in selling to credit unions because it adds another level of competitors in the bidding process industry consolidation has reduced the number of banks thus potential buyers significantly over nearly the past 40 years adding a credit union to the process just increases the number of possible bidders bell said the federal reserve bank reports there has been a steady decline in commercial banks for nearly 40 years driven primarily by mergers and acquisitions there were 14 496 banks in 1984 between 1984 and 2020 the number of banks decreased by 70 meaning more than 10 000 disappeared during the period arkansas federal executives say a bank acquisition remains on the table and the company would be most interested in expanding its footprint it operates mostly in central and northwest arkansas or growing a new loan portfolio in the agriculture or small business lending areas we re going to be focused on any opportunities that might arise ceo showmar said along those same lines showmar said the credit union would be interested in adding a bank that can raise talent levels and increase core competencies when we go into a new market we want to make sure we hang on to the talent that s there he added acquiring or keeping good talent is especially difficult in this market

this week bulls stage a counter attack technical things sentiment snippets buybacks margin debt investor positioning chinese equity capitulation 1 bulls stage counter attack big buying on friday as the reclaimed the 4400 level and the 50dma this follows a bullish rsi divergence and deeply pessimistic sentiment see the next few charts and a death cross when the 50dma crosses below the 200dma which is described as a slow moving bearish signal designed to detect market regime shifts into bear markets down trends but has a patchy record with many false positives source callum_thomas 2 death cross when the 50dma crosses below the 200dma like the s p 500 50 of the countries we track 35 70 have put in a death cross along with the itself albeit n b the death cross flagged 11 out of the last 2 bear markets for global equities source topdowncharts 3 market breadth on the topic of market breadth indicators interesting to note that the s p 500 200 day moving average breadth indicator is bouncing from very similar levels to late 2018 when a string of fed rate hikes scuttled markets source marketcharts 4 panic stations this sentiment indicator composite of the aaii investors intelligence surveys has this week officially dropped below pandemic panic levels source topdowncharts 5 consensus bulls on the other hand consensus bulls indicator only just dropped below the 50 mark this week to 49 this compares to the long term average of 51 5 by contrast this indicator dropped to 22 in march 2020 18 in march 09 36 in dec 18 basically my read of this is that the market and wider market sentiment is still teetering between correction vs bear market source topdowncharts 6 buybacks buybacks to the rescue firms in the s p 500 have outlined buyback plans valued at 238 billion through the first two months of 2022 according to data from goldman sachs a high for this point in the year source wsj via dimartinobooth 7 margin debt deleveraging progress check another d word for this one though is that of divergence more shoes to drop source t1alpha 8 sentiment positioning and leveraged bets in the scheme of things though investors are still fairly all in despite morose sentiment especially leveraged longs n b the blue line in the chart is combined margin debt speculative futures and leveraged etfs standardized against market cap the black line is average portfolio allocations to equities from the aaii portfolio survey and ici total aum figures key point is that despite extreme pessimism in the sentiment surveys investors speculators have not yet capitulated and made their move on actual positioning source topdowncharts 9 speaking of capitulation no capitulation in us equities but definitely an element of capitulation in china global investors have been dumping chinese stocks at a record pace perhaps spooked by geopolitical country risk following what happened with russia not to mention unfriendly macro e g property etc source ft via michaelaarouet 10 forward pe ratio reset forward pe ratio almost hit lucky number 8x meanwhile the us forward pe ratio is still wafting around pre pandemic levels definitely not cheap yet source marketpictorial thanks for following i appreciate your interest oh that s right almost forgot bonus chart got to include a goody for the goodies who subscribed sentiment divergences surveyed sentiment is in a state of deep pessimism and yet economic sentiment still remains fairly optimistic for now this chart shows a composite view of economic sentiment manufacturing consumer small business housing industry services sector and compares that against the same for investor sentiment surveyed bullishness in the aaii and investors intelligence surveys clearly there is a sharp divergence of opinions when it comes to the market vs the economy it s interestingly quite similar to what i noted in the weekly chart storm investor sentiment stands in sharp contrast to investor actual positioning i e they are very bearish but have not really reflected that in their portfolios or leveraged bullish equity bets makes you wonder if there are further shoes to drop so to say with regard to economic sentiment and investor positioning going back to the economy another chart that caught my eye this week was the divergence between the us consumer confidence surveys in an intriguing development the university of michigan index has wildly diverged to the downside vs the conference board index you have to go all the way back to the 70 s to find a similar type of divergence that last statement should be informative we basically have a commodity shock of a similar nature geopolitics driven and magnitude especially considering the breadth of the surge in commodities to what happened twice in that decade the uom survey has a greater emphasis on prices and so we can only assume that the uom survey is basically giving us a truer picture of how the consumer really feels in the face of runaway inflation surging inflation presents a real headwind and headache to consumers and the economy at large and more to the point gives cause for the fed to get its act together in attempting to rein in surging inflation expectations challenging times ahead for consumers and investors

faithful investors who helped pull amc entertainment holdings back from the financial brink are cheering its unorthodox investment in hycroft mining holding corp a troubled gold and silver mining company the investment follows a challenging run for hycroft which went public in early 2020 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company backed by hedge fund manager jason mudrick it had lost around 80 of its value since its debut and the company asked its lenders to grant it some breathing room on its debt last month hycroft s largest shareholder mudrick capital has experienced this phenomenon before mudrick was an architect of amc s narrow escape from bankruptcy last year when amc s shares jumped in early 2021 mudrick encouraged the theater operator to capitalize on the rally the company issued about 400 million worth of new shares and used the proceeds to pay down debt this time around mudrick s role was more involved after rushing amc management to a remote nevada location to visit the mine before finalizing the decision mudrick amc s chief executive officer adam aron and a handful of lawyers hashed out the details via zoom from the jump time was short hycroft had only six days to put together its deal in order to preserve a low price for amc s stock purchases nasdaq requirements meant they would price at the average of the past several days of trading and delay would include post rally prices in that average representatives from mudrick capital amc and hycroft did not provide comment reddit investors started talking about hycroft and drove its stock up to a high of 1 88 on march 11 the stock s highest price since august social media activity preceded a surge in the shares that caught the attention of stakeholders according to a person with knowledge of the dealmaking earlier this month jason mudrick recognized a familiar opportunity and called on an old partner amc s aron who had become a skilled reddit whisperer to help him sell hycroft on the idea according to the person familiar instead it also led to a surprise investment offer from the amc ceo hycroft said it would sell up to 500 million of additional shares in a future at the market issuance it may use proceeds from that and the amc investment to help finance new technology to better process its reserves according to the person familiar aron has attracted retail investor support due to what they say is his willingness to listen to individuals and solicit their ideas on twitter amc has spent months touting a move into crypto with plans to create its own token and accept cryptocurrencies as payment which investors had pushed for amid a broader movement positioning crypto as a new safe haven investment but that thesis has come into question in recent weeks after a sell off in the stock market and concerns about inflation and the war in ukraine gold the traditional safe haven has soared to record highs this year that seemed like a pretty good move to me anyways before i even read the release said jolene roderick 37 who bought shares in amc and hycroft last week after the announcement gold is supposed to be considered a relatively safe investment for companies to be adding to their portfolios to some amc investors the hycroft investment is a much needed pivot away from the movie chain s traditional business zack dillon 23 bought more amc shares after last week s announcement and is taking a look at hycroft hycroft potentially has precious metal reserves that could be very beneficial for amc he said i think that will be a positive outlook for the future for amc s revenue gerardo maya 28 owns both amc and hycroft shares he bought hycroft shares about a year ago and sold last week at a profit amid a reddit spurred rally before quickly buying back in hycroft could benefit from a strong retail investor community like amc s he said in an interview and he plans to buy more shares if there s a sell off everyone who invests in amc is all about holding and they see the ceo investing in another company that s having trouble financially like hycroft he said i can see that helping hycroft itself observers may see some irony in amc s newfound role as a rescuer the theater chain itself was itself on the brink of bankruptcy just over a year ago until it too caught the sight of rally happy redditors in a matter of months amc s fate turned dramatically albeit without much clarity on how the company was going to actually remedy the business the company discussed creating commemorative nonfungible tokens or nfts related to major films more immediately important was the seemingly self perpetuating narrative in which stock surge begat stock surge without much consideration for fundamentals aron acknowledged the likeness between the fates of the two companies in amc s press release tuesday hycroft appears to be just like amc of a year ago with rock solid assets but facing a severe and immediate liquidity issue he said we are confident that our involvement can greatly help it to surmount its challenges to its benefit and to ours
imagine an sti that you can t treat you go from doctor to doctor from pill to pill but nothing can clean out your undercarriage the infection starts to spread like the one night stand you contracted it from the infection refuses to leave after you make it clear that we re done here bacteria can get into your body in many ways in fact you re crawling with bacteria as you read this most of which are either completely harmless or genuinely beneficial you can t live without them but there are harmful bacteria too and for these we have a secret weapon antibiotics revolutionised the world when they became available in the 1930 s they ve made the world a place in which you can safely heal from trauma and you don t need to have six kids in the hopes that at least three may grow old enough to till the cornfields but it s been a double edged sword every time you take antibiotics the drugs work their way through your system stifling populations of bacteria inside you the good and the bad this is great for infections it means that your body has a much higher chance of surviving but it comes at a cost there is a small chance that even just one bacterium inside you will possess some mutation some genetic trick that renders it immune to the antibiotics you ve just taken it survives the medicinal onslaught and its children inherit its genetic immunity to the antibiotics this is bad news this is how we end up with strains of bacterial infections that cannot be treated by antibiotics and yes this potentially includes several sti s it can also include infamous infections like bubonic plague or tuberculosis which used to have the charming moniker of the consumption doesn t sound like something you want to come down with does it there has only been one case of antibiotic resistant tuberculosis in new zealand can you guess where it was here in dunedin the man infected with this strain was treated at the cost of 10 000 a month drugs had to be flown in from the u s to treat him when our stocks ran out and this is just for one person he made a full recovery but as the rate of antibiotic prescriptions continues to go up so too do the rates of resistant strains brian a recent graduate from otago works with people who studied this field at uni he told critic that antibiotic resistance was a bigger problem than it s been since 1930 when the drugs were invented and speaking of inventions new antibiotics can t just be churned out of a lab at the drop of a hat there is not a single class of antibiotics that we have created ourselves said brian every last one of them was first identified in a fungus and then appropriated for human use as humans continue to push out to the untouched regions of the planet we extend what brian called a fingerprint that degrades diverse ecosystems and that costs us opportunities to take these molecules and these drugs and use them we cannot simply create antibiotics we have to learn them from nature and as we continue to chop away at that nature we will continue to lose potential medicines before they re ever given a chance to be helpful in the meantime while we continue to prescribe antibiotics human error is building a veritable army of treatment resistant bacteria every time you don t finish your prescribed course the few most resilient stragglers are allowed to multiply and their progeny is that much stronger in the face of future treatment these bacteria can cause illnesses like tb sure but they can also be responsible for many of the sexually transmitted diseases that we can dismiss as an oopsie today take syphilis for example syphilis in its later stages can enter your brain al capone had it and towards the end of his life he was basically insane it actually became uncool to be associated with the most notorious american gangster of the day even amongst his fellow inmates on alcatraz he completely lost the plot because of untreated syphilis syphilis can also fuck with your bones according to brian and would be an absolute nightmare if suddenly resistent to treatment part of this new era that we re going into is that you will have untreatable sti s again said brian and that s terrible as a society i think we ve forgotten what it s like to have those but it s not just resistant strains that are causing concern every time we use antibiotics we make the general population of harmful bacteria just a little bit stronger so next time we take antibiotics that first line of defence has to be just a little bit stronger as well we re caught in a microscopic arms race with each side bringing bigger and bigger guns to the table and your helpful bacteria can get caught in the crossfire take your gut for example bacteria live there that produce neurotransmitters the stuff that regulates brain function when you take an antibiotic any antibiotic you re essentially swallowing gut napalm and the stronger and stronger that we have to make that first line of defence the more and more of your helpful bacteria get burned away critic also spoke to george who studies a particularly gnarly strain here at otago she told us that the world health organisation is most concerned about what they call the eskape pathogens six pathogens that each correspond to a letter in the acronym eskape staph stands for s for example george said that the uni gets samples of bacteria from people at the hospital and all over new zealand and that some of the samples we get out of patients are reeeally nasty she said that when a new antibiotic is tried on a sample an r is put in the spreadsheet if it s found to be resistant and looking at some of those results it s just r r r all the way down the sheet george said that of all the global crises bacterial resistance was pretty close to the top of their concerns you should 100 be worried about this and climate change and all of the plastic in the ocean there s a lot of things to worry about and this is just one of them george said that like the burgeoning climate crisis we re approaching the post antibiotic era pretty rapidly at this point that era meaning that if you get an infection in your foot you d probably need to get your foot amputated instead of just taking some amoxicillin we re fucked six ways from sundays this is one of the ways we re fucked from the very beginning scientists have been warning people about the dangers of antibiotic resistance any time you prescribe antibiotics you are at least somewhat increasing the likelihood of helping to create a newly resistant strain but how are we meant to judge the current and dire need of someone who needs antibiotics against the future wellbeing of our communal immune systems i would say the last two years have shown us that as a global community we suck at dealing with infectious disease threats said brian new zealand really needs to break away from the rest of the world and get a hold of this and that starts here dunedin has lots of medical professionals doing

barksdale federal credit union of shreveport announced recently it will jump into arkansas with a deal to buy a greenbrier bank the first ever acquisition of a credit union taking over a bank in the state barksdale s bid to purchase homebank of arkansas which has five branches and about 78 million in assets likely won t be the last purchase of a bank by a credit union in the state and industry analysts say similar transactions could be coming soon they cite a growing trend across the nation of credit unions acquiring banks this year is projected to set new records for the crossover transactions i think you will see more activity in arkansas said randy dennis president of dd f consulting group in little rock there isn t any question there will be more opportunities for credit unions in arkansas as well as across the country dennis company has put together deals in alabama and wisconsin involving credit unions and banks credit union bank transactions have raised objections from the nation s largest banking industry trade groups which contend credit unions enjoy an unfair tax exempt status that helps stockpile cash to fuel the acquisitions one of the quirks of the crossover transactions is that they are all cash deals since credit unions don t have stock they are owned by their depositors or members arkansas federal credit union of little rock the state s largest with 1 8 billion in assets has considered several acquisitions of banks but has yet to settle on one that fits culturally and matches the organization s growth strategy we ve gotten to the second layer of due diligence on all of those said president and chief executive officer rodney showmar once you get into it they didn t meet our level of expectation or with our strategy so we moved away from those we re not opposed to it we ve had three or four opportunities and we ve not pulled the trigger on one yet the potential acquisitions all were banks operating in arkansas across the nation credit union bank acquisitions have picked up over the past few years and reached a high of 13 deals last year with total assets of 5 96 billion according to s p marketing intelligence efforts continue to build on that momentum and five deals including the barksdale and homebank transaction have been announced in the first few months of 2022 industry consultant mike bell is projecting upwards of 25 deals this year i m most certain we ll break a record this year for the most ever of these deals said bell partner in the financial practices group at honigman llp and is based in kalamazoo mich bell was involved in the first credit union bank transaction in 2010 and has worked on about 45 of the 50 deals that have occurred since he said though the deals continue to gain traction bell points out that bank to bank acquisitions will dwarf those involving credit unions we will remain always the minority of these deals he added for example there were 190 bank acquisitions last year the lowest level excluding the 2020 pandemic year when there were only 99 transactions since 2011 according to data from the banking analysis team at stephens inc stephens is projecting more than 220 transactions this year increasing acquisitions by credit unions has drawn criticism from both the american bankers association and the independent community bankers of america icba which have called on congress to strip away the tax exemption for credit unions credit unions were established to support lower income consumers and focus on local communities banking industry officials contend in the past few years credit unions have been expanding on that statutory mission said michael emancipator icba regulatory counsel it doesn t seem like the tax exemption is warranted if they re expanding beyond that very narrow purpose of why congress gave them the tax exemption credit unions if given free rein to buy and compete with banks should be subject to the same regulatory supervisory and tax requirements as banks banking industry officials say the industry has had some luck at the state level iowa and colorado have barred state banks from selling to credit unions lawsuits are pending in nebraska and tennessee to block deals announced last year arkansas emancipator said has not been a focus to seek regulatory aid most industry efforts are focused on the handful of states with the most credit union bank acquisitions since 2015 florida has had the most deals with 12 followed by georgia and illinois with seven apiece while alabama indiana and wisconsin all have had five deals according to s p capital arkansas bank commissioner susannah marshall declined comment on the credit union buying trend since the department has to rule on the proposed barksdale homebank acquisition terms of the deal were not disclosed and it is projected to close in the third quarter four variables are moving credit unions to acquire banks according to bell credit unions want to expand their footprint boost loans and deposits to diversify add bank trained talent and make sure the transactions are revenue positive from day one those are the four key strategies that drive the majority of these deals bell said banks are interested in selling to credit unions because it adds another level of competitors in the bidding process industry consolidation has reduced the number of banks thus potential buyers significantly over nearly the past 40 years adding a credit union to the process just increases the number of possible bidders bell said the federal reserve bank reports there has been a steady decline in commercial banks for nearly 40 years driven primarily by mergers and acquisitions there were 14 496 banks in 1984 between 1984 and 2020 the number of banks decreased by 70 meaning more than 10 000 disappeared during the period arkansas federal executives say a bank acquisition remains on the table and the company would be most interested in expanding its footprint it operates mostly in central and northwest arkansas or growing a new loan portfolio in the agriculture or small business lending areas we re going to be focused on any opportunities that might arise ceo showmar said along those same lines showmar said the credit union would be interested in adding a bank that can raise talent levels and increase core competencies when we go into a new market we want to make sure we hang on to the talent that s there he added acquiring or keeping good talent is especially difficult in this market
menafn baystreet ca a severe shortage of lithium supply could put the brakes on net zero transitions there s just not enough lithium to meet growing demand in fact if the world can t fix the supply demand gaps for lithium it s tough to imagine any net zero transitions according to the ceo of the international council of metals and mineral mining rohitesh dhawan as noted by sky news we can see quite a large mismatch between demand and supply we currently produce around 400 000 tonnes of lithium annually by 2030 that s likely to need to jump to around two million tonnes adding at the moment about half of global lithium demand comes from the electric vehicle market by 2030 80 of global lithium demand will come from the electric vehicle market because we need to electrify our transport fleet that quickly until we have enough lithium supply to meet explosive demand prices are likely to accelerate higher and send related lithium stocks to higher highs including e3 metals corp tsxv

defi pronounced dee fye is short for decentralized finance it s an umbrella term for the part of the crypto universe that is geared toward building a new internet native financial system using blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries and trust mechanisms don t i promise it s interesting let s back up a bit to send or receive money in the traditional financial system you need intermediaries like banks or stock exchanges and in order to feel comfortable doing the transaction all parties need to trust that those intermediaries will act fairly and honestly in defi those middlemen are replaced by software instead of transacting through banks and stock exchanges people trade directly with one another with blockchain based smart contracts doing the work of making markets settling trades and ensuring that the entire process is fair and trustworthy basically crypto people are building their own version of wall street one that is largely decentralized and deals exclusively in crypto with crypto versions of many of the products offered by traditional financial firms and without much of the red tape and regulations that govern the existing financial system you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel that s part of it but defi also includes things like lending platforms prediction markets options and derivatives defi s total value locked or tvl a standard way of measuring the value of crypto held in defi projects is currently about 77 billion according to defi pulse that would make defi something like the 38th largest bank in the united states by deposits if it were a bank right and tvl isn t the only way to measure defi s growth you could also look at trading activity on decentralized exchanges which has grown by triple digit percentages in the past year or you could take a cue from regulators and politicians who are increasingly looking to defi s growth with concern michael hsu the acting u s comptroller of the currency said in a speech at a blockchain conference in september that many defi products reminded him of the credit default swaps and other complex derivatives that were popular on wall street in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and sen elizabeth warren d mass singled out defi in a december crypto hearing calling it the most dangerous part of the crypto world in short because defi is mostly unregulated with few of the consumer protections and safeguards that exist in the traditional financial system the best example is probably stablecoins stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the value of a government backed currency like the u s dollar stablecoins are a critical part of defi markets because if you re a crypto investor you don t want to constantly be changing tokens back and forth to dollars or keeping all your assets in cryptocurrencies whose values might fluctuate wildly you want a crypto coin that behaves like a boring stable dollar which you can use without needing to interact at all with the tradfi system it s what defi people jokingly call traditional finance well regulators have argued that despite the name stablecoins aren t actually that stable as my colleague jeanna smialek explained in an article on stablecoins last year the worry stems from the fact that stablecoin issuers aren t legally required to back their coins one to one with safe cashlike assets investors who buy stablecoins might reasonably assume that each usd coin or tether the two most popular stablecoins pegged to the u s dollar is worth 1 and that they will be able to redeem their stablecoins for actual dollars whenever they want but there s nothing in the law at present that requires stablecoin issuers to have one to one backing and if they don t have enough reserves to cover the stablecoins they re issuing the whole thing could collapse if enough investors decide to pull their money out all at once it would be especially since stablecoins are the backbone of defi trading and there are questions among investors and regulators about whether some of the leading stablecoin issuers actually have enough assets to pay out their holders in the event of a large scale redemption the crypto firms that issue loans credit cards and savings accounts without many of the protections or safeguards offered by conventional banks are also drawing concern regulators in the united states have begun clamping down on firms that issue these products saying they could represent a risk to consumers regulators are also looking into decentralized exchanges or dexs which allow users to swap crypto tokens with the help of market making algorithms and then there are all the hacks and scams yes defi like crypto in general is a big target for fraud more than 10 billion was lost to hacks and scams in defi projects in 2021 alone according to a report from blockchain analytics firm elliptic there typically isn t much recourse for victims of defi scams and unlike deposits in a regular bank which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corp crypto tokens usually can t be replaced or recovered once they re gone that s an unflatteringly phrased but largely accurate summary four reasons many people like defi because it s so new and unregulated building an entirely new financial system is the kind of intellectual challenge that doesn t come around every day and lots of people are attracted to the sector s wide open blank slate potential plus if you re a clever trader or an experienced financial engineer you could do all kinds of things in defi that you couldn t do in the traditional financial system and potentially make a lot of money very quickly many defi fans argue that blockchains are technologically superior to the existing banking system much of which runs on ancient databases and outdated code most bank transactions for example still rely on programs written in cobol a programming language that dates back to the 1960s crypto they say is the first form of money that is actually devised for the internet and as it grows it will need a new internet native financial system to support it if you ve bought into the crypto web3 vision of a decentralized economy defi is the financial architecture that makes all of the things you re excited about possible there s no way in the traditional financial system for a dao to create a membership token out of thin air and use it to raise millions of dollars you can t call up jpmorgan chase or goldman sachs and ask them to give you a quote for smooth love potion priced in dogecoin well you could but they might have you committed but with defi platforms you can find people who are willing to trade almost any crypto asset for almost any other crypto asset with no central entity s approval needed there s a more idealistic cohort of defi fans who see all of this heading in a much more utopian direction decentralizing finance these people say could help fix what s wrong with our current financial system in part by eroding the power of big wall street banks over our economy and markets these optimists contend that because defi replaces human intermediaries and trust mechanisms with public blockchains and open source software it s cheaper fewer fees more efficient faster transaction times and more transparent less opportunity for corruption than the traditional financial system they say it democratizes investing placing tools in people s hands that only professional investors had access to before and because you can participate in crypto anonymously and without a bank s approval they say defi is a way to provide financial services to people who aren t well served by the conventional banking sector and avoid many of the discriminatory practices that have kept minorities from accessing financial services in the past ultimately the optimists say defi will become safer and more robust over time as more people use it and some of the early problems are ironed out and just as they believe that web3 will replace greedy tech platforms with user owned collectives they believe that defi will replace today s banks and brokerages with a better fairer system right now it s unlikely that defi could produce any disasters on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis it s still a relatively small piece of the crypto world which is a relatively small piece of the overall economy and many of the people pouring money into defi are the kind of deep pocketed investors who could absorb even big losses but the possibility that defi could grow big enough to present a systemic risk isn t lost on regulators who are scrambling to make the wild west of crypto a little less wild

many people feel like the delaware statutory trust may be the greatest thing since sliced bread we would caution that rarely is one thing the best idea for everyone the following is a list of five types of investors who should probably avoid the dst option 1 investors who are not yet accredited investors who have not yet built enough wealth and or equity are prohibited from entering into a dst arraignment via securities regulation d under the accredited investor rules this rule states that to invest in private placement investments one must have a net worth of over 1 million excluding one s primary residence or income requirements of at least 200 000 per year for singles or 300 000 for couples filing jointly for the last two years for a greater explanation of those requirements i highly recommend you sign up for my course master the 1031 exchange below is a quick taste of what you can expect 2 younger wealth builders younger investors who are seeking a higher risk return profile might not yet be ready for a dst solution young wealth builders might be in a greater position to take on substantial risk and in turn reap the benefits of higher risk returns than what a more seasoned investor might be willing to do should those risks cause the younger investor to lose income or equity the younger investor usually has more time to overcome such losses generally most dst investors tend to be more seasoned investors who have a few battle scars and life experience than that of younger investors 3 do it yourself types some investors have a personal preference for finding tenants negotiating leases managing the books and records ranging from property taxes rent rolls bank loans lease agreements tenant issues property repairs and so on a dst is a more passive investment where all of those things are done by institutional investment grade real estate firms if you are the sort of person who would really miss those things and if you find significance in those activities you might find the dst solution less appealing 4 anyone with a high need for liquidity investors are people and therefore very different from one another if a real estate investor has a high need for liquidity then the investor might want to avoid real estate altogether and to that end a 1031 exchange might not be the best idea for an investor who needs more access to their cash a straight sale of your real estate where you recognize capital gains might be what is required in this instance this would allow the investor to invest in more traditional stock and bond portfolios that can be turned into cash in short order investors high need for liquidity might be due to the need for raising cash for a larger leveraged deal the anticipation of a divorce health concerns speculation about the economy or for many other possible reasons again the dst is an ideal solution for many investors not all investors 5 developers and construction company owners someone who owns a construction and or development company might want to use a 1031 exchange where they could use their construction company to build their new replacement property therefore benefiting two of their interests properties that are to be built generally will have a higher risk return profile as well and may be better suited for a younger investor moreover the individual may have a keen skillset and ability around a certain and specific type of property such as car washes storage facilities dentist and vet clinics retail etc dst offerings are offered through registered investment advisers accredited investors can
