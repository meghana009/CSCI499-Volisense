long before the hellfire club became associated with the new season of stranger things it was an 18th century gathering of hedonistic british aristocracy welcome to the river styx beamed willow randall tour guide at the hellfire caves in the south eastern english county of buckinghamshire we re about to pass off into hell we were standing some 300 feet beneath the village of west wycombe in the warren like hellfire caves which were tunneled into the earth here in the 18th century at the behest of local landowner francis dashwood this rural idyll nestled in the chiltern hills in a well to do corner of england seems an unlikely setting for british members of parliament to engage in blasphemous mock religious rituals and bacchanalian orgies but that is exactly what was on the menu for the hellfire club a society of blue blooded rakes who gathered here in the mid 18th century their number included the cream of society among the members listed on a plaque in the caves were a dozen mps the first lord of the admiralty the son of the archbishop of canterbury and a certain benjamin franklin who spent many years from the 1750s 1770s in london originally as a representative of the pennsylvania assembly dashwood himself the group s leader was the chancellor of the exchequer the second most powerful political figure in britain continue reading article after our video recommended fodor s video the origins of the hellfire club dashwood was a colorful character born into an aristocratic family in london in 1708 he inherited his father s title and west wycombe estate at the age of 15 as a young man he took full advantage of his wealth and status on a series of grand tours around europe in the process he gained infamy as a carouser and enthusiastic libertine in russia he was alleged to have impersonated charles xii of sweden russia s great enemy at the time and attempted to seduce the tsarina it was also said that he was expelled from the papal states during his time in italy the latter charge would set a pattern for dashwood s later life characterized by a fierce anti religious sentiment that found expression in his activities with the hellfire club an incorrigible bon viveur dashwood had already established two dining and drinking societies before setting up what would become known as the hellfire club the society of dilettanti formed in 1732 was ostensibly created for the appreciation of classical art but seemed to have quickly descended into something more dissolute the writer horace walpole a former member described it as a club for which the nominal qualification is having been to italy and the real one being drunk club for which the nominal qualification is having been to italy and the real one being drunk nevertheless the society still exists today its membership of around 60 is a fiercely guarded secret dashwood also established the divan club for people to gather and talk about their experiences traveling in the ottoman empire in 1746 however at the george and vulture pub in london opened in 1142 and still in business today dashwood first gathered together the band of upper crust hedonists who would later become known as the hellfire club they originally went by the name of the order of the knights of st francis and were limited to 12 members a not accidental piece of numerology given the group s satirical anti christian activities indeed dashwood decided that the ruins of medmenham abbey a christian monastery dissolved by henry viii in 1547 was the perfect headquarters for his new organization which was christened the medmenham friars in these hallowed grounds were pursued carnal pleasures sex was one of the main preoccupations of the friars wrote historian evelyn lord in the hell fire clubs dashwood s old associate horace walpole visited the abbey and wrote that the club had adorned the chapel with bawdy pictures and would take any woman they wanted into the old monks cells dressed in mock religious clothing men came to these meetings dressed as monks women dressed as nuns and dashwood came dressed as the priest randall told me as we walked through the caves they all wore masks so as to remain anonymous their motto was fais ce que tu voudras do what thou wilt an exhortation which would later gain infamy as the credo of aleister crowley a notorious english occultist of the 19th and 20th centuries the excavation of dashwood s caves in west wycombe was completed in 1752 and the meetings of the club moved into the caves at some point after this exact dates are hazy because the club s records were ordered to be burned by its secretary paul whitehead three days before his death in 1774 the geography of the caves the entrance to the hellfire caves is marked by an eye catching flint structure resembling the façade of a gothic church the path soon descends into the tunnels carved in the vaulted shape of a nave which branch off into small chambers in one of them sits a waxwork figure of paul whitehead alongside the original urn in which he donated his heart to francis dashwood after his death shortly beyond lies the caves largest room the great hall beehive shaped with black scars on the walls from the oil which was thrown there and set on fire in lieu of lamps during the club s gatherings this is where a lot of the social meetings took place randall said these alcoves had beds in them and a little railing with a curtain across them pointing to linear engravings beneath the alcoves she said these aren t pick marks they re tally marks of how many they took to bed claret was the drink of choice and a live band would play here walpole wrote that practice was rigorously pagan bacchus and venus were the deities to whom they almost publicly sacrificed the river styx at which randall and i stood is a modest natural stream within the caves uncovered during dashwood s excavations beyond this is the inner temple a small circular room directly beneath west wycombe s saint lawrence church in which the hellfire club were said to gather for their most transgressive rituals it stands directly beneath west wycombe s saint lawrence church directly beneath the altar to be precise the layout of the caves reflects the fascinations of dashwood s era both with the ancient world and with the italy he would have seen on his grand tours a gondola was even brought in from venice to make the journey of a few meters across the styx whisperings of explicit satanism and human sacrifice however remain in the realm of rumor largely thanks to whitehead s burning of the records on his deathbed although as randall pointed out he wouldn t have done that for no reason

chancellor kwasi kwarteng leaves 11 downing street to make his way to deliver his mini budget aaron chown via pa wire pa images the international monetary fund has made a stunning intervention over the state of the uk economy after the tory mini budget caused financial turmoil in the group s first public reaction to britain s growing crisis the imf said on tuesday that it would urge the uk to re evaluate a massive 45 billion tax cut funded by government borrowing as it does not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages given soaring inflation across the world advertisement it went on to warn the measures will likely increase inequality and urged more action to hep those affected by the energy crisis and rising cost of living what is the imf why do their comments matter the washington dc based lender of last resort has helped bail out struggling nation states around the world for more than 70 years but it is extremely rare for the organisation to intervene in a developed country s economic policy britain was forced to apply for an imf loan of nearly 4 billion during the 1976 financial crisis with the fund s negotiators insisting on deep cuts in public expenditure at the time the bailout has long been regarded as a low point of modern british economic history imf officials have warned repeatedly in recent months of the need to carefully calibrate fiscal and monetary policy as central bankers raise interest rates across the globe to get inflation under control advertisement against a backdrop of the pandemic russia s invasion of ukraine and rising global interest rates the organisation s lending has hit a hit a record high at 14billion the ft reported zambia and sri lanka which both defaulted in the pandemic are currently negotiating imf bailouts as part of efforts to restructure debts what is it responding to the imf comments followed the tories unveiling a controversial mini budget on friday that was designed to reboot growth a move that saw the pound slump to a record low against the dollar by monday the sell off of sterling as well as jitters across the financial markets has led to fears the bank of england is certain to raise interest rates dramatically to save the currency which in turn is likely to spell bad news for homeowners chancellor kwasi kwarteng responded by saying he would set out medium term debt cutting plans on november 23 alongside forecasts from the independent office for budget responsibility of the full scale of government borrowing what did the imf say the imf said the proposals which sent the pound to touch an all time low of 1 0327 on monday would likely increase inequality and it questioned the wisdom of such policies advertisement given elevated inflation pressures in many countries including the uk we do not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture as it is important that fiscal policy does not work at cross purposes to monetary policy an imf spokesperson said we are closely monitoring recent economic developments in the uk and are engaged with the authorities the spokesperson said the imf understands that britain s sizable fiscal package was intended to help residents deal with higher energy prices and to boost growth via tax cuts and supply measures but such measures could put fiscal policy at cross purposes with monetary policy the spokesperson said the fund said a budget due from kwarteng in november would provide an early opportunity for the uk government to consider ways to provide support that is more targeted and reevaluate the tax measures especially those that benefit high income earners what has the reaction been the bbc s economics editor faisal islam said the imf telling a g7 member and major shareholder to re evaluate their signature economic policy because it does not recommend such packages and will increase inequality suggests profound international concern in finance ministries about a global impact of uk crisis advertisement this the

there may be an unlikely opportunity for italian financial institutions to regain market confidence after the italian election perhaps more important is that they attempt shore up their capital provided they take advantage of political stability if it ensues it is still too early to tell what the newly formed italian government will deliver no doubt the general reaction in europe has been one of grave caution to say the least given the coalition government is the most far right the country has chosen since wwii and while perhaps widely unwanted across europe in italy the victory was widely expected led by her brothers of italy party giorgia meloni s coalition is expected to hold some stability and be able to form a new government relatively fast off the back of the combined 44 of the votes it received alongside far right politican matteo salvini s league and former prime minister silvio berlusconi s forza italia at the same time the coalition government lacks the two thirds majority in both chambers of the parliament that is necessary to make any profound changes meanwhile the conclusion of italy s election paves the way for the long awaited recapitalisation of the world s oldest and arguably one of the most troubled banks banca monte dei paschi di siena the new government ends months of political deadlock sparked by the collapse of mario draghi s government in july still uncertainties remain about whether the italian government which owns 64 2 of mps will launch its 2 5bn recapitalisation for which it had committed under draghi s government surely the recapitalisation will be a political decision and there is also the prevailing risk averse sentiment that will further complicate most equity transactions what equity capital markets bankers will be closely watching for next is any clarity on the equity deal from the new government and whether it will keep the previous commitment to subscribe for a 64 2 share of the recap the jury is still out on whether the coalition government will shake the internal as well as external political landscape in the european union but for once it is not the italian politics but those from the uk that have sent a shockwavethroughout the european markets the words of one senior fixed income banker reflect the current mood quite well italian politics used to be the number one source of market volatility in europe but not right now i asked one investor if he wanted to talk about italy but he was interested in what was happening with the uk however btps too have had their share of sharp jumps in yields the five and 10 year btp yields are up around 79bp and 75bp since september 19 some 37bp and 42bp of this increase coming from just before the election which indicates investors worries looking at this in the context of the 25bp rise in the btp bund spread since the start of the penultimate week in september it becomes somewhat more palatable assuming political stability holds in italy and there is no escalation in the war in ukraine that could send renewed shockwaves through global markets mps s recapitalisation could be just the signal italian financial institutions need debt capital market bankers agree that mps s equity deal is a far riskier proposition for investors than debt capital instruments from the country s financial institutions demand for tier two and even additional tier one bonds from italian banks should gain some tailwind from a successful mps execution pushing forward the recap will send a clear signal of government unity at least for the time being political instability on the other hand would translate into more volatility from higher btp yields something which would hurt italian banks given their huge holdings of government bonds bank of america and scope ratings both highlight that italian banks have significantly improved their capital since 2018 bofa s research shows that banks non performing loans have been reduced by two thirds in the short time since 2017 it also notes that these institutions funding has improved thanks to stable retail deposits in a bid to avoid past hits on their balance sheets from mark to market losses when btps widened italian banks have also rebalanced their holdings of italian government bonds they have reduced their btps held as other comprehensive income to 39 of their common equity tier one capital as of june from 106 at the end of 2017 according to scope despite all these improvements the perceived risk of italian banks remains elevated the cost of protecting against default on their debt is some of the highest in europe unicredit s credit default swaps ended tuesday at 174bp intesa sanpaolo at 150bp and banco bpm at 198bp these levels compare to deutsche bank s cds at 152bp commerzbank at

said as this is my first statement in a press release since the recent passing of my beloved father dr raymond v damadian i will take this opportunity to honor him dr damadian made medical history in 1971 with the scientific discovery that created the mri industry every mri picture ever made hinges on that discovery he built the world s first mri scanner in 1977 created the world s first mri company in 1978 which would later be named fonar corporation and produced and sold the world s first commercial mri in 1980 it was a struggle for the company from its inception as it had to compete with powerful well heeled corporate giants including johnson johnson general electric hitachi and siemens it truly was a david versus goliath battle yet through technological innovations extraordinary perseverance the help of devoted family members friends and employees and god s blessing and support dr damadian was able to keep fonar afloat the company had its ups and downs for many years eventually achieving consistent profitability based on dr damadian s fundamental discovery the ever expanding diagnostic capabilities of mri technology have enabled medical practitioners the world over to dramatically improve the quality of healthcare and in fact save countless numbers of lives to this day over 40 years since fonar introduced the first commercial mri scanner mri remains a premiere diagnostic imaging tool and the term mri is now a household word today we at fonar and hmca gratefully enjoy the fruits of my father s genius tenacity and tireless devotion and are committed to honor him with continuing success regarding the results of fiscal 2022 mr damadian said i am pleased that mri scan volume at hmca managed mri centers in fiscal 2022 marked our full return to pre covid 19 levels scan volume in pre covid fiscal 2019 was 184 028 scan volume in fiscal 2022 was 186 448 while a three year recovery period may at first glance seem like a long time it is actually something we at hmca are proud of the pandemic took its greatest toll on our business in fiscal 2020 as the result of decreased patient volume employee sicknesses quarantine restrictions reduced business hours staffing shortages etc scan volume fell by 9 compared to the previous year from 184 028 to 166 698 scans since then we have recovered steadily scan volume increased by 7 in fiscal 2021 from 166 698 to 178 364 and then by 5 in fiscal 2022 from 178 364 to 186 448 it s noteworthy that our recovery has been achieved in spite of covid 19 s continuing negative effect on our business while the rate of infections from covid 19 and its variants has been decreasing some of our centers continue to face an unrelenting shortage of qualified workers which has prevented them from returning to their regular pre covid 19 business hours and consequently scan volumes however since fiscal 2020 we added some new centers and installed second mris at some of our existing high volume mri centers most recently in fiscal 2022 we installed additional mris in pembroke pines florida and manhattan new york these new centers and the addition of second mris have helped to offset the volume losses at our short staffed sites looking ahead by the end of this calendar year we expect to have added two more centers one in the bronx new york and then one in central florida i am grateful to our management team and all the hmca employees who have kept us on the road to recovery and for consistently doing their very best to cope with the ongoing negative impact of the pandemic although we can t predict what the economy the labor force and the continuing effects of covid 19 or its variants will look like in fiscal 2023 i am confident judging from our history that we will do what needs to be done to keep the company profitable significant events on september 13 2022 the company adopted a stock repurchase plan the plan has no expiration date and cannot determine the number of shares which will be repurchased on september 26 2022 the board of directors approved up to 9 million to be repurchased under the plan which will be purchased on the publicly traded open market at prevailing prices with the passing of raymond vahan damadian m d fonar employees customers shareholders and their families and the world at large have lost a brilliant and caring physician and inventor he started the mri industry with the founding of fonar corporation in 1978 the first company to install the first of thousands of mri scanners in america and the world in 1960 dr damadian chose to pursue research after graduating from albert einstein college of medicine his interests were in cellular biology that pursuit led him to become familiar with nuclear magnetic resonance nmr a technology that analyzed samples in a test tube it was during the following year on june 18 1970 that he performed the first experiments whereby he discovered the distinctly elongated time lapsed signal marking the differences between normal and cancerous tissue as well as the differences among various normal organs themselves it is these signal differences that make the mri image at the time dr damadian called this his eureka moment this underpins tissue contrast in each and every mri image ever produced and is the foundation of the mri industry on march 19 1971 dr damadian published his discovery in the in 1987 the institute for scientific information philadelphia pa whose specialty is citation indexing recognized dr damadian s science journal article as a citation classic because of the frequency that it was referenced by other scientist authors in the field on march 17 1972 dr damadian filed where he described the use of the t1 and t2 relaxations as a method for detecting cancer and providing the first method ever for accomplishing a scan of the live human body it also provides the first method ever for a means of achieving the needed 3d spatial localization necessary to accomplish a body scan it describes the method of using this localization to scan the live human body to detect cancer the patented scanning method accomplishes the 3d spatial localization of a voxel by voxel acquisition by the combined shaping of the static and rf magnetic fields on july 3 1977 dr damadian and his two graduate students lawrence minkoff ph d and michael goldsmith ph d made the that of dr minkoff s chest they achieved it on the this world s first mri scan accomplished dr damadian s 1969 dream of scanning the human body he had successfully taken nmr from a test tube size device to a human size device other highlights of fonar corporation while dr damadian was president and chairman of the board include 1978 first company in the mri industry founded by dr damadian and colleagues 1980 first to install a commercial mri the mri scanner was called the and was installed in a cleveland ohio radiology practice the method of data acquisition was called field focused nuclear magnetic resonance or by its acronym fonar 1981 fonar joined nasdaq under the symbol fonr in the initial public offering 1 5 million shares were issued and 6 3 million was raised allowing fonar to build hundreds of mri scanners during the 1980s 1982 first to introduce its patented iron core technology which is the basis for all open mri scanners 1984 first to invent oblique imaging providing medical technology the means to produce multiple images at any angle which was never before possible in medical imaging 1985 first to invent the multi angle oblique mao scanning protocol an innovative dramatic extension of fonar s oblique imaging which was patented 1985 first fda approval for a mobile mri scanner 1986 first interventional mri performed at ucla on the fonar beta 3000 mri scanner 1995 during fonar s successful patent infringement trial general electric acknowledged that there was no prior art to dr damadian s cancer detection patent which was based on his discovery that was first reported in the 1971 journal of science 1995 first four post 35 tesla electromagnet mri approved for marketing by the fda 1995 first fda cleared high field open mri 0 6 tesla the quad 12000 1996 first to introduce the 1997 fonar corporation received 128 7 million for infringement of dr damadian s original patent and one other magnetic resonance imaging patent dr damadian s invention of the magnetic resonance imaging mri scanner has earned him top awards including the united states national medal of technology from president ronald reagan 1988 he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame 1989 joining others such as thomas edison alexander graham bell and the wright brothers he received the lemelson mit program lifetime achievement award 2001 as the man who invented the mri scanner his first mri machine indomitable is part of the smithsonian institution collection 1987 dr damadian received the benjamin franklin medal and bower award for business leadership 2004 for his contribution to the origination of mr scanning the intellectual property owners education foundation presented dr damadian with the 2007 national inventor of the year award for his development of upright mri technology he received the award 2018 from the chiari syringomyelia foundation csf perhaps professor donlin long m d former chairman of neurosurgery johns hopkins university said it best mri is the single most important diagnostic discovery in the history of all of medicine professor long made this statement on november 10 2018 when dr damadian was awarded the excellence in medicine medal of honor from the chiari syringomyelia foundation at brooks s in london england he was joined by fraser henderson m d a neurosurgeon and member of the steering committee for the chiari syringomyelia foundation who said raymond damadian revolutionized medicine with the discovery and development of mri had degenerative changes in their cervical spines that impinged on the spinal canal and limited the pulsatile flow of the cerebrospinal fluid csf lubricating the brain and spinal cord his team was able to view this csf flow in and out of the brain with the patients positioned both lying down and upright it was increased resistance to the outflow of csf he suggested that played a role in the development of ms in these patients this work became one of the catalysts for dr damadian s intense interest during the later part of his life in how the human body s position influences csf circulation between the brain and spinal canal when the fonar upright mri was used to examine patients and visualize these differences the results revealed a promising indication for future studies to investigate the csf posture correlation in brain waste clearance and aging as well as in a range of different neurodegenerative ailments about fonar fonar the inventor of mr scanning located in melville ny was incorporated in 1978 and is the first oldest and most experienced mri company in the industry fonar introduced the world s first commercial mri in 1980 and went public in 1981 fonar s signature product is the fonar upright multi position mri also known as the stand up mri the only whole body mri that performs position imaging pmri and scans patients in numerous weight bearing positions i e standing sitting in flexion and extension as well as the conventional lie down position the fonar upright mri often detects patient problems that other mri scanners cannot because they are lie down weightless only scanners the patient friendly upright mri has a near zero patient claustrophobic rejection rate as a fonar customer states if the patient is claustrophobic in this scanner they ll be claustrophobic in my parking lot approximately 85 of patients are scanned sitting while watching tv fonar has new works in progress technology for visualizing and quantifying the cerebral hydraulics of the central nervous system the flow of cerebrospinal fluid csf which circulates throughout the brain and vertebral column at the rate of 32 quarts per day this imaging and quantifying of the dynamics of this vital life sustaining physiology of the body s neurologic system has been made possible first by fonar s introduction of the mri and now by this latest works in progress method for quantifying csf in all the normal positions of the body particularly in its upright flow against gravity patients with whiplash or other neck injuries are among those who will benefit from this new understanding fonar s primary source of income and growth is attributable to its wholly owned diagnostic imaging management subsidiary health management company of america hmca fonar s substantial list of patents includes recent patents for its technology enabling full weight bearing mri imaging of all the gravity sensitive regions of the human anatomy especially the brain extremities and spine it includes its newest technology for measuring the upright cerebral hydraulics of the

for a certain kind of movie the greatest tribute you can pay is not being able to sit through to the end at least that s what i like to think the two people who sprinted out of my screening of barbarian on friday night were trying to express by their abrupt exit i d like to tell you exactly what it was in this tense and twisted movie that might have prompted them to head for the doors but i was a too busy suppressing the fight or flight instinct myself barbarian topped the box office when it opened in early september which isn t unusual for horror movies whose fans tend to turn out in droves and then vanish almost as quickly but it s since defied conventional wisdom by holding onto its audience last weekend it actually added 550 screens and having seen it with a crowd albeit one that was two people smaller by the time the credits rolled it s easy to see why written and directed by zach cregger barbarian is a prime example of what you might call un elevated horror where some directors and studios have used the elevated horror label to market scary movies like get out and the witch to people who wouldn t ordinarily be caught dead in one cregger s movie revels in the genre s stock elements a spooky house on a deserted street doors that open and close of their own accord a woman standing at the top of a rough hewn staircase that descends into inky darkness shakily asking hello advertisement cregger has thought about why horror clichés work and he keeps paying them off in unexpected ways barbarian doesn t feel the need to signal that it s better than genre clichés by constantly winking at them nor does it deploy them with the punishing determination of david gordon green s halloween movies but cregger has thought about why they work and he keeps paying them off in unexpected ways when tess georgina campbell turns up at a short term rental in a particularly bombed out section of detroit only to find it s already occupied by a man named keith bill skarsgård alarm bells immediately start ringing and his jittery attempts to set her at ease only make matters worse she surreptitiously snaps a picture of his driver s license and you keep waiting for the moment when she ll plug his name or likeness into a search engine and find out that he s an escaped serial killer but instead she just gazes at it fondly zooming in on her iphone to get a better look at his face and though when she returns to the rental home in daylight she realizes the neighborhood is much worse than she thought theirs appears to be the only house within miles that isn t crumbling entirely to ruin she sticks around anyway the movie justifies this vaguely with a tossed off line about how every room in town is booked because of some convention or other but of course the real reason tess stays is that the movie requires it and because we want her to advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement barbarian s script thinks through its problems as much as it needs to and no more it knows that horror and logic are enemies at heart and the trick is to make us desire the knowledge of what s behind that door more than we care why it s opened its best trick is that there s more than one door spoilers for barbarian follow when tess gets stuck in the house s basement the door locks from the outside because whatever it just does she finds a hidden passageway that leads to a windowless room containing a filthy mattress and a video camera along with a bloody handprint smeared on the wall not long after she realizes there s a hidden door behind that hidden door that one leading to a rough hewn staircase leading down into the earth eventually we realize there s another door beyond that one too but the movie s real trap doors aren t physical but structural tess starts descending those stairs about 40 minutes into the movie and the farther down she goes the more unbelievable it seems that there s nearly an hour to go but just as an unholy figure rushes out of the darkness at her the movie cuts away and suddenly we re in another time and place watching a callow young tv star aj justin long drive his convertible down the california coast advertisement advertisement naturally aj s story winds its way back to tess s that neatly kept house in an otherwise abandoned neighborhood turns out to belong to him an ill advised real estate investment that becomes his only asset after his career abruptly collapses aj too makes his way down to the basement albeit with the brash cocksureness of a man too dim to conceive of anything he can t handle and soon both of them are trapped in a cage and the story seems to be at another dead end but cregger cuts away yet again this time searing our eyeballs by now well adjusted to dimly lit interiors and stygian pits with the incandescent green of heavily fertilized lawns and brightly painted houses because there are no cues to orient us it takes a while to determine where we are until we realize the question isn t where but when we re back on the same street some 40 years earlier before white flight gutted the neighborhood and left it a shell of itself the fact that both versions of the street were constructed from scratch in bulgaria adds to the feeling of synthetic displacement reagan s economy is sending the markets into a downturn and his neighbor apologetically tells the gruff affectless frank richard brake that he s about to put his house on the market but frank vows that he isn t going anywhere and having seen the future we know how true that is frank goes shopping for baby stuff and we watch him stalk a woman to her house slipping into a utility worker s coveralls and surreptitiously opening the lock on her bathroom window before making his way out if you re up on your netflix serial killer series you know what happens next advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement or maybe you don t because frank isn t just murdering women or imprisoning them and forcing them to bear his children he s doing that and forcing those children to have children with each other and then forcing those children to etc we don t see any evidence of this fortunately beyond a stack of videocassettes with labels like puker and gas station redhead but the product of these concentric circles of incestuous rape is what s stalking the house s subterranean tunnels a mutated woman obsessed with making visitors her babies and yet strong enough to rip a man in two that is not a figure of speech generations of retreat from the outside world has produced something truly monstrous exactly how many generations fit into 40 years is not an equation you re meant to solve but the outside world isn t much better this corner of detroit has been left to rot and the authorities have their hands full making sure the rest of the city doesn t go the same way horror movies love finding ways to disable their protagonists cellphones but barbarian doesn t have to because when tess calls the cops they don t come and when they eventually do come they don t help advertisement advertisement before barbarian cregger was best known as a member of the sketch comedy troupe the whitest kids u know as the career of jordan peele has demonstrated there s a lot of crossover between comedy and horror the genres most dependent on technique and timing either a gag or a scare can be ruined if it s off by a fraction of a second but even more than peele cregger does both at once barbarian isn t horror comedy but it makes you laugh at its audaciousness as well as sometimes to keep yourself from screaming there s also a sequence involving long s character and a tape measure that s the funniest thing i ve seen all year especially as it nears its climax the movie leans into its own absurdity building to a final act that is quite deliberately more silly than it is scary advertisement advertisement it s also and i ve saved this for last so as not to frighten anyone off quite smart barbarian doesn t have an overriding thesis or big statement to make because its intelligence is intuitive rather than programmatic you can make what you like of the fact that tess who is black has come to detroit to interview for a job with a white documentary filmmaker whose latest movie is about jazz that the only other significant black character in the movie is a homeless man who drags her out of the basement and warns her not to go back to that bad place that aj is a gentrifier as well as an accused rapist the subtext about racism and urban renewal toxic masculinity reagan era paranoia and its ramifications in the present day stays subtext there to be mined by those who don t mind making ever so slight fools of themselves the copy of jane eyre conspicuously placed in tess luggage can stay just where it is thanks fortunately you don t have to dig under its surface to think barbarian s a blast

the cone of uncertainty is the tool forecasters use to illustrate a hurricane s likely path and that title has been particularly apt for hurricane ian whose predicted track has fluctuated by hundreds of miles as it developed into a dangerous storm the national hurricane center s initial track saw ian likely hitting florida far south of tampa bay but that was friday over the weekend ian s predicted path shifted briefly to tampa then far north to the tallahassee area in the panhandle and then it moved south again forecasters now say it s on a course that could take it through an area close to tampa people who live in areas vulnerable to hurricanes often look to the cone of uncertainty to determine their own actions whether they should stock up on drinking water and batteries or evacuate altogether but the nhc has repeatedly warned people against focusing on precise locations on a long term forecast on monday for instance it stressed that there is still significant uncertainty in the track of ian especially in the 3 5 day time frame and then there s the massive scale of a hurricane while a map tends to highlight the eye of the storm ian is spinning hurricane force winds up to 35 miles out from its center with tropical storm force winds four times as far and perilous storm surges and rainfall are predicted to cover wide areas even far inland there s a reason we have this cone of uncertainty joel cline the tropical program coordinator for the national weather service told npr if people think of a hurricane as a dot and a city as a dot i think they ve missed the point seriously he added it s the impacts that make the difference we asked cline about ian s track and how those predictions have changed below are highlights from our interview which has been edited for length and clarity hurricanes are notoriously hard to predict first off there are very few easy hurricanes to forecast and they re all different the reason you need somebody monitoring them all the time 24 7 365 is because the atmosphere that they re in is constantly changing and when one recurves from the tropics to the latitudes that s when it gets more difficult to get correct ian has been passing through a transition zone in the mid latitudes weather moves from west to east in the tropics it goes east to west so at some point when a storm moves north away from the equator it s going to be caught in a different flow and move in a different direction and recurve as we call it that s what ian s doing obviously it s not going west it s going north now so it s recurving the storm is butting against a high trough of dry air it s been picked up by this trough which is going all the way down into the middle part of the gulf of mexico and then extends off the coast of north carolina and then up off the coast of newfoundland ian s outer edges are already influenced by that trough so this thing s going to move north it has to go off to the northeast at some point in time the trick is when and how much of a turn is it going to be ian has to participate in that flow it has no choice and little differences will matter to people on the ground where they live everybody s going to get a heck of a lot of rain a foot of rain and higher amounts in some areas as it slows down because these things as they turn they have to slow down that s just physics and if it slows down it rains more over your area maybe it s not a category 4 when it hits but if the center of the storm lessens its intensity all that means is that energy had to go somewhere it doesn t disappear so you have higher winds over a larger area in the hurricane and maybe not as high in the center it s not going to be good people need to understand that and know what the impacts are and what it means for them hurricane ian is just doing its job it s doing its sole purpose you know the reason we have hurricanes is heat transport that s physics you ve got a lot of heat at the equator and you don t have a lot of heat at the poles what do you do with the excess heat the way the planet handles that is it takes heat and transports it what s the most efficient way to do that it s a hurricane you take the heat from the tropics and you move it toward the mid latitudes and eventually it gets enough dry air and cooler air and it dissipates or it runs into land and dissipates
rock bottom investor confidence in britain will only recover if finance minister kwasi kwarteng scraps the economic plan that unleashed such turmoil in financial markets leading economists investors and banks warned on tuesday the pound touched an all time low of 1 0327 on monday and british government bonds sold off at a ferocious pace as investors lost confidence in prime minister liz truss s new government some mortgage providers unable to price loans suspended sales u s economist larry summers said the first step in regaining credibility was not saying incredible things after kwarteng suggested there would be more tax cuts on top of the 45 billion pounds worth of debt funded cuts he announced last week summers a former u s treasury secretary pointed to surging interest rates on long dated british debt as a hallmark of situations where credibility has been lost and said the crisis would affect london s viability as a global financial centre my guess is that pound will find its way below parity with both the dollar and euro he added truss was elected prime minister earlier this month by a vote of conservative party members not the broader electorate with a vow to snap the economy out of years of stagnant growth with deep tax cuts and deregulation but an economic plan outlined on friday by her finance minister kwarteng that required an additional 72 billion pounds worth of government debt issuance in this fiscal year alone has sent shockwaves through financial markets sending the costs of such borrowing even higher while many of her lawmakers have cheered a return to the thatcherite and reaganomics doctrines of the 1980s some are starting to express alarm about the impact it will have on the finances of the government companies and households two years before a general election is due the opposition labour party now holds a 17 point lead over truss s conservatives a level not seen in more than two decades according to a yougov opinion poll for the times newspaper huw merriman a conservative lawmaker who backed truss s rival former finance minister rishi sunak in the race to become prime minister said the victor appeared to be losing our voters with policies we warned against for the good of our country and the livelihoods of everyone in our country i still hope to be proven wrong he said on twitter nyse twtr in response to the turmoil the bank of england and treasury released statements after london stock markets closed on monday in the hope of reassuring investors with the central bank saying it would not hesitate to raise interest rates if needed that immediately knocked the pound further as some investors had bet on an emergency rate hike although it recovered partially on tuesday up 0 9 at 1 0782 at 8 03 a m 0703 gmt british government bond yields fell sharply too but only partly reversing the historic increases seen on friday and monday former boe deputy governor charles bean said he advocated an emergency move from the central bank on this occasion if i had still been at the bank in my role as deputy governor i certainly would have been counselling the governor that i think this is one of those occasions where it might have made sense to call a meeting he told bbc radio a go big and go fast strategy would be the best approach bean said markets still watching kwarteng pledged on monday to set out medium term debt cutting plans on nov 23 alongside forecasts from the independent office for budget responsibility showing the full scale of government borrowing conservative lawmaker andrew bridgen told bbc radio he had spoken to kwarteng since friday and that he expected him to cut government spending in the coming weeks economist allan monks from america s largest bank j p morgan said the verbal intervention from the boe and treasury had been measured but there is still no clear sign that the source of the problem the government s fiscal strategy is being reversed or reconsidered monks said this will need to happen before november in order to avoid a much worse outcome for the economy chris scicluna head of economic research at daiwa capital markets said there was no reason why markets would give the government the benefit of the doubt before kwarteng s fiscal announcement in late november the market could force their hand and there still could be an emergency rate hike before the next boe meeting he said referring to the next scheduled policy announcement on nov 3 source reuters
president joe biden likes to ridicule the stock market he never talks about bonds or interest rates he frequently criticizes donald trump for keeping a sharp eye on the stock market as a leading indicator on the economy well biden might want to have another think about this stock market business because it s falling now almost on a daily basis the broad based s p 500 is off 24 year to date signaling a bear market and a recession the u s treasury bond market has basically collapsed prices have plunged and interest rates have soared u s government credit is still good but treasury market rates have gone up 3 4 points this year the 10 year is nearly 4 30 year mortgages are 6 5 the inflation fighting fed will run its target rate to at least 5 if not higher the inflation rate is stubborn around 8 core inflation roughly 7 the gdp tracker from the atlanta fed held its number for q3 steady at 0 3 today following two down quarters in the first half none of this is good really joe biden should be reading the business pages i ll be glad to help him out with a subscription according to the gallup poll 58 of americans own stocks hat tip to liz peek for that info that s a lot of people to ignore mr president markets in for a terrible october ahead of midterm elections kevin hassett warns in the second quarter household wealth fell 6 trillion that s mostly housing and stocks because of inflation the typical working family has lost 4 200 in real income over the past year government pension funds are down 8 the stock market is sending a message and it s not a happy one every time mr biden goes out there and talks about zero inflation and a strong economy he s begging the credulity of every american nobody believes him kitchen table prices are rising portfolios are falling it s not a good combination mr biden inherited a booming economy with virtually no inflation from donald trump and in slightly more than a year turned it into a busting recession with record inflation in just over a year that s not an easy thing to do and still today despite what financial markets are telling him what typical families are telling him what parents are telling him what the border crisis is telling him what the crime wave is telling him he will not listen the radical progressive economic model has failed dismally mr biden has committed the cardinal sin of politics he promised success and delivered failure if the big government socialist model was going to succeed it would have already succeeded but it hasn t and americans are a very practical minded common sense group if something s not working either fix it or throw it out that s what this eye popping washington post abc news poll is telling us in key swing districts across the country republicans have a 21 lead that s right 21 and kevin mccarthy s commitment to america is emphasizing all of the key issues on voters minds inflation economy crime and so forth click here to get the fox news app i m sure there will be lots of polls in the next month that don t agree with each other but it looks to me like the gop cavalry is closing fast and if they sweep congress it s possible there is a stock market bottom maybe one can hope but right now the stock market is very annoyed at joe biden s progressive policies and because it doesn t seem that he reads the business pages he is in danger of missing some big time shock and awe coming right at him that s what stocks are telling him that s what interest rates are telling him that s what polls are telling him the cavalry is coming that s my riff this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the september 27 2022 edition of kudlow
liz peek biden thinks stock market doesn t matter here s what he doesn t get stock markets are crashing but joe biden doesn t care the cheery president is oblivious even though u s investors have lost 7 6 trillion since he took office and we are now officially in a bear market politico reports that biden wants to hit the road eager to tout his economic achievements and confident that the nation s outlook is brightening this as economists from bank of america among many others are predicting a recession in 2023 and rising unemployment thanks to the federal reserve s efforts to combat inflation and as prominent companies like fedex and ge confirm such gloomy forecasts by warning more trouble lies ahead but then this is the same clueless president who hosted an inflation reduction party featuring james taylor crooning about drug addiction the same day a bad inflation read caused the dow to plunge 1 200 points one of the worst drops this year asked recently about the slide in share prices biden said the stock market doesn t necessarily reflect the state of the economy as you well know and the economy is still strong actually the economy shrank during the past two quarters the housing market is in freefall and an inverted yield curve is flashing red here s news for president biden the stock market matters the direction of share prices influences consumer sentiment which in turn helps drive spending job growth and also elections it is not a coincidence that biden s approval ratings inched higher this past summer as stock markets recovered some of the ground lost last spring biden has more than once criticized his predecessor for boasting about rising share prices during the 2020 campaign he said throughout this crisis donald trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market the dow and nasdaq not you not your families biden promised that if he were elected he would be laser focused on working families not the wealthy investor class they don t need me turns out the wealthy investor class has much in common with those middle class families that biden pledged to help both are being clobbered by sky high inflation and anti business policies democrats reckless spending has fueled a 12 7 increase in prices under biden s watch combined with higher interest rates the average american has lost 4 200 in real annual income more than wiping out the gains made during the trump years the nation s wealth dropped by a record 6 1 trillion in the second quarter thanks to falling stock prices that was the second consecutive decline in a row and occurred despite still rising home prices now that house prices are dropping the current stock market slump is even more painful declining consumer net worth is damaging if people feel richer they spend more it s that simple much of the discretionary spending in the economy outlays for travel or entertainment for instance is done by people in the higher income brackets households earning more than 100 000 accounted for only about 27 of the u s population in 2020 but made 47 of expenditures wealthier people not only spend more than the average person they also rein in their purchases when they see their net worth plummeting these are the folks that will determine whether the economy is stuck or soaring these are the people most impacted by a sinking stock market the tie between consumer net worth and spending is one reason the economy recovered faster than expected from the pandemic shutdown a near 20 rise in stock prices during 2020 combined with over 2 trillion in excess savings meant that even as covid 19 still stalked the nation americans were ready and able to spend that combination of wealth effect and cash in savings accounts should have alerted the federal reserve that spending would exceed their forecasts and given supply chain problems send prices for scarce goods soaring the same combination should have prompted the government which had already doled out trillions of dollars in aid to combat the pandemic slowdown to turn off the spigots instead democrats pushed through the 1 9 trillion american rescue plan throwing gasoline on the inflation fire despite biden s divisive rhetoric it isn t just the nation s wealthiest who are impacted by the ups and downs of stock prices gallup reports that 58 of americans own shares either personally or with their spouse retirees invested in stocks are struggling to maintain their standard of living as inflation drives the cost of everything higher and their nest eggs shrink savers who have put their money into iras or other plans and invested in stocks see their portfolios dwindle pension plans are also losing ground companies providing retirement benefits will have to increase their contributions with less money left over for pay hikes or new hires even public pension funds are being hit by the stock market sell off those groups are heavily invested in private equity funds which are struggling to realize gains as valuations fall the wall street journal reports public pensions reported returning a median minus 7 9 for the fiscal year ended june 30 their worst losses since 2009 according to data from wilshire trust universe comparison service because those plans are underperforming their stated targets cities and states will have to raise taxes or cut services to meet their promised retirement funds for cops and teachers so when candidate biden promised in 2020 to end to the era of shareholder capitalism he effectively promised to undermine the very foundations of our economy donald trump predicted that if joe biden were elected the stock market will crash was he wrong or just early comments are closed

the classic balanced portfolio of equities and bonds has been through difficult terrain lately thanks to rising inflation rising interest rates and falling growth expectations assets that many investors hope will play a defensive role in times of uncertainty namely bonds have failed to do so even as assets that have traditionally performed well in better times stocks have suffered yet one asset class has bucked the trend real assets which include commodities infrastructure and real estate traditionally thought of as inflation hedges much is uncertain about the outlook will central banks be able to control inflation will their efforts cause a recession has the covid 19 pandemic led to structural changes in the economy and in the trajectory of inflation and interest rates as these questions have weighed on investors real assets have provided a much needed source of diversification inflation surges globally inflation has risen dramatically since late 2020 and this rise has been pervasive hitting decades long highs in many countries in the united states its highest level since the early 1980s in japan and the united kingdom since the early 1990s in the euro area since its founding australia has fared relatively better but it continues to trend higher well above the rba s target level globally the international monetary fund imf expects consumer price inflation cpi to reach levels last seen in the 1990s a variety of factors have contributed to this surge including a dramatic increase in commodity prices constraints on supply and changing consumption patterns due to the pandemic and cyclical pressures from the broader economic recovery aided by generous policy support in the united states demand for labor has exceeded supply putting upward pressure on wages particularly in reopening industries looking ahead there are clear risks that could exacerbate already tight conditions russia s invasion of ukraine threatens to constrain the global supply of a number of important commodities including wheat natural gas and oil and the pandemic continues to threaten further disruptions to production and supply chains particularly in china where authorities remain committed to zero covid despite the emergence of highly infectious new variants of covid 19 in response to rising inflation central banks have raised interest rates and tightened financial conditions as it became clear that they could no longer afford to patiently wait for pandemic related factors to subside in a number of emerging markets policymakers came to this conclusion sooner and began raising interest rates in 2021 many of their developed markets peers have pivoted to less accommodative policy since including the us federal reserve late 2022 the european central bank and australia s rba all in 2022 in theory inflationary pressure linked to the strength of the economic recovery ought to subside as higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions slow economic activity but high commodity prices and other pandemic related pressures may prove harder to tame raising concerns both that central banks may cause a recession on purpose or by accident and that expectations for higher future inflation could become embedded leading to an environment of slow growth and high inflation that is difficult to dislodge another key uncertainty about the outlook is whether structural changes in the economy some accelerated by the pandemic and others longer running may have more permanently changed the economic and market environment for example stretched global supply chains and new geopolitical realities are leading many multinational corporations to reconsider their outsourcing of manufacturing to low cost areas and their reliance on just in time manufacturing in favour of reshoring and greater redundancy in production furthermore while the macroeconomic impacts are difficult to untangle climate change may put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates because it will require massive investment in the coming years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to build greater resilience to its many impacts and to respond to climate disasters that are increasing in their severity and frequency what works when a balanced portfolio doesn t high inflation rising interest rates and falling growth expectations have proven to be a particularly difficult recipe for balanced portfolios as both equities and bonds have suffered one asset class has stood out during this period real assets which derive their value from something tangible in the real world such as real estate commodities or infrastructure as equities and bonds have struggled real assets have outperformed as one would expect based on history all three broad categories real estate infrastructure and commodities are well suited to inflationary periods but have differing characteristics that can make one more or less attractive than the others depending on the economic and market environment for example commodities might be most attractive in an environment of accelerating economic growth and rising demand for production and investment while infrastructure tends to have more stable revenue streams that might be more defensive in an environment of slowing growth the way forward we are in an especially difficult period for investors as both equities and bonds have sold off in response to high inflation rising interest rates and falling growth expectations real assets like commodities real estate and infrastructure have outperformed during this period and provided valuable hedges against uncertainty it may be that central banks will quickly bring inflation to heel and that they will be able to do so without triggering a recession a rare soft landing however after so many unexpected and unusual developments over the past two years and with so many challenges ahead for the global economy we think there is a compelling case for real assets as a diversifying component of a well balanced portfolio and a safeguard against the unexpected jai jacob portfolio manager analyst lazard real assets team
the predicted growth in food demand over the coming decades creates significant opportunities for australian agriculture the local industry is in a strong position to meet this rising demand and australia has a comparative advantage in both the production of many agricultural products and our proximity to key markets like many markets agricultural prices vary between years and cycles largely reflecting supply demand economics however underlying demand for agricultural real assets and food products continues to grow and this trend is likely to remain for years ahead agriculture in different economic cycles agriculture returns also behave differently to traditional asset classes in various economic conditions and can offer important defensive characteristics to investment portfolios as an example during the global financial crisis not only did the prices of some goods fall much more than others agricultural products experienced the smallest declines while oil and minerals experienced the largest but global trade in agricultural products continued to grow over the period of the crisis and beyond when considering the impact of covid 19 an investment in agriculture is fundamentally linked to demand for food and staple products over the past two years as in previous pandemic events this demand has remained relatively stable and resilient amongst other economic pressures these strong fundamentals point to an asset class that is a valuable long term investment through any cycle however stepping back from the fundamentals and strong secular outlook for agricultural products this asset class is also becoming an increasingly important option for its low correlation diversification as an insulator to portfolio volatility and as a proven tool to hedge against inflation hedging against inflation the covid 19 pandemic pushed global economies into a snap recession unlike any downturn event in history with varying trends in infection rates and different government policy settings around the globe the recovery has not been one paced and different sectors have been impacted in different ways however a common response was the unprecedented fiscal policy from across the developed world including record low interest rates coupled with monetary easing the fiscal and monetary stimulus that was required to drive a full global recovery particularly the role of low interest rates led to a build up of inflationary pressures which central banks and markets are now trying to deal with long term investors are looking at their current portfolios evaluating what the impact of higher inflation and interest rates may be and assessing new investment opportunities that offer inflation protection and at the same time potential upside with traditional hedges such as government bonds offering relatively low returns in today s environment investors are turning to alternatives such as real assets as solutions that can not only protect against inflation but potentially benefit from an inflationary environment an increasingly popular investment solution in the real assets sector is agriculture farmland which provides investors with three key characteristics to fight inflation pressures within a diversified portfolio inelastic demand of food consumption the unquestionable necessity of food has been further highlighted through the pandemic and more recently the supply chain disruptions highlighted due to geopolitical events inelastic supply of assets although productivity and efficiency can increase ultimately the core elements of an agricultural investment farmland and water resources are finite and not something that can be manufactured or easily substituted correlation to inflation the commodities underpinning an agricultural investment themselves are highly correlated to inflation and product pricing has historically tracked with or beyond high economic growth rates farmland capital returns during high inflationary periods although the impacts of inflation on income yield in agriculture can vary there is a clear trend that in periods of high inflation farmland asset values increase at their highest rates in the period between 1978 and 2021 farmland values in australia increased at the highest rates during periods of high inflation and in particular when cpi has been above 4 2 per cent interest rates can also have a profound effect on property values across all sectors including farmland as higher interest rates increase the cost of finance and in turn reduce net operational returns however the impact of interest rates in agriculture is not as dramatic as that of inflation which is more highly correlated to farmland capital returns than the rba cash rate the impacts of high inflation on agriculture income yields in line with performance through historic events of economic stress agricultural investment returns have been highly resilient through the pandemic unlike traditional inflation hedges such as gold farmland is also an income generating asset that can produce a reliable yield specifically for agricultural income returns moderate to high inflation has different influences on key profit drivers and the impacts depend on relative inflation in agricultural outputs as well as the economic position of our relevant trading partners making up a large portion of the cpi basket of goods agricultural outputs such as food and beverages are naturally exposed to inflation a rise in prices can be indicative of higher revenue for producers of these goods and if occurring at the same time as a depreciating australian dollar aud it has the potential to be supportive of agricultural profits it must be noted that inflation in goods and services can increase the cost of farm inputs potentially squeezing margins unless revenue growth fully compensates such extra costs upward cost pressures on labour would also be expected in an inflationary cycle however agriculture is a much more sophisticated and less labour intensive sector than it once was and a continued focus on technology operating efficiency and automation across the food supply chain has reduced and will continue to reduce wage pressures over time high quality well managed farmland investments offer an attractive alternative to traditional asset classes which is largely agnostic to economic cycles adding or increasing exposure to agriculture within a well balanced investment portfolio can offer considerable benefits to long term investors steve jarrott portfolio manager

menafn globenewswire nasdaq new york sept 27 2022 globe newswire almost two years after the 44 day war the armenians of artsakh are trying to restore their lives even as challenges persist despite bearing the heaviest burdens of war and insecurity in caring and providing for their families and rehabilitating the post war society two years later the challenges people face in this little known corner of the caucasus are only multiplying the november 2020 trilateral agreement to end the hostilities signed by armenia azerbaijan and russia redrew the map of the region displacing thousands and making an uncertain future in the process according to the human rights ombudsman of artsakh twenty thousand out of the 40 000 internally displaced persons are women eight thousand are children six hundred women were widowed after the war 12 out of 80 killed civilians were women gegham stepanyan shared the official data on women affected by the recent conflict adding that the fate of four missing women civilians is still unknown at a first glance these figures are a drop in the sea in light of the global picture of a staggering 100 million displaced persons worldwide according to the un refugee agency s most recent report almost one in every 78 human beings on earth is now displaced 80 are women and children yet unlike in other conflict zones international organizations do not operate in nagorno karabakh to date the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr has failed to live up to its commitment of addressing the problems of the internally displaced under the november 2020 statement which is why local authorities have had to primarily rely on their own resources and financial assistance coming from armenia and the armenian diaspora the red cross and the russian peacekeeping contingent deployed in the region just hours after the war also extended a helping hand providing humanitarian aid to local populations a number of studies including un reports prove that women and children are most affected by armed conflicts displaced women were disproportionately affected by the loss of livelihoods caused by the war the overwhelming majority were not able to practice their livelihoods due to loss of land housing and livestock two thousand women mainly working in educational and cultural fields lost their jobs women engaged in agricultural work lost both their income source and property adds the human rights ombudsman economic empowerment is critical for women to determine the course of their lives and to reach their full potential meanwhile women capacity building programs are mainly being implemented in yerevan while stepanakert and rural areas are left out the only program aimed at women empowerment in artsakh has been implemented by agbu armenia for the past three years although there are no registrations of sexual violence due to conflict the right to dignity is violated in many cases for instance a six member family has to live in a single room apartment causing hygiene and privacy problems for women and young girls says the 31 year old ombudsman displaced women seek jobs in stepanakert to be able to improve their living conditions but the only option the labor market may offer them is work in the service sector where a monthly salary is under 100 thousand amd 230 usd still even with such a low income women manage to live and raise their children in artsakh i ve become vulnerable after losing my husband says elina hurumyan 28 a housewife left alone with her two little kids anush a 4 5 years old girl and armen a 2 5 years old boy her husband captain arayik hurumyan was killed in hadrut in october 2020 the family lost their home and property as their village mets tagher of the hadrut region came under the control of azerbaijani armed forces during the 44 day war hurumyan is looking to the future the government has helped her family to solve the housing problem she currently lives with her two children in a new condo in stepanakert the armenian government supports the heirs of fallen servicemen but legal issues and poverty sometimes translate to family feuds over resource competition due to the ambiguity of the law that doesn t make it clear who the primary beneficiary is the mother of the killed serviceman or wife hurumyan s mother in law received the financial assistance the military insurance fund provided for the killed captain hurumyan leaving these three without any direct financial aid i feel i want to realize any wish of kids also on the part of their father and raise them the way they are not affected by incomplete family problems the 28 year old widow shares however the gap between a young mother s wish and her real financial capabilities only increases as hurumyan cannot work with little kids meanwhile children are growing day by day and so are their needs the only income of the three member family consists of the social benefits for children that make 100 thousand amd 230 usd that s where the state social benefit policy towards families like elina s ends in hadrut the densely forested mountainous terrain that armenians called home for millennia they owned a small business in the form of one self service coffee making vending machine she remembers with excitement the moments of collecting the coins with her husband i know how to use it if i could own one in stepanakert i can provide some stable income even if it s small in amount the young mother concludes the lack of economic opportunities is not the only challenge that women face in artsakh while many women are struggling against the odds to both care and provide for their families after the loss of husbands and male relatives their peers are underrepresented in leadership positions due to male dominated politics as of today only two out of the 11 member government are women which translates to 18 and only seven out of the 33 seat parliament 21 the picture is much worse in regional administration or state bodies the percentage of women executives there is 0 like anywhere else working in the shadow of men is challenging for women in artsakh says irina mangasaryan 48 the chief of staff at the office of the security council of artsakh and one of the few women to hold a top bureaucratic position women in security military police and law enforcement in particular are traditionally underrepresented and underappreciated although many women are engaged in these state agencies they are mainly entrusted with the work of middle and low ranks mangasaryan a lawyer by profession with experience in government work was appointed to this position after the war before the war i could only see myself in education culture but not in security explains the chief of staff emphasizing that the most challenging part of her job is working with men subordinating her it s not about women s leadership skills we proved we can be multifunctional and deal with multitasking effectively it s about the perception of the role of women in leadership positions by men she states war and conflict affect all women irrespective of their profession position and experience mangasaryan with her family son and husband stayed in artsakh during the 44 day war when people were forced to flee to armenia i had the feeling i will not see them again recollects 48 year old irina however mangasaryan agrees with the general perception that women shook off the post war paralysis more quickly than men since women are more emotional which enables them to deal with their trauma quicker and to adapt to new realities better than men emphasizing that the soil water and air in artsakh the land itself are giving strength to move on dealing with post war realities was also a tremendous challenge for sirarpi avagyan a 33 year old musician who teaches qanon a traditional string instrument at the sayat nova state musical college in stepanakert it was a monumental task for a teacher to attract students back to the classroom for national music and culture lectures given the trauma of war loss explains avagyan adding that her students couldn t focus on education as many of them had lost relatives their homes all of their belongings the musician helped her students to overcome the psychology of war loss while dealing with the same pressure herself as the armed hostilities began she had to flee to armenia seeking a safer place for her three little kids as we escaped i could not imagine that i would ever take up my instrument again i thought the world had ended remembers avagyan explaining that qanon is about national music and culture it took weeks for her to look at her instrument again now i value my instrument my work and my attitude toward armenian culture more than ever says the qanon teacher with strong confidence but not everyone shares her renewed appreciation in the past months numerous concerts art exhibitions and other cultural events have been taking place in the capital stepanakert and regional centers after a long pause cultural life is reviving in artsakh and my students are less depressed but the attitude toward traditional armenian music is not growing however she is not giving up she is leading by example to convince the younger generation of the beauty relevance and healing nature of armenian national instruments and music art therapy is not about distraction it can be a powerful way to express and work through pain to relate to the trauma that her students have been undergoing avagyan decided to perform on stage for fallen heroes keeping artsakh armenian is the number one priority for avagyan we are always ready to die for our homeland she says but more important than that is to unite around our culture our identity and to live for our homeland for the people of artsakh that means living in the homeland like they have for millennia despite all odds women are leading that sacred mission

in the final week of brazil s general election campaign the country s fascistic president jair bolsonaro has continued to warn that he will not recognize any result except for his outright victory in the first round following the playbook of former us president donald trump in the preparation for his january 6 2021 capitol coup attempt bolsonaro has relentlessly declared for four years that the brazilian electronic voting system is being actively rigged to favor the front runner in the polls former president luiz inácio lula da silva of the workers party pt in recent weeks he has attacked as part of this supposed conspiracy the polling institutes that unanimously show him trailing lula by over 10 percentage points lula third from the right henrique meirelles right marina silva third from the left photo by ricardo stuckert much more gravely he has succeeded in integrating the brazilian armed forces which imposed a brutal dictatorship backed by us imperialism between 1964 and 1985 in his operation to discredit brazil s voting machines the military is mounting an operation to audit the vote separately from the country s electoral court tse this operation which finally received a cowardly endorsement from the electoral court president supreme court justice alexandre de moraes has effectively installed the military as the final arbiter of the election under these conditions the pt has launched a sharp turn to the right with the aim of winning the support of even the most reactionary bolsonaro supporters behind a third term for lula the party is promising big business that it will bring the kind of social peace and stability for profit making that bolsonaro is disrupting with his right wing demagogy the chief concern of the pt is that the general misery of the brazilian working class which exploded under bolsonaro including the mass death and suffering caused by his herd immunity policy towards the covid 19 pandemic will bring into question the whole of brazilian capitalism having as its first and foremost concern the chloroforming of public opinion as to the depth of the crisis of brazilian capitalism the party reaffirms day and night that institutions are working and bolsonaro is isolated in his coup preparations the backroom maneuvers of the last two weeks however expose precisely the contrary as widely publicized by both the corporate media and pt mouthpieces like revista fórum lula held a meeting on september 21 with the highest ranking us official in brazil douglas koneff whose nomination for ambassador to brazil remains stalled in the us senate the central issue in the meeting was washington s reassurance that the us will immediately and publicly acknowledge the results proclaimed by the tse likely confirming lula s wide lead on the evening of the election day senior pt advisers have reportedly requested the same from scores of latin american and european ambassadors in an attempt to dissuade the historically pro imperialist military from siding with bolsonaro and thus barring success for his anticipated coup attempt this entire operation is no more than a criminal bet the us southern command had no problem taking part in bolsonaro s fascist independence day marches on september 7 it sent a naval squadron to join celebrations off the coast of rio de janeiro in the name of not upsetting the brazilian military with which the pentagon has closely collaborated for over a century the pt is counting almost exclusively on the fact that bolsonaro a close ally of trump has more than once irritated us officials with criticism of both biden and the us proxy war against russia including a sharp rebuke of us sanctions during the 77th un general assembly last week accordingly lula recently bolstered his political turn towards imperialism with a largely scripted interview with the mouthpiece of brazil s agribusiness tycoons canal rural also on september 21 in which he made an unprecedented denunciation of late venezuelan president hugo chavez a historic target of us imperialism which attempted to kidnap and murder him in a failed 2002 coup lula took his cue from a question about gun ownership rights which were widely expanded by bolsonaro leading to a sharp increase in violence perpetrated by goons at the service of large land owners and miners against both peasants and indigenous communities pressed on whether he would reverse bolsonaro s measures lula affirmed that he never opposed gun ownership in the countryside and assured that the world famous landless workers movement mst a key element of the pt s left wing posturing no longer had any interest in occupying private land and had been transformed into a successful administrator of organic production of rice and other staples the movement which was once portrayed internationally as a radical opponent of the concentration of land ownership and even socialist had matured lula said in a completely unprovoked act of red baiting lula then declared he was opposed to expanded gun ownership because that was what hugo chavez had done in venezuela the pt s recent efforts have also included restoring alliances with marina silva lula s former environment minister who left his government to become a champion of capitalist green washing and neoliberal reforms as well as with lula s former central banker henrique meirelles who headed the economy ministry under bolsonaro s predecessor michel temer both silva and meirelles took part in elaborately staged ceremonies to announce their support for lula after years of publicly opposing the pt after leaving the pt and lula s government in 2008 silva became one of the largest recipients of corporate donations in her three attempts to become president in 2010 2014 and 2018 briefly leading the polls in 2014 against the pt s incumbent president dilma rousseff she was bitterly denounced by the pt for advocating the formal independence of the brazilian central bank the measure was finally approved under michel temer who succeeded rousseff after her 2016 impeachment on trumped up charges at the time meirelles was the minister of economy financial dailies were unanimous in indicating that a slight rise in the value of the brazilian currency the real vis à vis the us dollar on september 20 the day after the lula meirelles meeting was due to the confidence that lula would challenge neither the draconian spending cap imposed by meirelles in 2017 nor the independence of the central bank despite his past and present public promises as for the support of silva it included compromises on regulating the carbon credit market in brazil and curbing deforestation thus helping to unlock a free trade agreement between mercosur and the european union the deal has been decades in the making and is advertised as the largest commercial deal ever signed but it has been blocked by numerous european national governments on the grounds that brazil s intense and destructive farming methods would offer unfair competition to european small farming lula has historically opposed the deal claiming it would destroy national industry now with silva by his side he has vowed to conclude it in his first six months in office thus promising another boon to big business while the fraudulent carbon credit schemes do nothing to stop global warming there is a deep sense of historical irony in the fact that the much advertised guarantee against a bolsonaro dictatorship the embrace of a possible third lula term by us imperialism comes as bolsonaro himself strikes a defiant tone towards the us government exposing the deteriorating us world standing and the international descent into national rivalries and war one of the main sources of opposition to bolsonaro within the ruling class and the one most stridently voiced by the pt has been that his one sided alignment with us foreign policy was contrary to brazil s business interests especially as this year the country became the largest recipient of chinese foreign investment another big business figure previously reviled by the pt pedro parente who was named by president temer to head the state run oil giant petrobras after rousseff s ouster declared in a september 20 event at the são paulo stock exchange that if the incoming government has a certain competence and especially with the expected improvement in china relations if lula wins there is an opportunity to reclaim attractiveness for foreign investments the transformation of latin america into a battleground for the increasingly bellicose us confrontations with russia and china only makes the pt s own backroom deals with washington all the more reckless and criminal the same reason for the pt s praising the expansion of economic ties with china and other countries the weakening of the us position especially in latin america also underpins washington s need to preserve ties with the brazilian military whatever its short term concerns about bolsonaro s recklessness as it demonstrated on september 7 at the same time the pt s subordination of its populist appeals to its quest for the backing of the imperialist powers makes it clear that whatever the result of the october 2 vote brazilian workers will face a government of unprecedented austerity and attacks on living standards all in the name of competitiveness and great power politics the organization of a counter offensive against the class war announced by both bolsonaro and the pt requires a socialist and internationalist strategy that perspective is only advanced by the international committee of the fourth international

on april 29 amid deteriorating relations between the united states and russia over the bombing of yugoslavia international monetary fund imf managing director michel camdessus and russia s first deputy prime minister yurii maslyukov announced a preliminary agreement to lend russia 4 5 billion over the next 18 months there are strong reasons to oppose the new bailout for russia the chances of these funds being repaid would be close to nil the credits would increase the imf s outstanding liabilities and do little to help the russia s ailing economy moreover the new credits to russia would politicize the imf the credits are being driven primarily by the clinton administration s desire to secure russia s cooperation in resolving the kosovo crisis and to prevent an economic collapse in russia before the parliamentary elections scheduled for december 1999 before receiving the loan russia s government would need to meet imf requirements to boost tax collections and overhaul the banking system and the state duma the lower house of russia s parliament would need to pass a new bankruptcy law in view of the current political turmoil there is little chance that these conditions will be met the communists the largest faction in the duma have already promised to oppose these measures no more credit although the imf executive board will not make its final decision on the loan until early june the united states should voice its opposition now to the new credits to russia russia currently owes the west almost 150 billion and it has repeatedly defaulted on its loans since devaluing the ruble in august 1998 the imf refused last december to release a tranche of its 4 3 billion loan to russia because the government had failed to put in place the required comprehensive market oriented reform package on april 21 1999 russia defaulted yet again this time on 1 3 billion in soviet era bonds russia claims it needs the new imf credits to pay at least a portion of the 17 5 billion in principal and interest due in 1999 on its previous loans u s and imf officials however now admit in private conversations that the new loan application is politicized some have depicted the loan as political payoff for russia s cooperation in finding a solution to the kosovo crisis but according to officials at the u s department of state the new loan may also be an attempt to prevent russia from destabilizing before the december 1999 elections to parliament and june 2000 election to the presidency the decision to extend new credits to russia for these political reasons is fundamentally wrong especially because the imf has always justified granting credits in economic not political terms house majority leader richard armey r tx and representative jim saxton r nj the vice chairman of the joint economic committee declared in march 1999 their opposition to new loans to russia and are asking for a full accounting of the tranche the imf released in august 1998 these concerns are justified new credits or massive bailouts by multilateral financial organizations alone cannot alleviate russia s situation or cure its problems to alleviate payment pressures russia is trying to get its 100 billion soviet era debt forgiven despite russia s bad credit history first deputy prime minister maslyukov was expected to ask the members of the group of seven g 7 industrialized countries meeting in germany in june to forgive 75 percent of the soviet era debt and to approve russia s application for new loans and the rescheduling of its massive debts ironically mr maslyukov the last chairman of gosplan the mammoth soviet central planning agency is largely responsible for the accumulation of these debts forgiving russia s debt or pouring more money into russia to cover its existing payments however would create what economists call a moral hazard well connected private investors who went after the early astronomic yields in russia s stock and bond markets would be bailed out and avoid staggering losses on their risky investments this then would encourage other investors to take risks they normally would avoid and it would force western taxpayers who earned nothing on the lucrative deals to pay the costs to cover russia s debt extending new loans or debt forgiveness are faulty lending practices that would reward russia for severe economic mismanagement and corruption in its financial bureaucracy according to russia s prosecutor general russia s central bank between 1990 and 1998 allegedly siphoned up to 50 billion including some imf funds into an offshore entity called the finance investment management company fimaco moreover it allowed insiders to take advantage of the exorbitant yields on the short term bond market which it controlled although u s secretary of the treasury robert rubin has expressed grave concerns about the fimaco affair he apparently backs the imf on its decision to extend the new credits it is imperative that u s and imf officials get to the bottom of the fimaco affair and that russia s central bank and treasury become more transparent and accountable to prevent another futile bailout to russia congress should request the clinton administration to direct the u s executive director of the imf to oppose unconditionally any additional assistance to russia including loans or debt

straight days with many of those seeing broad selling typical of so called washout days that can sometimes be a contrarian buy signal on wall street but many investment professionals are skeptical that the selling is over one reason is that earnings expectations for next year still show solid growth which would be unlikely in the event of a recession we know that if we start seeing a turnaround in the 2 year yields and if we start seeing a turnaround in the dollar that gives us the ability to bounce from these extremely oversold conditions said andrew smith chief investment strategist of delos capital advisors in dallas but i have a hard time reconciling in my mind that the earnings story is going to be as good as we expect additionally the dramatic moves in the bond and currency

the state of sterling has been the talk of the markets over the past few days as the uk s currency approached parity with the dollar the trigger event over the past week was the new uk administration s decision to go full on reaganomics by cutting taxes and relying on a grand supply side push to propel the stuttering uk economy forward as opposed to boosting demand which is the keynesian solution to dire economic situations the financial markets in their inimitable way responded brutally to the mini budget proposals of kwasi kwarteng the new uk finance minister to decrease taxes and hike borrowing nothing in gilt markets in the past 35 years not the uk s ejection from the exchange rate mechanism 9 11 the financial crisis brexit covid or any bank of england move compares with the price movements in reaction to the chancellor s mini budget writes economics commentator toby nangle in the financial times the commentariat has now gone completely bonkers former us treasury secretary larry summers verdict was that the uk is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market and you can see his point in many ways the uk is starting to develop the characteristics of emerging market economies the features of which will be all too familiar to south africans one of the characteristics of emerging market economies writes john cassidy in the new yorker is that investors tend to be more sceptical about public finances and demand additional compensation for holding their government s debt the uk s bond market responded in a characteristically emerging market way to kwarteng s announcement the yield on 10 year british bonds jumped from 3 46 to 4 28 the usual variation is two or three hundredths of a percentage point that is equivalent to the entire global market saying we just don t think your trickle down economics idea is going to work another characteristic feature of emerging markets economics is that currencies fall even when interest rates are increased technically an increase in interest rates ought to be supportive of the currency because it makes a country s debt more attractive which tempts investors last week the bank of england raised interest rates for the seventh time in a year but the pound continued to slide visit daily maverick s home page for more news analysis and investigations and there is more as nangle points out in typical developed economy economics a weaker currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive since 2007 the pound has lost a quarter of its value against the euro and almost half of its value against the dollar that has hurt uk imports but it hasn t improved exports on a commensurate scale the whole unravelling of the uk s economic position conjures a sweet image in my mind of kwarteng and sa s finance minister enoch godongwana sharing a late night tipple at the club complaining about those godawful running dog imperialist amorphous markets of course it s easy to get carried away here the uk is still the world s sixth largest economy the other difference is that kwarteng s proposals are night and day different to any budget ever proposed by the anc all of which hugely favour disastrous tax and spend policies if godongwana and kwarteng do ever share a wee dram my hope would be they would share more than fury at the indeterminacy of financial markets and kwarteng would convince his counterpart about the desirability of decreasing state overreach a little the other reason not to get too carried away is that all currencies including the euro and the rand are really getting thumped by the dollar in the risk off environment money managers tend to hold their now enlarged cash holdings in the currency least likely to decline and that s the world s reserve currency the dollar but the extent of sterling s decline is telling us something else janan ganesh also writing in the ft has an interesting theory that the uk particularly on the right has become overenamoured with us politics despite the fact that europe is concretely much more important to the uk s economy this is partly because of the distorting effect of language he says because the uk s governing class can follow us politics as easily as their own they get lost in it prime minister liz truss and her cohort of tories have none of that snide but ultimately healthy distance from the us take her vaunted supply side revolution like all armchair free marketeers she has never set up a business she believes her nation is a blast of deregulation away from american levels of entrepreneurial vim it isn t it s an intriguing theory but i think there is more at work here if you look at the actual position that the us economy was in at the time of reaganomics and the actual position that the uk economy is in now they are just not comparable in the us the state had become pretty overbearing when ronald reagan was elected president for example the top marginal tax bracket for personal income tax at the time was a sweltering 70 reagan brought it down to 50 the uk s top marginal rate is now 45 before kwarteng s proposed decrease to 40 the same as sa s it s hardly a global outlier it s arguable that what the markets are indicating is not so much a distaste for supply side flexibility but rather a belief that after 13 years of conservative party rule the main features of reaganomics tax decreases and deregulation are already largely baked into the cake the marginal gain from intensifying reaganomics already much debated as a tool will necessarily yield lower returns the markets are also responding to a sense that the new uk government is in that wonderful afrikaans description n bietjie kortbroek a little lacking in the experience department that will change in time but you can t go through five prime ministers in a decade without coming up a bit short in the meantime we in sa can savour just for a moment the week in which the uk joined us on the reserve bench of global economics dm bm

refinery work which could last several more days this has put a significant crimp in supplies and sent pump prices soaring in this region in addition the olympic pipeline in washington is due for maintenance perhaps as early as this week says marie dodds public affairs director for aaa oregon idaho hurricane ian also has the potential to cause problems depending on the storm s track by disrupting oil production refining and transportation in the gulf of mexico until this week the national and oregon averages had been declining for 14 consecutive weeks backing away from record highs set in mid june the national average reached its record high of 5 016 on june 14 while the oregon average reached its record high of 5 548 on june 15 lackluster demand for gas and lower crude oil prices should take some pressure off of rising pump prices but drivers can expect a very volatile couple of weeks due to the refinery issues as well as hurricane ian slamming the gulf coast adds dodds crude oil prices have tumbled from recent highs due to fears of economic slowdowns elsewhere around the globe crude reached a recent high of 122 11 per barrel on june 8 and ranged from about 94 to 110 per barrel in july in august crude prices ranged between about 86 and 97 in september crude prices have been between about 76 and 89 per barrel last week west texas intermediate fell below 80 per barrel for the first time since january crude prices rose dramatically leading up to and in the first few months of russia s invasion of ukraine russia is one of the world s top oil producers and its involvement in a war causes market volatility and sanctions imposed on russia by the u s and other western nations resulted in tighter global oil supplies oil supplies were already tight around the world as demand for oil increased as pandemic restrictions eased a year ago crude was around 75 per barrel compared to 77 today crude oil is the main ingredient in gasoline and diesel so pump prices are impacted by crude prices on the global markets on average about 53 of what we pay for in a gallon of gasoline is for the price of crude oil 12 is refining 21 distribution and marketing and 15 are taxes according to the u s energy information administration demand for gasoline in the u s decreased from 8 49 million b d to 8 32 million b d last week this is lower than last year at this time when demand was at 8 9 million b d total domestic gasoline stocks increased by 1 6 million bbl to 214 6 million bbl although gasoline demand has decreased tight supply and fluctuating oil prices have increased the national average price however if gas demand remains low pump price increases should be temporary quick stats oregon is one of 28 states with higher prices now than a week ago and 11 states including oregon have double digit increases oregon 50 cents has the largest weekly jump in the nation delaware 4 10ths of a cent has the smallest weekly increase rhode island 12 cents has the

only states with an average at or above 5 a gallon this week 11 states have averages at or above 4 and 39 states and the district of columbia have averages in the 3 range the cheapest gas in the nation is in mississippi 3 07 and texas 3 11 for the 90th week in a row no state has an average below 2 a gallon oregon is one of 11 states with higher prices now than a month ago the national average is 11 cents less and the oregon average is 36 cents more than a month ago oregon has the second largest monthly increase in the nation california 60 cents has the largest month over month jump connecticut 58 cents has the largest monthly drop all 50 states and the district of columbia have higher prices now than a year ago the national average is 56 cents more and the oregon average is 1 41 more than a year ago this is the second largest yearly increase in the nation california 1 49 has the biggest yearly increase connecticut 13 cents has the smallest year over year increase west coast the west coast region continues to have the most expensive pump prices in the nation with all seven states in the top 10 this is typical for the west coast as this region tends to consistently have fairly tight supplies consuming about as much gasoline as is produced in addition this region is located relatively far from parts of the country where oil drilling production and refining occurs so transportation costs are higher and environmental programs in this region add to the cost of production storage and distribution source aaa

many of those seeing broad selling typical of so called washout days that can sometimes be a contrarian buy signal on wall street but many investment professionals are skeptical that the selling is over one reason is that earnings expectations for next year still show solid growth which would be unlikely in the event of a recession we know that if we start seeing a turnaround in the 2 year

afp getty images fabrice coffrini afp getty images opponents also suspect that for all of its emphasis on improving animal welfare the initiative is really intended to curb animal husbandry gunter fischer ucg universal images group getty images by many measures located about 30 minutes southwest of zurich the chickens it raises for meat called broilers in agricultural parlance are housed in two spacious well kept barns one of those barns is outfitted with heated floors that keep the birds bedding dry and a state of the art filtering system that strips away the overpowering smell of ammonia that typically characterizes chicken farms leaving the air inside remarkably sweet and clean solar panels on the roof generate enough electricity to power the whole farm renewably stauffacher and his wife even host playgroups at the farm complete with a brightly decorated break room where children can watch the chickens through a window as they color and enjoy snacks and he will either have to build a lot more barns or reduce his flock size significantly in the next 25 years neither of these options he says is economically viable people don t understand how agriculture works anymore stauffacher said on one of the first chilly mornings this fall forty or fifty years ago almost everyone had someone in their family who farmed but that conduit is gone now so you get people saying oh poor animals but they still want to eat meat that conundrum is playing out on dinner plates across europe on the one hand a rising concern with animal welfare and an awareness of agriculture s environmental impact especially when it comes to climate change animal husbandry contributes 14 5 of greenhouse gas emissions has translated into a broad and growing movement to reduce meat consumption and improve the conditions under which livestock are raised at the same time stauffacher raises for which demand has actually risen as concerns with the environmental and health impacts of beef have grown have only increased the pressure on agriculture to prioritize efficiency and keep prices accessible the swiss campaign dovetails with and will perhaps provide ballast for animal rights efforts elsewhere in the west a citizens petition for a similar measure led by the organization compassionate world farming garnered the necessary 1 million signatures from across the 27 member states to trigger a proposal from the european commission ec next year in fact notes alice di concetto founder of the european institute for animal law and policy the european commission is taking the opportunity of the cage proposal to revise all eu farm animal welfare legislation so there are other measures that hopefully will be included like chick grinding a common egg farm method for killing male chicks soon after they hatch andthat it is switzerland taking the lead in attempting to resolve the tension by eradicating intensive farming is either ironic or unsurprising depending on how you look at it many of which were introduced through the direct democracy tool of popular initiatives its long history of animal protection laws dates as far back as 1893 when a popular initiative made it illegal to slaughter animals without first anesthetizing them in 1978 the country passed the animal welfare act which prohibits inflicting pain on animals without justification it has banned boiling lobsters alive decreed that social animals like guinea pigs must be kept in pairs and in 1996 became the first country in the world to outlaw battery cages for laying hens currently 10 states in the u s have done the same denmark announced its own plan just this week and while a handful of other nations have enshrined the notion of animal dignity in their laws only switzerland protects it at the constitutional level but none of that supporters say means there isn t more to be done over the past two decades swiss farms have on average grown in size and some aspects of the welfare law have either been watered down or left unenforced it s true that we don t have a lot of big farms in switzerland says legislator martina munz whose social democratic party favors the ban but we have a lot of things we can do better when it comes to animal welfare it s not just the number of animals in the group it s also about how they re kept it s about slaughtering and transportation farmer kurt brunner practices the kind of animal husbandry that the proposal s organizers would like to see from his mixed purpose farm located about 40 kilometers west of zurich brunner and his colleagues not only make cheese from the milk of their 20 cows raise 8 sheep and sell eggs from their 300 chickens but also grow the grain that feeds their livestock brunner supports the initiative because he has seen what the growing consolidation of farms and the commodification of their products has meant for farmers and the animals they raise the bigger farms in switzerland are not so sustainable he says neither environmentally nor economically they have no guarantee of good prices because the big dealers like migros and coop look for cheapest products and there is also the problem of animal welfare i don t think that all of my farmer colleagues are happy with their ways of production but if the price is so low one possibility is just to make more the proposed amendment which allows for a 25 year transition period requires farms to ensure that livestock have free access to the outdoors and species appropriate housing and that the entire slaughter process including transport is humane it also mandates less dense farms calling for the adoption of the same guidelines employed by the organization that regulates organic certification in switzerland bio suisse those standards limit the number of pigs in any pen or barn to 1000 and the number of laying hens to 2 000 so to us it seems like a no brainer but obviously our opponents see it differently they do indeed the we already produce on a high level and they want to put another load of laws on our shoulders argues martin haab of the farmers he represents as president of the zurich farmers union haab is also a legislator and a dairy farmer himself but consumers are not ready to pay a lot more for their food so it s kind of nuts to say we have to have a higher level of animal welfare nevertheless still makes switzerland the third largest consumer in europe the proposal includes a provision that requires any imported animal products to meet the same standards as domestic ones but critics argue the in a written statement to time patrick stöpper spokesperson for switzerland s largest supermarket chain migros said that if swiss farmers don t remain competitive consumers will increasingly cover their needs with animal products from abroad where the level of animal welfare is sometimes much lower than in switzerland not exactly says sentience politics ryf he points out that although some members of the initiative coalition are indeed opposed to eating meat others like the small farmers association depend on producing it for their livelihoods but he agrees that one of the questions that s very heavily debated is whether we will have the same output after and just need a lot more farms more slaughterhouses more everything or whether it will necessitate shifting consumption patterns he says which we actually would be in favor of the latest polls and recent history suggest that the initiative faces an uphill climb earlier in the year but even if it doesn t pass ryf says he says people who have never heard about the conditions in swiss farms are now thinking about them all the politicians have heard the specifics all the journalists and they probably will keep on talking about it so this for us is already success at the heart of all this debate lie shifting perspectives on the relationship between humans and the animals they eat a debate shaped by technology climate change and evolving ethics for all of the care and innovation evident at ueli stauffacher s farm for example it s also plain to see why some might be troubled by the efficiencies built into his style of raising animals for meat stauffacher s 18 000 chickens are all sold directly to the supermarket chain migros which supplies the farm with day old chicks to raise and collects the grown chickens 36 days later when they are taken to slaughter although they have access to an outdoor pen during the final 15 days of their lives it is covered for their protection which means the birds spend their five weeks on earth without ever seeing open sky perhaps nowhere were those changing perspectives clearer than on legislator haab s own farm located in mettmenstetten not far from ulie stauffacher s poultry operation it is home to the animals spend the summer on pasture in the hills about 10 kilometers away but in winter they return to a barn and paddock where they are milked by a robot that after cleaning the cow s underside with tiny versions of the roller brushes used at car washes locates the cows teats attaches itself to the udder and begins sucking in many ways haab s farm embodies the dilemma that farmers and the people they feed face as they attempt to navigate the tricky waters between welfare and efficiency between the public s unease with treating animals as essentially food producing widgets and its appetite for meat and cheese on the one hand it s hard to get more industrialized than a robot but according to haab if technology has made things easier it hasn t changed how much they care about their animals haab still knows the names of all his cows even if keeping track of when cranberry was last milked now entails nothing more than opening the app on his phone to look at the latest data sent by the automated system because the machine disinfects her teats before it begins milking she and the milk itself are at lower risk for pathogens andrather than having to adjust to the farmer s schedule a measure that can make the cows more comfortable it s not up to me anymore they get to decide for themselves he says with a grin now that s animal welfare
by david stockman from contracorner the messages are coming in loud and clear today from the crashing pound to repudiation of establishment governments in italy sweden and more to come to hungarian prime minister orban s call to end the sanctions war and do so pronto so let s be clear washington s dunderheaded intervention in the intramural spat between russia and ukraine and the accompanying global sanctions war is the surely the stupidest most destructive project to arise from the banks of the potomac in modern times and the architects of this perfidious folly biden blinkin sullivan nuland et al cannot be condemned harshly enough after all this madness is being pursued in the name of abstract policy norms the rule of law and sanctity of borders that make washington a laughing stock more than any other nation on planet earth and by a long shot it has serially and blatantly violated these standards scores of times in recent decades among other actions washington s interventions in serbia iraq afghanistan libya yemen syria somalia etc were not only pointless they were also a self evident violation of the very rule of law and sanctity of borders upon which washington now beats its breasts ever more stridently moreover by wallowing in this unhinged hypocrisy washington has abandoned every semblance of commonsense as to why this conflict happened in the first place and why it is wholly irrelevant to the national security of the american homeland or for that matter europe as well the fundamental fact is aside from the historically short interval of iron fisted communist rule during the soviet era ukraine had never been a nation state within its post 1991 happenstance borders in fact for upwards of 275 years before 1918 much of its territories were borderlands vassals and outright provinces of czarist russia and before that constituents of the polish lithuanian empire and others so we are not dealing with the invasion of a long established ethnically and linguistically coherent state by its aggressive neighbor but with the left over potpourri of separate tongues territories economies and histories that were smashed together by brutal communist rulers between 1918 and 1991 accordingly the fast approaching dark cold winter of stagflationary collapse in europe is not being done in heroic defense of the grand principles proffered by washington and nato to the contrary it amounts to the pointless and grubby business of preserving a vile status quo ante that was confected on the lands north of the black sea not by the ordinary course of historical evolution and nation state accretion but by the bloody hands of lenin stalin and khrushchev in any event the staggering economic costs for the everyday peoples of europe in pursuit of such a threadbare and illegitimate purpose is starting to register among the long suffering victims of brussels elitist rulers hence the thunderbolts from the italian elections this weekend and viktor orbán s parallel appeal to the european union to lift sanctions and thereby potentially reduce energy prices by half in one swell swoop nor is orbán the only one calling for an end to sanctions with greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotaki calling for a repeal of russian sanctions as well other political leaders such as matteo salvini who leads the conservative league party and will be a major force in italy s new government says that europe needs a rethink on russian sanctions due to the harmful economic effects likewise the conservative alternative for germany afd party has also been pushing for an end to sanctions and an re opening of the nord stream 1 2 gas pipelines due to soaring energy costs in germany afd member of the bundestag mariana harder kühnel for instance recently echoed orbán s call the eu bureaucracy has turned the screw on the sanctions and now we are paying the bill she said in this context the ructions since friday in the fx market for the pound sterling speak more powerfully than anything else the british pound briefly plunged to its lowest level ever early this am touching 1 0349 during asian trading hours breaking through its previous record low of 1985 moreover today s cliff dive followed a tumble of 3 on friday after the new truss government announced sweeping tax cuts and a massive energy bailout for businesses and individuals likewise the price of u k government debt has fallen in tandem with the pound with yields rising sharply again today the 10 year government bond was yielding 4 11 up 28 basis points from friday and a staggering 342 from the 0 93 yield of just one year ago for want of doubt here is the path of pound sterling over the last twelve months that s a massive thumbs down by the fx markets if there ever was one but the relevant point here is not all the keynesian palaver about the mistake of lowering the 45 top income tax rate and removing other disincentives to work and investment that take uk marginal rates as high as 60 these reductions in the crushing tax rates that conservative and labor government alike have erected atop the uk s lavish welfare state are long overdue and will in fact stimulate compensatory economic activity what s actually going to destroy the remnants of the uk s fiscal sustainability is truss utterly foolish plan to freeze all energy prices for all citizens and businesses at a cost of upwards of 200 billion per year or 5 of gdp but that s neocon insanity run amok if london wants to relieve its consumers of onerous energy prices and utility bills it only need follow orban s advice and terminate its sanctions war against russian energy food and other commodity exports and it wouldn t cost the exchequer a dime that is to say the pound s crash ought to be a general wake up call to europe and washington too by declaring war on the productive and peaceful commerce with russia that previously prevailed europe s leaders especially the new government of united kingdom have sacrificed their own prosperity and the living standards of their citizens in behalf of a prodigiously corrupt anti democratic regime in kiev that is dedicated to preserving intact nothing more noble than the dead hand of the soviet presidium or as our friend james howard kunstler rightly summarized let us agree that the place called ukraine was never any of america s business for centuries we ignored it through all the colorful cavalry charges to and fro of turks and tatars the reign of the dashing zaporozhian cossacks the cruel abuses of stalin then hitler and the dull gray khrushchev to yeltsin years but then having destroyed iraq afghanistan libya somalia and sundry other places all on a great hegemonic lark the professional warmongers of our land and their catamites in washington made ukraine their next special project they engineered the 2014 coup in kiev that ousted the elected president mr yanyukovich to set up a giant grifting parlor and international money laundromat the other strategic aim was to prepare ukraine for nato membership which would have made it in effect a forward missile base right up against russia s border because well russia russia russia so we return to the question at hand every ukrainian presidential election since 1991 has revealed a nation radically split between pro russian populations in the east and south and anti russian nationalists in the center and west when the mailed fist of communist rule was removed in fact ukraine became a territory yearning to be partitioned into more amenable jurisdictions of governance we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us for instance here is the results of the 2010 election that put a pro russian politician in the president s office and at length gave rise to washington s putsch during the maiden uprising that soon drove the country into civil war the above map barely does justice to the actual figures in many of the yellow tymoshenko supporting areas the vote was 80 or higher in favor of the latter s nationalist candidacy while in much of the blue area the pro russian yanukovych won be similar massive pluralities yet this wasn t a one time fluke of short term electoral politics it was actually the recrudescence of the manner in which the fake nation of ukraine was put together during the last three centuries prior to the end of wwi there was no ukrainian state like the artificial and unsustainable polities of czechoslovakia and yugoslavia which were confected by self serving politicians at versailles especially the domestic vote seeking woodrow wilson ukraine was a product of geopolitical engineering in this case by the new rulers of the soviet union indeed the historical provenance of ukraine can be described in a nutshell what was to become ukraine joined russia in 1654 when bohdan khmelnitsky a hetman of the zaporozhian host petitioned russian czar alexey to accept the zaporozhian host into russia that is to say imperial russia spawned the latter day polity of ukraine by annexing into its service the fearsome cossack warriors who inhabited its central region the army and a small territory then under hetman control was called u kraine which means in russian at the edge a term that had originated in the twelfth century to describe lands on the border of russia during the next 250 years the expansionist czars annexed more and more of the adjacent territory designating the eastern and southern regions as novorussiya new russia which territories included catherine the great s purchase of crimea from the ottomans in 1783 that is to say at the time of america s own independence the heart of today s ukraine was ruled by the long arm of czarist autocracy after the bolshevik revolution of course the map changed radically in 1919 lenin created the socialist state of ukraine on part of the territory of the former russian empire ukraine officially became the ukrainian people s republic with the capital of kharkov in 1922 moved to kiev in 1934 accordingly the new communist state swallowed up novorussiya per the eastern and southern portions of the green area in the map below including donetsk and lugansk regions as well as the kherson and zaporizhzhia regions bordering the sea of azov and the black sea that are the sites of today s russia sponsored succession referendums then in 1939 as a result of the infamous nazi soviet pact stalin annexed the eastern territories of poland as designated by the yellow areas of the map thus the historic territory of galicia and the polish city of lvov were incorporated into ukraine by the joint decree of stalin and hitler in june of 1940 stalin next annexed northern bukovina brown area from romania and then at the yalta conference in 1945 upon stalin s insistence to churchill and roosevelt the hungarian carpathian ruthenia was incorporated into the soviet union and added to ukraine taken together these stalinist seizures are now known as western ukraine the people s of which understandably do not cotton to things russian at the same time the 85 russian speaking population inhabiting the purple area crimea was gifted to ukraine by khrushchev in 1954 for the very reason of extending his own accession to the communist dictatorship nevertheless after the disintegration of the soviet union ukraine inherited these communist confected borders within which there were upwards of 40 millions russians poles hungarians romanians tartars and countless lesser nationalities all trapped in a newly declared country in which they didn t especially wish to reside indeed the reason that the hapless state of ukraine needs relief in partition not a war to preserve the handiwork if czars and commissars was well summarized by alexander g markovsky in the american thinker today s ukrainian civil war is thus greatly exacerbated by the fact that unlike pluralistic societies such as the usa canada switzerland and russia which are tolerant of different cultures religions and languages ukraine is not unsurprisingly devotion to pluralism proved not to be her forte even though the kiev regime had no historical roots in the real estate it inhabited it imposed ukrainian rules and the ukrainian language on non ukrainian people after declaring independence as a result pro russian sentiments ranging from the recognition of the official status of the russian language to outright secession have always been prevalent in crimea and eastern ukraine western ukraine has always gravitated toward its polish romanian and hungarian roots emphatically anti russian poland may not miss this strategic opportunity to re acquire its land and avenge the humiliation inflicted by the yalta conference the west s insistence on maintaining the status quo of the ukrainian borders established by lenin stalin and hitler exposes the disconnect between strategic doctrine and moral principles indeed poles make no secret of their ambitions polish president andrzej duda recently declared for decades and maybe god forbid for centuries there will be no more borders between our countries poland and ukraine there will be no such border romania is not far behind especially in light of many inhabitants of former northern bukovina already carrying romanian passports the territory of ukraine is a mosaic of other people s lands if we want to stop this insane war and ensure peace in europe instead of calling russia s sponsored referendum in eastern ukraine a sham we should conduct an honest referendum in all the disputed territories under the auspices of the un and let the people decide what government they want needless to say partition of the fake state of

omaha a mining company that wants to extract an assortment of rare elements from southeast nebraska has announced an agreement that will provide up to 285 million to help cover the roughly 1 1 billion cost of building the mine in addition to the acquisition of a special purpose acquisition company called gx acquisition corp ii that niocorp announced monday the centennial colorado company also signed letters of intent to borrow up to 81 million more from yorkville advisors global so niocorp could get as much as 366 million to finance the project niocorp ceo mark smith said these transactions have the potential to put niocorp on the fast track to obtain the required project financing the main element niocorp plans to produce at the mine about 80 miles south of omaha near the town of elk creek is a heat resistant element called niobium along with scandium and titanium the company has said analysis of samples from the site shows there is also a significant amount of rare earth elements there like the ones president joe biden wants to produce more of domestically but it s not yet sure whether it will be economically feasible to also produce some of those elements that are used to create the strong magnets used in a variety of high tech products such as electric vehicles and cell phones biden has said the united states needs to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers of critical minerals china is the world s biggest supplier of rare earth elements dean c kehler co chairman and ceo of gxii said niocorp should be able to help with biden s goal if it can raise the rest of the money it needs to begin mining niobium scandium and possibly rare earth elements we believe niocorp is well positioned to be a reliable u s based supplier that will produce these products on a sustainable basis kehler said it won t be clear exactly how much money the transaction will give niocorp until closer to when the deal is expected to close early next year because some investors could pull their money out of the gxii fund before closing gxii is one of the risky shell companies known as spacs that became popular on wall street in recent years before many of them fell out of favor and had to be liquidated without ever completing a transaction a spac is essentially a blank check company created solely to merge with another business to invest in it while spacs are often used to help companies go public niocorp is already a publicly traded company but this deal is expected to give it a listing on the nasdaq which would help it attract more investors niocorp has been actively exploring the nebraska site for more than seven years and since 2013 it has raised more than 80 million to pay for its efforts the proposed mine is expected to create more than 400 jobs if it is ever built the u s imports all the niobium and scandium and most of the titanium and rare earths that niocorp hopes to mine there is only one american mine that produces rare earths now at a site in california niocorp says its deposit of rare earth elements is second only to that mountain pass mine that mp materials runs in california top journal star photos for september

global stock markets are tanking on fears of recessions in the us the uk and europe and the oecd is actually forecasting recessions in europe so is recession now inevitable in australia not at all the good news is there are several reasons to think australia might be able to escape a global slide into recession though it will need careful management what could push australia into recession here s the worst case scenario the united states keeps pushing up interest rates until it brings on a recession and australia gets pressured to do the same here s how it s playing out at the moment the us federal reserve has lifted rates at each of its past five meetings the past three hikes have been massive by australian and us standards 0 75 percentage points each enough to slow already forecast us economic growth to a trickle which is what the fed wants to fight inflation but the fed is planning to go further its chair jerome powell says he expects ongoing increases and last week countenanced the possibility they would throw the country into recession we don t know no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be that s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down whether expectations remain anchored and whether also we get more labour supply powell is saying he is prepared to risk a recession to get inflation down view image in fullscreen chair of the us federal reserve jerome powell photograph jim lo scalzo epa the uk s top banker already expects a recession powell s not alone his uk equivalent bank of england governor andrew bailey has lifted rates seven times since december bailey says he is prepared to do more to fight inflation forcefully as necessary and is actually forecasting a recession which he says has probably started so alarmed is the new uk government headed by liz truss that on friday it unveiled a 45bn a 75bn growth plan made up of tax cuts and infrastructure spending on top of spending of 60bn a 100bn to cap household and business energy bills given what s now happening overseas you might expect australia s reserve bank to take note and behave differently to central banks overseas except that it s not that quite easy view image in fullscreen shoppers pass a graffitied cash machine in oxford street in london photograph kirsty wigglesworth ap pressure to follow the us whenever the us hikes interest rates it s hiked them seven times since march investors buy us dollars to take advantage of the higher rates this forces up the price of the us dollar in relation to currencies of countries that didn t hike this means unless countries such as australia hike in line with the us the values of their currencies are likely to fall in relation to the us dollar meaning their values are likely to fall in relation to the currency in which most trade takes place this means more expensive imports which means more inflation and australia s reserve bank is trying to contain inflation the upshot is whenever the us pushes up rates no matter how recklessly there s pressure on australia to do the same simply to stop inflation getting worse the risk of a gratuitously severe recession since march when the us began pushing up interest rates more aggressively than australia the value of the australian dollar has slid from us0 73 to less than us0 65 putting upward pressure on goods traded in us dollars of about 11 with australian inflation already forecast to hit 7 75 this year way above the reserve bank s 2 3 target still more inflation is what the bank doesn t want it s often said that central banks hunt in packs what s less often noted is the pressure they are under to follow each other this locks countries such as britain whose currency has fallen to an all time low against the us in the wake of the tax cuts and japan whose government has intervened to try to stop its currency falling into a semi dependent relationship with the us failing to follow its lead makes inflation worse it is why us economist paul krugman says there is serious risk the fed s actions will push america and the world into a gratuitously severe recession going your own way can hurt your dollar the risk isn t merely that the us will go too far the risk is that other countries including ours will ape the us in pushing up rates to maintain the value of their currencies amplifying the effect of a us recession and making it global it s often said that central banks hunt in packs what s less often noted is the pressure they are under to follow each other in australia amp chief economist shane oliver puts it starkly if the reserve bank doesn t follow the us fed the australian dollar might crash but here s the good news we know australia can avoid the worst of global economic downturns because we ve done it before view image in fullscreen the reserve bank of australia is trying to contain inflation photograph rick rycroft ap how australia has avoided past recessions and can again australia avoided recession during the 1997 asian financial crisis we escaped the 2001 us tech wreck and we avoided the great recession during the global financial crisis in part this has been due to excellent judgment our reserve bank was able to take clear eyed decisions about when to follow the us on rates and when not to at times it was helped by high commodity prices which are high again following russia s invasion of ukraine and which are supporting our currency even though we are increasing rates less aggressively than the us at the right moment australia s reserve bank would be wise to decouple from the us if the fed pushes up rates to the point where it is about to bring on a us recession australia would be well advised to stand back and not lift rates letting the collapse of the us economy bring down inflation by itself if australia s reserve bank thinks that moment is approaching it should consider shrinking the size of its rate rises the last four have been 0 5 percentage points its next meeting is next tuesday because of its importance the bureau of statistics is bringing forward the publication of its new monthly measure of inflation to this thursday publishing the results for both july and august at once but the bank will need more than information it ll need the intuition and common sense that has kept us out of trouble in the past

anyone hoping the current stock market sell off will end soon should be warned that this volatility with a downside inclination could be here for a couple of months it could be more but i m gambling we will see some better trends in october or november but this is my best risky guess my best sound guess is that in 12 months time you could be unhappy with yourself if you went too defensive now if you did that believing you could buy back into stocks once the scary stuff has gone you could find that you would have made a mistake timing the market is great if you re good at it but few people are and research work by bank of america confirms this claim cnbc recently covered the boa s work and revealed that looking at data going back to 1930 the firm found that if an investor sat out the s p 500 s 10 best days per decade total returns would be significantly lower than the return for investors who waited it out in fact if an investor missed the s p 500 s 10 best days each decade the total return would stand at 28 if on the other hand the investor held steady through the ups and downs the return would have been 17 715 the table below shows what happens if you re good or bad at guessing the best 10 or worst 10 days for the us stock market the afr recently let duncan burns from vanguard look at the topic and this is what he came up with the australian share market has delivered an average return of about 10 over long periods of time that 10 return only measures what buy and hold investors would have earned by putting money in at the start of the period and keeping it fully invested through good times and bad vanguard analysis of australian investor behaviour between 2004 and 2013 before and after the height of the global financial crisis found that investors chasing returns were actually worse off than their buy and hold counterparts the average market timing investor was at least 0 5 a year worse off before transaction costs were factored in whereas a straightforward buy and hold approach would have improved an investor s returns by at least 0 5 every year burns looked at why we try to guess the market and largely get it wrong psychologists have identified a human tendency for investors to think they have control over events even when they have none he revealed when applied to investing this perception can lead many to see imaginary patterns in stock price charts or spot trends when none exist but as historical data shows while the long term trajectory of the sharemarket is upwards shorter term price changes are more random at times like these i like to show clients this chart of the all ords between 1970 and 2009 one year after the market crashed 50 because of the gfc this shows 10 000 invested in 1970 in a portfolio similar to the all ords with dividends reinvested saw it roll over into 453 542 just look at the blue line for the aussie stock market over that time and see those deep blue v shaped movements which were crashes in 1974 1987 the dotcom crash of 2000 and the gfc at those times people worried like you might be and those who sold out at the bottom missed out on the big rebounds that followed provided you are invested in a good portfolio your capital return over time and grow like that blue line at a rough rate of 10 per annum over a decade you just have to keep the faith and be patient if you don t think you re a genius market timer
