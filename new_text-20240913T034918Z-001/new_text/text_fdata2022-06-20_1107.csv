investors to buy right now and walmart wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of 2 14 21 this video was recorded on june 01 2022 david gardner i never say never for just about anything but i m as close as can be to never on some things one of them is that i never think i m going to enter the government or run for public office first i m not particularly interested in it pretty sure my brother tom and i both believe that we can affect far more positive change in this world through the vehicle of our company the motley fool through the platform of hundreds of fools every day working inside our building we re back to work for the first time in fool hq this week and outside our building where many of us continue to work then all of us i mean you too of course all of our members we can make the world together smarter happier and richer there s no political office needed there s no campaigning no special interests no packs no negative ads i got so many negative ads and no sloganeering either this is particularly good for me because one of the things i m the worst at is just saying the same thing the same soundbite over and over i just can t do it i take far more joy in coming up with something new for you right here every week on this podcast than if i were just saying the same thing over and over but if i were good at that well that seems to be what politics are often about you need to stay on message you say the same thing over and over and that gets you the votes but that s the opposite of my own inclinations and joy to a fault i think i need to keep coming up with new tricks for you every week on this podcast to a fault i d say because if you re always playing a new instrument or a new tune from one week to the next you might make the mistake of forgetting to repeat some of the important truths the timeless ones the essentials from time to time i like to hail back to the past and remake some cardinal points that i ve made before so they are not lost especially for my newer listeners i would be a fool small f if i assumed you knew that critical lesson i taught on this podcast back in 2016 or one of my favourite stories from 2020 even about once a year i do this series it s called blast from the past it features five points that i want to make sure you hear again or hear for the first time is it june already great it s time for blast from the past volume 6 only on this week s rule breaker investing welcome back to rule breaker investing you know as i did the cold open as i spoke to you at the top i was conscious that i actually did something similar to this a few weeks ago because what have you learned from david gardner volume 3 is your annual birthday gift to me thank you again i ll stop thanking you for it it can get annoying to over thank but i realized that part of what i make of that episode every year is an opportunity to revisit most of the really important stuff that comes out through rule breaker investing in a way you can think of blast from the past as an opportunity to revisit what i think of as meaningful i hope compelling i hope rewarding stories frameworks and points don t make it into what have you learned for me they don t necessarily always make the best hits greatest of the most important points but the reason we blast back from the past and this is the sixth time in the seventh year of this podcast is because these are important i hope compelling points but maybe in internet terms they re below the fold maybe you d have to scroll down to really find these that really scrolling down is a pretty good analogy for what we re doing with blast from the past volume 6 i will be presenting this week five bits from the past in most cases restated not just giving you what i did before but specifically calling out those episodes from the past which i do believe i hope are worthy of some time and attention if you have a little extra beach time this week or later this summer instead of reading which is traditionally what people do at the beach maybe it s time to listen to some extra podcast if so i hope all scale up one or two good ideas for you looking through the past this week on the show here s the game we re playing for each of these i m revisiting a point made in the past podcast most of these are five six and sometimes seven years old i m pretty sure you won t remember these unless you re a very long time very faithful listener i know some of you are out there thank you but for most of the rest of us this is all going to be new but i intended to be helpful and just as relevant i hope here in 2022 as it was back in here s the first one july 20th 2016 let s get started blast from the past got five points for the past year comes point number 1 this one goes back to july 20th of 2016 the rule breaker investing podcast that week was entitled pet peeves volume 1 i ve been storing up presumably for 50 years since i was born in 1966 it wasn t until the summer of 2016 that i got to air out my pet peeves on this podcast for the first time you can imagine i was loading some up and i m going to share with you one of them now but in order to entice you maybe to go back and relisten to pet peeves volume 1 let me mention elsewhere on that podcast i spoke to state lotteries which will always be a pet peeve for me another one was that button that you are forced to click that says you ve read someone s disclaimer you know that online button that a lot of us have to click to get past stuff to what we re really trying to do yeah that s a pet peeve and one other i remember is that ticker symbol that s listed incorrectly more frequently than any other ticker symbol i hope i m enticing you to go back and listen to pet peeves volume 1 but there was pet peeve number 2 i hope you share this pet peeve this is a big one for me it s littering how can any person today whether you re driving down the street or on a truck somewhere just walking through a parker sometimes people presumably do it on their own front lawn how can you just drop the cup or flip the cigarette away or toss the straw we end up driving down that highway and seeing over on the shoulder litter it doesn t look good there and it looks even worse in green settings and family settings i hope you feel this too i know the teddy roosevelt in all of us the national park loving people that we are i know you don t like littering i really don t like littering i think that there is no real excuse for it in almost any context that i can think of i don t actually care what your own personal background is or how easy or tough life has been for you where you come from or what your culture is i don t think there s any excuse for just dropping something and making someone else pick it up the phrase litterbug i remember growing up in the 1970s my formative years i don t see that phrase around quite as much anymore but i do see some powerful statements against littering in fact a lot of us who are outside the state of texas might not know this but if you ve ever seen that bumper sticker don t mess with texas maybe you ve seen it on the back of a truck or on someone s t shirt you might have thought that s just some tough guy talk from somebody who is presumably a texan but the truth is that was started by a very talented ad agency run by a fellow fool named roy spence it was all about encouraging texans not to litter in their home state don t mess with texas i love that sentiment and whenever i see that bumper sticker it makes me smile by the way speaking of blast from the past roy join me on this podcast on november 1st of 2017 and i will tell you that is 48 minutes of greatness that you should take the time to listen to if you haven t rate is not for me of course but just because of roy who i think is a truly great entrepreneur and human being one of the best storytellers i know back to littering one of my proudest but most ridiculous moments was when i was in my car behind another car at a light somewhere in greater washington dc and the person a young man had lowered his window and just dropped his cigarette right there while we were waiting at the light i knew it was a longer light and i was having a little bit of fun with this so i literally opened my door from the driver s side got out walked up bend over right next to him at his window picked up his cigarette which was still smoking and without even looking at him simply walked back to my car with it i hope that doesn t sound self righteous i m definitely not suggesting i do that all the time but the reason i m telling it as an anecdote is that i did it once just to see what it felt like but i like to think that that guy still remembers that moment and maybe that in a small way that changed the future destiny of our world littering big pet peeve blast from the past number 1 blast from the past number 2 this one it s one of my favorite author interviews every august for the last several years we ve done authors in august on this podcast and once again i m rubbing my hands together getting ready for authors in august 2022 edition i still need to decide my books and i hope the authors will say yes and join me but in 2018 it was august 8th when priya parker the author of the art of gathering said yes to this podcast i still regularly think back fondly not just to that book which i highly recommend to all my fellow humans the art of gathering by priya parker but of course i think back fondly to that podcast and i even did a weekend extra with additional spillover comments from priya that s how passionate i was and m about her work which is focused on gathering now i think she defines a gathering as anytime three or more humans are gathered together for a particular purpose that counts as a gathering that means the wedding that you ll be attending later this summer the funeral that you may have attended last month the corporate offsite that are these happening again that s going to happen for your company in 2022 or really any dinner party or picnic all of these are gatherings and priya with passion and intelligence say we can do these better now as fellow human beings we know that none of us is perfect but it doesn t mean we can t do it a little bit better each time that we gather what i think is really delightful about priya s book is each of the chapters in her book is a sentence or a directive and it gets across to you this is probably perfect for being on oprah it gets across you just with the chapter title where she is headed and what she is thinking about i m going to share with you the one that i remember best but before i do it let me just mention a few others chapter 1 of the art of gathering is to decide why you re really gathering i think that s such a great reminder and a wonderful way to start off the book because it s a reminder to really think deeply and carefully about the purpose of why you are having that corporate offsite or why you are having that supper party deciding why you re really gathering is the first step to having a better gathering another one chapter 2 of the book in fact is called closed doors which sounds a very counter cultural tone i would say inclusivity is a big trend these days capitalize inclusivity and lots of ways is what the world is about in recognizing the importance of that but at least in chapter 2 of her book she reminds us the power of exclusivity closed doors is there to remind you that if you exclude a certain person or type of person that could be what saves your gathering a quick example comes to mind for me one of the better ways to pass down money from one generation to the next is to ensure that the generation that will be receiving the money has been included in the plan you shouldn t be surprising people when you spring upon them at your own death whatever you ve saved it would be a much better idea most of the time i think to have talked it out and everybody has some clarity and understanding now one of the best ways you can get to understanding and get that next generation bought into your vision is to ensure that they have a chance to weigh in and talk and if you have a wills and estates person or some family office help to ensure that they have an opportunity without you there to talk with each other or talk with the estate professionals and be able to provide their point of view i think too often such gatherings can be dominated by the patriarch or matriarch their will and their plans end up taking up most of the time but a really effective gathering that will ultimately create a better outcome for all is if if you re the patriarch you exclude yourself intentionally from a gathering of your next generation there s one example maybe not have been the best example i can think of the importance of closing doors anyway in that podcast and in her book you can see other examples of how important it is sometimes to exclude i think we can all think of somebody who might talk too much or too long at supper parties and how that could really diminish the party if somebody is just dominating the conversation so for that particular part of you might want to exclude that person closed doors but the blast from the past i really wanted to talk a little bit about is her chapter never start a funeral with logistics again a very evocative chapter title and it s a reminder of the importance of big moments now i haven t been to too many funerals i think the first one i ever went to was the suicide of a friend in my teens i m sorry to say but for the most part at the age of 56 most of the people i know especially my peers are still alive i hope yours are too most of my loved ones are still alive we ve all been presumably to some funerals if were over the age of 21 but i haven t done it enough to really be experienced at it yet priya s advice to us to never start a funeral with logistics is a reminder of the importance of big moments in that podcast and in that chapter she talks about the mistake that many will make have you ever been to an important moment let s say a funeral or a wedding and it starts something like this well thank you all for being here ow before we get started i do want to mention that on the second floor of the parking garage if you re license plate is dmms 2147 indiana plate your lights are on while that is important information maybe the one person in the room it s really not the way to start something important priya points out both at the very start of a gathering and at the very end of a gathering you have generally rapt attention right at the start what you say or to what happens right at the start of something funeral wedding birthday party corporate offsite supper party what happens right at the start the first thing you say or do makes a huge impression on everybody never start a funeral with logistics others have spoken to the importance of what do we really remember as humans we tend to remember the start of things the end of things and maybe a peak moment somewhere in between well all of those things are timelessly true to human psychology even though the chapter is extensively about funerals it s about the importance at the start of any gathering of really nailing it there you go august 8th 2018 priya parker the art of gathering i hope maybe we ve just helped improve your next gathering on the blast from the past number 3 the podcast was entitled lessons from a great business it was on august 10th 2016 that was before we had authors in august before i dreamed up the idea so six augusts ago and the focus of lessons from a great business was specifically and is specifically on starbucks squarely so a business that i love to talk about because i think so many of us have some association or experience with starbucks if not on a daily or weekly basis at least on a sometimes basis and speaking of gatherings starbucks is about the only big coffee brand that i think is as much about gathering as it is about coffee within that podcast well i got to talk about what are my favourite leaders howard schultz the ceo in a sense the founder the spiritual founder anyway of starbucks i think i talked a little bit about how my favourite leaders are not political leaders they ve always been business leaders because i think the business leaders have to create value for all whereas too often especially these days i feel as if political leaders are pitting half of us against the other half in a way that at its best is on attractive to me and it is worst can be self destructive but business leaders howard schultz being one will always be a passion of mine i also on that podcast lessons from a great business got to talk about what happened when my brother tom and i were on abc tvs the view which is probably one of my 10 favorite motley fool stories of all time i m not going to retell it here but it is there for you on the podcast if you want to rehear the story of tom and me on the view but one of the points that i make in lessons from a great business is about initial public offerings and that s what i m going to share with you this week i call it my great wolf story but before i get there let me back up a little bit initial public offerings ipos are of course when companies go from being private to being public for those of us who invest in the stock market it s when new stocks are born there were sure were a lot of ipos in the years 2020 and somewhat in 2021 there haven t been as many in the very cold market of 2022 but i generally like initial public offerings because if they don t happen we don t have stocks to invest in you and me i always root eventually for great companies once they ve hit scale and i would say a margin of stability even safety i like it when great businesses go public in the early days of the motley fool howard schultz the ceo of starbucks through his venture capital arm maveron howard was invested in the motley fool maveron was one of our lead investors and i have very fond thoughts about 25 years later even though we never went public i appreciate maveron and the people of maveron and howard schultz in particular howard used to come to fool hq from time to time and talk some about his views of our company and hope i think as our venture capitalist that one day we would go public and i m sorry howard that we never did but part of what he was doing was coaching us if we did go public based on his own experience of taking starbucks public he was coaching us on the proper way and the proper time to take your company public obviously i speak about it at a little bit greater length and detail in that podcast lessons from a great business august 10th 2016 but i think i can remember enough of it just to convey the key point here the number 1 thing i remember howard conveying to us is that before you ever go public as a private company that you do so at a time where you are 100 percent sure of your next couple of quarters of performance that you are going to come out and not just put up good numbers but 100 percent of the time beat the analyst s numbers of course you re communicating the analysts in the first place and a lot of good businesses consistently under promise and over deliver any experienced investors used the company s conservative management s talking down their prospects and analysts respecting that and holding the numbers back a little bit and then the company comes out beats those numbers and stock market investors like that and usually the stock pops a little bit the next day but over the course of time as a management team you get used to under promising and over delivering howard was saying to us before you ever brought the motley fool public which we may never do but before you ever do he was saying back then make sure that you lock stock and barrel toss away the key you know that you re going to put up numbers that are good and surprise people positively with the numbers that you report in your first two quarters as a public company now why am i telling you this since you re not about to invest in the motley fool and we re not about to go public the reason i m telling you this is because ever since as an investor i have very carefully scrutinized the first two quarters of any newly public company in the early days of motley fool rule breakers the subscription service which i hope many present members are hearing me today as i speak in the early days of rule breakers i had recommended a stock great wolf resorts this is a company some of us may know it s a resort company it s the water park company some people love waterparks other people my wife for example don t really like waterparks very much but great wolf resorts was a pretty successful earlier stage waterparks company and it was coming public with the ticker symbol w o l f and weeks into it being a public company we decided to recommend it for motley fool rule breakers well when that company in its very first i think it was the first but if it wasn t the first it was the second in its first or second quarter as a public company they came out with bad numbers that surprised the analysts and the stock market overall and that was one of the few times that i quickly sold a stock out of either rule breakers or stock advisor both of which i worked on about 20 years i didn t do it very often but i did it with ticker symbol w o l f because i remembered howard schultz s coaching saying to us if you re really ready to go public you need to prove it by coming out with good numbers at least your first two quarters so when nasdaq ticker symbol w o l f came out and really wolf it s numbers that first or second quarter it went bye bye from rule breakers i think i m happy to say it i m sad for them it was not a good company on the public markets i think it eventually went private but it was a very poor stock i think it was a good sell on our part ever since especially with analysts internally i turned great wolf into a verb a new word a neologism i ll say a company waft that quarter which is my way of saying we probably shouldn t be in that stock because it s a new ipo and they didn t hit their first quarter numbers were they really ready why did they go public in that position if you like that wisdom and you like that story you along with me have howard schultz to thank on the blast from the past number 4 this one came from great quotes volume 1 december 16th 2015 it was our first ever great quotes episode in that episode i won t be speaking to these but just to entice you i gave my favorite grateful dead quote in that episode i think it s really my only grateful dead quote i reached out to a sci fi author with a great quote about the future and i got to quote the author of the book the little prince with my favourite line from antoine de saint exupery but in that episode i also one of the five quotes i spoke to was this one and what i love about this quote is this is not jerry garcia this is not antoine de saint exupery this was a motley fool member posting on our discussion boards i remember his screen name was markoos m a r k o o s for the record this was posted on the motley fool discussion boards on december 7th pearl harbor day of 2002 it was on our economy and markets folder along running discussion board on the motley fool and it was post number 5 894 but that s all just trivia here s the quote i m just pulling a part of the post and i just love how he expressed this so from markoos here comes a great quote from december 16th 2015 the stock is going to trade whether you look at it or not and the market is a crazy man if you haven t already noticed always has been always will be knowing that why on earth would you listen to a crazy person five days a week your mood is going to swing right along with the market your stocks are up you re going to be happy for the rest of the day your stocks are down you re going to be in a bad mood the rest of the day and possibly even scared are worried that something is wrong when there s no reason at all honestly life has enough ups and downs of its own already you actually want more besides he closed listening to this crazy person day after day it s probably going to tempt you to do crazy things well i want to thank markoos for that great quote by the way markoos if you re still a member definitely write in an update your story for may 20 years later i ll feature it on the june mailbag later this month or if anybody knows markoos in the motley fool community anyway speaking of the market is a crazy man haven t we just seen that seven weeks in a row the dow jones industrial average was down for the longest streak since 1923 that was right up until last week last week the markets broke that seven week losing streak and the s p 500 saw its highest weekly return in almost two years talk about your whipsaw i admit i personally do follow the market five days a week i ve often talked about this i am also a minnesota twins baseball fan and i actually watched just about all 162 twins games each year i love to follow things that i love from one day to the next but very few people love the stock market as much as i do and many people listening to me right now probably don t spend five days a week watching the stock market but if you do you need to recognize you are watching a crazy person it s kind of like i don t know the danger of following in social media somebody who s just constantly raving there are a fair number of cynical people out there in social media if you give them your attention from one day to the next guess who else is becoming a seneca or maybe even worse a misanthrope at the end of that posting markoos talked about how he just checks his stocks once a month literally he says it took discipline but has made a great deal of difference to him i have to say i love that i definitely don t have that discipline or want to show such discipline but i do think if you find yourself getting preoccupied by the stock market it s probably because a the market is a crazy man and b there is a chance you ll go crazy if you pay too much attention to him i think it was benjamin graham who talked about mr market and in a lot of the work of his life mr market buffett has picked up on this as well mr market is not a very reliable gentleman anyway that was for great quotes volume one december 16th 2015 that takes me to the last one this week blast from the past number 5 i opened up with a car story when i got out of my car and picked up somebody else s cigarette but next to his car and i often driving my car i hate to see litter along the highway it was a car story well this is a car story to close in our omega this week is our alpha at the end of what have you learned from david gardner my annual birthday podcast from years past i used to end with this story this year well just last month i forgot it i didn t make time for it i think it makes an important point while i didn t get a chance to end last month s episode with it i will have a chance to end this month s episode with it i ve entitled it it s a short essay for me prison of our own creation i hope it makes a helpful point for you for this blast from the past number 5 i wrote this essay just a few years ago and it starts well i mentioned i wanted to tell us a short anecdote to close on my birthday last thursday i was driving from where i spent my day to supper that night it was a gorgeous evening here in washington dc and for those of you who know our climate there s a little bit of the mid atlantic in general but especially in washington dc there s a wonderful three weeks or so each year where spring is sprung and yet the heat the humidity the gnats aren t out yet well the washington nationals baseball team might be out by the way not a very good team this year but i m talking about the g n a t s which start to swarm around us like clouds through most of the summer it was one of those beautiful pre gnats nights last week on my birthday so i got in an uber my driver had i m going to say it was a russian accent quietly on my own i noticed he had the windows up but it was about 5 30 pm and i wanted to drink in the evening air so i put my window down and we got started on the drive at about four minutes in he just reflexively rolled my window up i m just sort of sitting there and i m generally a pretty non confrontational person in my mind the driver wasn t comfortable or maybe he didn t want me to have my window up for whatever reason he probably had air conditioning on or maybe he was thinking economically i m not really sure what he was thinking other than he wasn t thinking what i was thinking and that made me sad as he put my window back up i sat there for about five minutes and steward about it a little bit and i noticed that the air in the car was not particularly pleasant wasn t really air conditioning i think he had the air going but not the ac on and i was just sitting there thinking it looks so beautiful outside should i do it well i decided i m going to do it i m going to ask him if i can roll my window down now i know many of you are like of course you can roll your window down its uber they are there to serve you it s your window temporarily while you re in his car and yet that s just not how i roll as i said i m pretty non confrontational but i decided i m going to ask him directly do you mind if i roll my window down i asked him and he said back to me in so many words thank you so much for asking me to do that in fact i m getting a little sick right now and the air in the car would not have been good for me what i realized from that conversation was that we were both creating together a small dystopia he misunderstood my intentions i misunderstood his we both found out that the wicked witch was dead all hail dorothy we both wanted the window down and as i told my kids later that night it s important in life not only to let others know what you like and not make assumptions about what they are thinking but sometimes you may be surprised that the other person was thinking exactly the same thing that you were and yet if i had not reached out if i just sat there and stood for another 25 minutes missing a gorgeous evening in the nation s capital i would ve been living in a dystopia of our own collective creation now i m sure many of my seasoned wise and knowledgeable listeners already knew that that s maybe not something that you had to learn from david

by kalena thomhave whenever there are new or proposed changes to tax law your eyes may glaze over as they skim the headlines meanwhile the wealth defense industry and its legions of accountants financial advisors and lawyers is quietly mobilizing last year the biden administration unveiled a proposal for a revitalized irs including a stronger wealth squad to take on tax evasion by the extremely wealthy that is people with tens of millions of dollars soon after the wealth defense industry announced strategies that wealth advisors should use to prepare the wealth squad officially called the global high wealth industry group was formed in 2009 but the following year was a pivotal shift in u s politics and due to conservative blowback against the agency the irs has since bled funding combine budget cuts with the power of billionaires and multimillionaires to hire seemingly endless teams of lawyers and accountants and it s clear how the wealth squad has not always been an effective force emphasizing both the unrealized purpose of the squad and the hope that enforcement will increase a recent report from the government accountability office gao highlights how audit rates have significantly declined over the past decade this is particularly true for high income households between 2010 and 2019 audit rates of households earning more than 5 million per year declined by 86 percent falling from a more than 16 percent audit rate to just over 2 percent don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the reduction in audits of the wealthy is concerning not only because of the substantial revenue lost from tax evasion but also because of the explosion of wealth and wealth hiding over the past decade let s take for example the wealth of the top ten billionaires from forbes list of billionaires in 2010 that year the list was topped by mexican billionaire carlos slim jeff bezos had yet to break the top 40 and elon musk s tesla had only just gone public the total wealth of the world s ten richest people totaled 342 2 billion fast forward almost a decade later to 2019 when bezos was number one by then the total wealth of the top ten billionaires in the world had more than doubled to 744 billion the start of the pandemic the following year was particularly lucrative too as the institute for policy studies reports u s billionaire wealth has soared by more than half 1 7 trillion since the pandemic began as the rich get richer they need somewhere to park their billions beyond the traditional financial markets that s why the uber wealthy choose a wide variety of physical assets like real estate yachts and expensive art as vessels for wealth storage they also create complex trusts to house their wealth hiring skilled lawyers to extort loopholes and manipulate laws to protect wealth from the worst thing that could happen to it taxation the international consortium of investigative journalists revealed in last year s pandora papers how exactly the world s wealthy use trusts to avoid taxes and accountability some of the world s top destinations for trusts are u s states like south dakota nevada alaska and delaware these states have passed laws that attract the wealthy to state trust companies both international and domestic ultra high net worth people are increasingly setting up trusts in these states south dakota for example hosts more than 500 billion in trust assets up from 57 billion in 2010 nationwide according to estimates by gabriel zucman thomas piketty and emmanuel saez the u s was home to at least 5 6 trillion in trust assets in 2021 more than double the approximately 2 3 trillion it hosted in 2010 in short strong irs oversight is needed now more than ever but as the gao report contends that s not what we ve seen unfortunately the irs doesn t exactly have the resources for a robust effort against tax evasion and avoidance in a comment on a draft of the gao report irs deputy commissioner douglas o donnell said that budget cuts have hampered the agency s ability to fully carry out its mission he wrote that reduced funds have led to a staffing shortage that has resulted in challenges to overall tax administration including our ability to deliver adequate customer service audit coverage collecting on taxes owed closing the tax gap funding the government and it modernization in inflation adjusted dollars irs funding has fallen by approximately 21 percent since 2010 more than 13 000 enforcement employees were lost to attrition between 2010 and 2020 and the number of agents handling complex cases specifically fell by more than a third though higher income individuals are more likely to misreport their taxes those who claim the earned income tax credit eitc low and middle income households are audited at higher than average rates according to the irs this is because eitc audits can be automated while high income audits require much more work by teams with specialized skills skills that the irs has increasingly lost the irs itself estimates underreporting and underpayment led to a 441 billion annual gap between taxes owed and taxes paid between 2011 and 2013 and that just 60 billion of that would eventually be collected in recent years more than half of what s known as the tax gap is due to underpayment by those in the top 5 percent of income and more than a quarter of the gap is the responsibility of the top 1 percent don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free over the next decade the tax gap is estimated to reach approximately 7 trillion to crack down on tax abuse the biden administration hopes to give the irs a shot in the arm through an infusion of 80 billion over the next ten years funds that would go toward enforcement efforts and better technology the funding was included in the languishing build back better plan it s unclear whether it the funding plan will pass even if it s an investment that would yield substantial revenue hen you have fewer employees doing compliance work you end up leaving tax revenue on the table said then irs commissioner john koskinen in 2015 addressing the american institute of certified public accountants at its national tax conference in cutting the irs budget the government is forgoing billions just to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars the treasury department estimated that the 80 billion investment in the irs would generate 480 billion in revenue over the next decade due to increased tax enforcement this is consistent with irs data that suggest each dollar invested in enforcement yields a return of about 5 yet even if the irs gets increased appropriations the wealth defense industry will be prepared it began preparing when there were mere whispers of a better funded wealth squad a spring 2021 webinar from wealthmanagement com suggested that clients should expect a holistic and intrusive auditing process and to start preparing immediately an excellent way to advertise wealth advisor services multimillionaires and billionaires have immeasurable resources to defend their wealth against taxation and creditors if the irs continues to hobble and the capacity of the irs wealth squad recedes those resources will only continue to grow and inequality will only continue to widen previously published

farmland partners is an under the radar farmland reit that has a great shot at being a long term winner my selection for a stock trading at less than 20 per share that has considerable long term growth potential is farmland partners fpi 0 95 this company is organized as a real estate investment trust reit and focuses on you guessed it farmland specifically in the united states on friday its stock closed at 14 11 farmland partners is one of only two publicly traded farmland reits gladstone land is the other one before we dive in a word of caution while it s possible to find some relatively undiscovered gems among lower priced stocks as a whole this space tends to be quite risky why invest in reits real estate investment trusts are attractive because they tend to pay solid dividends in exchange for the special tax treatment they receive they re required to pay out at least 90 of their annual income as dividends farmland partners dividend is currently yielding about 1 7 this is on the low side for reits but the stock could be a nice fit for investors more concerned with long term capital appreciation than current income why invest in u s farmland prime u s farmland is poised to increase nicely in value over the long term in my view because of supply demand dynamics the supply of arable land should shrink over time due to continuing development and climate change which is causing an increase in the frequency of severe droughts in this country and around the world on the other hand demand for crops grown on farmland should continue to grow the world s population is rising and more people in developing countries are moving into the middle class moreover the pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine have underscored the benefits of companies and entire countries having domestic supply chains this is especially true with respect to supply chains for essential goods and commodities such as food the current high inflationary environment is another reason why now is a good time to consider investing in farmland which investors can do by buying shares in a farmland reit investments in physical assets tend to outperform those in other categories when inflation is high farmland partners business and key stats farmland partners which went public in 2014 buys high quality u s farmland that it leases to farmers to grow a variety of crops it also provides auction brokerage and third party farm management services the company s portfolio included about 160 700 acres of owned farmland and 25 000 acres of managed farmland across 19 states as of the end of the first quarter with more than 100 tenants and 26 crop types grown on its farms the company has good geographic tenant and crop diversity portfolio vacancy was 0 company market cap dividend yield forward price affo based on company s 2022 guidance stock s year to date 2022 total return stock s 5 year total return farmland partners 706 million 1 7 50 to 64 18 5 83 8 s p 500 index 1 59 22 3 65 2 last month the company announced that it was raising its quarterly dividend by 20 to 0 06 ceo paul pittman attributed the increase to strong earnings growth significant asset appreciation reduced leverage and better expense visibility resulting from the dismissal of the class action litigation this dividend hike is the first one since 2018 the 20 raise suggests management feels very confident about the company s future profitability performance farmland partners stock is trading at 50 to 64 times the 2022 affo range for which management has guided this is a relatively high valuation but attractive stocks rarely come cheap lastly investors can expect some cyclicality with a farmland reit because there is cyclicality with agricultural commodity prices which are currently at or near all time highs however the long term trend will be up for these commodities for the supply demand reasons discussed in my opinion if this thesis proves accurate farmland partners stock should be a long term winner

to displace the longtime residents who helped give the city its distinctive culture and character it s a crisis facing cities across america where housing is in short supply affordable housing is even scarcer and investors are sweeping into high demand markets with big cash offers that are pricing many americans out of the market altogether ten years ago a multibillion dollar push by the city to incentivize development in san antonio s urban core yielded explosive investment along its enchanting riverway a realization of former mayor julián castro s decade of downtown campaign the leveraging of taxpayer dollars for private development was wildly successful and critics say destructive in the city s economically segregated inner core neighborhoods which have its oldest housing stock and most vulnerable residents redevelopment brought luxury housing high end shopping districts tourist attractions and made downtown a hot destination but it also triggered soaring property values intensified code enforcement action which made it easier for older buildings to be demolished for redevelopment and residents say gentrification that has made the historically black east side unrecognizable advertisement article continues below this ad advocates say this new form of redlining spreading to the city s tejano west side means many will no longer be able to afford homes in

done on the river but why is it at the cost of people who have lived here forever why can t poor people have nice things said flores we ve been living next to a ditch for years and finally they fixed it now we have to leave that s what irritates me city leaders say they are listening and aiding residents with everything from money to help rehabilitate homes to integrating advocate recommendations into their housing strategy to a 150 million bond issue approved by voters this month that will be used for affordable housing initiatives mayor ron nirenberg said the city has curbed the wild west development mentality with a reset on tax incentives and affordability metrics but the solution cannot continue to be disinvestment he said we are trying to slow or turn back the tide that began

like what the united states will look like in 20 25 years said roger enriquez a university of texas san antonio criminal justice professor who directs the school s engagement with the city s west side the rest of the country needs to pay attention to what s happening here because it s almost a crystal ball into the future and what will happen if solutions aren t found san antonio officials realized in 2010 that the city of 1 5 million projected to grow by another million in less than 30 years was facing a housing shortage the city s military and medical industries and low cost living made it attractive it also was poised for spillover from the boom in austin located about 80 miles north advertisement article continues below this ad deputy city manager lori houston said years of neglect meant there was no market rate housing downtown to meet the growing demand neighborhoods in the city s core were falling apart and plagued with crime through a community driven vision she said the city focused on making downtown more livable once done they d turn back to affordability issues she said it was wildly successful houston said after we saw these housing projects come online we heard a lot of concerns from the community and from council members developers received rebate deals for nearly everything they built forgoing taxes for up to 75 years and obtaining federal housing grants to develop public housing but most of the new housing including the affordable units built as a condition of receiving public money were priced above what most san antonians could afford according to a report from the national association of latino community asset builders the median household income for san antonians is 67 521 a year nearly 15 000 less than the national median beautification

and 2017 various task forces and studies produced about a half dozen reports but led to little progress we spent three years banging our head against the wall and started to see the problem unfolding

june is caribbean american heritage month a month dedicated to recognising and celebrating the significance of caribbean people and their descendants in the history and culture of the united states over the next few weeks loop news will profile some people of caribbean descent who have made a tremendous impact in the entertainment industry in the united states nolan baynes credits his guyanese upbringing for the success he has had in his life the general manager of 300 studios an arm of 300 entertainment which is home to artistes such as megan thee stallion gunna young thug and mary j blige baynes has worked his way up the entertainment eco system in the united states from budding artiste to music executive he says he can t imagine what his life would have been had he not had his foundation as his anchor i can t tell you how many times i have hit these crossroads in my life where every decision i have made strong ones important choices that were based on lessons from home guyanese culture that allowed me to choose the right path every time he tells loop news stating that growing up in america as a child makes one susceptible to bad aspects of the culture baynes says the lessons he learned from back home helped him to navigate many challenges my guyanese upbringing grounded me to the level where when i went to school i was serious about school because that is what i was taught to be back home i didn t talk back to teachers because i was taught that is not what you do even the decisions i made in my music career were based on can i live with myself afterwards that is all guyanese teaching that is my aunty my mum my dad you do the things that would allow you to look at yourself in the mirror and you respect other people all those basic things have been my anchor as i navigate my life in the music industry he explains the men of 300 kelly g head of creative strategy 300 studios kevin liles founder ceo of 300 entertainment and nolan baynes born in mackenzie and growing up in new amsterdam baynes migrated to the united states at the age of nine when his father who worked in the bauxite industry moved the family there after completing studies in canada his family settled in brooklyn at a time when hip hop was still a nascent genre and dancehall was just gaining a foothold in the us baynes was first introduced to the music business working at a record store his father and some friends owned there they listened to a lot of dancehall tapes and sound clashes from jamaican sound systems and helped independent artistes who would come in and sell albums on consignment baynes himself was a dancehall artiste as a teen signed to freeze fever pitch label a part of emi at the george westinghouse vocational and technical high school he was among a student body that produced today s hip hop legends among them jay z busta rhymes dmx and the notorious big i was always around music i lived it i breathed it but i was better at the business i naturally cared about what happened to the business when i and my crew were recording i would find myself thinking about what do we do with this record when we do the show how do we do it he reveals working for an independent dancehall label called signet where shaggy first got exposure baynes decided to focus on the business we were doing things right on the business side and that whole vision of finding shaggy and signing him i initiated it because these guys were in my circles growing up they were the popular artists in flatbush he says nolan with dancehall star shaggy and singer kreesha turner despite his interest in the business end baynes was still recording until a pivotal experience forced him to abandon hopes of being an artiste todd terry a dance producer and owner of freeze records at the time was looking for reggae acts for a house music series called dred stock baynes couldn t find acts available for the project so he ended up doing it himself i went home wrote a song came back the next day knocked it out and he was like this is really good do you have another one two weeks in we finish an album and we have a dred stock group with random artists that i knew from flatbush he sent the project to emi and they liked it so much they licensed it he realised i wasn t into dance music so he said if you do this project for me i will sign you as a dancehall artist to do your own project baynes recalls the relationship with terri and emi soured and the dred stock project stalled disheartened baynes decided that he would no longer put himself in a position where he didn t have any power so he shelved his career as an artiste i started really studying the music industry paying attention asking questions i wanted to know everything from publishing to licensing he said nolan baynes still at signet where by this time shaggy had moved on as his career blew up baynes decided to revitalise the label by doing remixes he looked for the hottest song in jamaica to remix for a hip hop audience he selected tour by capleton and sent it to a bunch of djs who did remixes one of them was rapper lil john who at the time worked for a record company and had a radio show he remixed the capleton track with a slick rick beat and baynes sent it to funkmaster flex who played it on repeat on his radio show we were on to something and the record was number one in ny we had baltimore dc he recalls despite the success of the record baynes didn t receive payment owed from the label for the song and he quit shortly after he got an opportunity to work as a production assistant for an mtv shoot for 200 a day curious he started asking questions about the production and made friends with a producer who kept hiring him for small jobs when she was promoted to run her own department she offered him a job which he turned down my wife who was my girlfriend then said you want to be in the music industry and you saying no to mtv i went back to her two weeks later and asked if the job was still available and she said she filled it it made me realise how valuable it was and i said next time i get an offer like that i won t say no two weeks later she came back to me with an offer he says singer deborah cox is one of the many artistes nolan has worked with baynes stayed at mtv for 12 years going from production management for the vmas and other big events to a music marketing manager for shows such as trl among his achievements at mtv was the launch of a two dollar concert series the launch of mtv 2 the sucka free concert series and leading the marketing for music choice one of the first streaming services that reached 75 million homes his experience there taught baynes many aspects of the entertainment industry from budgeting and dealing with unions to conceptualising tours and networking with industry stakeholders every chapter at mtv is contributing to what i do now all of those things really helped me but more importantly working with people in the creative space allowed me to build a sensibility that makes it easy to navigate even an environment like 300 i understand young people i understand where they are what they want their dreams and how much music means to them at this stage of their life for the older folks who are running the business i understand the stresses they face they have to deliver the business has to be profitable they have board members to answer to he says nolan baynes throughout his career which included running two boutique agencies baynes has also kept a pulse on caribbean music and artistes he was part of the team at mtv that launched mtv tempo and managed artistes such as nadine sutherland it s in his dna he says but as he learns how the business works at a higher level he is thinking of a different approach for the caribbean how do we reposition our stories how do we reposition our artistes where is the story that is not really told that could be appealing to this audience so if they know we are there it could reawaken a renaissance of our music and culture i am working on some pretty cool technology things that could have an impact on what we do on the caribbean side and there are tons of programmes being discussed right now that could help the caribbean shore up the music industry he revealed outside of the entertainment industry baynes has intentions to contribute to the development

cars that track your every movement gadgets that can tell your mood from how you walk pcs that take screenshots to show your boss if you re really working from home it s all laid bare in a new book by a top british lawyer who warns of the terrifying consequences just imagine a great bazaar a vast marketplace teeming with shoppers like the bustling souks of istanbul dubai or marrakech at every turn stallholders pester visitors to inspect their wares while the signs appeal for custom in almost every language in the world there s just one unusual thing about it for instead of the pots pans silks and spices you might expect the bazaar sells only one product it sells data mine yours your neighbours your family s an emirati woman walks in front of the saudi arabian pavilion at dubai s tech expo 2020 the market traders don t hide what they sell quite the reverse as the writer jamie susskind puts it they boast of knowing the innermost secrets of hundreds of millions of people they know what they eat for breakfast where they sleep what they do for work what they believe and care about the kind of tv they watch their ages and sexual preferences their insecurities and fears some of the bazaar s merchants susskind writes sell filthy buckets of raw data in need of a clean others offer neat packages crisply tailored to the needs of their clientele one vendor hawks a list of rape victims 79 bucks for a thousand along with a list of victims of domestic abuse but perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the great data bazaar is the fact that in large parts of the world including america it s almost entirely unsupervised in susskind s words there are no law enforcement officials in sight it sounds like the stuff of a wild dystopian fantasy yet in reality says susskind a highly respected lawyer and expert on the politics of technological change it s simply the world of today s bloated digital behemoths from facebook and tiktok to apple and amazon futuristic technology has potentially worrisome implications for people and democracy too for years susskind has been investigating the world of the tech giants meticulously recording their erosion of personal freedom and political debate now in a blistering and highly persuasive manifesto the digital republic he is calling for western governments to fight back against these autocrats of information as he sees it digital technology poses a deadly threat to democracy itself by which he means the ideal of a virtuous republic which we inherited from the greeks and romans quietly ruthlessly the gilded elites running firms such as google and facebook are stripping us of our liberty and power yet they re doing it so subtly that we barely notice most of us are vaguely aware that when we type in our postcode or date of birth we re handing over our personal data but typically we shrug and do it anyway because it s more convenient not to quibble what few of us realise though is how coldly and pitilessly we re being watched and recorded going off grid is almost impossible for as susskind notes the unique identifiers in our smartphones and payment devices telegraph our presence wherever we go what few of us realise is how often we re being watched but our phones our cars and more even our cars are keeping tabs on us four years ago the then chief executive of ford jim hackett boasted that he could harvest data on 100 million people through their cars we already know he bragged what people make we know where they work we know if they re married we know how long they ve lived in their house and that s the leverage we ve got here with the data your car in other words isn t just a car it s a means of spying on you and selling your information meanwhile our phones record our fingerprints our voices even our facial characteristics other devices says susskind can recognise us from our gait their algorithms can tell if we are bored or distracted from the tiny movements of our faces they can see if we re sad from the way we walk chillingly they can even predict our mental state from the content of our social media posts with the pandemic encouraging home working many employers now use software packages such as hubstaff which claims that it enables teams to work more effectively but when you look more closely the implications could scarcely be more terrifying hubstaff doesn t just track the websites you visit it records your mouse movements and keystrokes it even takes screenshots of your desktop so that your boss knows exactly what you re looking at all this seems disturbingly reminiscent of the telescreens in george orwell s nightmarish novel nineteen eighty four which allow the authorities to track what the oppressed masses are doing and saying even a decade or two ago it would have seemed utterly unimaginable yet today it has become a daily reality for thousands of workers across the western world the sinister implications concealed behind the website s cloying pictures of happy grinning employees here s another example when police in the u s wanted information about black lives matter activists reports susskind they didn t need to spy on them with cameras in bars they bought what they needed in the data market facebook had a trove of data about users interested in black lives matter which it sold to third party brokers who sold it on to law enforcement authorities you don t have to be an enthusiast of black lives matter to find all this deeply alarming who might be next environmental organisations countryside protesters religious groups people opposed to the political fads of the day but snooping as susskind calls it is merely one symptom of a deeper issue what s even more worrying is the tech giants power to influence and control us often in ways we don t even notice although platforms such as twitter and facebook boast of their commitment to free expression they are constantly tweaking what we see and hear twitter s former chief executive jack dorsey for example has admitted that his platform unfairly filtered some 600 000 accounts from its latest results search feed which is what many users turn to first and though i wasn t sorry to see donald trump kicked off twitter should a mere social media platform have such power who decides who stays and who goes should it really be up to elon musk the billionaire who hopes to buy twitter to decide who can talk to us google s search results too exercise a colossal influence over our daily decisions and political assumptions during the 2016 u s presidential election says susskind the top two suggestions on yahoo for completing the phrase hillary clinton is were a liar and a criminal yet the google equivalents were winning and awesome so depending which search engine you chose you would get a very different picture of the defeated democratic candidate even tiktok which specialises in comical videos for children and teenagers quietly tweaks its content in 2020 reports susskind it emerged that the app s moderators had been ordered to block images of chubby people and those with an abnormal body shape from appearing on the for you page transport developments though promising offer new opportunities for our data to be lost all this might not sound terribly sinister but when you look beyond the western world you realise how this technological power can be abused for authoritarian ends in thailand facebook removes anything critical of the royal family just as it has censored blasphemous content in pakistan and tiktok which is chinese regularly censors any discussion of tibetan independence the bloody massacre in tiananmen square in 1989 or the horrific treatment of millions of uighurs in the concentration camps in xinjiang the cruel irony is that in the west the social media giants boast that they are fostering democracy and bringing the world closer together yet even as they parade their commitment to the latest woke fads they actively enable the authoritarian suppression of human rights on the other side of the world in hong kong reports susskind pro democracy activists developed an app that would allow them to track police movements and therefore evade tear gas and baton charges so what did apple do you can probably guess eager to please its friends in the chinese communist party the tech giant banned the app from its platform meanwhile if you go to saudi arabia and you re a man you can download an app that will allow you to monitor and restrict the movements of your wife doesn t this undermine apple s commitment to women s rights so often proclaimed in its western adverts apparently not though the women of saudi arabia might disagree if only they could speak freely tiktok quietly tweaks its content in 2020 it was revealed the app airbrushes chubby people to put it simply whenever the choice lies between money and morality firms such as apple google and facebook always unerringly choose the cash in a saner world as susskind points out firms with this sort of power would be subject to proper democratic regulation the kind that already governs doctors lawyers even broadcasters but the tech giants driven by crude self interest and a bloated sense of their importance have resisted regulation at every turn they claim they are capable of regulating themselves though the record tells a different story facebook hired a former cia officer yael eisenstat to supervise their elections integrity operations but she left after just six months complaining that she had been intentionally sidelined the plain fact she said was that mark zuckerberg and his cronies were ultimately interested in only one thing making money yet in some cases facebook genuinely costs lives in burma the site has been used to encourage the government backed genocide campaign against the minority rohingya people moreover despite the empty promises of zuckerberg s corporate lickspittle the shameless nick clegg the network has often acted as a recruiting centre for extremists even allowing people to post instructions on making a nail bomb at google meanwhile another whistle blower ross lajeunesse tried to set up a human rights programme but walked out in despair as he put it google didn t really care about human rights it cared only for bigger profits and an even higher stock price against this background western governments have been criminally weak from the white house to downing street our leaders have allowed the tech firms to steal our data sell us lies and misinformation and turn us into little more than unwitting content generators all in the name of profit western governments have ben too weak in protecting our human rights versus corporations in his final chapters susskind offers a series of remedies tech firms should be regulated by law he says and forced to ban data harvesting and take down abuse within 12 hours above all they should be subject to precisely the kind of competition laws and editorial regulations that already govern other powerful industries such as the broadcast media for they are no longer plucky outsiders they are the new digital establishment and if they cannot show genuine civic responsibility they should be forced to do so some readers i imagine may find this too strong a slippery slope to state interference in the free market but i don t agree at the turn of the 20th century reforming u s presidents such as theodore roosevelt moved firmly and decisively to break up the monopolistic bullying anti competitive giants that were giving capitalism a bad name most famously standard oil but this didn t endanger capitalism quite the reverse it reinvigorated it encouraging competition and restoring public confidence as susskind s book powerfully shows we need to rekindle the same spirit today for the past 30 years governments on both sides of the atlantic have been pathetically weak cowering before the supposed power of facebook and google instead of daring to stand up in the interest of the people technological companies are supposed to be our servants not the other way round your phone shouldn t spy on you your social media platform shouldn t sell your secrets so how have we allowed ourselves to get into a situation where they do when a western government finally summons the will to change things there will susskind warns be howls of anguish from the kleptocrats of silicon valley yet the great task that has fallen to our generation he writes is to be welcomed and not feared the task of harnessing the awesome power of technology and binding it tightly to the shared hopes and aspirations of humanity that s worth fighting for who could disagree with that adapted from the digital republic on freedom and

parsa venkateshwar rao jr senior journalist india emerged as the dealmaker at the world trade organisation s wto 12th ministerial conference in geneva last week when the conference went into an extra day and india almost appeared to be a deal breaker commerce minister piyush goyal has emerged as an unlikely hero and he has been credited with holding a slew of bilateral meetings across the board to resolve outstanding issues the four main issues are intellectual property waiver for covid 19 vaccines public food stocks and their global trade fisheries subsidies and customs duties waiver on electronic transmissions the united states and china are yet to give the assent to the waiver on intellectual property rights on covid 19 vaccines the farmers should seize the opportunity and rules should be framed in a way that the traders do not rob the farmers of their due share of export profits there is still not much clarity on public food stocks the conditionality is that restrictions on procurement will arise only when there is a demand for foodgrains in the domestic market and a government to government trade from public food stocks is to be allowed the fisheries subsidies had a compromise clause while subsidies were waived for deep sea fishing and the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone was recognised subsidies for illegal fishing are to be barred the waiver of customs duties on electronic transmissions which mainly benefits the advanced economies is to remain in place till the end of 2023 india said that if the 13th wto ministerial conference is not held before the end of 2024 then it will not adhere to this understanding on waiver of duties on electronic imports the wto has claimed this patchwork of a deal to be historic because it is based on the consensus of 164 countries which seemed unreachable the deal based on consensus had become crucial for the very credibility of the organisation which is struggling to make its writ run there are too many free trade agreements among countries and among groups of countries which makes the wto redundant and these agreements break many of the fair trade rules that are supposed to underpin the wto and which favours competition and market economy one of the reasons that the wto has lost its authority is because the developed economies which had set the rules during the pre wto general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt had lost much of their authority during the wto era as the voices of developing economies and the least developed economies gained ground the wto became an open forum hurdles have increased and decisions have become difficult and the rich economies have had to strategise to get their way they still seem to get away behind the cacophony of differences but it has become difficult the wto is forced to recognise the concerns and needs of the poorer economies it is because of this apparent disorderliness of the working of the wto that the powerful economies are getting things done outside the wto framework india which is neither a rich economy nor poor is forced to play the difficult role of speaking up for the developing economies while trying to corner the advantages of an emerging economy this is evident in the case of the waiver of intellectual property rights on covid 19 vaccines indian pharmaceutical companies want to manufacture during the duty free hiatus by making the covid 19 vaccines developed in europe and america india would not want to make available its own indigenous covaxin manufactured by bharat biotech in collaboration with the government s national institute of virology niv in pune india would lose the advantage of earning on intellectual property rights if it were to market the home made covaxin so india would like to manufacture the vaccines developed by pfizer astrazeneca johnson johnson and sell them in asian and african countries the marginal profits to be made from this venture are quite huge opportunism indeed but in the hard world of trade offs one cannot insist on being too generous of course the government would want to pretend that it is doing it for the sake of the poor people and poor countries which is plain hogwash the public food stocks are a trickier issue the temptation to offload the overflowing public buffer stocks is indeed tempting but it will be an unfair trade practice because a subsidy is involved through the minimum support price there is also the hidden fact that the government is not able to procure more than 30 per cent of the foodgrains produced the other two thirds remain in the shadow world of private trade the honest way of dealing with it and making india an agriculture exports country is to evolve a mechanism where farmers benefit from the rising prices in the world grain markets the producers cooperatives that the government has envisaged remain a dead idea there is no dynamism to it the farmers and traders should be forming a profitable alliance but the farmers and traders remain at the primitive level of thinking of course there are the privileged traders who strike gold in this labyrinth of inaction with the government helping them with insider information the government however wants to keep its freedom to deal with the public food stocks as it deems fit it wants to deal with foodgrain exports when there is an opportunity as is the case now the fair thing for the government then is to help farmers sell their produce in the export markets so that profits go to the farmers but there are too many bureaucratic trapdoors on the way and it is better that the government is kept out of the picture it is the farmers who should seize the opportunity and rules should be framed in such a way that the traders who facilitate the transport and sale of foodgrains do not rob the farmers of their due share in the export earnings this might look like utopian but it can be worked if the farmers pick up entrepreneurial courage what about the wto and india in all this the truth is that india is outgrowing the wto and it will be under pressure from developing economies to play by the rules which will not be to the liking of india of course india wants to be in the big boys club and call the shots but as we have seen the big boys have been marginalised in the wto and india too will be in the same position ultimately democratic pressures work within countries and among countries

to displace the longtime residents who helped give the city its distinctive culture and character it s a crisis facing cities across america where housing is in short supply affordable housing is even scarcer and investors are sweeping into high demand markets with big cash offers that are pricing many americans out of the market altogether ten years ago a multibillion dollar push by the city to incentivize development in san antonio s urban core yielded explosive investment along its enchanting riverway a realization of former mayor julián castro s decade of downtown campaign the leveraging of taxpayer dollars for private development was wildly successful and critics say destructive in the city s economically segregated inner core neighborhoods which have its oldest housing stock and most vulnerable residents redevelopment brought luxury housing high end shopping districts tourist attractions and made downtown a hot destination but it also triggered soaring property values

into their housing strategy to a 150 million bond issue approved by voters this month that will be used for affordable housing initiatives mayor ron nirenberg said the city has curbed the wild west development mentality with a reset on tax incentives and affordability metrics but the solution cannot continue to be disinvestment he said we are trying to slow or turn back the tide that began

are condemned often cannot afford housing in the redeveloped neighborhoods that replace them property valuations in bexar county home to san antonio have increased by an average of 73 over the last 10 years raising the tax bill of the average homeowner between 2 300 and 3 000 according to the county appraisal district the number of homeowners protesting their valuations has jumped 50 in the past five years neighbors are helping each other apply for tax exemptions and some residents are exploring housing trusts and historic preservation to protect their land these things combined residents say

like what the united states will look like in 20 25 years said roger enriquez a university of texas san antonio criminal justice professor who directs the school s engagement with the city s west side the rest of the country needs to pay attention to what s happening here because it s almost a crystal ball into the future and what will happen if solutions aren t found san antonio officials realized in 2010 that the city of 1 5 million projected to grow by another million in less than 30 years was facing a housing shortage the city s military and medical industries and low cost living made it attractive it also was poised for spillover from the boom in austin located about 80 miles north advertisement article continues below this ad deputy city manager lori houston said years of neglect

a lot of concerns from the community and from council members developers received rebate deals for nearly everything they built forgoing taxes for up to 75 years and obtaining federal housing grants to develop public housing but most of the new housing including the affordable units built as a condition of receiving public money were priced above what most san antonians could afford according to a report from the national association of latino community asset builders the median household income for san antonians is 67 521 a year nearly 15 000 less than the national median beautification

question 1 dr marx you are well known as the author of a book on economics but i think you studied law at university didn t you karl marx although i studied jurisprudence i pursued it as a subject subordinated to philosophy and history in the year 1842 43 as editor of the rheinische zeitung i first found myself in the embarrassing position of having to discuss what is known as material interests the deliberations of the rhenish landtag on forest thefts and the division of landed property the first polemic started by herr von schaper then oberpresident of the rhine province against the rheinische zeitung about the condition of the moselle peasantry and finally the debates on free trade and protective tariffs caused me in the first instance to turn my attention to economic questions present day society q2 what as a result of the studies you then undertook would you say is the basis of present day society marx present day society is capitalist society which exists in all civilised countries more or less free from mediaeval admixture more or less modified by the particular historical development of each country more or less developed in present day society the instruments of labour are the monopoly of the land owners the monopoly of property in land is even the basis of the monopoly of capital and the capitalists the capitalist mode of production rests on the fact that the material conditions of production are in the hands of non workers in the form of property in capital and land while the masses are only owners of the personal conditions of productions of labour power q3 what would you say are the essential features of this capitalist society marx capitalist production is distinguished from the outset by two characteristic features first it produces products as commodities the fact that it produces commodities does not differentiate it from other modes of productions but rather the fact that being a commodity is the dominant and determining characteristic of its products this implies first and foremost that the labourer himself comes forward merely as a seller of commodities and thus as a free wage labourer so that labour appears in as wage labour the relation between capital and wage labour determines the entire character of the mode of production the principal agents of this mode of production itself the capitalist and the wage labourer are as such merely embodiments personifications of capital and wage labour the second distinctive feature of the capitalist mode of production is the production of surplus value as the direct aim and determining motive of production q4 you say that the relation between capital and wage labour determines the whole character of capitalism but how first would you define capital marx capital is a social relation of production it is a bourgeois production relation a production relation of bourgeois society capital consists not only of means of subsistence instruments of labour and raw materials not only of material products it consists just a much of exchange values all the products of which it consists are commodities capital is therefore not only a sum of material products it is a sum of commodities of exchange values of social magnitudes material wealth transforms itself into capital simply and solely because the worker sells his labour power in order to live the articles which are the material conditions of labour the means of production and the articles which are the precondition for the survival of the worker himself the means of subsistence both become capital only because of the phenomenon of wage labour capital is not a thing any more than money is a thing in capital as in money certain specific social relations of production between people appear as relations of things to people or else certain social relations appear as natural properties of things in society without a class dependent on wages the moment individuals confront each other as free persons there can be no production of surplus value without the production of surplus value there can be no capitalist production and hence no capital and no capitalist capital and wage labour it is thus we designate the labour of the worker of the worker who sells his own labour power only express two aspects of the self same relationship q5 but in some cases the means of production belong to the state does this make any difference to this basic relationship of capitalism marx the social capital is equal to the sum of the individual capitals including joint stock capital and also state capital in so far as governments employ productive wage labour in mines railways and so on and the function as industrial capitalists where the state itself is the capitalist producer as in the exploitation of mines woodlands and the like its product is commodity and for this reason possesses the specific character of every other commodity q6 how do you explain the origin of surplus value marx the value of a commodity is determined by the total quantity of labour contained in it but part of that quantity of labour is realised in a value for which an equivalent has been pain in the form of wages part of it realised in a value for which no equivalent has been paid part of the labour contained in the commodity is paid labour part is unpaid labour the surplus value or the part of the total value of the commodity in which the surplus labour or unpaid labour of the working man is realised i call profit it is the employing capitalist who immediately extracts from the labourer this surplus value whatever part of it he may ultimately be able to keep for himself upon this relation therefore between the employing capitalist and the wage labourer the whole wages system and the whole present system of production hinges q7 so you are saying that it is through the wages system that the workers are exploited marx wages are not what they appear to be namely the value or price of labour but only a masked form for the value or price of labour power the wage worker has permission to work for his own subsistence that is to live only in so far as he works for a certain time gratis for the capitalist and hence also for the latter s co consumer s of surplus value the whole capitalist system of production turns on the increase of this gratis labour by extending the working day or by developing the productivity consequently the system of wage labour is a system of slavery and indeed of a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social productive forces of labour develop whether the worker receives better or worse payment q8 but surely you are not saying that workers should not try to obtain better payment while capitalism lasts marx to clamour for equal or even equitable retribution on the basis of the wages system is the same as to clamour for freedom on the basis of the slavery system what you think just or equitable is out of the question the question is what is necessary and unavoidable with a given system of production the periodical resistance on the part of the working man against a reduction of wages and their periodical attempts at a rise in wages are inseparable from the wages system and dictated by the very fact of labour being assimilated to commodities and therefore subject to the laws regulating the general movement of prices the value of labour power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions whose importance for the english working class can scarcely be overestimated the trade unions aim a nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry trade unions work well as centres of resistance against the encroachments of capital they fail partially from an injurious use of their power they fail generally from limiting themselves to a guerrilla war against the effects of the existing system instead of simultaneously trying to change it instead of using their organised forces as a lever for the final emancipation of the working class that is to say the ultimate abolition of the wages system future society q9 clearly then the abolition of the wages system is one key feature of the socialist or as i believe you prefer to call it communist society which will achieve the emancipation of the working class but what else can be said about it marx the condition for the emancipation of the working class is the abolition of every class the working class in the course of its development will substitute for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and their antagonism and there will be no more political power properly so called since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonism in civil society within the co operative society based on common ownership of the means of production the producers do not exchange their products just as little does the labour employed on the products appear here as the value of these products as a material quality possessed by them there can therefore be nothing more erroneous and absurd than to postulate the control by the united individuals of their total production on the basis of exchange value of money the private exchange of all products of labour all activities and all wealth stands in antithesis to free exchange among individuals who are associated on the basis of common appropriation and control of the means of production if we were to consider a communist society in place of a capitalist one then money capital would immediately be done away with q10 so you are saying that the working class can only emancipate themselves by establishing a classless stateless and moneyless society but with regard to this last point you yourself are on record as mentioning labour time vouchers as a possible means of distributing consumer goods in the early stages of communist society is there not a contradiction here marx any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves if the material conditions of production are the co operative property of workers themselves then there likewise results a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present one with collective production money capital is completely dispensed with the society distributes labour power and means of production between the various branches of industry there is no reason why the producers should not receive paper tokens permitting them to withdraw an amount corresponding to their labour time from the social consumption stocks but these tokens are not money they do not circulate the certificate of labour is merely evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common labour and of his claim to a certain portion of the common product which has been set aside for consumption q11 but you are not claiming are you that such tickets or certificates would be a permanent or even an essential feature of a future classless society marx what we have to deal with here is a communist society not as it has developed on its own foundations but on the contrary just as it emerges from capitalist society which is thus in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges in a higher phase of communist of communist society after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour and herewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labour have vanished after labour has become not only a means of life but life s prime want after the productive forces have also increased with the all round development of the individual and all the springs of co operative wealth flow more abundantly only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners from each according to his ability to each according to his needs the period of revolution q12 the continuing development of the forces of production over the last hundred or so years means that communist society could now proceed almost immediately to this stage of free access but i want to move on to ask you about how you see the change over from capitalist to socialist or communist society taking place marx the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest by degrees all capital from the bourgeoisie to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state of the proletariat organised as the ruling class and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible q13 wait a minute let me stop you there what exactly do you mean by the phrase centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state of the proletariat organised as the working class in a previous reply you told us that socialism was a society without a state marx when attains government power its enemies and the old organisation of society has not yet vanished the proletariat still acts during the period of the struggle for the overthrow of the old society on the basis of that old society and hence also still moves within political forms which more or less belong to it it has not yet during this period of struggle attained its final constitution and employs means for its liberation which this liberation fall aside it can however only use such economic means as abolish its own character as salariat hence as a class with its complete victory its own rule thus ends as its class character has disappeared when in the course of development class distinctions have disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the public power will lose its political character in place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all q14 you are saying that to establish a classless stateless society the working class has first to organise to gain control of political power win the battle of democracy as you put it and use it to expropriate the capitalist class this seems reasonable enough even if today it could again be said that this period of revolution could be passed through very quickly precisely because the centralisation and development of the means of production has now reached such a high degree but how do you see the working class winning political power peaceably or violently marx the workers will have to seize political power one day in order to construct the new organisation of labour they will have to overthrow the old politics which bolster up the old institutions we do not claim however that the road leading to this goal is the same everywhere we know that heed must be paid to institutions customs and traditions of various countries and we do not deny that there are countries such as america and england where the workers may attain their goal by peaceful means that being the case we must recognise that in most continental countries the lever of the revolution will have to be force q15 today of course most continental countries have adopted the same political forms as america and britain but in any event won t socialism or communism have to be a world system marx united action of the leading civilised countries at least is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat empirically communism is only possible as an act of the dominant people all at once and simultaneously which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism moreover the mass of propertyless workers presupposes the world market through competition the proletariat can thus only exist world historically just as communism its activity can only have a world historical existence causes of crises q16 can we now perhaps turn to some current issues that are of immediate concern to people today first of all the present slump where we hear about there being over production of steel cars food and other goods marx the word over production in itself leads to error so long as the most urgent needs of a large part of society are not satisfied or only the most immediate needs are satisfied there can of course be absolutely no talk of an over production of products in the sense that the amount of products is excessive in relation to the need for them on the contrary it must be said that on the basis of capitalist production there is constant under production in this sense the limits to production are set by the profit of the capitalist and in no way by the needs of the producers but over production of products and over production of commodities are two entirely different things q17 yes that s clear enough but what do you think of the proposal put forward for instance by the labour party that the way out of the crisis is to increase spending marx the popular ascription of stagnation in the processes of production and circulation to an insufficiency of the circulating medium is a delusion it is pure tautology to say that crises are provoked by a lack of effective demand or effective consumption the capitalist system does not recognise any forms of consumer other than those who can pay if we exclude the consumption of paupers and swindlers the fact that commodities are unsaleable means no more than that no effective buyers have been found for them no consumers no matter whether the commodities are ultimately sold to meet the needs of productive or individual consumption if the attempt is made to give this tautology the semblance of greater profundity by the statement that the working class receives too small a portion of its own product and that the evil would be remedied if it received a bigger share if its wages rose we need only note that crises are always prepared by a period in which wages generally rise and the working class actually does receive a greater share in the part of the annual product destined for consumption from the standpoint of these advocates of sound and simple common sense such periods should rather avert the crisis it thus appears that capitalist production involves certain conditions independent of people s good or bad intentions which permit the relative prosperity of the working class only temporarily and moreover always the harbinger of crisis q18 what about the other aspects of crisis such as unemployment and falling real wages marx capitalistic production moves through certain periodical cycles it moves through a state of quiescence growing animation prosperity overtrade crisis and stagnation the market prices of commodities and the market rates of profits follow these phases now sinking below their average now rising above them well during the phase of sinking market prices and the phases of crisis and stagnation the working man if not thrown out of employment altogether is sure to have his wages lowered a surplus population of workers is a condition for the existence of the capitalist mode of production it forms a disposable industrial reserve army which belongs to capital just as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost capitalist production can by no means content itself with the quantity of disposable labour power which the natural increase of population yields it requires for its unrestricted activity an industrial reserve army which is independent of these natural limits taking them as a whole the general movements of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army and this in turn corresponds to the periodical alternations of the industrial cycle q19 lets now turn to the other big economic issue inflation what do you see as its cause and consequences marx here we are concerned only with inconvertible paper money issued by the state and given forced currency pieces of paper on which money names are printed such as 1 5 are thrown into the circulation process from outside by the state in so far as they actually circulate in place of the same amount of gold their movement is simply a reflection of the laws of monetary circulation itself a law peculiar to the circulation of paper money can only spring up from the proportion in which that money represents gold in simple terms the law referred to is as follows the issue of paper money must be restricted to the quantity of gold or silver which would actually be in circulation and which is represented symbolically by the paper money if the paper money exceeds its proper limit the amount in gold coins of the same denomination which could have been in circulation then quite apart from the danger of becoming universally discredited it will still represent within the world of commodities only that quantity of gold which is fixed by its immanent laws no greater quantity is capable of being represented if the quantity of paper money represents twice the amount of gold available then in practice 1 will be the money name not of 1 4 of an ounce of gold but of 1 8 of an ounce the effect is the same as if an alteration had taken place in the function of gold as the standard of prices the values previously expressed by the price of 1 would now be expressed by the price of 2 in such a case nothing would have changed either in the productive powers of labour or in supply or demand or in values nothing could have changed except the money names of those values to say that in such a case the workingman ought not to insist upon a proportionate rise of wages is to say that he must be content to be paid in names instead of things all past history proves that whenever such a depreciation of money occurs the capitalists are on the alert to seize this opportunity for defrauding the workingman q20 what do you think of the idea of cutting taxes as a way of trying to improve the workers position under capitalism marx if all taxes which bear on the working class were abolished root and branch the necessary consequence would be the reduction of wages by the whole amount of taxes which goes into them either the employers profit would rise as a direct consequence by the same quantity or else no more than an alteration in the form of tax collecting would have taken place instead of the present system whereby the capitalist also advances as part of the wage the taxes which the worker has to pay he would no longer pay them in this roundabout way but directly to the state ecology q21 finally there is a growing concern these days about pollution and the environment could you say something on this marx the capitalist mode of production completes the disintegration of the primitive familial union which bound agriculture and manufacture when they were both at an undeveloped and child like stage but at the same time it creates the material conditions for a new and higher synthesis a union of agriculture and industry on the basis of the forms that have developed during the period of their antagonistic isolation capitalist production collects the population together in great centres and causes the urban population to achieve an ever growing preponderance this has two results on the one hand it concentrates the historic motive power of society on the other hand it disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil thus it destroys at the same time the physical health of the urban worker and the intellectual life of the rural worker but by destroying the circumstances surrounding that metabolism which originated in a merely natural and spontaneous fashion it compels its systematic restoration as a regulative law of social production and in a form adequate to the full development of the human race moreover all progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art not only of robbing the worker but of robbing the soil all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress towards ruining the more long lasting sources of that fertility capitalist production therefore only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth the soil and the worker q22 would you like to address a special message to our readers marx it is the working millions of great britain who first have laid down the real basis of a new society modern industry which transformed the destructive agencies of nature into the productive power of man the english working classes with invincible energies by the sweat of their brows and brains have called to life the material means of ennobling labour itself and of multiplying its fruits in such a degree as to make general abundance possible by creating the inexhaustible productive powers of modern industry they have fulfilled the first condition of the emancipation of labour they have now to realise its other condition they have to free those wealth producing powers from the infamous shackles of monopoly and subject them to the joint control of the producers who till now allowed the very product of their hands to turn against them and transformed into as many instruments of their own subjugation the english working men are the first born sons of modern industry they will then certainly not be the last in aiding the social revolution prepared by that industry a revolution which means the emancipation of their own class all over the world which is as universal as capital rule and wage slavery sources every word in marx s replies is taken from his actual writings the only changes being to leave out in some cases introductory phrases or

leading figure in ukraine s pro european maidan movement who was killed fighting russians in the country s east earlier this month aged just 24 in front of the coffin draped in a yellow and blue ukrainian flag at the foot of a monument that overlooks the sprawling independence square in the capital people of all ages saluted his memory i think it is important to be here because he is a hero of ukraine and we must remember him dmytro ostrovsky a 17 year old high school student told afp the loss put a human face on the shared grief of ukrainians as the bloodshed continues the worst of the fighting continues to be in the eastern industrial donbas region with battles raging in villages outside the city of severodonetsk which russia has been trying to seize for weeks meanwhile british prime minister boris johnson have warned western allies to prepare for the long haul in ukraine as russian forces intensified their assault on ukrainian positions in the east of the country johnson writing in the sunday times newspaper called for sustained support for ukraine saying the country s foreign backers should hold their nerve to ensure it has the strategic endurance to survive and eventually prevail time is now the vital factor the british leader wrote in the 1 000 word article posted online on saturday night everything will depend on whether ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster than russia can renew its capacity to attack our task is to enlist time on ukraine s side to help he outlined a four point plan for constant funding and technical help levels of which should be maintained for years to come and potentially be increased and economic concerns amid global food and energy crises made worse by the conflict should not lead to a rushed settlement in ukraine said johnson who is battling inflation at 40 year highs at home and spiralling domestic fuel prices he added that allowing russian president vladimir putin to keep territory in ukraine would not lead to a more peaceful world such a travesty would be the greatest victory for aggression in europe since the second world war he said stoltenberg also appealed for continued support for ukraine telling germany s bild am sonntag newspaper that the supply of state of the art weaponry to ukrainian troops would increase the chance of liberating the eastern donbas region from russian control we must prepare for the fact that it could take years we must not let up in supporting ukraine he said even if the costs are high not only for military support also because of rising energy and food prices meanwhile germany announced emergency measures including increased use of coal to ensure it meets its energy needs after a drop in supply of russian gas to reduce gas consumption less gas must be used to generate electricity coal fired power plants will have to be used more instead the economy ministry said in a statement the move comes after moscow turned up the pressure last week on western allies sharply reducing flows of natural gas in its pipelines to western europe driving up energy prices gazprom said the supply reductions via the nord stream pipeline are the result of repair work but eu officials believe moscow is punishing allies of ukraine berlin s temporary return to coal marks a turnaround for chancellor olaf scholz s ruling coalition of social democrats greens and the liberal fdp which has vowed to wind down its coal usage by 2030 it s bitter but indispensable for reducing gas consumption economy and climate minister robert habeck said in a statement a law outlining the new measures is due to be adopted in the coming weeks he added they include an auction system for the sale of gas to manufacturers which according to the government will help bring down consumption by the powerful sector funding will also be released to finance the filling up of tanks before winter habeck stressed that the increased use of coal was only provisional in the face of the worsening situation in the gas market italian company eni joined qatar energy s project to expand production from the world s biggest natural gas field days after russia slashed supplies to italy eni

expected to come on line in 2026 it will help qatar increase its liquefied natural gas production by more than 60 percent by 2027 totalenergies chief executive patrick pouyanne told afp last week meanwhile central banks have ramped up their battle against runaway inflation a necessary remedy that could have the adverse side effect of tipping countries into recession analysts say just this past week the us federal reserve announced its biggest interest rate hike in almost 30 years followed by the fifth straight increase by the bank of england and the first in 15 years in switzerland this week was a first the craziest in my experience said frederick ducrozet chief economist at pictet wealth management the moves rattled stock markets as investors fear that while the rate increases are needed they could put the brakes on economic growth if the tightening of monetary policy becomes too aggressive recessions are increasingly likely as central banks race to dramatically raise rates before inflation spirals out of control said craig erlam an analyst at online trading platform oanda capital economics a research group said it does not anticipate a recession in the united states but the fed is deliberately tempering demand in order to reduce price pressures this is a difficult line to tread and there is clearly a risk that it goes too far and the economy tips into recession it said in a note emerging countries could be collateral victims from rate hikes the dollar rises when the us fed raises its rates a strong dollar will complicate debt repayments of countries with deficits which borrow often in that currency ducrozet said central banks had insisted last year that inflation was only transitory as prices were driven up by bottlenecks in supply chains after governments emerged from lockdowns but energy and food prices have soared in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine pushing inflation higher and prompting economists to lower the world s growth prospects for this year this has left central banks with no other choice but to move more aggressively than planned australia s central bank raised rates more than expected earlier this month while brazil last week lifted its benchmark rate for the 11th straight time more hikes are looming in the united states and europe but it is the swiss national bank that caused the biggest shock on thursday when it announced a rate increase of 0 5 percentage points the first since 2007 the snb had focused on keeping the swiss franc from being too strong until now the actions of the snb are notable in that they mark a significant shift in policy away from a very dovish position said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk the european central bank has been slower to act than its peers it is putting an end to its massive bond buying scheme and will finally raise rates next month for the first time in a decade the eurozone faces another problem the yields paid by its governments to borrow money have surged with indebted countries such as italy being charged a premium compared to germany a safer bet for investors this spread revived memories of the eurozone s debt crisis prompting the ecb to hold an emergency meeting on thursday after which it said it would design a tool to prevent further stress in the bond market the bank of japan bucked the global trend on friday as it stood by its decision not to raise its rate sending the yen close to the lowest level against the dollar since 1998 but even the bank of japan could adjust its policy said stephen innes managing partner at spi asset management boj members are considering public dissatisfaction with inflation and the rapid depreciation of the yen innes said while they plan to maintain the current easing policy they may look to make some tweaks to support the currency he said consumers will have to be patient before they see the rate hikes have an effect on prices ecb chief christine lagarde said it bluntly when announcing plans for a rate increase next month do we expect that july interest rate hikes will have an immediate effect on inflation the answer to that is no central banks do not have control over some of the problems that are lifting inflation such as soaring energy and food prices and the supply chain snarls capital economics said energy and food prices accounted for 4 1 percentage points of the 7 9 percent rise in consumer prices in major advanced economies over the past year it expects oil gas and agricultural commodity prices to start falling later this year which would bring inflation down sharply but core inflation rates will remain elevated earlier outside his butchery in the south of iran s capital ali cuts up a sheep carcass for customers who like him have seen

international monetary fund that was the year us president donald trump yanked washington out of a nuclear deal between iran and world powers and began reimposing biting sanctions sending the currency into a tailspin even before he unilaterally banned iran s oil exports hundreds of iranians have taken to the streets of several cities to protest against the spiralling prices on top of months long demonstrations by professionals and pensioners demanding wages and pensions be adjusted for inflation labour minister hojjatollah abdolmaleki stepped down in the hope of strengthening cooperation within the government and improving the provision of services to the people according to government spokesman ali bahadori jahromi but reformist newspaper etemad linked his resignation to heavy criticism from the protesting pensioners in tehran s marketplaces attention is focused on the consequences and effects of inflation rather than its causes president raisi pledged from the outset that

in this piece we will take a look at the ten best falling stocks to buy right now if you want to skip our introduction of the companies and the general economic outlook jump right ahead to 5 best falling stocks to buy right now the start of 2022 had a tinge of optimism to it global populations were finally able to take a small and careful sigh of relief after having dealt with a historic pandemic that upended economies livelihoods and families the start of the pandemic in early 2020 had seen major american stock markets bleed more than one third of their value as global lockdowns shattered demand and disrupted supply chains leaving investors wary about the future of their investments subsequently they exited shares and rushed towards safe haven investments such as gold and untried avenues such as cryptocurrencies however the small respite was short lived as soon after the new year kicked off russia invaded ukraine in the largest european invasion since the second world war initially believed to only be a short term affair the invasion is now entering the second half of 2022 and with it is damaging an already fragile economy given both countries importance to the global economy particularly in terms of commodities and energy exports inflation is surging to record levels and energy supply chains have once again become uncertain the effects of this latest crisis coupled with the united states federal reserve s plans to increase the interest rate are now taking their toll on the stock market and the economy in order to keep households afloat during the pandemic and stimulate the business environment the fed reduced its interest rate and handed out stimulus checks these injected trillions of dollars into the market and ended up significantly contributing to inflation now the rate increase will at least partly aim toward curbing inflation but at the same time it will harden the business environment as firms costs of borrowing particularly to finance working capital will also increase as a result the nasdaq composite stock index which consists of most of the stocks on the nasdaq exchange is down by more than 30 over the course of this year similarly the s p 500 index which consists of some of the leading companies in the world is down by 21 over the same time period others such as the dow jones industrial average and the new york stock exchange composite nyse have bled 16 and 15 of their values year to date respectively however the recent stock market bloodbath has a silver lining since the markets are dropping mostly due to economic concerns and a general sense of foreboding what this means is that some companies share prices are not indicative of their fundamentals in other words even if their share prices are dropping

for the last two weeks when i ve been trying to have a break in france and italy the stock market has made me toil harder than i wanted to that said i suspected the market was going to remain crazy mad with the fed likely to raise interest rates by 0 75 which of course it did last week given our market is now down 14 69 year to date and off about the same since late august last year at least we ve outperformed the yanks they ve seen their market slump over 23 to be in a bear market while we re only in a correction three big reasons explain this and here they are 1 inflation is worse in the us at 8 6 while ours is 5 1 2 the us economy looks more likely than ours to end up in a recession 3 the us stock market boomed excessively after the coronavirus crash with its tech stocks overbought which drove their share prices to ridiculous levels this powered the market up much more than our stock market so the fall of the s p 500 index had to be bigger right now the consensus view of those who really drive share prices short term is that the fed and other central banks will screw up these rate rises i e too many and too fast and they will create recessions this is a guess by a bunch of people who ve never been great at guessing when a recession comes last week jerome powell took a shot at economists fund managers and media critics who think he s a knucklehead and will create a recession powell argued that a soft non recession landing for the us economy is a good chance to get even with those who maintain the sell off of the stock market says the smarties there don t agree powell quoted famous us economist paul samuelson whose textbook i revered as a student and teaching academic many years ago the afr s us correspondent matt cranston captured it neatly with this after the biggest rate rise in 28 years federal reserve chairman jerome powell went to great lengths to convey what nobel prize winning economist paul samuelson said almost 60 years ago about predicting recessions samuelson quipped that us share market sell offs had correctly predicted nine of the last five american recessions the stock market and the bond market sometimes get it right and sometimes get it wrong and powell in the us and dr phil lowe here in oz have to raise interest rates judiciously to bring inflation down but they also have to avoid a recession that s a big task but they re the guys paid the big bucks to make it happen in case you re interested this is what they get dr phil lowe a 1 059 761 jerome powell us 203 500 gee you have to hope he has a great retirement package so what do we need to watch in the coming weeks and months because i can t see much relief from the stock market anxiety until some good news arrives like what try these 1 lower us inflation by the way amp s shane oliver says his us inflation pipeline indicator is telling us inflation is starting to fall in economics there are lags see how the red cpi inflation line is going up but the black pipeline inflation line is falling keep your fingers crossed that the cpi in june starts falling like the black pipeline line did in may and is doing now stock markets want to see inflation on a slide which will make them believe they ve been too negative on rate rises and stock prices 2 other economic data in the us and here needs to point to the fact that previous rate rises are scaring consumers and businesses falling house prices slower retail sales rising unemployment fewer job ads this slumping stock market and so on will make central banks less aggressive with rate rises they ve been trying to scare us into less spending to slow down the demand driven aspect of inflation 3 china completely out of lockdown and back to full normal production and exporting which will really cut into inflation 4 an end to the ukraine war which will bring down the price of oil and damn well bolster confidence especially in europe note this well if in a couple of months time the recent and maybe the next interest rate rise bumps into less cost push inflation from the problems in china and ukraine then stocks will spike in the latter part of 2022 history has shown that the s p 500 usually beats the annual inflation rate if the central bankers play a good game and china at least delivers cost reductions by avoiding more lockdowns then the us and us in oz might have the conditions to avoid a recession which will be great news for stocks by the way if the ukraine war can end it will give global and local normalcy a chance to reassert itself and normalcy will help bring down inflation as well last week a good back to normal indicator started to bob up with commsec reporting that in may provisionally there were 651 060 overseas arrivals to australia the most since covid 19 international border restrictions were imposed in march 2020 and there were 663 970 overseas departures from australia last month the most in over two years yep tourists are coming and some will be foreign workers which will help the tight job market that s pushing up wages and inflation also economists think we re starting to buy services again like in normal times which will mean we ll buy fewer tvs and other retail products which will lead to rising inventories in places like jb hi fi and harvey norman which will lead to price decreases and lower inflation if you don t believe me just look at this headline from reuters on may 27 last month u s retailers ballooning inventories set stage for deep discounts this kind of thing is good news for bringing down inflation slowing up interest rate rises and helping stocks to stop falling major u s retailers that recently scrambled to restock shelves amid product shortages disclosed this week that their stores are now packed with too much merchandise and some are even doing what was unthinkable just a few months ago discounting unsold goods brendan mcdermid reported that s how normalcy can help reduce inflation for those who think a recession is a done deal this is what a trained economist like shane oliver wrote on saturday we remain of the view that a global recession can be avoided but with central banks now hiking rates aggressively the risks have increased to the point that it s now close to 50 50 this stock market craziness mightn t end as soon as we d like but i bet it will be sooner rather than later which is what many are predicting

richmond va ap a gop sweep of virginia s 2021 statewide elections and particularly gov glenn youngkin s win appears to have energized the republican field in two of the country s most competitive u s house races tuesday s crowded republican congressional primaries in virginia s 2nd and 7th districts will settle who takes on centrist democrats elaine luria and abigail spanberger in november s general elections which in turn could help determine which party controls the u s house virginia republicans like their chances along with the party s resurgence last fall a redistricting process that refashioned virginia s congressional maps and a national political environment viewed as highly unfavorable to the party in power are also seen as factors that have led to vigorous gop competition for the seats the climate is so god awful for democrats i mean it s the worst maybe since 2010 maybe even worse republicans feel very emboldened said john whitbeck a former republican party of virginia chairman virginia s unusual off year 2021 statewide elections were closely watched as an early indication of what this year s midterms could portend along with flipping all three statewide offices republicans also took control of the state house animating the state s republicans after a nearly decadelong stretch of stinging losses for comparison s sake in 2018 when whitbeck stepped down from his role republicans had 14 candidates competing in four nomination contests this year the party had 37 candidates competing in eight districts republicans opted to settle several other nomination contests including an 11 way fight to run for a democratic leaning northern virginia district in party run processes in may the 2nd and 7th districts will be closely watched with general elections in both considered a tossup by the nonpartisan cook political report in the coastal 2nd district which includes the state s most populous city virginia beach four candidates are seeking the gop nomination to take on luria a retired navy commander who s cultivated a congressional identity as a centrist luria is serving on the jan 6 committee investigating the 2021 attack on the capitol luria flipped the district under its previous competitive boundaries in 2018 under its new boundaries youngkin won it by more than 11 points according to an analysis by the nonpartisan virginia public access project her four potential opponents are all veterans as well they include tommy altman a virginia beach tattoo shop owner andy baan a former prosecutor who retired as a captain from the navy and jarome bell a retired navy chief petty officer who calls himself the maga candidate the three men appear to face an uphill climb against state sen jen kiggans a nurse practitioner and navy veteran who has served in the state legislature since 2020 and has a hefty fundraising lead plus the backing of the congressional leadership fund a super pac dedicated to electing house republicans in an entirely rebooted 7th congressional district which shifted away from the richmond suburbs and now covers a stretch between charlottesville and the washington suburbs the gop nomination fight to compete against spanberger appears more wide open a former cia officer spanberger also flipped a competitive gop held seat in 2018 and is now competing under lines that youngkin would have won according to virginia public access project s analysis bryce reeves who has served in the state legislature since 2012 and previously ran for statewide office got into the race with plenty of name recognition he s facing a challenge from derrick anderson a former green beret who has nearly kept pace in fundraising and yesli vega a local elected official with law enforcement experience who s picked up high profile endorsements also in the race are crystal vanuch and david ross who serve on local boards of supervisors and gina ciarcia an educator who has trailed the pack in fundraising monica robinson a spokesperson for the democratic congressional campaign committee said the republican candidates had spent months running to the right the only thing these candidates have shown is that they are too extreme to survive a general election against two of the strongest women in congress she said jimmy frost 57 a lowe s salesman who s active in virginia beach republican politics said he thinks the nation s problems which he blames on democrats helped feed the long list of republican candidates frost who said he s backing bell because he thinks he will tell constituents the unvarnished truth said luria should be ready to face voters who are angry their kids can t find baby formula for their grandkids they can t afford gasoline to get their kids where they need to go they don t know how much it s going to cost to go to the grocery store today or next week they don t know what interest rates are going to do there s a lot of people who are walking around going oh my god what s next he said without a primary challenge of their own spanberger and luria will almost certainly start the general election season with enormous fundraising leads luria reported nearly 3 4 million cash on hand june 1 spanberger reported 4 3 million youngkin hasn t endorsed in either race nor has trump whose false claims of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election have continued to percolate through both primaries bell has called for executing anyone involved in what he claims is widespread fraud kiggans recently declined to say in a new york times interview whether she believed president joe biden had won and no candidate but bell responded to virginia public media queries about whether they would have voted to certify the 2020 results he said he would not in may the democratic party of virginia released a video highlighting every 7th district candidate but vanuch being asked about the violent jan 6 assault on the capitol each declined to call it an insurrection tom davis a former u s congressman from northern virginia who has endorsed vega said he doubted whether jan 6 focused messaging would resonate in the general election at a time when voters are facing historic inflation and a tanking stock market i m not saying it s unimportant i m just saying voters don t seem to be that interested in it he said

the 16th president of the united states abraham lincoln once said a house divided against itself cannot stand he was right and so the recently concluded summit of the americas raises a good question can the house of the americas stand firm given its growing cracks in the lead up to the meeting which took place in los angeles california on june 6 10 the u s announced it would not be inviting cuba nicaragua and venezuela to the gathering due to these countries human rights records the move prompted the leaders of some latin american and caribbean lac countries to either dispatch lower level

badly we ve managed relations with our neighbors brett bruen a former u s diplomat who served as director of global engagement under the barack obama administration tweeted on june 8 the actual number

polarization due to economic problems and the situation generated by the covid 19 pandemic the united states has not yet recovered said roberto zepeda a researcher with the center for research on north america at the national autonomous university of mexico adding that like previous administrations the current u s administration is looking abroad to divert attention despite washington s efforts as a host the summit showed the diminishing u s leadership in the region and how much progress remains to be made in areas such as integration and cooperation zepeda told xinhua news agency a woman protests against the u s refusal to invite the leaders from cuba nicaragua and venezuela to the u s hosted summit of the americas in los angeles california on june 10 xinhua fading influence the first summit of the americas took place in 1994 with the subsequent ones being held every three or four years the third summit held in canada in 2001 adopted the inter american democratic charter which stipulates that only democratic countries are eligible to participate in the organization of american states jiang shixue director of the center for latin american studies at shanghai university told beijing review that the emphasis on ideology and common values has long characterized the diplomatic strategies of successive u s presidents nothing illustrates this better than joe biden s decision to not invite the three countries under the pretext of attendees having to meet u s standards of democracy this practice is similar to the so called summit for democracy jiang said adding that democracy is merely a tool for the u s to challenge any opposition at the summit of the americas and then turn it into the summit of america a platform from which to lecture other countries i am not going to the summit because not all american countries are invited and i believe there is a need to change the policy that has been in place for centuries the exclusion the desire to dominate without reason the disrespect for countries sovereignty the independence of each country mexican president andrã s manuel lã³pez obrador a key latin american leader on the gathering s invitee list said at a news conference in mexico city on june 6 it shows the deep divisions across the continent said martha bã rcena former mexican ambassador to the u s she pointed out that the leaders who decided against attending were challenging u s influence because has been diminishing in the continent biden should prioritize dialogue rather than exclusion and commonalities instead of arbitrary notions of difference to keep the house of the americas intact according to david castrillã³n kerrigan a researcher and professor at the universidad externado de colombia should he fail to do so the standing of the u s in the region will further weaken he wrote in an article on china daily the u s wanted to use the summit as an opportunity to compensate for its inadequate attention to latin america in recent years however we are living in a multipolar world in which the u s cannot act as it has in the past not even in a region considered to be within its sphere of influence zepeda said during the gathering the u s proposed the americas partnership for economic prosperity an economic recovery plan to be developed only with its most trusted partners which distorts the continental character it purports luis ricardo delgado a professor of social sciences at venezuela s university of carabobo told xinhua the limited scope of the plan is a direct result of the fact that the u s insists on injecting ideology into its international ties he said as a consequence the summit does not substantially modify the current status quo of international relations in the hemisphere so its impact will be practically nil he added a migrant caravan continues its trek to the u s mexico border advancing along mexico s southern caribbean coast on june 7 visual people standing on their own as the first major diplomatic event targeting lac countries since the biden administration took office in early 2021 there was a significant division in expectations between the two sides from the very beginning and the structural conflicts of one trying to dominate the region with others trying to reject this have become a true portrayal of this summit said zhang jieyu a researcher with the department for latin american and caribbean studies at the china institute of international studies ciis argentine president alberto fernã ndez said at the summit that the silence of those who are absent is calling to us and insisted that the host country did not have the power to impose the right of admission we definitely would have wished for a different summit of the americas he added under the pressures of covid 19 and the spillover effects of the russia ukraine conflict many lac countries are facing severe challenges in economic recovery inflation control public health and poverty reduction said qian feng director of the research department at the national strategy institute at tsinghua university what these countries were expecting was for the u s to offer more favorable market access loans and aid to help them tide over difficulties what they need now is real respect and equality but the u s merely cares about its own interests qian added washington s economic recovery proposal aims to mobilize new investments in the region fortify supply chains promote decarbonization and biodiversity facilitate inclusive trade and update the social contract between governments and their people u s political news outlet politico reported noting that these priorities are unlikely to satisfy the desire among lac countries for more trade access to the u s donald trump offered the growth in the americas initiative in 2019 then biden touted his build back better world plan and now it s this new economic package but will those policies truly become effective it remains to be seen jiang said u s aid policies toward lac countries have always proven discontinuous and it is highly doubtful the new initiative can be realized according to zhang of ciis the country has long pursued the america first approach in dealing with international affairs giving short shrift to the interests of other countries in the region she added for example last year when people in lac countries were in urgent need of vaccines amid the covid 19 pandemic the u s refused to share its vaccines even though it had a surplus of stocks that were about to expire we are living in a different world there are new institutions new rules and that is what we are experiencing today mexican political scientist eduardo roldã n told xinhua the u s is going to have to understand that it has neglected latin america and we are not its backyard latin america is giving itself respect in 2011 33 lac countries announced the creation of the community of latin american and caribbean states which naturally excludes the u s and canada demonstrating the determination of those countries to stand on their own print edition title summit of discontent copyedited by elsbeth van paridon

woman protests against the u s refusal to invite the leaders from cuba nicaragua and venezuela to the u s hosted summit of the americas in los angeles california on june 10 xinhua fading influence the first summit of the americas took place in 1994 with the subsequent ones being held every three or four years the third summit held in canada in 2001 adopted the inter american democratic charter which stipulates that only democratic countries are eligible to participate in the organization of american states jiang shixue director of the center for latin american studies at shanghai university told beijing review that the emphasis on ideology and common values has long characterized the diplomatic strategies of successive u s presidents nothing illustrates this better than joe biden s decision to not invite the three countries under the pretext of attendees having to meet u s standards of democracy this practice is similar to the so called summit for democracy jiang said adding that democracy is merely a tool for the u s to challenge any opposition at the summit of the americas and then turn it into the summit of america a platform from which to lecture other countries i am not going to the summit because not all american countries are invited and i believe there is a need to change the policy that has been in place for centuries the exclusion the desire to dominate without reason the disrespect for countries sovereignty the independence of each country mexican president andrã s manuel lã³pez obrador a key latin american leader on the gathering s invitee list said at a news conference in mexico city on june 6 it shows the deep divisions across the continent said martha bã rcena former mexican ambassador to the u s she pointed out that the leaders who decided against attending were challenging u s influence because has been diminishing in the continent biden should prioritize dialogue rather than exclusion and commonalities instead of arbitrary notions of difference to keep the house of the americas intact according to david castrillã³n kerrigan a researcher and professor at the universidad externado de colombia should he fail to do so the standing of the u s in the region will further weaken he wrote in an article on china daily the u s wanted to use the summit as an opportunity to compensate for its inadequate attention to latin america in recent years however we are living in a multipolar world in which the u s cannot act as it has in the past not even in a region considered to be within its sphere of influence zepeda said during the gathering the u s proposed the americas partnership for economic prosperity an economic recovery plan to be developed only with its most trusted partners which distorts the continental character it purports luis ricardo delgado a professor of social sciences at venezuela s university of carabobo told xinhua the limited scope of the plan is a direct result of the fact that the u s insists on injecting ideology into its international ties he said as a consequence the summit does not substantially modify the current status quo of international relations in the hemisphere so its impact will be practically nil he added a migrant caravan continues its trek to the u s mexico border advancing along mexico s southern caribbean coast on june 7 visual people standing on their own as the first major diplomatic event targeting lac countries since the biden administration took office in early 2021 there was a significant division in expectations between the two sides from the very beginning and the structural conflicts of one trying to dominate the region with others trying to reject this have become a true portrayal of this summit said zhang jieyu a researcher with the department for latin american and caribbean studies at the china institute of international studies ciis argentine president alberto fernã ndez said at the summit that the silence of those who are absent is calling to us and insisted that the host country did not have the power to impose the right of admission we definitely would have wished for a different summit of the americas he added under the pressures of covid 19 and the spillover effects of the russia ukraine conflict many lac countries are facing severe challenges in economic recovery inflation control public health and poverty reduction said qian feng director of the research department at the national strategy institute at tsinghua university what these countries were expecting was for the u s to offer more favorable market access loans and aid to help them tide over difficulties what they need now is real respect and equality but the u s merely cares about its own interests qian added washington s economic recovery proposal aims to mobilize new investments in the region fortify supply chains promote decarbonization and biodiversity facilitate inclusive trade and update the social contract between governments and their people u s political news outlet politico reported noting that these priorities are unlikely to satisfy the desire among lac countries for more trade access to the u s donald trump offered the growth in the americas initiative in 2019 then biden touted his build back better world plan and now it s this new economic package but will those policies truly become effective it remains to be seen jiang said u s aid policies toward lac countries have always proven discontinuous and it is highly doubtful the new initiative can be realized according to zhang of ciis the country has long pursued the america first approach in dealing with international affairs giving short shrift to the interests of other countries in the region she added for example last year when people in lac countries were in urgent need of vaccines amid the covid 19 pandemic the u s refused to share its vaccines even though it had a surplus of stocks that were about to expire we are living in a different world there are new institutions new rules and that is what we are experiencing today mexican political scientist eduardo roldã n told xinhua the u s is going to have to understand that it has neglected latin america and we are not its backyard latin america is giving itself respect in 2011 33 lac countries announced the creation of the community of latin american and caribbean states which naturally excludes the u s and canada demonstrating the determination of those countries to stand on their own print edition title summit of discontent copyedited by elsbeth van paridon

washington a bipartisan group of senators said sunday that it has an agreement in principle on gun control legislation though the lawmakers did not provide specific and detailed legislation families are scared and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities a group of 20 senators said in a statement that outlined their plan ten of the signers were republicans the number needed to break a gop filibuster on the package the group said its plan increases needed mental health resources improves school

agreement a good first step and added that we must move swiftly to advance this legislation because if a single life can be saved it is worth the effort the proposal is vastly more limited than changes pushed by president joe biden to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines add universal background checks and raise the minimum age to buy guns to 21 years old still he urged immediate passage in both chambers obviously it does not do everything that i think is needed biden said but it reflects important steps in the right direction and would be the most significant gun safety

doesn t get everything he asked for white house senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky issued a tepid statement praising the work of negotiators but not specifically endorsing their proposal i

for the republicans who signed the proposal four of the 10 gop senators are retiring this year another five are not up for re election until 2026 the 10th romney often goes his own way murphy an especially vocal proponent of new gun laws since the 2012 mass killings at an elementary school in his home state of connecticut called the deal a breakthrough agreement on gun violence the first in 30 years that will save lives what s in the gun legislation deal the group said its proposal includes support for state crisis intervention investment in children and family mental health services protections for victims of domestic violence funding for school based mental health and supportive services funding for school safety resources clarification of definition of federally licensed firearms dealer telehealth investments penalties for straw purchasing the plan also calls for an enhanced review process for young gun buyers for buyers under 21 years of age requires an investigative period to review juvenile and mental health records including checks with state databases and local law enforcement the statement said house action on gun bills house lawmakers voted last week to raise from 18 to 21 the minimum age to buy semi automatic rifles following a day of poignant testimony from survivors of mass shootings including a fourth grader a mother taking care of her wounded son and parents who lost a 10 year old daughter the house approved on a party line vote the age change as part of a package of gun reform measures that also would clamp down on gun trafficking ban bump stocks and require safe storage of firearms the bill known as the protecting our kids act heads to the senate where it s not expected to pass because republicans have enough votes to block gun legislation rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y told cnn s state of the union on sunday that all options on the table must be looked at closely regarding guns i think we need to really look at the text and once we look at that text i think we ll be able to see if this legislation has been responsibly put together and i hope it is my hope that it has been ocasio cortez said she hopes to vote yes on the gun legislation deal announced sunday from a group of senators rep chris jacobs r n y a longtime supporter of gun ownership is in favor of some gun controls including raising the minimum age to

experience what happened in my city and what happened with all those beautiful children down in uvalde he said reaction from both sides the national rifle association did not comment in detail saying in a statement that it does not take positions on frameworks and adding that we will make our position known when the full text of the bill is available for review the nra also said it will continue to oppose any effort to insert gun control policies initiatives that override constitutional due process protections and efforts to deprive law abiding citizens of their fundamental right to protect themselves and their loved ones into this or any other legislation vice president kamala harris praised the bipartisan group of senators who put the safety gun proposal together on sunday calling it an important step toward saving lives this gun safety proposal is an important step toward saving lives harris said while it does not reflect everything we need to do i applaud senator chris murphy

a farmer harvests wheat in nanyang city china s henan province may 22 2022 since the beginning of the year global grain prices have been at high levels leading to a rise in the domestic grain cpi consumer price index of 2 7 percent year on year a record not seen since 2016 it is a result not much beyond expectations after the conflict between russia and ukraine broke out as the two counties are major suppliers of wheat and corn in 2021 russia s wheat and corn exports accounted for 22 percent and 3 percent respectively of global total while ukraine s stood at 11 percent and 17 percent based on this we believe future changes of output and exports from the two countries will undoubtedly continue to weigh on the global grain market in terms of wheat the conflict has affected spring planting in ukraine the country s 2022 23 wheat output is expected to fall to 21 5 million metric tons down 11 5 million tons from 2021 22 global output is expected to be 774 8 million tons for the 2022 23 period down 4 5 million tons from 2021 22 by the end of 2022 23 there will be a 5 percent loss in global wheat stocks which will then fall to 267 million tons the lowest level in six years in terms of corn global production is expected to fall from 1 22 billion tons in 2021 22 to 1 18 billion tons in 2022 23 a decrease of some 2 9 percent this is mainly due to production declines in ukraine and the united states inventories of corn are expected to fall 1 4 percent to 305 1 million tons by the end of 2022 23 worsened forecasts for wheat and corn have been well reflected by the market from january to may international spot prices for the two commodities once jumped more than 30 percent and the absolute price level has exceeded the level seen in 2008 when an earlier food crisis emerged there are fears that worrying effects brought by global price surges may further drive the domestic cpi indeed the rise of international food prices has affected domestic food prices but how much of an impact will there be to answer this there are two factors to consider one is the import reliance of china on certain products and the other is the gap between domestic production and demand based on this we can divide the main food crops rice wheat corn and soybeans into three categories based on china s dependence and price transmission from global to domestic markets in simple terms price transmission is a change in one price that causes a corresponding price change generally it is measured in terms of transmission elasticity defined as the percentage change in the price in one market given a 1 percent change in the price in another market first is soybeans china relies heavily on soybean imports and they normally constitute more than 80 percent of domestic soybean consumption soybean prices in china basically follow the fluctuations in international prices since 2021 price transmission from the global soybean market to the domestic soybean market is between 85 percent and 100 percent second are corn and wheat since 2020 due to declines in planting acreage and an increase in demand for livestock feed domestic imports of the two soft commodities have surged significantly in 2020 21 imports of corn and wheat took up 10 percent and 7 percent respectively in terms of domestic consumption while in 2019 the figures were just 3 percent and 4 percent import pressure pushed up domestic prices of the two crops since 2021 price transmission from the global corn and wheat markets to the domestic market has been between 10 percent and 30 percent third is rice a commodity for which china is virtually self sufficient imports of rice only account for 3 percent of the nation s total demand and are mainly used to meet tastes for exotic varieties therefore domestic rice prices are relatively independent and mainly follow minimum purchase price factors the price sees very little influence from the international market from january to may international rice prices have surged 19 percent while domestic prices edged up only 3 percent in china consumption of wheat and rice makes up the bulk of total edible grain consumption looking at china s grain consumption structure in 2021 the consumption ratio of edible wheat and rice is about 80 percent which is significantly higher than that of corn and soybeans which are 3 percent and 28 percent respectively over the same period therefore from the perspective of the trend of the grain cpi it mainly depends on the fluctuation of wheat and rice prices historically when rising food prices have clearly pushed up domestic inflation rice and wheat prices have always seen sharp simultaneous jumps the weight of food in the cpi basket is about 2 percent not a very high proportion so when food prices fluctuate sharply the impact it has on inflation will be relatively low since 2000 the impact of food prices on the cpi once reached 1 percent in 2004 a time when prices of rice and wheat both rose sharply ranging from 40 percent to 50 percent and the food cpi rose by 34 percent at present domestic rice prices are at historically low levels as adjusted for incomes and inflation and act as a significant stabilizer to dampen the impact of rising food prices on inflation on the one hand being asia the main rice cultivation area rice prices are not directly affected by the russia ukraine conflict according to estimates by the us department of agriculture in may global rice production in 2022 23 will increase and global inventories will reach new highs on the other hand the amount of government held stocks is also at low levels indicating that the actual supply of domestic rice is relatively sufficient for wheat first there is always a certain loss in the transmission of international wheat price surges to the domestic market and second this year there is an expansion of wheat production narrowing the gap between domestic production and demand and the inventory to consumption ratio is also higher than in the previous year which also helps stabilize domestic wheat prices therefore assuming that under extreme circumstances if international wheat prices rise again by 100 percent in the near future which may trigger a surge in domestic flour prices by 10 20 percent due to stable domestic rice prices the grain cpi will rise by 5 10 percent pulling up the cpi by 0 1 0 2 percentage point a relatively manageable outcome for corn its consumption by humans is relatively low less than 5 percent of the total and that for livestock feeding purposes is as high as 60 70 percent therefore the impact of global corn price surges is mainly reflected by the price of meat products such as pork and that on the cpi is indirect and minor from january to may global corn prices rose 24 percent while domestic prices increased 6 percent although the domestic corn inventory consumption ratio has remained at a low level since 2019 due to continuous reductions of live pig production capacity since the second half of last year there has been a decrease in feed demand thus domestic corn prices did not increase significantly in the first half however with the expected further increase in pig prices in the third quarter profits among breeders may gradually return to the black and corresponding demand in the sector will improve accordingly driving the increase in domestic demand for corn providing that there is still a gap between supply and demand of global corn it s necessary to pay close attention to upward pressure on domestic corn prices going forward the writers are gao ruidong chief macroeconomist at everbright securities and liu xingchen an analyst with everbright securities the views don t necessarily reflect

table but may not go lower jai bala a war does not necessarily mean that the markets will go down the markets actually could go up in this kind of a situation and the reason of course is that the governments start spending on defence and other things and companies grow in the face of this spending so there is a bullish market it is an interesting phenomenon a war does not necessarily mean a bear market it means actually a bull market says founder mark mobius india is in a very good spot now because the indian macro environment is pretty favourable for the long term perspective i would say india is in a take off stage because incomes are rising economic growth is very good and technology is having a very important impact on the indian economy and the indian population in general i would say india is in a very sweet spot the central banks around the world starting with the fed tend to take a heavy handed approach because they have a model which tells them that to control inflation they have to raise interest rates higher than the measure of inflation that they are using of course there is a big question mark against this measure of inflation as i have pointed out in my book the inflation myth but anyway let us assume that the inflation rate is corrected in america and it is 8 5 plus which means that real rate has to be positive and the fed will have to raise rates above 8 5 that is 9 9 5 or whatever till the inflation rates comes down so i would say we are looking at higher and higher rates and i am frankly surprised that people are shocked by the three quarters of a percent rise that the fed just has instituted it is not surprising to me at all they are headed for 9 we have to get ready for that however now the most important point is that high interest rates do not kill markets stock markets can go up in the face of high interest rates temporarily there will be some impact but in the long run bull markets often are accompanied by high interest rates and rising interest rates i might add not really and the reason why you have to look at this carefully is the differentiation between various kinds of companies we are going to see winners and losers in any kind of situation the winners will be those companies that have a high return on capital have low or no debt and have earnings growth they get earnings growth as a result of pricing power in an environment like this high debt companies will go under and their market will be taken over by the leaders these leaders then will have pricing power and will be able to raise prices in line with or even higher than inflation so that is one of the explanations why markets go up even in the face of high interest rates because the index is made up of large companies and their pricing power go up in these times there is no question that there is a big risk of a nuclear war it is a risk that has been with us all the time because so many countries now have nuclear weapons and mistakes can be made this is something we have to look at very carefully i recently did a little study looking at the korean war the vietnam war and world war ii during all these wars the s p500 was going up not down a war does not necessarily mean that the markets will go down the markets actually could go up in this kind of a situation and the reason of course is that the governments start spending on defence and other things and companies grow in the face of this spending so there is a bullish market it is an interesting phenomenon a war does not necessarily mean a bear market it means actually a bull market we probably have more to go nasdaq for example is down more than 30 and of course one has to pay attention to the cryptocurrencies many of us do not realise how many people around the world are looking and invested i use the word invested very carefully in cryptocurrencies when cryptocurrencies go down a lot of people feel poor and bitcoin as a leading cryptocurrency is down dramatically it is down further than the s p or any other index and it is kind of leading indicator given that i believe that the other indices the s p nasdaq could go down more but then we will have balmy effect and the next bull market will begin so it is a great opportunity to buy bargains but you have to be careful and make sure you have companies with a high return on capital pricing power and earnings growth potential and no debt nobody can predict markets and i am not the first to try to predict any market but i would say cryptos have to go down more crypto is kind of a religion it is a faith when people begin to lose faith then there is nothing left there are no dividends there is no interest being paid there are no assets except something on the internet so when people lose faith it can go down much lower and can go to zero at the end of the day we have to watch the space very carefully because there are millions if not billions of people who have bought cryptocurrencies and that is the only thing they have bought they have not bought anything else they have not bought stocks they have not bought bonds they believe that this is the next great thing and they are going to be out and they are going to be very unhappy it is very important and india is probably a very good example the current leadership is forward looking exhibiting credible ways they have adopted and spread technology to every corner of the country it is an incredible development and it is quite mind boggling they have done an incredible job this is one of the impetus for growth in india as i see going forward leadership is very critical and the rule of law is very important i hate to use george soros words but an open society is very critical i believe because an open society results in creativity and innovation and that is what is really driving the growth of india and other countries around the world

a farmer harvests wheat in nanyang city china s henan province may 22 2022 since the beginning of the year global grain prices have been at high levels leading to a rise in the domestic grain cpi consumer price index of 2 7 percent year on year a record not seen since 2016 it is a result not much beyond expectations after the conflict between russia and ukraine broke out as the two counties are major suppliers of wheat and corn in 2021 russia s wheat and corn exports accounted for 22 percent and 3 percent respectively of global total while ukraine s stood at 11 percent and 17 percent based on this we believe future changes of output and exports from the two countries will undoubtedly continue to weigh on the global grain market in terms of wheat the conflict has affected spring planting in ukraine the country s 2022 23 wheat output is expected to fall to 21 5 million metric tons down 11 5 million tons from 2021 22 global output is expected to be 774 8 million tons for the 2022 23 period down 4 5 million tons from 2021 22 by the end of 2022 23 there will be a 5 percent loss in global wheat stocks which will then fall to 267 million tons the lowest level in six years in terms of corn global production is expected to fall from 1 22 billion tons in 2021 22 to 1 18 billion tons in 2022 23 a decrease of some 2 9 percent this is mainly due to production declines in ukraine and the united states inventories of corn are expected to fall 1 4 percent to 305 1 million tons by the end of 2022 23 worsened forecasts for wheat and corn have been well reflected by the market from january to may international spot prices for the two commodities once jumped more than 30 percent and the absolute price level has exceeded the level seen in 2008 when an earlier food crisis emerged there are fears that worrying effects brought by global price surges may further drive the domestic cpi indeed the rise of international food prices has affected domestic food prices but how much of an impact will there be to answer this there are two factors to consider one is the import reliance of china on certain products and the other is the gap between domestic production and demand based on this we can divide the main food crops rice wheat corn and soybeans into three categories based on china s dependence and price transmission from global to domestic markets in simple terms price transmission is a change in one price that causes a corresponding price change generally it is measured in terms of transmission elasticity defined as the percentage change in the price in one market given a 1 percent change in the price in another market first is soybeans china relies heavily on soybean imports and they normally constitute more than 80 percent of domestic soybean consumption soybean prices in china basically follow the fluctuations in international prices since 2021 price transmission from the global soybean market to the domestic soybean market is between 85 percent and 100 percent second are corn and wheat since 2020 due to declines in planting acreage and an increase in demand for livestock feed domestic imports of the two soft commodities have surged significantly in 2020 21 imports of corn and wheat took up 10 percent and 7 percent respectively in terms of domestic consumption while in 2019 the figures were just 3 percent and 4 percent import pressure pushed up domestic prices of the two crops since 2021 price transmission from the global corn and wheat markets to the domestic market has been between 10 percent and 30 percent third is rice a commodity for which china is virtually self sufficient imports of rice only account for 3 percent of the nation s total demand and are mainly used to meet tastes for exotic varieties therefore domestic rice prices are relatively independent and mainly follow minimum purchase price factors the price sees very little influence from the international market from january to may international rice prices have surged 19 percent while domestic prices edged up only 3 percent in china consumption of wheat and rice makes up the bulk of total edible grain consumption looking at china s grain consumption structure in 2021 the consumption ratio of edible wheat and rice is about 80 percent which is significantly higher than that of corn and soybeans which are 3 percent and 28 percent respectively over the same period therefore from the perspective of the trend of the grain cpi it mainly depends on the fluctuation of wheat and rice prices historically when rising food prices have clearly pushed up domestic inflation rice and wheat prices have always seen sharp simultaneous jumps the weight of food in the cpi basket is about 2 percent not a very high proportion so when food prices fluctuate sharply the impact it has on inflation will be relatively low since 2000 the impact of food prices on the cpi once reached 1 percent in 2004 a time when prices of rice and wheat both rose sharply ranging from 40 percent to 50 percent and the food cpi rose by 34 percent at present domestic rice prices are at historically low levels as adjusted for incomes and inflation and act as a significant stabilizer to dampen the impact of rising food prices on inflation on the one hand being asia the main rice cultivation area rice prices are not directly affected by the russia ukraine conflict according to estimates by the us department of agriculture in may global rice production in 2022 23 will increase and global inventories will reach new highs on the other hand the amount of government held stocks is also at low levels indicating that the actual supply of domestic rice is relatively sufficient for wheat first there is always a certain loss in the transmission of international wheat price surges to the domestic market and second this year there is an expansion of wheat production narrowing the gap between domestic production and demand and the inventory to consumption ratio is also higher than in the previous year which also helps stabilize domestic wheat prices therefore assuming that under extreme circumstances if international wheat prices rise again by 100 percent in the near future which may trigger a surge in domestic flour prices by 10 20 percent due to stable domestic rice prices the grain cpi will rise by 5 10 percent pulling up the cpi by 0 1 0 2 percentage point a relatively manageable outcome for corn its consumption by humans is relatively low less than 5 percent of the total and that for livestock feeding purposes is as high as 60 70 percent therefore the impact of global corn price surges is mainly reflected by the price of meat products such as pork and that on the cpi is indirect and minor from january to may global corn prices rose 24 percent while domestic prices increased 6 percent although the domestic corn inventory consumption ratio has remained at a low level since 2019 due to continuous reductions of live pig production capacity since the second half of last year there has been a decrease in feed demand thus domestic corn prices did not increase significantly in the first half however with the expected further increase in pig prices in the third quarter profits among breeders may gradually return to the black and corresponding demand in the sector will improve accordingly driving the increase in domestic demand for corn providing that there is still a gap between supply and demand of global corn it s necessary to pay close attention to upward pressure on domestic corn prices going forward the writers are gao ruidong chief macroeconomist at everbright securities and liu xingchen an analyst with everbright securities the views don t necessarily reflect

skip to comments 2022 us expat trends survey posted on by markomalley every year greenback surveys us expats on key aspects of life abroad this year over 3 200 us citizens living in 121 countries shared their opinions on us expat taxes foreign financial reporting the coronavirus pandemic remote work and more why do expats live abroad the majority of expats choose to live abroad for their career significant other or their love of adventure and travel 28 job relocation 33 significant other 16 adventure love of travel many expats feel burdened by us tax obligations because the majority of the world s nations use a system of residence based taxation most us expats are required to pay taxes in their host country despite this most also have to pay taxes to the us government on the same income due to the us s practice of citizenship based taxation this taxation method has caused the expat community to feel extremely excluded 86 feel like their concerns are less likely to be addressed by the us government than us citizens living in the usa the us government has put several measures in place to help avoid double taxation but all expats must still file an annual return and many still have to pay a us tax bill 77 don t think they should have to pay us taxes while living abroad 10 were feeling worried about filing their us tax return this year 30 owed money to the us government last year 53 did not owe and 13 received a refund excerpt read more at greenbacktaxservices com topics business economy government society keywords the bottom line 40 find filing us taxes too great of a burden 15 are concerned about the current political climate 12 have married a non us citizen abroad 10 are disappointed in the direction of the us government 10 don t have strong ties to the us 8 have difficulty working with foreign banks as an american citizen my comment i am an expat living abroad and have experienced each one of those reasons listed above while i don t have any intention of renouncing citizenship i can t blame anybody for doing so do you people realize that there is literally only one other country in the world that has citizenship based taxation eritrea all other countries tax people who live inside the country and basically leave their country s citizens who live abroad alone i ve heard a lot of people say that they don t want to be far from their loved ones i can appreciate that as a reason not to leave i ve heard many people comment that the us is the last great bastion of freedom the us has a unique constitution that s a fact i ve looked at other constitutional documents and none of them are constructed in the same way as the us constitution that exists to limit the power of government in order to protect liberty but in this age after seeing political prisoners legal spying on citizens government control of corporations and financial markets social credit scores for individuals read that as cancellation of people based on diversity inclusion and equity or die for short extrajudicial executions of domestic enemies etc is this still true obviously i have my opinion but is it objectively factual in 2022 renouncing citizenship is not for me but i can t blame anybody for jumping ship at this point to markomalley x to markomalley do you people realize that there is literally only one other country in the world that has citizenship based taxation eritrea all other countries tax people who live inside the country and basically leave their country s citizens who live abroad alone i thought it was 4 eritrea cuba north korea and libya but yeah i found all those problems too here is an additional one if you live outside the us for decades as i did you better have a us tax lawyer go over you accounts with a fine tooth comb because the irs assumes you are a money laundering terrorist and will throw your school teacher rear end in jail you still need an accountant but it is a good idea to move to a corrupt us territory like the us virgin islands or ahem guam you file us taxes there but everything stays on the island and all the tax employees are lazy locals who don t audit anyone this gives you a paper trail of filing taxes for several years to get the irs off your back god forbid you should have a non us citizen spouse who isn t poverty strickened honestly while i was on guam or in china i d have gladly voted for even the piaps if she had changed us tax laws and made the line up with other countries to markomalley i ve been an expat in the past you pretty much need a professional in the states to prepare your taxes you get a 1 to 1 deduction on any taxes paid abroad the upshot of this is if you live in a higher tax foreign country you pay the us nothing but you re stuck paying your country of residence their higher rate of taxation if you live in a lower tax country then you subtract what you paid to that country but now you owe uncle sam what s left of what you d usually pay for example if you lived in hong kong and paid their 15 flat rate and your effective us tax rate was 35 you d still have to cough up 20 more of your income to the us once you were done paying your hong kong taxes basically as a us citizen you can never get a lower tax bill by moving to a foreign jurisdiction to markomalley absolutely if i lived abroad and had no intention of returning i d tell uncle sam to eat a d to markomalley i wonder do you collect a nice govt pension ss get your health paid by medicare tricare people want to be in another country but do like to collect the money we taxpayers pony up we are paying those taxes we to fai mao i think you shouldn t have to pay us taxes but if you live outside the us maybe you should not get a govt pension or health care nor ss how does that

bought 160 unripe bunches of bananas in jamaica for a shilling a bunch and after ten days sailing sold them in jersey city for 2 each bananas were popular in the northeast in the days before refrigeration since aside from oranges they were the only fresh fruit available during the winter months one of captain baker s first customers in 1871 was a 21 year old produce dealer named andrew preston preston had handbills printed up extolling the virtues of the new fruit and explaining how to eat it in 1885 captain baker started a partnership with andrew preston and some investors and

brothers and his uncle henry meiggs in a railroad building project in costa rica meiggs had built railroads in peru and had obtained a contract with the costa rican government to build a railroad from the caribbean port of limón to the capital at san josé in the central mountains the first twenty five miles of the railroad had to be constructed in jungle conditions and the project s workers died by the thousands from accidents and tropical diseases malaria and dengue fever the dead included minor keith s uncle meiggs and keith s brothers leaving keith in chrage of the project the railroad s reputation for killing its workers made it impossible to hire enough local labor so keith recruited convicts from new orleans only 25 of the seven hundred convicts hired survived the construction and returned to new orleans around 1873 keith planted banana trees in the railroad s right of way in the province of limón in order to cut food costs for his workers midway through the project keith realized that passenger revenue would never pay off the railroad s debt he began exporting bananas by the time the railroad was finished in 1890 its principal use was transporting bananas in the 1890

extensive railroads and plantations in central america boston fruit company had plantations in the caribbean and a steamship fleet of 42 ships painted white to reflect the tropical sun the great white

gobble up several smaller firms as well the merger on march 30th 1899 created the united fruit company with preston as president and keith as vice president keith continued with his railroad projects in central america the nation of guatemala contracted its postal system to the united fruit company in 1901 in 1903 united fruit commenced the first refrigerated steamship service and the united state

making him the largest shareholder united fruit s share prices had been devasted by the 1929 crash and kept dropping after zemurray bought in from 158 a share to 10 a share in 1932 with his original 30 million fortune reduced to 2 million zemurray had to come out of retirement and kick some butt at this point zemurray stormed into to the board of directors meeting the company had long been a preserve of the boston elite and daniel g wing chairman of the first national bank of boston displayed his disdain by replying to zemurray that he could not understand his russian accent unfortunately mr zemurray i can t understand a word of what you say wing said while smiling thinly zemurray was infuriated and quickly he went out and gathered up proxies allowing him to take control of the company

distribute uncultivated lands to the poor peasants the act was approved in 1952 landowners including particularly the united fruit company were offered compensation based on the valuations of the land for tax purposes since united fruit company s land was grossly undervalued for tax purposes the company deemed this grossly unfair zemurray funded a public relations campaign to portray arbenz as a dangerous communist united fruit could count on the support of secretary of state john foster dulles and his brother cia director allen dulles both had investments in firms with heavy investments in united fruit the american ambassador to the un henry cabot lodge was a shareholder anne whitman the wife of the united fruit s public relations director was president eisenhower s personal secretary

in every electoral season politics and discussions about political parties and candidates that will take over governance at the federal state and local levels usually trump every other discussion political discussions are so pervasive and dominate print electronic digital and social media since politics to a great extent determines the trajectory of every other facet of governance it is imperative to infuse political discourse with practical issues and challenges in the economic social and other relevant sectors this discourse focuses attention on the economy with a specific interrogation of the level of nigeria s public debt the debt management office indicates that nigeria s total public debt at the end of the first quarter of 2022 stands at 100 069 billion converted to the dollar at the prevailing rate of n415 75 to the united states dollar it amounts to n41 604 trillion this excludes the sum of n19 trillion the federal government owes the central bank of nigeria through ways and means borrowing when n19 trillion is converted to dollar at the above rate it comes up to n45 7 trillion adding the sum as posted on the website of the dmo and the cbn ways and means figures gives the sum of 145 769 billion or n60 6 trillion the total sum outstanding is about four years of federal budget estimates combined the debt figure on its own is hanging but when it is contextualised against the fact that the federal government is deploying about 97 of its revenue to debt service a great economic and fiscal challenge crystallises this was the percentage of retained revenue to debt service released to the public by the minister of finance zainab ahmed at the public presentation of the 2022 federal budget the acting accountant general for the federation confirmed what has been public knowledge since the minister s presentation that the federal government has been borrowing to fund personnel overhead and capital expenditure and pay salaries indeed from the trajectory of the increase in debts in the last quarter it is apparent that the federal government may need to spend its entire retained revenue and still borrow some more to be in a position to service its debts this is the type of challenge that should dominate political discourse in terms of political parties and candidates presenting ideas on how they will tackle this challenge unfortunately the discourse is not about the economic social and security challenges that have enveloped the nation rather it is about the ethnicity religion and social background of candidates and the leaning of political parties on these issues these raise some posers is it possible that some of the candidates especially those aspiring to the presidency of the federal republic of nigeria do not understand the magnitude and gravity of this fiscal challenge do they understand that from day one of their presidency if elected they would be looking for resources to pay salaries and meet basic government obligations is it possible that some candidates think that oil is still flowing and there is a fiscal buffer which they will rely on to run the government now that the presidential candidates have emerged it is imperative that the media begins the agenda setting for candidates and political parties to unveil their plans on how to engage these critical challenges it is not the kind of engagement we had in previous presidential debates where candidates who knew they had nothing to offer and would have been disgraced at real presidential debates avoided the debates without any electoral setbacks it is about patriotic media engagement where vacuity in the lack of functional and modern ideas of economic governance are pointed out and made to command the headlines and editorials this will ensure that the electorate understands the respective capacities of the candidates so as to make properly informed choices not based on primordial sentiments furthermore the media should inform the electorate that in our extant fiscal situation the elbow room or the fiscal space is almost not available our debt situation especially from the ways and means stock has been accumulated through illegality impunity and outright contempt for the rule of law and its due process the central bank of nigeria act in s 38 states that the bank may grant temporary advances to the federal government in respect of temporary deficiency of budget revenue at such rate of interest as the bank may determine the total amount of such advances outstanding shall not at any time exceed five per cent of the previous year s actual revenue of the federal government all advances made to the federal government shall be repaid as soon as possible and shall in any event be repayable by the end of the federal government financial year in which they are granted and if such advances remain unpaid at the end of the year the power of the bank to grant such further advances in any subsequent years shall not be exercisable unless the outstanding advances have been repaid the advances shall also be repaid in such form as the bank may determine provided that no repayment shall take the form of a promissory note or such other promise to pay at a future date or securitisation by way of issuance of treasury bills bonds certificates or other forms of security which are required to be underwritten by the bank the cbn on the request of the federal government has been advancing way beyond the five per cent of previous years actual revenue and the advances have not been paid within the years in which they were granted but the cbn continued to advance more sums contrary to the provisions stated above sometime in 2021 when the federal government announced plans to securitize the cbn advances over a long term period the outstanding sum was just 25 billion that was a good opportunity to stop the charade of advances and take concrete steps to reduce the cost of governance and cut leakages but the retired major general muhammadu buhari led federal government would rather continue borrowing without thinking of how to pay it back the media needs to educate nigerians that the fiscal responsibility act permitted borrowing only for long term capital expenditure and human development as such borrowing for personnel and other recurrent expenditure is illegal and ultra vires the powers of the federal and state governments popular awareness needs to be raised that most of our long term loans will only be due for repayment in 10 to 15 years when going by the natural course of events many of the present occupants of power and the aspiring ones would likely no longer be available on planet earth they would have collected loans in violation of the law mismanaged the proceeds and left the repayment to the present young generation this brings to the fore the need for sensitisation and empowerment of the young generation who are already suffering and will suffer more in future for the economic sins of the fathers let the engagement of political parties and candidates on their plans to resolve our economic and fiscal challenges start immediately it cannot wait any longer
there are conflicting views on what impact a third consecutive la nina weather event will have on crops in india and australia many weather models anticipate ongoing la nina conditions throughout 2022 according to presenters at the international grains council s grains conference 2022 la nina years typically result in better than average monsoon rainfall for india said fahad vaipei vice president of olam a singapore based agribusiness company india s wheat exports tend to surge during la nina periods like they have in the last couple years exports are estimated at 4 5 to five million tonnes in 2022 23 which is about half of what was initially forecast due to a government ban caused by excessive heat during harvest advertisement read also coming canola crush capacity delayed saskatoon canada s canola crush buildout is not going as smoothly as planned according to the u s department of agriculture the last time india had a stretch of solid exports was during the la nina years of 2011 12 through 2013 14 exports topped six million tonnes in 2012 13 these high production years during la nina have helped india export and is helping cap world wheat prices during years with high wheat prices said vaipei with la nina forecast to remain in place through 2022 he is forecasting another bumper crop will be harvested in india in april 2023 and another strong export program to ensue it would also boost india s pulse production which wouldn t be good for canadian pea and lentil farmers advertisement however according to drew lerner president of world weather inc this year s la nina will be many times weaker than the previous two events its influence on world weather is going to be meagre at best he said in a phone interview lerner believes india s weather will be dictated instead by the indian ocean dipole which is in a negative phase that means cooler temperatures in the indian ocean and less water vapour feeding the southwest monsoons that is why he believes the summer monsoon season will be disappointing despite la nina being around carlos mera head of agro commodity research at rabobank said that la nina is usually associated with poor wheat crops around the world advertisement that is why he is calling for a third consecutive deficit in global wheat production in 2022 23 especially when adding in the problems caused by the war in ukraine this year s deficit will be the largest of the three at over 10 million tonnes the last time there was a deficit that large was 2012 13 following two consecutive la nina years where are we going to find more stocks he said in a pre recorded presentation for the conference i think it s going to be a difficult task both winter wheat and spring wheat crops are in trouble in the united states and there is dryness in other key exporting regions like the european union and argentina advertisement mera noted that while la nina is bad news for many wheat producing regions of the world it is good news for australia preliminary estimates call for 32 6 million tonnes of production in that country that would be down from the record 36 3 million tonnes harvested in 2021 but would still be the third largest crop in australia s history a third consecutive la nina is also expected to boost production of other grains oilseeds and pulses in australia lerner is once again skeptical of that forecast because he believes it is going to be a weak la nina that may have completely fizzled out by the time australia s spring and summer season rolls around in the september through march period however he did note that while a negative indian ocean dipole typically cools the indian ocean it also results in warmer ocean temperatures off the coast of sumatra that in turn can result in more rainfall in central and southeast australia during the country s winter months that means south australia victoria and new south wales could get a good drink of water leading up to spring planting if la nina hangs around and is strong enough it would also enhance precipitation in queensland and new south wales during the summer months but he doubts that will happen for now lerner is forecasting normal moisture conditions for australia s summer crop

time for some real talk there are a lot of republicans with doubts about president trump running again in 2024 and you hear it often when conservatives gather together they worry that him going grover cleveland could spoil a sure thing but that s not necessarily so whether you love donald trump or whether you doubt him if you hate him shut up and go back to the bulwark offices with the other losers you need to look hard at the facts we re not progressives who let our feelz control us and we must ruthlessly assess our own potential courses of action when it comes to replacing that desiccated old pervert masquerading as our president we must look at his downside but also his upside and he has one the fact is that donald trump 2024 has a reasonable chance to beat anyone the democrats launch at him hell in 16 he defied the conventional wisdom to crush felonia milhous von pantsuit the smartest woman ever was and there are a lot of reasons why he might well pummel whatever pea brained nimrod the dems deploy against him in 2024 advertisement let s look where all smart tacticians will look first at logistics trump has money oodles of it and his supporters now have two campaigns worth of experience instead of the none they had in 2016 he also has his own social media outlet as well as friendly conservative media and twitter may even be under free speech advocate elon musk by then they can t shut him up again then there is the opposition he faces a clown for an opponent grandpa badfinger is the only guy dumb enough to forget how to ride a bike and some polls already show trump beating biden in a head to empty head race two plus years out none of those who will be seeking to shiv the crusty in chief and send him off to sunny acres so they can grab the dem nom is a bigger threat kackling kamala supply chain chump pete buttigieg maybe aoc will run voters will love her perhaps hillary will step into the ring to get humiliated yet again all of them are potentially beatable by djt in 2024 but there is more critically a lot of people really dig donald trump and it s not because he somehow bedazzled them with his magical power to make the jesus gun people fall in love with him that the ruling caste seems to think he wields as i write in my forthcoming book we ll be back the fall and rise of america could trump save us again his vision for this country is simple and correct all about making america great again and putting america first just compare the democrat vision of empty shelves and bank accounts with trump s vision of america prosperous proud and strong instead of one dropping abandoned allies off of c 17s advertisement recommended that s what people love about him and it s not just the people with djt tatts and red hats even conservatives who have doubts about trump going for round 3 tend to respect him and his achievements trump brought a whole bunch of people into the republican party who had been repelled by stiffs like mitt romney and blunderers like george w bush guys who incidentally never had a job that involved them sweating and certainly looked like they despised anyone who had trump nearly singlehandedly turned the gop into the party of the working man because despite his flamboyance and his gold plated bidets he genuinely respected guys who built things who drove things and who fought wars it wasn t fake he grew up on construction sites the toffs and puffboys with their ivy league degrees scoff at that notion as if they would ever dirty their dainty paws working but you can t fake that not for seven years working folks saw him and saw an unlikely ally and that meant we republicans suddenly had access to voters miracle whip mitt could never attract you look at the gop stampede of latinx voters who hate that stupid word with a passion and you have to understand that it would not be possible without donald j trump but it is not just his personality that built that loyalty it was his performance as president just look at the guy s record a record that rivaled even st ronny s trump presided over the first expansion of wealth for working people in decades reversing the stagnation that saw the coastal blue elites growing richer and everyone else growing poorer he cut taxes for small business jump starting economic growth gas prices were low the stock market was high compare and contrast his economic record with that of this ridiculous dust puppet we are stuck with now we didn t have to worry that there would be no baby food on the shelf when trump was in office now you need to take out a mortgage at much higher rates than under trump just to fill up your f 150 and just a couple years ago the stock market was booming instead of failing like brian tater stelter on tinder advertisement in a few weeks scotus decisions tossing out roe and upholding your right to keep and bear arms will vindicate donald trump yet again trump began the process of rebuilding our military wrecked after decades of fruitless wars and most importantly he did not get us into any new ones that matters because the people who like him tend to be the people who either have to actually fight those wars or send their sons and daughters to do it see if you can imagine a cheney in uniform without laughing at the absurdity of a member of that clan actually personally participating in one of the myriad wars they love so much as anything other than a distant spectator but it s not so funny when it s your kid coming home in a box and trump got that when no one else in the gop seemed to oh and trump aided by some outstanding appointees like ambassador ric grenell and national security advisor robert o brien brought peace not just to the intractable kosovo conflict but to the middle east remember how mid east violence was a staple on the nightly news for most of the last century trump fixed that when all the geniuses of the establishment couldn t now israel and saudi arabia are working together if you can wrap your heads around that at least until president numbskull screws that up too trump put america first not the interests of the ruling caste and for that our alleged betters cannot forgive him this brings us to the last reason trump should run we deserve a chance to have a real trump presidency and so do our enemies they need to pay their russiagate lies and stupid impeachment onanism wrapped up the administration for years when trump should have been free to do even more than what he accomplished despite the establishment s full court press to disenfranchise his voters by neutralizing him moreover the shameful 2020 election you do not have to believe that the outright fraud which did exist i saw it helping the legal effort in las vegas working alongside future nevada senator adam laxalt with its unlawful legal hijinks and regime media interference trump is down 17 points in wisconsin was fundamentally unfair trump personally deserves vindication from that unfair fiasco but more importantly the people who voted for him deserve vindication too and the people who hate trump deserve four more years of suffering under his reign of mean tweets advertisement anyone who tells you that trump cannot win is wrong he can he has powerful winds behind him some of them of his making some historical and he has a fantastic record that contrasts starkly with the legacy of bungling of his successor trump has been blessed with incompetent opponents who have made everyone hate them so a win is not out of the question trump has real reasons to run if he chooses but a win is not assured because he can realistically run does not necessarily mean he should there is a case to be made that we republicans need to thank him hand him a gold watch and move on and that s why my thursday column pending some breaking news or my attention being captured by some other politico cultural squirrel will be the case against donald trump 2024 conservatives must stand together and fight join townhall vip and check out this week s stream of kurtiousness republicans great midterm plan betraying us and my podcast unredacted pre order my next non fiction book we ll be back the fall and rise of america which talks a lot about 2024 and provides a detailed to do list of progressive bashing for the next president whoever he is and don t forget my kelly turnbull series of

a months long delay in printing car titles is causing concern for oklahoma drivers and car dealers the jenks tag agency said it s a supply chain issue that the state hopes to resolve by the fall but one car dealer told channel 6 this could be devastating for her business titles make the car business go round said rhonda pruitt co owner of chris pruitt auto sales a statewide shortage of title paper is the latest roadblock facing the car industry at what point do we go okay how can we fix all these shortages i mean the car business is a volatile business to begin with and then when you throw all of the new cars not being able to get the chips so everybody s forced to buy used cars great for us but then it makes it hard for us to get our stock and our supply and our customers want another choice for vehicles my husband goes and buys all the vehicles and he s running himself ragged trying to get cars so this paper shortage is just one more headache for us to deal with said pruitt vicki greene with the jenks tag agency said the delay is forcing most people to wait for 8 to 12 weeks to receive their title you leave here with a registration that proves you re the owner of that vehicle so you re not in need of one right away said greene greene said it s a bigger issue for car dealers like rhonda pruitt without titles we can t transfer ownership of a vehicle to a customer we can t purchase it from an auction we can t sell it at an auction said pruitt their tag is gonna be expired and they re gonna be either having to park the car or re contract that car deal and sometimes that can be a costly procedure for us pruitt said it s also problematic for folks getting their car financed as that approval is only good for 30 days if we have to re contract them and if something was to happen to their credit between the time they bought it to the re contract date the bank could either decide to not redo the loan or cut us back and not pay us as much for the loan said pruitt dealers have been instructed to request expedited titles through the oklahoma tax commission and usually receive a response within a couple of days even then pruitt said there s still a delay we had one customer come in and demand her title because her tag was due and i said we can t give you your title and she s like well this sounds a little shady said pruitt my biggest thing is just letting people know that this is an issue we aren t trying to scam people and we are as frustrated as they are and it is something that needs to be fixed but unfortunately won t be today a new digital title and lien program approved last year by oklahoma legislatures is set to be up and running next month if we can print off titles or send electronic copies of titles to the banks that will help us move quickly and it will be more efficient for us but we ve got to get the kinks worked out before that s gonna work out very smoothly said pruitt for more information click here and here
now we have the nastiest inflation that we ve ever seen we have a war in ukraine with perhaps millions and millions of people dying in the end you re talking about tens of thousands of people dying and perhaps it s going to lead to world war iii because of the way we re handling it we just gave 40 billion on top of another 16 billion so we re in for 56 billion we want to help those people we have to also save our country by the way and it s horrible horrible what happened but when you look at europe and germany and france and all these

a farmer harvests wheat in nanyang city china s henan province may 22 2022 since the beginning of the year global grain prices have been at high levels leading to a rise in the domestic grain cpi consumer price index of 2 7 percent year on year a record not seen since 2016 it is a result not much beyond expectations after the conflict between russia and ukraine broke out as the two counties are major suppliers of wheat and corn in 2021 russia s wheat and corn exports accounted for 22 percent and 3 percent respectively of global total while ukraine s stood at 11 percent and 17 percent based on this we believe future changes of output and exports from the two countries will undoubtedly continue to weigh on the global grain market in terms of wheat the conflict has affected spring planting in ukraine the country s 2022 23 wheat output is expected to fall to 21 5 million metric tons down 11 5 million tons from 2021 22 global output is expected to be 774 8 million tons for the 2022 23 period down 4 5 million tons from 2021 22 by the end of 2022 23 there will be a 5 percent loss in global wheat stocks which will then fall to 267 million tons the lowest level in six years in terms of corn global production is expected to fall from 1 22 billion tons in 2021 22 to 1 18 billion tons in 2022 23 a decrease of some 2 9 percent this is mainly due to production declines in ukraine and the united states inventories of corn are expected to fall 1 4 percent to 305 1 million tons by the end of 2022 23 worsened forecasts for wheat and corn have been well reflected by the market from january to may international spot prices for the two commodities once jumped more than 30 percent and the absolute price level has exceeded the level seen in 2008 when an earlier food crisis emerged there are fears that worrying effects brought by global price surges may further drive the domestic cpi indeed the rise of international food prices has affected domestic food prices but how much of an impact will there be to answer this there are two factors to consider one is the import reliance of china on certain products and the other is the gap between domestic production and demand based on this we can divide the main food crops rice wheat corn and soybeans into three categories based on china s dependence and price transmission from global to domestic markets in simple terms price transmission is a change in one price that causes a corresponding price change generally it is measured in terms of transmission elasticity defined as the percentage change in the price in one market given a 1 percent change in the price in another market first is soybeans china relies heavily on soybean imports and they normally constitute more than 80 percent of domestic soybean consumption soybean prices in china basically follow the fluctuations in international prices since 2021 price transmission from the global soybean market to the domestic soybean market is between 85 percent and 100 percent second are corn and wheat since 2020 due to declines in planting acreage and an increase in demand for livestock feed domestic imports of the two soft commodities have surged significantly in 2020 21 imports of corn and wheat took up 10 percent and 7 percent respectively in terms of domestic consumption while in 2019 the figures were just 3 percent and 4 percent import pressure pushed up domestic prices of the two crops since 2021 price transmission from the global corn and wheat markets to the domestic market has been between 10 percent and 30 percent third is rice a commodity for which china is virtually self sufficient imports of rice only account for 3 percent of the nation s total demand and are mainly used to meet tastes for exotic varieties therefore domestic rice prices are relatively independent and mainly follow minimum purchase price factors the price sees very little influence from the international market from january to may international rice prices have surged 19 percent while domestic prices edged up only 3 percent in china consumption of wheat and rice makes up the bulk of total edible grain consumption looking at china s grain consumption structure in 2021 the consumption ratio of edible wheat and rice is about 80 percent which is significantly higher than that of corn and soybeans which are 3 percent and 28 percent respectively over the same period therefore from the perspective of the trend of the grain cpi it mainly depends on the fluctuation of wheat and rice prices historically when rising food prices have clearly pushed up domestic inflation rice and wheat prices have always seen sharp simultaneous jumps the weight of food in the cpi basket is about 2 percent not a very high proportion so when food prices fluctuate sharply the impact it has on inflation will be relatively low since 2000 the impact of food prices on the cpi once reached 1 percent in 2004 a time when prices of rice and wheat both rose sharply ranging from 40 percent to 50 percent and the food cpi rose by 34 percent at present domestic rice prices are at historically low levels as adjusted for incomes and inflation and act as a significant stabilizer to dampen the impact of rising food prices on inflation on the one hand being asia the main rice cultivation area rice prices are not directly affected by the russia ukraine conflict according to estimates by the us department of agriculture in may global rice production in 2022 23 will increase and global inventories will reach new highs on the other hand the amount of government held stocks is also at low levels indicating that the actual supply of domestic rice is relatively sufficient for wheat first there is always a certain loss in the transmission of international wheat price surges to the domestic market and second this year there is an expansion of wheat production narrowing the gap between domestic production and demand and the inventory to consumption ratio is also higher than in the previous year which also helps stabilize domestic wheat prices therefore assuming that under extreme circumstances if international wheat prices rise again by 100 percent in the near future which may trigger a surge in domestic flour prices by 10 20 percent due to stable domestic rice prices the grain cpi will rise by 5 10 percent pulling up the cpi by 0 1 0 2 percentage point a relatively manageable outcome for corn its consumption by humans is relatively low less than 5 percent of the total and that for livestock feeding purposes is as high as 60 70 percent therefore the impact of global corn price surges is mainly reflected by the price of meat products such as pork and that on the cpi is indirect and minor from january to may global corn prices rose 24 percent while domestic prices increased 6 percent although the domestic corn inventory consumption ratio has remained at a low level since 2019 due to continuous reductions of live pig production capacity since the second half of last year there has been a decrease in feed demand thus domestic corn prices did not increase significantly in the first half however with the expected further increase in pig prices in the third quarter profits among breeders may gradually return to the black and corresponding demand in the sector will improve accordingly driving the increase in domestic demand for corn providing that there is still a gap between supply and demand of global corn it s necessary to pay close attention to upward pressure on domestic corn prices going forward the writers are gao ruidong chief macroeconomist at everbright securities and liu xingchen an analyst with everbright securities the views don t necessarily reflect
