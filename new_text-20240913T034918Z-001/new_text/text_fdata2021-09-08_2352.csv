transcript transcripts for crosscut escapes are the product of a third party service the audio stands as the official record for the reporting in this series anonymous crosscut escapes is sponsored by john s adams cfp and ubs marian maxwell you know with any mushroom there s always some in the group that are going to probably either make you sick or do you in even with the polypores you have to know what you re looking at ted alvarez hello listeners i m ted alvarez and this is crosscut escapes that s marian maxwell a mycologist who knows as much about mushrooms as almost anyone in washington marian maxwell and i should add that i m a member of the puget sound mycological society in seattle and i m a past president and currently on the board and i ve been a member of that club since 1978 and for about 32 years i was in charge of their annual show and the scientific display ted alvarez up here there s a lot to know about fungi the most conservative estimates suggest there are at least 5000 mushroom species in the pacific northwest which could be as much as a quarter of all mushroom species in north america that includes prized gourmet shrooms like morels matsutakes and chanterelles as well as varieties like the aptly named death cap and the destroying angel which can attack your liver and kidneys killing you within hours of consumption this delicate balance of deadly and delicious has defined mushrooms for most humans since the beginning of time at least it has for the portion of people who don t find mushrooms just plain gross in fact marian s first exposure to our trepidation with them came on the very first day of her very first mycology class at the university of washington where her professor quoted one of the earliest mentions of mushrooms in the grete herball an old english encyclopedia from 1526 marian maxwell it says mushroom s been fungi there d be two manners of them one manner that be deadly and sleep him that eateth love it the other doth not they that be not deadly may be gross slimy disobedient to nature and digestion be perilous and dreadful to eat and therefore it is better to eschew them and so just saying that okay there s you know the kind that are deadly and the kind you stay away from that s it that s all there was dedicated to fungi at the time ted alvarez mushrooms eventually won most of us over worldwide it s a multi billion dollar industry and while the state doesn t keep stats experts estimate that wild mushroom hunting is likely a multi million dollar business in washington the puget sound mycological society is one of the largest such organizations in the country and our mushrooms are prized in high end restaurants from seattle to japan plus these bizarre life forms in our backyards could be the key to breakthroughs in everything from meatless diets to neurological medicine anonymous so called magic mushrooms can be effective in treating numerous conditions from addiction to ptsd ted alvarez the precise mixture of rain conifer heavy forests and the soil quality of the wildlands in the pacific northwest is perfect mushroom habitat before we go too much further it s probably worth spending a little time defining exactly what a mushroom is what we think of as mushrooms multicolored caps and sponge like masses dusty puff balls and slimy stocks weird polypores that hang like shelves on trees these are fungi preparing for reproduction usually in the spring or fall but the actual mushroom is there all year and because they re here to reproduce those fruiting bodies contain lots and lots of spores sometimes trillions of them marian maxwell and the spores are what we call haploid or half the genetic material the spores go out and they germinate and there they are in search of a compatible strain or a mate you could say and when they find that they fuse their dna and then they re able to again produce a mushroom you don t get the mushrooms unless they find a mate they can actually live a long time in that haploid state um where you have half your genetic material before they find that mate and what that does is that actually increases their chances of survivability because they re still able to survive even though they can t find a mate so it would like our egg or our sperm living for a while until they find a compatible egg or sperm so they re really resilient ted alvarez that resiliency helps mushrooms play a much larger role in the ecosystem than their size and visibility might indicate some form symbiotic relationships with very specific types of trees during very specific times of year improving their host tree s ability to absorb moisture and nutrients in exchange for the tree s sugar others help recycle the dead material of a forest or rehabilitate a burned area still others are harmful parasites that can kill the forest too understanding the behavior of a particular species of mushroom is like finding a key that unlocks how our varied forest ecosystems work the process works backwards too you need to understand the precise alchemy of conditions hosts weather indicator species and so much more to find a particular mushroom take the morel mushroom this bulbous honeycomb variety is revered for its nutty flavor and meat like texture you ve probably seen it in fancy restaurants and foragers flock to the hills and spring to try their luck at scoring some to eat or even sell to farmers markets anonymous they re like a highly prized delicious mushroom that some people just search for all their lives it really feels like winning the lottery when you find a patch ted alvarez but you can t just expect to walk into the woods and stumble onto one a successful hunter will need to follow several intricate detailed clues to get their morel and the first hint might be in your front yard here s marian marian maxwell one thing that we ve always said is when the lilacs are blooming in seattle that s time to go look for morels ted alvarez your next clue might be at the trailhead as you begin the hunt marian maxwell when the trillium has started blooming up in the forest that little plant that s in association with some of the trees when those start blooming that s when you ll find hopefully find morels ted alvarez now the hunting gets a little bit tougher marian maxwell now you have to look for habitat so if you re if you re looking for morels you gotta determine whether you re going to go out for the naturals which are in the forest that is not burnt or whether you re going to go out for the ones that are in the burn areas they do fruit in greater abundance in burn areas but if you re going for the naturals and you re up in the forest you would be looking for the conifers and you would be looking in an area that has had enough moisture maybe following along stream banks where they re no longer is any snow and the temperature has warmed up to oh at least 45 50 degrees for at least 10 days and it helps if i ve found that a lot of times i ll find them in areas where the sun s shining in that early spring where you know maybe that s warmed up the soil a little better you just have to look you have to train your eye with morels because they look like pinecones or fir cones on the ground you don t even see them at first and then if you train yourself you can develop an eye for it and sometimes it helps just to stand back and just kind of gaze over the area and try and pick out differences in the area that you can focus on and you re kind of like okay that s a cone that s a cone and then all of a sudden you see one sticking up straight and you realize okay that s a morel then you almost have to go through that every spring i don t know why it is but for me i almost have to do it every spring to train my eye over and over to see them again ted alvarez the hardest part if any of those conditions change temperature time of season moisture you may have to adjust your methods entirely later in the spring for instance you might have better luck looking for morels near cottonwoods instead of their usual habitat of douglas firs on the west side of the cascades or ponderosa pines on the east side of the cascades see it can be a lot to keep track of which is why it s so important to say don t try this at home at least not without training there s still some truth to what those authors of that old encyclopedia from 1526 were saying guessing wrong could get you in a lot of trouble so even if you have a guidebook and have done the research the best way to learn how to hunt for mushrooms is from another experienced trained forager puget sound mycological society offers plenty of courses and outings during mushroom seasons and they host identification clinics where you can bring mushrooms you ve picked for identification before eating them marian maxwell the poison inquiries we ve gotten have generally been from members of society who are out looking and it looks like something from their homeland or it looked particularly beautiful so they thought they would eat it bad choice you should just not go out and just randomly pick ted alvarez one time marian says she got a call from a woman who had been out picking mushrooms by herself for quite some time marian maxwell apparently she got a guidebook and she was picking and she called me when i was this was during the time i was president and she said my husband said i should give you a call i ve been picking mushrooms and we ve been eating them in her family she had children and her husband and her husband got a little nervous about it in about week three when she s going by a guidebook and he was just concerned thank goodness and most of what they d eaten they d survived so far they hadn t had any reactions but she did bring in some mushrooms to our id clinic we have a free monday night id clinic she brought it in and it was one that would have made her family very very ill so they got away with like two and a half three weeks of hunting and she just went out took this guidebook along and picked what looked like the mushrooms that she thought they were but she said well you know i really don t think i need to come and see you at first and i said well what are you hunting and she says well i found chanterelles and they were growing up on wood and generally chanterelles don t grow on wood unless there s dirt that s kind of covering they re not growing off the tree but it looks like they might be when there s dirt there but she said also i found shiitake growing in the forest well we don t have shiitake growing around here unless it s cultivated i said well that s not a native mushroom and chanterelles don t grow off of wood so i think you d better come in and see us and that s when she later brought in the clustered wood lover which is uh would ve made her whole family pretty sick ted alvarez luckily that family got away with eating some less than ideal mushrooms without getting sick and they got the information they needed before they ate that particularly toxic mushroom again foraging under any circumstance can be kind of a gamble marian says that even some well known edible mushrooms can make certain people sick no person reacts the same to every mushroom and your mileage with each species may vary most edible mushrooms have poisonous doppelgangers and people s powers of observation aren t always equal a distinctive gill frond or almond like smell might appear different in the eye or nose of the shroom beholder getting it wrong can get scary very quickly marian maxwell if you get sick within an hour or two you re probably going to be all right if you get sick six to eight to 12 hours later you better start worrying that s the bad one the really toxic mushrooms like the death cap you don t even get a reaction generally for six to eight hours after and by that time it s out of your stomach and so it becomes more critical and um they ve had people like the heir to the sebastiani wine company many years ago he picked what he thought he remembered his grandparents taught him which was an edible amanita there s certain members of the amanita group which is our most deadly group you can eat them and the italian community is big on some of those and they go out and they gather them and unfortunately he didn t remember right and he picked the wrong one and i think it took him three days to die but it s a very gruesome death and there s no cure ted alvarez we ll be right back anonymous the arbor group at ubs has a straightforward mission to help you make the world a better place through personal financial planning and sustainable investment management the arbor group works with each of their clients to pursue that client s specific goals learn more by visiting ubs com team thearborgroup ted alvarez before the break we were talking about how some mushrooms can be lethal but others are still so beloved that the hunt for them can get extremely competitive the only thing more deadly than a death cap might be asking an experienced mushroom forager to take you to their favorite mushroom hunting spot marian maxwell so people are sometimes upset that we won t give our secret locations but it takes you sometimes you know five to 15 years to find spots that fruit regularly that you have become accustomed to knowing through trial and error when they might fruit based on the environmental conditions of that year you recognize it and so when they tell you that they want you to tell them where the exact spot is if you do that you ve got a lot of people competing for that same spot and there are places that you know basically that i m more willing to share with people than others like my matsutake spots no way no way but i have shared some i ve shared some chanterelle spots with people and we ve also shared morel spots with somebody one time ted alvarez the relative generosity provided by marian and other teachers has occasionally come back to bite them one day a man who claimed to know nothing about mushrooms approached marian for help marian maxwell he heard us talking at one of the meetings that we were going to go looking and so he begged and begged to go along with my husband and i and so we we took him you know we thought oh well you know we ll be nice and then when we got out there he s spotting morels and remember i said that you know like for me every every year i have to retrain my eyes i get out and i have to kind of focus in on okay now look for a morel but we get out there and he s like zeroing in on those babies and it was like my husband nudged me and he said i thought you said was a neophyte and i said well that s what he said he goes ah there s something fishy here later we found out when we went back a couple of times to the spots and they were all cleaned out regularly we found out that he and his friend were going a couple times a week to clean out those spots and they were actually selling them it was going to be another source of income for him but he had actually documented everything on his little iphone where we were and put the coordinates down so he knew exactly where they were but i guess the part that really fried me was that he pretended he said he had never been out looking before and i that was the part that made me mad ted alvarez the last thing i d ever want to do is make a person with an encyclopedic knowledge of toxic mushrooms mad so when i decided to try my luck at hunting i decided to go it alone and attempt to apply all the mycological wisdom marian shared with me i wasn t going to pick it and eat it for all the obvious reasons but i wanted to see what i might find this was june hardly an ideal time for shroom hunting but ripe with possibilities at higher elevations where it was still basically spring but the encroaching heat of summer meant i had to hurry mushrooms are highly sensitive and regulated by temperature that sometimes acts like a seasonal on off switch now if you live in the pacific northwest or read the news or basically haven t been living under a rock at the bottom of the ocean you can maybe guess what happened next anonymous the pacific northwest is broiling in temperatures never seen before it is sweltering under a heat dome ted alvarez instead of an on off switch the infamous heat dome that brought saharan temperatures to metro seattle and melted i 5 well that acted like a nuclear blast on the fungal community virtually obliterating my chances marian tried to sound encouraging like maybe i might find something at really high altitude at least i d see polypores or bracket fungi the kind that stick out of tree trunks like little shelves marian maxwell those you can find all year even in the heat so you might be able to find some of those ted alvarez but even at paradise on mount rainier temperatures hit almost 90 i did not like my odds still i found a high altitude spot in the cascades no i m not telling you where and began my ascent up to the snow line after several hours of arduous switchback free hiking i had nothing but a few hardened bracket fungi to show for it i set up camp near a pile of remnant snow hounded by mosquito swarms i went for a last look at the mountains in the waning light after sunset and a few inches from the snow in moldering wet grass i saw it let s see what we can find here a cluster of frilly beige mushrooms sprouting next to their own miniature stream hmm looks it looks kind of like something you can eat when i showed marian a fuzzy photo she said it was a variety called a cup mushroom but she needed to see more to determine what specific kind and if it was safe for consumption or any other use i didn t collect it instead i m planning to return next season hoping to catch this resilient little cup mushroom one that survived the worst heat wave in history in my own secret spot but i definitely won t eat it until marian can take a look that s it for this week s episode many thanks to marian maxwell and the puget sound mycological society this episode was produced by me and sara bernard our executive producer is mark

the box office success of shang chi and the legend of the ten rings the first entry in the marvel cinematic universe to feature an asian lead is a welcome boost to theater owners still contending with the uncertainty the covid 19 pandemic brought to the motion picture industry walt disney co film s 90 million four day opening weekend in the u s and canada obliterated the previous record for a labor day weekend which is typically an end of summer quiet time for hollywood the displaced record holder was rob zombie s 2007 halloween at 30 6 million on one hand the financial results from the film starring simu liu awkwafina and hong kong cinema great tony leung among others should surprise no one it s the first marvel movie since spider man far from home to be released only in theaters rather than getting a same day online release like black widow and it s yet another validation of the benefit of having inclusive storytelling in major blockbusters advertisement to theater operators it s the latest encouraging sign that audiences are willing to return to the big screen when there are movies they want to see amc theatres the world s largest circuit on tuesday said this was the first time that its attendance numbers exceeded those of the same weekend pre pandemic amc s share price increased 9 to 47 83 on tuesday the larger question though is how the recent run of new movies will affect studios decisions about whether to hold onto their current release plans or continue to delay big movies or send them to streaming services paramount pictures last week delayed top gun maverick from its november release date to may shortly after the studio showcased footage of the film for eager exhibitors in las vegas at cinemacon sony pictures is selling the rights to hotel transylvania 4 to amazon prime and mgm has decided to release the addams family 2 to premium video on demand and in theaters at the same time but on the heels of shang chi sony on monday said it would release the big budget marvel sequel venom let there be carnage two weeks earlier than expected on oct 1 shawn robbins chief analyst at boxoffice pro said the shang chi release could be a confidence boost for distributors i m sure studios went back to work this week feeling more confident releasing movies this fall in theaters than they did a week ago robbins said moviegoing is ready to come back at a certain level the pandemic is going to be here through the end of the year and will continue to be here into next year and people are learning to live with it and we re starting to see that at the box office advertisement theaters have implored studios to keep their fall movie schedules intact and just as importantly to release them only in theaters shang chi s winning numbers should bolster their case analysts said disney has said shang chi will be only in theaters for 45 days before being available in the home another recent disney release free guy which also got a 45 day theatrical window has shown strong staying power with 94 4 million domestically over four weeks universal pictures recently released the horror reboot candyman exclusively on the big screen grossing a solid 41 9 million in its first two weeks this is not a flash in the pan this is not an anomaly this is a trend said paul dergarabedian box office analyst at comscore for studios that are in boardrooms every day trying to make decisions about their release plans this at least gives hope to the notion that movies can do well in theaters for movie theaters this is another arrow in the quiver still it s difficult to compare shang chi s performance with that of black widow which was released in theaters and on disney premier access for a 30 charge black widow opened with a strong 80 million in its first three days but fell significantly in its subsequent weekend theaters and analysts blamed the video on demand release for cannibalizing the box office and enabling piracy star scarlett johansson sued disney over the release saying it ate into her box office bonuses in a case the company said has no merit company town forget scarjo vs disney hollywood s streaming fight is just beginning scarlett johansson and walt disney co are locked in a legal fight and war of words over black widow s online release it s the latest flashpoint where talent pay practices have yet to catch up to broader industry changes shang chi s three day gross not counting the monday holiday was 75 5 million slightly less than black widow but comparisons are flawed because shang chi was previously little known to people other than comic book devotees while black widow has been a major fixture in the mcu since 2010 s iron man 2 advertisement disney has released several movies through its 30 premier access plan during the pandemic including jungle cruise and cruella but does not currently have any movies on the schedule following that strategy the shang chi grosses make it less likely that big movies such as the upcoming marvel feature eternals will be released simultaneously through streaming analysts said in an earnings call disney chief executive bob chapek noted that shang chi would be another important data point in its learnings about release strategies it has tested during the pandemic which hobbled theater attendance we think it s actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it s got only a 45 day window chapek said the conventional theatrical window was typically double that still among the major studios disney has been one of the most willing to experiment with release strategies to help boost subscribers for streaming disney was absent for last month s cinemacon where its rivals all to varying degrees declared the importance of the theatrical business model meanwhile disney has been a major driver of the company s stock price and is considered the burbank entertainment giant s top priority analysts are closely watching what disney decides to do with the november release of the animated feature encanto after other kids movies like pixar s luca went straight to digital international markets which fluctuate wildly with coronavirus caseloads and government restrictions are a major factor in studio release decisions outside the u s shang chi did worse than black widow in the markets where both were released disney estimated that in like for like markets at current exchange rates the opening weekend was 29 below that of black widow most of southeast asia is currently closed 70 of australia s box office market is in lockdown and places like japan and south korea are contending with surges that s really the challenge in releasing tent poles now robbins said at no point have all these markets been aligned in a way that would be healthy for a global movie advertisement china which remains an important if unstable box office market for u s studios could also be tricky for shang chi which still does not have a release date in the country china s government has allowed relatively few american movies into the country so far in 2021 preferring to support chinese films the ruling communist party also has

the analysis comes at a time when the covid 19 pandemic has made millions of american workers uneasy about their financial stability it s been more than a decade since the federal minimum wage increased to 7 25 an hour one of the longest periods of time its gone without a boost since the program was first implemented nearly a century ago in that period of time the us has seen enormous growth in its economy with the stock market and corporate profits reaching record heights still wages have stagnated and even decreased if inflation is considered however if the minimum wage did keep pace with the country s booming economy one economist says workers would be seeing a federal minimum wage of about 26 an hour in a blog post for the center for economic policy and research economist dean baker says for the first 30 years of the program s existence wages did keep pace with the country s economic productivity but some time in the 1970s wages began lagging behind the country s productivity and has been in a tailspin ever since baker says his research is not meant to inform any serious economic policy it s more of a thought experiment for picturing what the world could look like but he states it s a very unrealistic picture in order to have a minimum wage that high other changes would need to be made to the economy baker says that would result in mass unemployment however that s mainly due to the fact that our economy is structured to not support workers earning near the bottom according to baker the analysis comes at a time when the covid 19 pandemic has made millions of american workers uneasy about their financial stability during the pandemic the wealth of the richest americans soared while those who relied on low wage jobs were more likely to get laid off according to cbs news labor data shows that around 250 000 workers earn the federal minimum wage of 7 25 an hour nearly 865 000 earn less
south lake tahoe calif on monday morning enough smoke still lingered here to irritate the eyes if one stayed outside long enough and it smelled like the acrid end of a burning incense stick but that didn t matter to those among the steady trickle of cars that made their way across the nevada line crossing lincoln highway as it turned into lake tahoe road the residents were glad to be returning to their homes after being forced to evacuate because of the caldor fire signs that days ago had warned of danger and urged them to flee now welcomed them back outside the hard rock hotel and casino in stateline nev carolina cumpa and her husband loaded their white ford explorer with the items they d hurriedly thrown into the vehicle when they evacuated their home more than a week ago cumpa 29 who works as a housekeeper at the atlantis hotel in reno nev said that she her husband and their toddler daughter had been confined to the hotel for seven days she had prepared meals using a slow cooker and groceries that she and her husband had packed when they left home advertisement cumpa said her husband is a houseman at the hard rock which provided them shelter but being in a room with only a king size bed and a crib brought from home made her miss their usual space she was eager to get home and clean up what was left behind in the rush to leave and to cook on a real stove we love tahoe she said noting that they had lived there for three years we re happy the firefighters saved our home the caldor fire the 15th largest fire in california history has burned through more than 216 000 acres of land and damaged more than 77 structures according to an update provided by cal fire on tuesday morning more than 770 single residences have been destroyed along with more than a dozen commercial properties the fire is about 49 percent contained authorities anticipate that it won t be fully contained until sept 27 advertisement the fire sent residents hundreds of miles away and across state lines to seek shelter for residents willing to return under a warning with fair air quality it was a respite from being turned away from shelters and hotels or cramped living spaces

the couple who had decided to wait out the danger at home instead of evacuating bob lopez a retired firefighter said he had been confident that the fire wouldn t reach their lake property advertisement it was actually kind of annoying to hear noise he said monday as a family of ducks made its way onto his property to eat the food he leaves for them he and his wife had become accustomed to the eerie silence of their tahoe keys neighborhood as they sheltered in place with air purifiers along with their irish setter trudy and gracie the cat many restaurants souvenir shops and convenience stores remained closed prompting returnees to stock up on essentials at safeway with the expectation that services might not return anytime soon businesses that were open were anxious for customers to return to the area share this article share kathleen mason general manager of the holiday inn express said the hotel on the main drag of lake tahoe boulevard reopened its doors monday morning after evacuating seven days earlier when it housed grizzly flats evacuees post office workers and firefighters advertisement mason estimated that the hotel lost 120 000 over the weekend because of the closure it s this weekend and fourth of july that are the busiest for us she said adding that summer is the busy season our summer is over summer concerts for example are good for business but most were canceled this year and last not far from the hotel chris nicholson was doing repairs on his camper it had been damaged by a bear shortly after he returned from santa cruz on monday morning south lake tahoe residents had been warned about roaming bears attracted by trash left curbside as residents evacuated most of the burglaries reported while people were away were

scenic beauty and great skiing has not waned that alone they said provided some assurance that the area would be saved south lake has seen an influx of people fleeing the bay area and other congested communities that are only a few hours drive away as work from home options multiply because of the pandemic living in the region however requires one to be somewhat of a survivalist more because of the brutal winters than summer emergencies tahoe keys resident brady hodge said monday as he prepared to mow his lawn hodge 70 had gone back and forth on whether to evacuate the 45 year tahoe resident had originally planned to leave by boat but a friend talked him out of it after spending an hour in stalled traffic he went back home to reload his boat with supplies only to switch plans again

full the shelter offered him and about 150 others space to sleep on the lawn but they were awakened by sprinklers around 2 a m he said after that he went from one full carson city nev hotel to another before finding a hotel in reno that would take him and toby he said a friend who works for a carson city public agency offered to drive him home from reno on friday night he left his vehicle behind for the chance to head home when he returned he opened up one of the three remaining bottles of sauvignon blanc poured a glass a daily ritual sat down and thanked his lucky stars he emailed his neighbors to let them know he was back and that their homes were fine advertisement i m thankful to be back he said i m thankful to be alive i m thankful my house is still standing he said he had considered staying home the next time a fire comes but a friend told him it won t be a next time because it ll burn hodge said he has enough groceries to last him until the businesses on his deserted

by ryan mcmaken of mises institute job growth numbers on friday failed to impress economists had predicted job growth in the area of 720 000 but according to the department of labor s estimates jobs growth for august was only a third of that 235 000 commentators on cnbc called it terrible news and the word stagflation has started to appear more and more in the media and investor narratives for example desmond lachman writes in the hill today with inflation rising to levels last seen 30 years ago and with unemployment remaining stubbornly high amid the covid 19 pandemic despite massive policy stimulus we may again be entering a prolonged period of stagflation a barron s headline reads a weak jobs report puts fed in a bind as it stares at stagflation the street has advised investors to embrace stagflation and bofa warned of the potential for stagflation and there are good reasons to fear that stagflation may be on the horizon consumer confidence fell to its lowest levels since 2011 in july the atlanta fed has reduced its q3 forecast from 6 percent to 3 7 percent over the past month bank lending has turned negative in year over year measures in recent months both in real estate loans and commercial loans it s now abundantly clear there is no v shaped recovery as so long promised by advocates of covid lockdowns total non farm employment remains 5 3 million jobs below february 2020 s peak although the headline unemployment rate fell in august to 5 2 percent down from 5 4 percent in july this is likely being pushed down by a depressed level of labor force participation which remains well down from 2019 in the 25 54 age bracket bigtime stimulus with disappointing results all these numbers should be much better given that the economy is still in the midst of receiving enormous amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus federal spending is at multi generational highs largely because the federal government can continue to borrow at rock bottom interest rates this is only possible because the federal reserve continues to add to its 8 3 trillion portfolio composed largely of government debt and mortgage assets over the past 18 months the fed has added 4 2 trillion to its assets which means the fed has also flooded the economy with a similar amount of money as the new york times summed it up on friday the fed has been buying 120 billion in government backed bonds each month to keep longer term interest rates low and many types of borrowing cheap bolstering lending and spending to help the economy heal given these levels of stimulus we should be talking about an overheating booming economy given those levels of stimulus yet as daniel lacalle has pointed out these continually ratcheting up levels of stimulus produce increasingly meagre results high inflation presents a political problem for the fed this all leaves the fed in a very unpleasant position as the fed is fond is reminding everyone it has a dual mandate to both maximize employment and achieve price stability we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us yet thanks to structural weakness in the economy pursuing the goal of maximum employment has required an unusually immense amount of money creation which has fed into tremendous amounts of asset price inflation namely stock prices and housing prices now even consumer prices are beginning to build as powell admitted in his jackson hole speech so if continued stimulus is necessary to keep job growth going which appears to be the case what s the fed going to do to keep prices from spiraling out of control ultimately this is a political problem not one of technocratic management right now there is heavy political pressure on the fed to keep the money spigot open and the government spending flowing there s also plenty of pressure to keep the financial sector well lubricated the fed has been happy to oblige but the political situation can change significantly if price inflation comes to be seen by the public as a real problem there s some evidence it may already be moving in that direction as cnbc reported on tuesday the conference board reports that consumers now see inflation running at 6 8 percent 12 months from now and of course rents and prices for housing are already crippling many households financially so the fed could end up facing pressure from the public and thus from a growing number of elected officials to cut price inflation well before anything resembling a robust economy is actually achieved if the fed then cuts back on asset purchases and allows interest rates to rise the federal government would have to pay far more interest on the debt leading to very unpleasant budget cuts moreover as interest rates rose a decline in lending would lead to a declining money supply and a bust would ensue zombie companies would begin to go bankrupt and unemployment would rise the fed s apparent plan to somehow get full employment and then deal with inflation sounds nice but reality could easily derail the plan headed for the 1970s some commentators are already suggesting that we re heading in that direction niall ferguson fears inflation could be repeating the trajectory of the late 1960s which laid the foundation for sustained high prices the following decade and ken rogoff suggests the parallels between the 2020s and the 1970s just keep growing he then asks has a sustained period of high inflation just become much more likely until recently i would have said the odds were clearly against it now i am not so sure especially looking ahead a few years how could this be avoided the us would need big time economic growth and big productivity gains to grow its way out of this but that s unlikely because productivity has already been crippled by american governments lockdowns and covid stimulus policies in 2020 logistics and supply chains are in disarray the workforce is still down 5 3 million workers from its peak 18 months ago unless something changes soon this all points toward a scenario of stagflation author contact ryan mcmaken ryan mcmaken is a senior editor at the mises institute

some say records are to be broken but when it comes to the global supply chains breaking records come with a very dark side only this year supply chains were plagued by a myriad of disasters the suez canal accident interruptions caused by extreme weather and most recently port shutdowns drove by new virus outbreaks in asian countries fresh data released by resilinc a global leader in the supply chain risk monitoring space indicated that supply chain disruptions hit record breaking levels in 2021 with the number of factory fires up by 150 only in the first half of the year this marked the highest rate of factory fires ever reported the shocking increase is mostly attributed to gaps in regulatory and process execution and also by a shortage of skilled warehouse workers the data also exposes that disruptions caused by supply shortages skyrocketed by 638 just in the first half of 2021 in total resilinc already sent 251 supply shortage alerts this year with this type of disruption ranked 6th in terms of most reported events but shortages are the number one reason why business sales have been collapsing in recent months and according to the report almost half or about 46 5 of such disruptive events occurred in the united states in the first six months of 2021 from january 1 to june 30 2021 resilinc issued staggering 5 425 alerts about supply chain disruptions across 39 event categories with about 59 of them impactful enough to trigger prolonged interruptions that lasted for at least four weeks today in the us one of the main problems causing shortages is port congestion there are still dozens of container ships waiting to undock in california ports industry experts say that it could take months for the backlog to be cleared while inland logistics hubs are still crowded with containers that have yet to be loaded onto trucks to get to cargo ships and make their trip to their final destinations in addition to all that a shortage of truck drivers is causing further bottlenecks at ports and inland rail hubs as some warehouses are being forced to refuse delivery of new containers until backlogs could be reduced all of this is severely aggravating the global container shortage which consequently is pushing shipping prices for almost all trade routes to sky highs according to xeneta the average cost of shipping a container from china to the west coast of the u s went from 1 794 last year to 11 594 this year and those numbers represent an official average but the truth is that new premium prices are negotiated on the spot and some companies reported shipping rates of up to 33 000 from shangai to los angeles this year as a result companies continue to struggle to ship their products overseas and to get their orders in time the imbalances on supply chains are threatening to derail the us economic rebound this quarter as business activity and production have fallen 6 9 percentage points in august new export orders dropped by more than five percentage points and new orders faced a sizable decline according to a report released by the institute for supply management moreover shortages of materials such as plastics are pushing the price of a wide range of products to record highs this started during the big freeze that hit texas that disrupted the petrochemical industry along the gulf coast it accounts for nearly 20 of the global ethylene production and three quarters of that production along the gulf coast was knocked out during the big freeze explained wolf richter the materials produced by it go into pretty much everything all kinds of consumer goods from water bottles to automobiles all kinds of packaging and all kinds of industrial goods such as pvc pipe that is used in new construction the expert added all of this is happening at a time when consumer demand is being fueled by government stimulus not just in the us but all around the world the combination of artificially fueled demand for goods and supply chain problems is causing significant distortions in the global economy and it is creating asset bubbles in the financial markets and threatening to trigger an inflationary spike like no other the main problem is that as companies realized that they can charge more for the same products and consumers have been accepting those increases without a question they will continue to get away with raising prices even after conditions improve across supply chains that is how hyperinflation infiltrates global economies and our future is going to be marked by it on the other hand wages won t similarly hyperinflate which means we re headed to an era of economic deterioration while the price of everything continues to explode we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us

u s home prices continued to rise at a rapid pace in july increasing 1 8 compared with june and jumping a record 18 compared with july 2020 according to corelogic s home price index home price appreciation continues to escalate as millennials entering their prime home buying years renters looking to escape skyrocketing rents and deep pocketed investors drive demand says frank martell president and ceo of corelogic in a statement on the supply side it is also the result of chronic under building especially of affordable stock this lack of supply is unlikely to be resolved over the next 5 to 10 years without more aggressive incentives for builders to add new units corelogic s research shows that areas with lower population density remain in high demand in july home prices rose sharply in the west with twin falls idaho experiencing the highest year over year increase for a third consecutive month at 39 8 bend oregon ranked second with a year over year increase of 37 1 at the state level idaho and arizona again led the way with the strongest price growth at 33 6 and 28 4 respectively utah also had a 25 7 year over year increase as home buyers seek out more affordable locations with lower population density and attractive outdoor amenities demand is strongest for standalone detached homes however that is where supply is most constricted which continues to put upward pressure on detached home prices a recent corelogic survey of consumers looking to buy homes shows that on average 65 8 of respondents across all age cohorts strongly prefer standalone properties compared to other property types given the widespread demand and considering the number of standalone homes built during the past decade corelogic estimates the single family market will be undersupplied by 4 35 million units by 2022 this 18 year over year increase is the largest since corelogic launched its hpi report in 1976 in july appreciation of detached properties 19 7 was again the highest measured since the inception of the index and nearly double that of attached properties 11 6 as prospective buyers continue to seek more living space and lower density communities corelogic forecasts that home price gains will slow to a 2 7 increase by july 2022 as ongoing affordability challenges deter some potential buyers and an expected uptick in new for sale listings cause a slowdown in home price growth july s annual home price growth was the most that we have ever seen in the 45 year history of the corelogic home price index says frank nothaft chief economist at corelogic this price gain has far exceeded income growth and eroded affordability in the coming months this will temper demand and lead to a slowing in price growth last week the s p corelogic case shiller home price index reported that u s home prices hit new highs in june rising 1 7 compared with may and soaring 18 6 above june 2020 photo tierra mallorca
all employees and children over the age of two would be required to wear masks under the measures however the official say so will come from the school board cobb county ga the cobb county board of health approved new measures to help prevent the spread of covid 19 in the community the new measures would adopt the centers for disease control and prevention and the american association of pediatrics recommendations on schools which includes wearing masks in schools in order to save children s lives from the virus superintendent of cobb schools chris ragsdale who is also a member of the cobb county board of health abstained from the vote because he said he didn t get a copy of the final version to read through in time however he added that schools are already using seven of the eight recommendations from both agencies the only recommendation they weren t using is a mask mandate for all employees and children over the age of two the new measure would apply to public private and charter schools in the county however the official say so still comes down to a vote from the school board essentially the board of health s meeting and passing of the measure lets the community know where they stand on the issue of covid protocols in schools but in the end the decision ultimately comes down to whether the school board will vote to implement a mask mandate our public health officials made it very very clear that we are in an emergency and we have to do more to keep our kids and keep our community safe said school board member dr jaha howard i hope we listen i m one of seven board members and i hope we come together and do what s right before the county health board approved the measures 11alive spoke to some parents who said they wanted to remind health officials that their kids aren t disposable and that this is a matter of life and death they don t have a voice we are their voice and we re not doing a good job it s divided on one end to the other this is a war said parent and oncologist sujatha hariharan i think it s the frustration that we are almost like the laughing stock of the state and part of the country that we can t even come together as a group of adults to help keep kids in school and keep them safe added hariharan tuesday s meeting came as the district reported active covid 19 cases in the thousands for the third consecutive week in a row and after the county issued a 30 day emergency declaration on august 19 some parents said their children have been out of school more days than they ve been in school because they re too young to get the vaccine i wake up with my heart beating fast almost every single day said parent carianne tucker do i put him on the bus today do i send him to school today state data from the georgia department of public health shows there s been a significant increase in pediatric testing in cobb county in august compared to july one of the largest numbers that we have here is age 5 17 in our k 12 school aged children the case rate is 1 434 which is almost twice what we re seeing in the community said dr janet memark district director for cobb douglas public health and the second highest which is also higher than our community is the college aged ranged folks so it shows us there is a lot of significant transmission in these groups about 51 of the population in cobb county is fully vaccinated my worst nightmare is that we fill up the icus and the ers and children s hospitals and then we don t have any space for children in need of other care or specialized doctors to help them parent and pediatrician laura verigan said during the meeting the pediatric patient is physically different than a regular patient

al qaeda made several organisational blunders that intelligence failed to spot or exploit and airline security was shockingly poor it s staggering to read that on the day of the attack the hijackers were flagged at the airport for extra scrutiny one had no photo id couldn t understand english and was behaving suspiciously but this only meant that their bags were held before they were confirmed to have boarded they passed through metal detectors one of them set off the alarms twice the country should have been on maximum alert during spring and summer of 2001 to quote the commission intelligence agencies received a string of warnings that something very big was coming in 1993 there had been an attempt by a different group to destroy the world trade centre with a truck bomb in 1995 in manila a plot was uncovered to blow up a dozen us airliners advertisement by 1997 al qaeda was firmly on the radar attempting to purchase nuclear material and in february 1998 its leader osama bin laden issued a fatwa calling upon muslims to kill americans duly in august 1998 his organisation was responsible for the deaths of 224 people in joint attacks on us embassies bill clinton reportedly wanted to kill bin laden and had a plan his failure to act hinged say some on embarrassment at speculation that he went to war only to distract attention from his domestic troubles but the us was also overstretched active in iraq and the balkans and there were worries about inflaming muslim opinion that in retrospect appear quaint clear warning in october 2000 al qaeda ran a boat packed with explosives at the uss cole off yemen killing 17 us sailors none of these attacks was as complex or as devastating as 9 11 but by the time the hijackers went through security the us had received clear warning that islamist terrorists meant to kill americans in high numbers one explanation for the lack of public alarm was a perception that the us was widely seen as benevolent who would want to do its citizens harm anti war activists counter that 9 11 was blowback for decades of us intervention pointing to bin laden s demands that america withdraw its bases from holy lands and stop providing aid to israel advertisement it s a flawed case bin laden also asked america to convert to islam which had nothing to do with foreign policy and blowback edges towards blaming the victim nevertheless the commission painted an inglorious picture of involvement in the muslim world providing not an excuse but critical social context for 9 11 stable dictatorships were uprooted creating a vacuum for terrorists to fill torture accusations handed propaganda victories to the enemy during the cold war the us propped up dictators who destroyed civil society such that the only place opposition could be voiced was the mosque and development was often experienced as cultural imperialism rising life expectancy and a baby boom produced an army of young men with nothing better to do than wage jihad thousands were recruited by sunni fanatics of a stock once bankrolled by america in the soviet afghanistan war and further radicalised by policies such as clinton era sanctions on iraq which were blamed for the deaths of thousands of children saddam hussein s regime did indeed have connections with al qaeda and yes the taliban did provide the latter with an operations base but as the bbc s documentary suggests iraq was a preceding obsession with the bush administration advertisement in many ways us policy post 9 11 was not innovative but a dramatic scaling up of what bush snr and clinton had already been doing the argument was swiftly made that america now had to go over there to the islamic world to stop the terrorists coming over here yet america was already very much over there and had been so for decades which made it a target for resentment and terrorism it might have made sense to tighten us security and track down and capture bin laden while recalibrating us policy to withdraw from the region and reduce its overexposure instead america did the complete opposite stable dictatorships were uprooted creating a vacuum for terrorists to fill the us handed propaganda victories to the enemy via accusations of torture advertisement if america s empire has ended which i very much doubt then it happened not when it retreated from afghanistan but when it injected itself so violently into the region mission improbable anyone reading the 9 11 commission report would see that the politics and culture of the islamic world rendered the mission improbable even though the commission effectively endorsed it because the basis for the kind of society the us wished to create did not exist hand wringing over the failure of nation building evades the question of why it happened and who was to blame the answer is many of those who were in charge when 9 11 took place their re election defied sense the military was unprepared for 9 11 concluded the commission and its civilian response was improvised the order was given to shoot down flight 93 if necessary on its way to washington dc but responders were probably not in a position to carry this out and had its passengers not fought back forcing the hijackers to crash in a field in pennsylvania the outcome could have been even worse their actions saved the lives of countless others and may have saved either the capitol or white house from destruction in the midst of such wickedness their courage was humanity at its best the telegraph london

city has learned gov kathy hochul recently tapped benjamin for her old job after she succeeded andrew cuomo who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations and other scandals benjamin a manhattan state senator for the past four years is set to be sworn into his new role on thursday the harvard business school grad got the inside edge via his role as a founding board member of next point acquisition corp an investment firm that earlier this year bought the oft sued california firm loanme records show benjamin resigned from nextpoint s board in march but kept his stock the city estimates that benjamin could net a hefty 80 000 profit off what appears to be his initial 4 100 investment if he sold the stock tomorrow on the toronto stock exchange where it s traded the california based loanme arranges small personal and business loans for borrowers with troubled credit histories using banks in states with few restrictions on interest rates loanme borrowers are then on the hook for interest rates of 98 to 500 plus fees according to rates in some states posted on the company s website loanme does no business in new york because interest rates on most loans are by law capped at 16 per annum the state considers rates higher than 25 to be criminal loanme has been sued 33 times in seven states in the last five years records show the firm has settled all but two of those lawsuits under terms that remain sealed records show in some suits consumers charged that loanme bombarded them with texts and robo calls pushing them to take out loans in others borrowers alleged loanme employed similar harassment if they were late with payments some borrowers have also alleged loanme reported to credit rating agencies that they still owed money even after they d paid their debts an erroneous claim they said destroyed their credit benjamin s past loan woe it s unclear why benjamin a former investment banker at morgan stanley and failed city comptroller candidate chose to invest in a company like this confronted last week by the city benjamin declined through a spokesperson monday to comment on loanme s track record but he confirmed that he still owns the nextpoint stock that in december he listed in his financial disclosure forms as being worth between 75 000 and 100 000 the spokesperson neil reilly wrote in an email to the city monday the senator s stock holdings have not changed since his last disclosure reilly wrote that benjamin is now working with counsel on a recusal related to nextpoint and its subsidiaries to ensure that his service to the people of the state of new york is free from any appearance of conflict meanwhile benjamin has experienced the stress of loan debt himself a condominium he once owned in providence r i was foreclosed upon in 2011 seven years after he purchased the studio unit the city has learned suzanne moniz a former treasurer of the complex s homeowners association said he failed to pay his home owners fees for well over a year and only settled up after the threat of legal action maybe he s seen the light and become a more responsible person she said i certainly hope so incoming lt gov brian benjamin once owned a condo in this providence r i building credit via google maps reilly said that benjamin moved back to new york in 2006 and became overwhelmed by rental payments in the city and his mortgage in rhode island unfortunately like too many others during the crisis he had difficulty making payments particularly while also paying rent in new york city and his home was foreclosed upon reilly in a statement that inspired him early in his career to build and support real affordable housing in harlem creating over a thousand environmentally sustainable units in the community and he will bring that experience to his service as lieutenant governor to improve the lives of new yorkers stock took off benjamin s foreclosure drama came well before his lucrative stock deal records filed with the toronto stock exchange reveal that last year benjamin and five other original investors in nextpoint appear to have each invested about 4 100 on private insider shares that were ultimately priced at 48 cents once nextpoint went public in july the shares jumped dramatically in value the stock opened at 11 12 on july 7 and has since risen and then dropped only to climb again to 13 29 per share thursday by friday nextpoint had fallen to 8 60 his initial investment of about 4 100 would now be worth just short of 85 000 the city estimates benjamin refused to discuss the current value of his stock he got the private deal as a co founder board member and original investor in nextpoint acquisition corp a canada based investment outfit created in july 2020 to buy other companies as nextpoint formed benjamin along with four other board members and a sponsor bought some 5 9 million private shares for an aggregate 25 000 records filed with the toronto stock exchange state the founders immediately relinquished about 760 000 shares reducing the total share amount to just over 5 1 million that comes out to 0048 cents per share if the six members split the cost evenly that would mean they each put in 4 166 to acquire some 985 500 shares each incoming lt gov brian benjamin credit hiram alejandro durán the city in february when benjamin was still on the board nextpoint announced it had entered into definitive agreements to purchase two companies loanme and liberty tax to create a one stop financial services destination for consumers and small businesses according to a company press release part of the notion was that taxpayers who owed the irs could borrow via loanme loanme specifically arranges loans ranging from 300 to 250 000 with banks located in states that don t cap interest rates on its website for instance it describes interest rates in delaware and missouri around 99 in texas they could be as high as 500 15 per annum that means if a customer borrowed 1 200 and paid it off within two weeks they d owe a total of 3 131 the company charges an upfront fee based on the size of the loan high cost installment loans are as dangerous or worse than short term payday loans lauren saunders associate director of the national consumer law center told the city they have very high rates lawsuits spell out accusations according to thetoronto stock exchange records it appears benjamin participated in the decision to buy these companies nextpoint s board met three times in 2020 during the time this acquisition was underway all board members including benjamin attended the meetings the records state benjamin declined to answer the city s questions about what due diligence he did on loanme as a nextpoint board member nextpoint then moved to go public converting the board members shares at a rate of 100 to one and estimating its value for the upcoming initial public offering at 10 per share that meant each board member now had about 9 855 shares worth a total 98 550 in his 2020 financial disclosure form benjamin estimated the worth of his nextpoint stock to be between 75 000 and 100 000 as of dec 31 that was several months before the planned ipo and weeks before nextpoint formally announced on feb 22 it had entered into definitive agreements to acquire loanme and liberty tax loanme has been sued 33 separate times in federal court in seven different states by that time anyone who did any basic research into loanme would have discovered it had been sued 33 separate times in federal court in seven different states from coast to coast the lawsuits alleged a wide variety of bad behavior records reviewed by the city show last november harrisburg pa resident danielle katen filed suit accusing loanme of erroneously reporting to credit rating companies that she had an open account with them the effect of this was devastating to her credit rating the suit alleges loanme settled in january katen couldn t be reached for comment and her attorney did not respond to the city s inquiries oshkosh wis resident brian marx got his credit report from experian showing loanme incorrectly reporting him as in chapter 13 bankruptcy and erroneously claiming he was late with his november 2018 payment according to his lawsuit loanme settled in march 2020 neither marx nor his attorney responded to the city s request for comment california resident hillary mosher filed a class action suit against loanme last year after she was bombarded with texts from the company pressuring her to take out a small business loan her attorney ronald marron contended in court papers that this practice was systemic and demanded loanme pay his client 1 500 for every hectoring text the firm settled with her in october marron declined to comment benjamin quit board loanme also has ties to settleit a california based debt settlement business that recently agreed to settle a consumer fraud case with the federal consumer financial protection bureau cfpb in april the cfpb filed a complaint against settleit alleging that loanme would transfer indebted customers who d fallen behind in payments directly to settleit which would not disclose its ties to loanme while helping borrowers settle their debts the cfpb further alleged that settleit reached agreements with borrowers that were favorable to loanme in july settleit without admitting or denying wrongdoing agreed to pay 646 000 in restitution to customers of loanme and another personal loan outfit who d paid them fees the company also agreed to pay a 750 000 civil penalty and stop settling debts from loanme and the other firm court records show the city left several phone messages with loanme but none were returned scott hyman an attorney who has represented loanme in multiple lawsuits declined to discuss the cases and said he would obtain contact information for loanme executives he subsequently did not provide any further information attorneys representing settleit did not return calls from the city seeking comment on march 15 benjamin resigned from nextpoint s board after the daily news reported on his involvement with the firm according to his spokesperson a month later nextpoint put out a statement announcing that he d stepped down to focus on his political career the statement did not disclose that benjamin had held on to his private stock in nextpoint earlier this year benjamin launched an unsuccessful bid for city comptroller in january the city revealed contributions to his campaign that some named donors said they never made the city campaign finance board is now looking into those contributions which benjamin promised to return after the city s report
the good news is that the reserve bank is so confident that a big economic rebound lies ahead for us that it s still planning to reduce the cash splash to stimulate the economy with money lots of money what this says is that by february the economy is going to be doing so well that it won t need this help but according to the media the bad news is that the nsw government will extend emergency business assistance until january when i heard that i thought you little beauty a smart government not pulling away support too quickly just because the economy is on the improve the economist business owner in me thought that s reinforcing the positivity that should start in sydney and melbourne as vaccine rates justify a reopening of the economy and the businesses that have been shut down because their customers have been locked up thank god for online as it has saved us from a deeper economic slump or recession which is a point that came out with a recent interview i made with amp capital s chief economist shane oliver but on the other hand suspicious media types had the other view which could be valid casting some doubt over the berejiklian government s ambitious economic reopening and whether restrictions will be eased sufficiently enough to keep companies viable you ve got to hope that my media mates are wrong but you can t rule it out you see there are actually businesses that won t be early beneficiaries of a rebounding economy that should start in november and hot up in december as the silly season kicks in holiday related businesses will boom but while cbd based businesses will benefit from christmas shoppers office workers won t be flocking back to normal for some time i bet after one more school holiday with the kids that you ve already spent more time with than is humanly endurable a lot of workers on february 1 will drop the littlies at school before heading to the office for an overdue dose of their old colleagues and the sanctuary of their work station that s when governments in both nsw and victoria can start plotting their budget repair programs and they will be helped by a booming 2022 that s likely to roll over into 2023 yesterday i got a booster shot of positivity not only from reserve bank governor phil lowe but also from an economist who i rate as a very good forecaster michael knox of the brokerage firm morgans when the coronavirus crash of financial markets happened in march 2020 the oz dollar fell as low as 56 us cents knox listed a number of reasons why he thought the us dollar would fall because of big budget deficits out of washington and therefore our dollar would rise powered by a resources boom he was right with these economic matters he often is that s why i check in with him tonight he features in my podcast knox s positivity was buttressed by what the rba told us yesterday firstly they re not expecting to raise interest rates until 2024 when they think inflation will be in the 2 3 band second they will reduce bond purchasing from 5 billion to 4 billion a week but extend it to mid february but third it expects a booming oz economy over 2022 this was commsec s craig james take on the rba revelations yesterday rba said the economy had considerable momentum prior to the delta outbreak the economic recovery has now been interrupted but only temporarily the delta outbreak is expected to delay but not derail the recovery the rba is effectively saying that it apologises for the break in transmission and hopes that normal services will soon be restored so wisely the nsw government is creating a roadmap out of lockdown and it makes a lot of sense if the nsw treasurer wants to get a big bang for his budget buck in 2022 the more he gives in assistance between november this year and the first few months of next the more momentum he will create for his state economy and this ultimately will send him a lot of tax income as the economic boom proceeds the australian has learned a new round of financial support packages including the jobsaver wage payment will likely be activated from october as nsw begins a tentative reopening of its economy at a double vaccination target of 70 per cent yoni bashan reported some industry officials said the loosening of restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination coverage would not be enough to assure the survival of businesses particularly if health officials maintained too many restrictions rather than being something we should be worried about this plan for greater assistance to help businesses that experience a quiet time in the hot summer holiday months looks like a smart piece of economics and a compassionate play by the government of nsw which i m sure will be mirrored by dan andrews in victoria and that s exactly what should happen by the way check out the knox interview which i ll take excerpts out of for thursday s tv show on youtube knoxy expected a stronger dollar and a boom for commodities which will be good for big mining stocks but he does expect the stock market will become more volatile albeit on a rising trend gee i hope his predictive powers haven t been infected by the coronavirus though he lives in brisbane so he hasn t be as affected as us poor aussies down south
with the recent surge in covid 19 cases across the country and the emergence of the omicron variant many communities are again making masks a requirement in public to help reduce the number of covid 19 cases across the country the good news is companies are still making reusable non medical grade face masks for daily protection from covid 19 but more people are opting for disposable masks for daily use right now a lot of us are getting vaccinated to help slow the spread of covid 19 if you haven t gotten a vaccination card protector you might want to get one now but demand for the best cloth face masks especially the best breathable face mask options is still strong in part because the centers for disease control and prevention still recommends wearing personal protective equipment

reserved for health care workers who are caring for the sick however the cdc now recommends everyone wearing non surgical n95 and kn95 face masks for protection against the new variants as cases surge within the u s when these kn95 masks meet the right requirements they offer better protection in comparison to the regular disposable face masks by filtering up to 95 of air particles many of our favorite brands like maskc have released kn95 masks in different prints and colors beyond that lots of brands are selling directly to consumers including some that donate face masks to health care workers and others in need with every purchase or offering a free mask with every purchase which is especially great now that more people are opting to double mask for extra protection fyi the cdc guidelines recommend washing your reusable face mask regularly with detergent in the washing machine not touching your eyes nose or mouth when removing them and washing your hands or using hand sanitizer immediately after taking your face mask off and now that many people are receiving covid 19 vaccinations a vaccination card holder helps keep that card just as handy as your mask vaccination

oregon flight for freedom participants marched down fifth avenue in the 2001 columbus day parade a powerful symbol of unity from sea to shining sea in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attack in new york city jack mcgowan of sisters is front row center holding the american flag photo provided jack mcgowan was up early on tuesday september 11 2001 listening to npr as he does most mornings the broadcast faded out and a bulletin announced that a plane had hit one of the towers of the world trade center wtc in new york mcgowan s first thought was that there had been a terrible accident then a second plane hit a second tower and the world changed you re rocked back on your heels he recalled i yelled to jan oh my god jan we ve got a terrorist attack mcgowan had been living in oregon since 1970 and was serving as co executive director of the environmental nonprofit solv stop oregon litter and vandalism but he was a native new yorker and the attack hit home with great force i watched the towers being built he recalled two years before i took jan and travis to see my new york and we went out to lunch at windows of the world the restaurant at the top of the north tower of the wtc the dark events of september 11 and the wound it inflicted on his country and the city of his birth came down hard on mcgowan all of a sudden i just broke loose he said i cried and cried and couldn t stop crying the initial shock settled into profound grief flickering in his heart beneath the grief was a desire to do something a need to take some positive action in the face of tragedy an opportunity soon presented itself tapping his background in media the tv station kgw asked mcgowan to host local cutaways that were part of a national telethon to support 9 11 relief at that telethon broadcast mcgowan connected with sho dozono owner of portland based azumano travel and his wife loen loen dozono had an idea what mcgowan characterizes as a bold act of perseverance of looking terrorism in the eye and not blinking dozono proposed enacting a reverse oregon trail bringing oregonians east to new york to show solidarity and provide an economic shot in the arm for a city that was pummeled shut down and reeling they mulled the possibility of a bus caravan but that seemed too slow and cumbersome this had to be immediate mcgowan said they had to fly planes had been grounded across the nation in the wake of the attack and no one really knew what was going to happen with air travel in the coming weeks or what threats civilian airliners might yet face but they had to fly and the idea for the oregon flight for freedom was born mcgowan put every bit of passion and emotion that had washed over him into helping make it happen he wasn t sure he could leave his responsibilities with solv to make the trip but jan insisted that he had to go he needed to be part of something that was larger than just grief he was assigned to an advance team to prepare the ground in new york for what was swiftly becoming an enormous event in a 10 year retrospective published in the oregonian in 2010 sho dozono recalled a thousand oregonians responded to our call from all over oregon and southwest washington there were folks who had never been to new york some had never flown before world war ii battle veterans joined grandparents brought their grandkids whole families flew together roger hinshaw president of bank of america took his two children out of school to join us mayor vera katz had to overcome her fear of flying to lead us nick fish a new york transplant used all of his contacts in new york and arranged for a memorial at union square to honor the victims firefighters police officers mayors from eugene hermiston and other small towns joined the growing number of political leaders the organizers had to weigh the impact of what they were doing the responsibility suddenly weighed so heavily on us mcgowan recalled was bringing 1 000 oregonians to new york really the right thing to do was it too much of a burden on a city that was still reeling would they be making the oregonians a target for a follow on terrorist attack but it quickly became apparent that new york didn t just welcome the flight they were desperate for it mcgowan said mcgowan arrived in new york on october 1 where the waldorf astoria hotel waived room fees to put the oregonians up mcgowan helped set up an international press office for the flight and liaised with a range of new york officials and media then he took a bit of time for himself i went down the next day by myself because i needed to decompress but i also needed time to mourn he said the area around what was being called ground zero was covered in thick layers of dust and there was paper everywhere scattered from thousands of offices in the collapsed towers there was a terrible smell of pulverized concrete burning and decomposition below canal street the city had stopped mcgowan said you could feel the oppressive sense on every single thing people didn t even look at each other it was this unbelievable sense of shock and mourning the pall of grief and mourning contrasted with an exuberant welcome for the oregon delegation broadway entertainers performed for them at the waldorf the welcome created a very human roil of mixed emotions resilience and the desire for joy contending with the somber weight of events there was a certain sense of guilt mcgowan said you re not supposed to smile but there was such a sense of welcome and sheer relief i think that we were there mcgowan reckons that the economic impact of a thousand oregonians was welcome but just a drop in the bucket in an effort to get the city back on its feet the real impact of the flight for freedom was in knitting the country together in making a tangible statement of solidarity it was the psychological embrace that told new yorkers you re not alone mcgowan said and new yorkers responded the entire staff of the waldorf astoria turned out on the steps and the sidewalk to welcome the oregonians waving american flags and cheering flight participants were invited to ring the bell at the reopening of the new york stock exchange and were asked to participate in the city s legendary columbus day parade in his oregonian retrospective dozono recalled certainly the highlight of the trip for many was marching down fifth avenue in the columbus day parade enthusiastic new yorkers we love you oregone we gave the t shirts off our backs oregon heart ny to our newfound friends along the parade route oregonians were treated to standing ovations in new york restaurants for mcgowan the unity and solidarity on display during the oregon flight for freedom represents a precious moment and an opportunity to stand upon the best of our ideals a moment that he fears americans have allowed to slip away to say that we squandered it maybe that s too harsh he said but we missed it without a compass we wandered into the wilderness that is america today jack and jan mcgowan have lived in sisters for more than 14 years now jack continues his public service with the sisters camp sherman rural fire protection district board of directors and no matter how far we ve wandered in the 20 years since the september 11 2001 attacks mcgowan recalls the oregon flight for freedom with deep emotion and profound gratitude for the opportunity to help bring americans together oregon flight for freedom representatives rang the bell at the reopening of the new york stock exchange after the september 11 attacks photo provided i m still so proud of that he said i m so thankful i was part of that

iran s representative to the international organizations in vienna has called on the international atomic energy agency iaea to maintain its impartiality and professionalism towards tehran s nuclear activities kazem gharibabadi made the call late on tuesday after the iaea s chief rafael grossi claimed in a report that iran is blocking access to some of its nuclear sites and continues to boost its stocks of uranium enriched above the percentage allowed in the 2015 nuclear deal officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa gharibabadi stressed that all of iran s nuclear activities including enrichment are in full compliance with the non proliferation treaty and the country s commitments under the jcpoa and safeguards agreement since the other parties to the jcpoa have not fulfilled their obligations in lifting sanctions and the us policy of imposing illegal and unilateral sanctions on tehran still goes on no one can pressure iran to halt its nuclear activities the iranian diplomat said the iaea must maintain its independence impartiality and professionalism and the iaea members must seriously refrain from putting pressure on the agency and trying to use it as a tool for their own political purposes gharibabadi noted the iranian envoy also criticized the iaea s nuclear data recording of the country saying the monitoring agreement between iran and the agency was signed for a three month period and was solely a political decision gharibabadi underlined that the data recording agreement should be considered neither as an iaea s right nor iran s obligation the iranian representative to the vienna based international organizations said in july that the islamic republic would soon produce enriched uranium metal and that the country had earlier informed the united nations nuclear watchdog of the move iran and world powers including the us russia china france britain and germany struck the jcpoa on july 14 2015 under the accord iran agreed to scale back some of its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief however the us under former president donald trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal and reinstated crippling sanctions on the islamic republic although the country had been fully compliant with the deal iran and the remaining signatories to the jcpoa have already held six rounds of talks in vienna which began after the us administration of president joe biden voiced willingness to rejoin the nuclear agreement three years after trump s withdrawal negotiators took a break from the talks after ebrahim raeisi emerged victorious in iran s june presidential election waiting for iran s democratic transition to take place in order for them to be able to continue the talks as disagreements remained unresolved on key issues tehran argues that since washington was the party that violated the terms of the agreement it should take the first step back into compliance with the deal by removing its unilateral sanctions

since 1948 as the primary disposal facility for new york city s solid waste over time according to nyc mayor rudy giuliani it became the world s largest landfill the landfill would soon become a site for the most costly forensic investigation in us history involving dna identification of damaged bone and statistical analysis of partial profiles but sifting through the melted computers corroded

in the months after the 9 11 attack which killed thousands of people and cost 54 11 billion in damages the shock at the tower collapse gave way to the monstrous scale of the rescue and clean up

residues evocatively called fresh kills from the middle dutch word kille meaning stream the suburban landfill had served since 1948 as the primary disposal facility for new york city s solid waste over time according to nyc mayor rudy giuliani it became the world s largest landfill the landfill would soon become a site for the most costly forensic investigation in us history involving dna

privately owned vertical tower had been used to patch a broken horizontal public road network as the families of victims filed a lawsuit for mismanagement of human remains against the municipality the

pexels peter drucker seemed to have a knack for simplifying the profound he said the greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence it is to act with yesterday s logic how prescient what insight could be more appropriate for the times we are experiencing despite hopeful signs that the world of work is beginning to settle down daily headlines still give us reason to wonder what will the new normal really look like was remote work just an emergency measure or is it what many people now prefer and even demand what kind of talent pool is most attractive to employers today and what will they want and need tomorrow johnny c taylor jr spends a lot of time pondering these and related questions fortunately in addition to his own experiences in the workplace he has at his disposal 70 years of original research data compiled by the society for human resources management shrm he s ceo and president of shrm the world s largest hr professional association impacting the lives of 115 million workers and families every day as a global leader on the future of employment culture and leadership he frequently testifies before congress on critical workforce issues he writes a weekly column for usa today taylor s new book is reset a leader s guide to work in an age of upheaval his insights provide a practical framework for any leader who wants to rethink reconsider and reimagine the workplace rodger dean duncan the global pandemic certainly produced upheaval for a lot of businesses what do you see as the common denominators in leaders who are navigating most successfully through the upheaval johnny c taylor jr they are open to change and they lead with empathy rod martin jr the ceo of voya financial once said to me johnny my chro chief human resources officer and others have been talking about losing out on talent because the people aren t located in the new york metro area there was this whole category of people he felt needed to work in the office rod says now post covid i rethought it because i saw that it actually could work in many instances they were better at their work and so that s something i would have never ever agreed to if it weren t for covid one of the great benefits of this realization was that he could increase the number of qualified individuals with disabilities who would have turned down voya job opportunities due to the difficulties of navigating public transportation to a new york city office every day leaders must provide stability in times of upheaval some ceos will tell you well i can t do anything about how my employees feel but the reality is that you have to be aware of what your workers are experiencing that s doing your job put yourself in their position with empathy and your eyes open the bottom line is upheaval creates opportunity you just have to figure out how best to seize it duncan some senior leaders perhaps especially those with backgrounds in accounting law or technology may look at human resources as that soft hard to define stuff what would you tell them about hr s role in the vitality and viability of a business johnny c taylor jr taylor people are the lifeblood of your business domino s pizza chairman david brandon recently told me that enterprises rise and fall based on the ingenuity of their human resources leaders why because they serve as the chief reinvention officers exploring how the workforce relates to consumers and determining which skills that workforce can ply in novel ways hr is who you look to to lead in these incredibly important areas the organizations thriving in this era feature human resources leaders who exhibit a gift for reinvention but they also have the tools they need to envision and implement a totally new way of doing business with their human resources a great example of this is cvs health where the chief human resources officer lisa bisaccia reimagined how the workforce could be repositioned from pharmacy staff to full service allied health services professionals this allowed the company to pivot during the covid crisis and become the third largest source of testing and treatment in the u s duncan what characteristics should a smart ceo look for when hiring or promoting someone to the position of chro chief human resources officer taylor a special number of ceos fewer than one in four are fortunate enough to have chros on their team who apply what we call the right r principles they are results the basis of every activity is to deliver results for the organization which in turn delivers results for people this may mean talent management training programs and succession strategies the basis of every activity is to deliver results for the organization which in turn delivers results for people this may mean talent management training programs and succession strategies reconnaissance data and information are leveraged to advance organizational objectives today this means that application of core analytics enables the chro to make decisions about efficiency effectiveness and entrepreneurship data and information are leveraged to advance organizational objectives today this means that application of core analytics enables the chro to make decisions about efficiency effectiveness and entrepreneurship resourcefulness decisions are based on evidence and concepts of design thinking a cognitive and strategic practice applied to problem solving today this means the chro can think abstractly about new problems and their underlying issues has the tenacity needed to tackle them and has the ingenuity to resolve them decisions are based on evidence and concepts of design thinking a cognitive and strategic practice applied to problem solving today this means the chro can think abstractly about new problems and their underlying issues has the tenacity needed to tackle them and has the ingenuity to resolve them reimagination each day starts with an understanding of people matters and an eye toward reinventing the business in the face of competition and existential threats today this means the chro is reimagining how a stock operation could yield revenue in new unexpected circumstances viewing the talent landscape across the enterprise with a labor economist s eye to repurpose and reskill the workforce and meet market demands duncan because innovation is so critical to business success what can companies do to attract and hire innovators and what can they do to unlock innovation potential in people already on board taylor you ve got to establish the right culture if people don t feel like innovation would be well received they ll play it safe if your compensation plan doesn t reward people who take risks even new ideas that don t work out then you re just treading in the same old same old waters what scares a people manager looking across the table at a potential hire getting it wrong before a question is asked you have to ask yourself if you re looking for innovators in the right places from different backgrounds with diverse points of view is your talent acquisition team turning up widgets or wisdom has your hr team detailed the right job description to attract outside the box talent a new perspective can be as groundbreaking as a new algorithm ensuring the right person is in front of you makes all the difference what we ve learned with innovators is there are three pieces of guidance that help fold in this kind of talent one you have to be very clear about the problem you want them to address second is understanding the help you need to provide them for support the activators that make the idea happen and lastly it s essential to understand that innovators and ideators are perfectionists you need to remind them that the pursuit of perfection is aimless that the idea can still exist and be executed even in an imperfect state in other words great ideas shouldn t continue to be tinkered with on a whiteboard they need to be implemented with room for adjustment expansion and iteration you can t position invention within the lines of convention that s how innovation gets boxed in duncan businesses have a responsibility to be good corporate citizens but some companies have been accused of caving to cancel culture and social media campaigns rather than responding to public issues on the basis of well though out values and reasoning what s your advice to leaders who might be tempted to view current issues more through the lens of short term pr points rather than what s really right taylor we re living in an era where activists can target your organization in a social media instant you have to be aware of why what is it that people are attacking you and your brand for once that s identified the narrative has to be shifted don t focus on what i m saying focus on what i m doing there are lessons to be learned in what nike did during the racial injustice protests of the summer of 2020 they were the embodiment of activism right they had long embraced colin kaepernick and leaned in to his racial injustice cause by july of 2020 they had announced a 140 million initiative with the jordan brand to help fund partners such as the naacp and black girls code suddenly there was a viral video of inspiration from nike titled you can t stop us well within 72 hours the good intentions were being turned upside down the public chorus was growing with questions what about you nike how diverse are you while nike had done all these things putting up the dollars the response placed a laser focus on its own leadership you re a bunch of hypocrites that was the blowback no black people on your leadership team very few black women at the top and yet they ll tell you all day long that they stand with black people if you re not what you re posting about if your instagram feed is not a reflection of your boardroom how are we supposed to take you at face value you re just throwing money at a problem and that s never going to have an impact on racial injustice if i m checking your website and all of a sudden the new face of a black executive magically appears overnight it s insulting and offensive fix your own house then talk to me about the rest of the world duncan if a new ceo sees reasons to change the organizational culture what are some good ways to make culture changes without coming across as disparaging the previous ceo taylor leadership changes cultures shift but it s important to read the room understand legacies and form a strategy after all the board hired you for a reason to maintain the journey or create a different path as the ceo you take the opportunity to revisit the guiding principles that s what we did when i arrived at shrm in 2017 stepping into a position henry hank jackson occupied for seven years before his retirement i was very purposeful i wanted to create a new culture that was not intended to disparage the last ceo s beliefs because what hank did was phenomenal given what shrm had been trying to do for the last decade but what about the next ten years i knew it would take a different culture to find success for the future of shrm to be clear there are no right or wrong cultures but there is the right timing at shrm we needed to fundamentally change our road map so we could react to a rapidly changing nonprofit world we had to figure out how to become essential in the 21st century that required a 100 shift and we couldn t just say it with words we needed a different culture with a tolerance for risk an ethos for innovation and we needed people who would support that culture smart and curious people duncan many organizations have employees from multiple generations what have you found to be good ways to maximize the human resources in such a workplace taylor invest in the individual don t buy into stereotypes but understand that workplace identity and personal identity are becoming more entwined for example a 2019 study by weber shandwick united minds and krc research pointed out that millennials are the generation most likely to be employee activists 48 almost twice as likely as boomers 27 inclusion impacts the bottom line not only through policy and in practice but culture too reexamine antiquated paradigms and develop policies that support your unique company culture this could mean developing inclusive employee benefits such as same sex partner coverage floating holidays and parental leave and hiring strategies that focus on untapped talent such as older workers veterans people with disabilities and people with criminal records it s crucial for business leaders to understand the importance of the employee experience every employee regardless of identity factors undergoes an experience when joining an organization shrm research shows that 54 of the workforce indicates feeling excluded in some way during the recruitment stage remedying unforced errors like these helps make for a much more inclusive workplace by valuing and including differences you drive your company forward by building a winning diverse culture that attracts engages develops and retains top talent an organization could hire the most diverse workforce on earth but if those people can t come together and connect then what s the point duncan what can leaders do to create a workplace environment where people feel free to reinvent themselves before reinvention is necessitated by a crisis taylor be open to reimagining your organization but do so with intentionality around people and culture embrace perpetual work reinvention as technology gives rise to new ways of working and new work options that may include automation work itself will be continuously reinvented to keep up with perpetual work reinvention and changing skill requirements hr leaders must make continuous learning and reskilling a core component of the new employment deal culture is a double edged sword if healthy it generates all sorts of creativity and innovation while unlocking more revenue if toxic it almost assuredly generates waste in talent costs to the tune of 52 billion across the global economy every year aside from the risk reward nature of your organization s culture any leader appreciates one undeniable fact transformation almost always begins with a culture change moreover these culture changes are typically driven by some sort of reset moment i m asked by leaders all the time do you transform via technology or people my answer is almost always the same reset starts with the organization s software its people as leaders we cannot forget people s astounding ability to sink any change reset relies on reduced resistance duncan how can leaders deal with diversity and inclusion in ways that focus on fairness and performance without inadvertently marginalizing people whose support is needed to make diversity and inclusion work for the betterment of all taylor you need talent to show up as candidates whether they re black brown white disabled veterans or able bodied you need skilled people if you commit to that mindset you re going to get a deeper talent pool and if you get a deeper talent pool you get better output i was at a meeting at the department of defense not long ago and a three star general was making a point to a room full of white male officers in the military not surprisingly that s the demographic and the general a white male himself told everyone we can t have enough children to supply the future needs of the military we meaning white males this was a call to recognize that america is getting more diverse not whiter this was a call to have a reckoning with a military that will have to be truly inclusive to thrive he made it clear diversity wasn t about feeling good or posting an inclusive image on social media but about safeguarding america by tapping into every available talent pool that includes women that includes members of the lgbtq plus community that includes black and brown people everyone yes it s the right thing to do and the hard nosed people and the forward thinking leaders are saying we should cast the net wider this doesn t mean an able bodied white male isn t part of the picture diversity doesn t mean to be anti something else it just serves to open your mind to an array of candidates because it ll take all hands on deck to meet the needs of the next decade and it ll take opening our arms to embrace the workplace of the future
reuters u s president joe biden s coming decision of whether to reappoint federal reserve chair jerome powell after his term expires in february or hand the reins to somebody else will arrive at a critical juncture for the central bank progressive democrats want the fed to take on a more expansive role in the economy by beefing up efforts to bolster employment heading off climate risk and addressing inequality conservatives want it to stick to its monetary policy lane pay more attention to tamping down inflation and reduce its footprint in financial markets and on the oversight front whoever the democratic president picks the next fed chief will need to tackle major questions about monetary policy and the nature of money here are some of the biggest challenges in the next four years getting policy right after the coronavirus pandemic hit the fed slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and bought trillions of dollars of treasuries and mortgage backed securities with the economy rebounding quickly fed policymakers will likely start winding down the asset purchases later this year but under a new policy framework adopted last august they plan to wait to raise interest rates until the economy reaches full employment and inflation is at 2 and on track to moderately exceed that level it s a promise that a new fed chief may struggle to keep most fed policymakers believe the current burst of above 2 inflation is temporary but if the price rises prove more persistent whoever heads the central bank may end up overseeing a liftoff in rates before all would be workers can get a job as of august there were 5 3 million fewer americans employed than there were before the pandemic there are a lot of things that are going to be different going forward that are really underlying structural aspects of the economy that i think we re going to have to pay a lot of attention to in order to make sure that we re appropriately calibrating our policy to the economy cleveland fed president loretta mester said in an interview in august fed as watchdog if the fed s new framework has it keeping monetary policy looser for longer in pursuit of a stronger labor market analysts say it may need to tighten financial regulations to avert risky behavior that could precipitate a crisis financial regulation in my view is number two on the agenda and especially continuing to deal with the issue of containing financial risk in an environment of historically low interest rates said david wilcox a former top economist at the fed and currently a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics whoever leads the fed will also need to look at financial stability more broadly wilcox said systemic weaknesses in how treasuries and money markets are traded were laid bare last march by the near collapse of financial markets in the wake of the pandemic related shutdowns the growing popularity of stablecoins a largely unregulated form of cryptocurrency that can be pegged to the dollar also poses a brewing threat to financial stability boston fed president eric rosengren has argued going digital one main question will be whether the fed decides to issue its own digital currency powell has been non committal so far fed governor lael brainard the other leading candidate for the top u s central bank job has said she would find it hard to imagine not doing so the fed plans to publish a discussion paper on the topic in september supporters say a well designed digital currency could lower transaction costs and increase access to the banking system for disadvantaged groups others worry that banks could be sidelined if american households and businesses dispense with regular checking accounts and go straight to the fed china and other countries are already issuing their own digital currencies as are private companies such as amazon com inc if widely adopted such tokens could fragment the payments system threaten the fed s ability to control interest rates and endanger the u s dollar s global dominance the federal reserve needs to figure this out pretty quickly said andrew levin an economics professor at dartmouth college this is a challenge where the dust can settle within the next year or two climate risks the fed chief also will be under pressure to understand and address the economic and financial market implications of uncontrolled wildfires super powerful hurricanes and other devastating impacts of climate change both powell and brainard say it is the fed s job to ensure banks are resilient to for instance drops in asset values due to wild weather events or government mandates to limit carbon dioxide emissions but the fed s mandate does not include any remit to combat climate change directly as is the case for some other central banks the fed created two internal panels last year one focused on climate related risks at individual banks and the other on system wide threats it also became the last major central bank to join the network for greening the financial system which develops recommendations for central banks to respond to climate change both could be vehicles for the fed chief to do more on the climate front though a more aggressive stance on par with other central banks may prove difficult without new legislation racial and gender gaps fed officials have also become more outspoken on the potential for racial and gender inequities to drag on economic growth u s senator pat toomey a republican calls that mission creep many on the left of the political divide however say it doesn t go far enough and fault the fed s bond buying program for lining rich people s pockets by boosting stock prices that s causing a lot of sort of restlessness with what is the fed doing to address some of the big issues of our day which includes inequality and disparities in labor market outcomes and wealth distributions said julia coronado a former fed economist who is now president of macropolicy perspectives whoever leads the fed could fine tune its tools to potentially narrow some of those gaps including through programs meant to boost lending to small businesses and supervisory changes that encourage banks to work with consumers struggling to repay their loans coronado said reporting by ann saphir and jonnelle marte editing by paul simao by ann saphir and

while blackstone has not commented on its intentions for the 1990 vintage shed the property is located around 3 minutes walk from another site in sheung shui town which singapore s mapletree

it was leasing a fanling warehouse from its parent firm and intends to develop a hyperscale data centre in the building that property at 11 on chuen street in fanling is around four minutes walk from

development plan and allows it to streamline its business structure and resources yip s chemical chairman tony ip chi shing said in a statement to the hong kong exchange announcing the transaction occupying a 12 895 square foot site yip s chemical building has ground level clearance heights of about 6 5 metres and ceiling heights of approximately 3 5 metres 11 4 feet on the upper floors which could accommodate the 48u racks used in contemporary data centres which typically stretch over 2 13 metres yip s chemical had been headquartered in the building before relocating to fortis tower in wan chai the chemical trading firm had first put its facility on the market in 2015 through a tender managed by joint sole agents savills and colliers the tender failed to result in a transaction the company then made the asset available again in march last year at a reported asking price of hk 250 million or hk 3 912 per square foot the sale of the building was announced last month by cbre after having closed in july industrial roots fanling has always been perceived as a traditional industrial zone and most of the en bloc industrial buildings in the area are occupied by logistics operators or utilized as warehouses said jonathan chau cbre hong kong s executive director and head of investment property and private office in the capital markets team driven by the government s industrial revitalisation scheme which encourages redevelopment by charging standardised premiums for land use modifications districts such as kwun tong and cheung sha wan were renovated into commercial hubs chau said under these circumstances genuine warehouse occupiers and end users tend to move to the traditional industrial zones in the north like fanling and tuen mun to continue their operations he added strong foothold in asia in blackstone s earnings call in july its president and chief operating officer jonathan gray announced that the group had raised more than 5 billion for its second asia fund and planned to raise a third real estate fund in the region that fresh batch of capital was arranged after the manhattan based fund manager had earlier this year closed on a 1 1 billion

privately owned vertical tower had been used to patch a broken horizontal public road network as the families of victims filed a lawsuit for mismanagement of human remains against the municipality the authorities objected that the debris had been inspected following a meticulous process of classification in the end the judge sided with nyc he said the victims perished without leaving a trace utterly consumed into incorporeality by the intense raging fires or pulverised into dust by the massive tons of collapsing concrete and steel piles of waste from the rubble of the twin towers became a major problem for new york picture nathan edwards the ground zero site one year after the attacks on september 7 2002 rising from the ashes with time however a regime of land reclamation covered up the presence of the dead since 2008 the fresh kills dumping ground has gradually morphed into a municipal recreational park accessible by bike canoe and horseback once completed the expansive area

secured by a system for the capture and treatment of underground toxic gases that heats 20 000 local homes the story of 9 11 provides a stark example of the political economy of waste management which profoundly shapes the culture of the modern metropolis waste is not an undesired by product of human society but contributes to the cycles of boom and bust as wall street reopened silverstein properties and the lower manhattan development corporation oversaw the reconstruction of the site including the erection of six new office towers the highest one being one world trade center totemic symbols of wealth stand erect to ensure the institutional continuity of the financial corporation but waste is impossible to ignore much less eliminate control or even predict starting in 2006 explosives detonated to clear bedrock for building foundations in july 2010 construction of the ground zero memorial ground to a halt when remains of an 18th century ship were found in the mud it was speculated that the hull of this wooden ship was used as part of the debris in a landfill to extend the island of manhattan into the hudson river historically new york used the rubble of its construction operations and wreckage of its seaport to create artificial land and expand its waterfront much as other prized real estate still standing today the twin towers were originally built on the site of a former landfill in lower manhattan following a law of ruins according to which capital is built upon the foundations of its own refuse this story was published by the conversation and

employees work at a small firm that makes communication products in meishan sichuan province the people s bank of china the central bank will release all of the 300 billion yuan 46 41 billion new quota of relending funds to increase commercial banks targeted credit supply to smaller businesses in the rest of this year a senior official said on tuesday the one year relending interest rate is set at 2 25 percent and the average lending rate for small and micro enterprises will be 5 5 percent relending refers to loans issued by the central bank to financial institutions at a certain interest rate which is a monetary policy tool that the former can employ to adjust the monetary base in order to boost credit supply to a certain group of enterprises commercial banks should issue loans to enterprises before the former can receive the relending funds from the central bank to ensure such funds could be used in targeted areas said pan gongsheng deputy governor of the pboc this measure was announced at an executive meeting of the state council china s cabinet on sept 1 policymakers are convinced micro small and medium sized enterprises or msmes still face difficulties despite broader economic recovery from the impacts of covid 19 the recent surge in commodity prices has severely inflated msmes operational costs the central bank will therefore take measures to curb inflation and maintain price stability pan said irrespective of when the united states and some other economies might make changes to their respective monetary policy china s policy will remain in accordance with its domestic economic situation so as to promote policy independence pan said we have relatively large room for monetary policy changes our policy is still in the normalized range and we will not take flood irrigation type of easing the pboc deputy governor said zhang anyuan chief economist at china securities said the monetary policies of china and the us have shown a trend of divergence and the us is likely to keep aggressive expansionary fiscal policy while the us fed s withdrawal tapering of quantitative easing may not begin too soon china will maintain liquidity at an ample level while keeping the overall monetary policy stable said sun guofeng head of the pboc s monetary policy department under the current circumstances much liquidity may not be needed to keep the money market interest rate stable he said a key gauge that can be used to figure if the liquidity is loose or tight is the seven day repo rate in the interbank market or dr007 instead of the excess reserve ratio or the part higher than the required reserves sun said in august official data showed the average dr007 was at 2 15 percent 5 basis points lower than the seven day reverse repo rate which indicated the stable running of the money market sun said he is confident the pboc has sufficient policy tools to stabilize liquidity although the rise of fiscal expenditure and government bond issuance may result in tight financial conditions over a short period of time in the next few months the supply of and demand for liquidity will basically remain balanced and there will be no large gap of base money
politicians in washington tend to be a pretty arrogant group they think they can just define their own terms and expect everyone else just to accept these terms at face value senator manchin gives us a great example of this pattern in his wall street journal column complaining about president biden s plan for a 3 5 trillion reconciliation bill which would increase federal spending by an amount equal to roughly to 1 3 percent of gdp over the next decade manchin complained that he was worried that this spending would add too much to the debt and could spur higher inflation while the proposal would address many issues such as extending medicare to include dental and hearing coverage to expanded support for child care most of the items in the bill fit clearly under the definition of investment much of the spending goes to combat global warming either by promoting electric cars conservation and clean energy or increasing the resiliency of our infrastructure to deal with extreme weather events like hurricane ida as a practical matter spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere without regard for its impact on the climate is creating a type of debt in future years we will have more forest fires droughts and hurricanes due to a hotter planet this will impose enormous costs as governments at all levels have to evacuate people care for the injured and constantly repair and replace damaged homes businesses and infrastructure senator manchin wants to pretend that this climate debt does not exist he only wants to look at the debt that comes from the government directly borrowing money he wants to ignore that the costs that we are imposing on future generations by not taking steps to counter global warming now that may somehow work for his conscious but it is absurd in the real world also if he is concerned about inflation he may want to ask what happens to the price of beef when much of the land in the west where cattle now graze becomes too dry to support the herd or to take the case of agriculture more generally large parts of california that now provide the bulk of our fruit and vegetable production may no longer be suited for agriculture if they can t get water due to persistent droughts and we will see more housing shortages and higher house prices if rising temperatures and sea levels make much of our current housing stock inhabitable inflation can come from too much demand although that hardly seems the problem today it can also come from reduced supply which will be a problem if we insist on not taking global warming seriously i will also just briefly make the obvious point that the government creates debt not only through its direct spending but also by granting patent and copyright monopolies to things like coronavirus vaccines excerpted debt doesn t go away just because senator manchin and others in washington choose not to think about it counterpunch org

temi onifade didn t plan on being an environmental lawyer but as he looked around benin city nigeria all he could see were injustices rooted in climate inaction in a place like nigeria where the most vulnerable should be the ones that should have access to resources they do not have that access said onifade onifade a current allard law fellow came to canada in 2014 looking to learn more about climate policy and find opportunities to put climate justice into action i want to be part of that change however i can he said i m not sure i have enough power but the little that i have my voice my writings my advocacy i d be happy to contribute but despite his connections to canada he applied for dual citizenship in 2020 onifade wants to do right by the nation that taught him the importance of climate justice onifade grew up in southwest nigeria s oyo state over 200 km away from benin city benin city sits along the niger river delta which hosts oil extraction operations from multinational corporations like shell exxonmobil and chevron among others but the oil industry while an economic boon to some has been detrimental to communities across the niger delta oil spills taint drinking water and riverbeds fumes from fires and chemical laden sludge endanger neighbors young and old all the while multinational corporations continue to defer responsibility for their nigerian subsidiaries and investors continue to reap profits investors that include ubc s 1 99 billion endowment ubc is invested in exxonmobil chevron royal dutch shell plc eni spa and total se which are all fossil fuel companies operating in the niger delta there are so many other investors but ubc being a leader or claiming to be a leader in climate action should lead by example right said onifade ubc has said it will divest from fossil fuels by 2030 but what does that actually mean for students communities and our climate divestment at ubc since onifade came to ubc in 2017 movements towards endowment divestment have gained significant traction the endowment which provides funding for faculties scholarships and campus facilities is invested in a broad range of assets the ubc investment management trust imant splits ubc s billions between dozens of investment funds who pick and choose stocks bonds and other investments on its behalf the board of governors bog first rejected divestment in 2016 members cited fiduciary duty the need for investments to be profitable and financially secure to donors and the university instead bog created the fossil fuel free sustainable future pool which held 36 million as of march 2021 student pressure pushed bog to endorse partial divestment in november 2019 and full divestment by 2030 three months later but even with board approval and the legal go ahead it s taking time to actually divest in december 2020 imant announced that 34 million of the endowment had been moved to fossil fuel free funds this past march it committed to moving an additional 110 million of its total assets which includes the endowment and staff pension fund away from fossil fuels and while it has yet to discuss it publicly imant told the ubyssey in a written statement on august 9 that it intends to commit another 85 million towards a paris aligned investment that has more stringent requirements for lowering carbon emissions currently investments in fossil fuel companies and fossil fuel free funds are about even the 110 million commitment was equivalent to around 2 6 per cent of imant s portfolio in march 2021 while an additional 85 million would be around 2 per cent in contrast fossil fuel extraction and distribution firms made up around 2 2 per cent of the endowment as of june 2020 and 2 5 per cent of the staff pension fund as of december 2020 however divestment hasn t always seemed certain in april vice president of finance and operations peter smailes proposed eliminating the sustainable future pool citing high management costs the bog is slated to vote on this on september 8 the idea comes as the main endowment pool continues to invest tens of millions of dollars in fossil fuel companies without a publicly available plan for full divestment or public accountability for bad actors ubc set itself a deadline of 2030 to fully divest which is too late said anna brookes a coordinator at climate justice ubc ubc isn t really powerful when it sits on a board and tells people to do better it s powerful when it uses its gravitas as a university to withdraw support from the fossil fuel industry brookes pointed to concordia university and the university of guelph who have committed to divesting from fossil fuels by 2025 groups also remain critical of the ethical and environmental impacts of ubc s investments really what ubc is talking about is profit said britt runeckles fellow coordinator at climate justice ubc they want to make profit at the expense of marginalized people and the people that are most at risk climate change s impacts to divest or not to divest werner antweiler an environmental economics professor at the sauder school of business thinks across the board fossil fuel divestment won t work because it doesn t hurt companies bottom lines it would take pretty much a concerted effort from everyone around the world to not invest in these companies said antweiler james k rowe a professor of environmental studies at the university of victoria thinks divestment has its merits financially and politically the more that reputable institutions like universities churches and pension funds divest not only does that have some financial impact on the industry it also just sends a signal that the population has grown tired of the antics of this industry said rowe antweiler says divestment doesn t impact state subsidized oil and gas firms but would penalize some companies who ve already started funding renewable energy projects he gave the example of enbridge a natural gas company based out of calgary enbridge is very much invested in fossil fuel activities and pipelines but they re also invested in renewable energies and he said if you divest from them you divest from both rowe noted that at enbridge renewable energy is only 7 per cent of its current business and 12 per cent of its future efforts more than 65 per cent of enbridge s future funding supports the expansion of its controversial line 3 oil pipeline we ve got this 10 year window to avoid 1 5 c warming and i think that necessitates a much more direct strategy than engagement at this point rowe said according to antweiler pushing politicians to place an adequate price on carbon emissions and impose stronger regulations like the european union s proposed carbon rules would be more effective than divestment fossil fuel companies may also overlook front line communities especially in developing countries onifade explained how lobbyists in nigeria watered down a long awaited oil regulation law among these lobbyists were the royal dutch shell plc which ubc is invested in under the law fossil fuel companies must use part of their profits to fund community needs like clean water electricity and education the allocation is 3 per cent but were asking for 10 per cent said onifade it doesn t even meet them in the middle antweiler is cautiously optimistic that investors and consumers will show that social and environmental issues matter to them he thinks as fossil fuel companies transition to energy companies public pressure could force them to clean up their acts for some companies who are really not willing to move maybe divestment is sending them the right message at least in a sort of symbolic way antweiler said but other groups we have to be more careful because they may be part of the solution what does it mean to invest responsibly in july 2020 imant signed on to the united nations principles for responsible investing unpri since then imant says it has been assessing investments for environmental social and governance esg factors which include everything from pollution to labour standards to executive compensation imant s responsible investing strategy was established in september 2020 and it committed to annually disclosing its publicly held stocks last december in july 2020 it released its first endowment carbon footprint report but onifade worries that the focus on reducing carbon emissions forgets the other effects of environmental injustice like the ones taking place in the niger delta beyond destroying marine ecosystems oil extraction and spills in the niger delta are stripping farmers and fishermen of their livelihoods they also expose residents to a higher risk of developing diseases like cancer diabetes alzheimer s and parkinson s while contributing to neonatal mortality rates twice the national average ubc is invested in multiple companies extracting oil from nigeria including exxonmobil who was responsible for one million gallons of oil being spilled into the niger delta in 2010 emissions reductions don t necessarily mean you re taking into account the impact on people onifade said avocates add that emissions reduction targets are often incomplete sfu350 co president abby herd told the ubyssey in a written statement that most targets don t account for scope 3 emissions carbon released when we drive fly or dump trash into landfills if neither fossil fuel producers nor consumers count their carbon emissions climate advocates say there s no accountability what s more fossil fuel companies may underestimate their carbon footprints one recent study showed that fossil gas fracking in bc may release double the methane emissions than expected imant s portfolios are weighted more heavily towards the energy utilities that extract and distribute fossil fuels despite their flaws these investments are often kept for their stable financial returns i think the issue is really around there s no accepted methodology for collecting scope three emissions data so that s where it becomes very difficult said ubc treasurer yale loh transparency and community engagement loom large in climate advocates minds while ubc announced the beginnings of a renewable energy research hub and a centre for climate justice observers still don t know how its financial commitments are playing out late last year imant created an esg scorecard for fund managers the firms that manage ubc s investments to assess esg performance but despite board member requests the scorecard has yet to be made public a draft of the responsible investing scorecard was shared with the board of governors in february 2021 imant wrote student bog member max holmes called the draft promising but wants imant to consult with students and other community members the very principles of responsible investing and esg would tell us that we should be as transparent and open as possible with all of our investment strategies and tools holmes told the ubyssey in a written statement in june imant ceo dawn jia gave bog a responsible investing roadmap with imant s next steps unlike what s listed the active ownership policy is still being drafted it s set to be presented to bog on september 8 the policy will detail imant s approach to proxy voting where investors ask fund managers to vote on company boards and proposals on their behalf insights into the proxy voting reporting we receive from our public equity managers will be included in the responsible investing scorecard provided to imant wrote votes like these could reveal more about the political influence of fossil fuel companies in places like the niger delta we genuinely just don t know said brookes because we don t know what their esg scorecard is what their climate risk assessment measures are what their active ownership guidelines are and who their managers are so we kind of have no idea how much climate justice as a principle is showing up in any of those things loh said that smailes and imant are currently consulting on campus and outside experts about responsible investing however that s left less time for student consultation now that we re more into the carbon emissions and divestment aspects we ve been really focused on that and we haven t really had any additional student involved focus groups said loh loh acknowledged calls for transparency from imant and the vp finance office loh and jia have committed to quarterly updates before bog nonetheless loh noted that imant s first unpri report which will provide more details on carbon reduction and advocacy efforts won t be publicly released until next year to be honest it s not that we re trying to hide anything by not releasing loh said claiming that it s common practice to privately consult with unpri s accounting consultants before releasing an institution s first report in the meantime climate advocates the vp finance office and imant will challenge each other on how the divestment process should play out climate justice ubc told the ubyssey that imant stopped disclosing the endowment s fund managers late last year the group pointed to uvic s and sfu s trusts who disclose their managers and proxy voting policies the vp finance office claimed that managers asked imant to take the information down citing competitive disadvantages if they are looking at our website saying hey yeah i can see what s in your investment pool we re giving away information to competitors said loh although the fund managers for the 110 million commitment and sustainable future pool are public imant wouldn t disclose the manager of the 34 million investment meanwhile students like onifade have no direct way to raise concerns regarding environmental destruction and potential human rights abuses within ubc s investments practically speaking i m not sure that there is a mechanism that exists for said loh loh claimed even if bog raised concerns about a specific company it might be difficult to convince every fund manager to take action but as fund managers for the university of toronto and the university of victoria have confronted companies on their ethically questionable acts there may be room ahead for future advocacy climate action begins and ends with people after a summer of historic heat waves worsening wildfires and ongoing tensions over old growth forests climate action is on the minds of many but to groups who are disproportionately affected by extreme heat out of control blazes and conflicts over land and resource management calls for climate action have resonated much longer there is a long list of vulnerable people in that category including indigenous peoples in canada and internationally children the elderly and workers said onifade ubc s climate emergency declaration acknowledged that climate change in the form of rising heat natural disasters disease famine and mass migration will exacerbate existing inequities however acknowledging a problem isn t the same as addressing it while onifade thinks the climate action plan 2020 cap 2020 was a step in the right direction he believes it lacked emphasis on equity affordability and justice he s hoping that the upcoming climate action plan 2030 fills that gap focuses mostly on technologies and economic strategies including energy efficiency reducing emissions from old and new buildings as well as vehicles and other sources of emissions onifade said the emphasis is not on the people on occasion ubc has engaged with climate vulnerable communities when discussing sustainability but despite charters and coalitions urging collective action to address climate change community members want to know how ubc s financial organizations will support the people who are most impacted by it details remain scarce for now imant s roadmap appears to place climate justice in the nondescript category of other social and governance targets slated for 2022 loh agrees that all stakeholders should have a seat at the table climate justice ubc says it wants to help but it still doesn t know if past recommendations were heard the group pointed to the climate emergency task force cetf report which bog endorsed in february i think of undrip in particular that ubc prided itself on being the first north american university to sign on to said climate justice ubc coordinator runeckles yet in its current process of divestment ubc is still investing in that harm indigenous people onifade thinks that ubc should advocate for climate justice beyond canada s borders his foray into environmental law began when he represented renewable energy entrepreneurs in southwestern nigeria but couldn t find government organizations or companies who would invest in them we know nigeria is a resource country and getting incentives for renewables should be easy said onifade but even with the few incentives that we had big corporations had more access to them onifade still wants immediate divestment from fossil fuels but he thinks that capitalist power structures have put ubc in a bind for now onifade suggests three low hanging fruit for the university to pursue while committing to divestment first onifade wants universities to approach climate change as an intersectional issue according to onifade ubc could improve climate research by having its research ethics boards consider climate justice and potential impacts on indigenous and climate vulnerable communities researchers in fields ranging from environmental policy and earth sciences to business forestry and mining would be asked how their projects minimize potential harm and benefit climate impacted peoples that would show that those researchers respect communities and respond to important climate justice concerns onifade said second onifade wants the university to expand technical resources available to students faculty and community groups on and off campus ideally ubc would build connections with climate vulnerable communities around the world for cooperative research he suggested connecting efforts like the sustainability scholars program with interdisciplinary groups like the liu institute network for africa to share knowledge and better understand regional issues third onifade wants the university to bolster funding opportunities for student projects and volunteers in climate justice and equity efforts loh acknowledged that despite best efforts climate related initiatives on campus may face inconsistent flows of funding from year to year largely the reason we ve had to cobble together one time funding is that we ve had to cobble together funding from somewhere else in the university to try and do that loh said and while onifade knows that the economics of funding certain climate justice projects may be a tough sell he says it s well worth the social cultural environmental and health benefits shared by the entire community some climate justice projects may not necessarily because the values and lessons of climate justice are bringing an additional lens to cover other values that are not prioritized by say technology or economics he said all in all onifade wants those bracing for the brunt of climate change s impacts to not just have a voice but have the means to create change for the world and for themselves some people would argue that it s just environmental injustice but this is what drew me to the justice part of climate policy the niger delta s also has to do with justice britt runeckles is a member of the ubyssey

rosalia indongo wanted to get a covid 19 vaccine then her country namibia ran out of doses and then she got sick while the united states and a handful of other countries are already offering covid 19 booster shots health care workers in dozens of low income countries haven t yet had a first dose a nurse by training indongo 56 oversees a health care nonprofit in windhoek namibia that works on health care policy to improve outcomes for hiv patients since the pandemic s arrival her team has shifted their focus to the the coronavirus and what can be done to slow its spread due to heart health complications in may indongo said she missed a chance to get vaccinated with either astrazeneca or sinopharm which was developed in china namibia then stopped distributing vaccines they had used up their stock a few weeks later the sub saharan nation experienced a surge of cases and an outbreak occurred at indongo s office she became so sick in early july that she was hospitalized for 17 days 10 of which she needed to receive oxygen treatment today indongo remains unvaccinated and hopes that medical issues linked to her covid 19 infection do not prevent her from getting her first shot later this month while namibia has amassed one of the highest reported covid 19 death tolls in africa and experts say that s likely an undercount an estimated 92 percent of its population is still unvaccinated the dangerous trend is fueled in part by vaccine hesitancy but also due to a lack of supply everything is being grabbed up by the wealthier countries indongo said the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare wide disparities in health care between countries on issues like vaccines and raised calls for more resource sharing to save lives almost two dozen vaccines exist worldwide but high income countries home to less than half of the planet s population hold 80 percent of all doses according to the world health organization one estimate suggests that a quarter of people worldwide are fully vaccinated but fewer than 2 percent of people living in low income countries have received a single dose that disparity is fueling the pandemic said dr kate o brien the who s director of immunization vaccines and biologicals debate over boosters last month the who called for a global moratorium on covid 19 vaccine boosters until at least the end of september that would give each country enough time to vaccinate at least 10 percent of their population according to the who it s unconscionable that some covid19 vaccine producing companies are reporting record profits and some countries are offering boosters while so many people remain unprotected who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus tweeted on aug 17 no one is safe until everyone is safe president joe biden has pushed back against this criticism saying the u s pledged to donate 600 million vaccine doses to covax an initiative designed to improve global vaccine access that is overseen by the who coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations and others he also said the u s has given more vaccine to other countries than every other country in the world combined we can take care of america and help the world at the same time biden said during a speech in mid august but those doses are not getting to the people and countries who need them fast enough said dr tom frieden former director for the centers for disease control and prevention who leads the global health initiative called resolve to save lives since mid april namibia has received roughly a fifth of its allocated 108 000 doses of astrazeneca vaccines from covax according to gavi the vaccine alliance while more than 5 out of every 10 people in the u s are fully vaccinated against coronavirus in india which produces most of the world s vaccine stockpile the number is one out of 10 and across the african continent fewer than 3 percent of the population has been vaccinated dr john nkengasong a virologist who directs the africa centres for disease control and prevention told pbs newshour correspondent william brangham on tuesday adding that he has not seen the science yet that justify boosters the lack of global vaccine equity is problematic both ethically and epidemiologically frieden said the longer there is uncontrolled spread anywhere in the world the higher the risk that there will be even worse variants emerging frieden said more variants each time someone gets sick with the coronavirus and infects another person that gives the virus a chance to mutate it s a biological gamble that could make the virus weaker or stronger unchecked infections allowed the delta variant to emerge which is far more transmissible than the original strain when vaccines are used with other health measures those transmission chains stop especially when most people within a community have gotten their shots the vaccines have their best chance at having maximum impact on protecting against disease and death when they can be rolled out to achieve a population level of immunity without pressure from the virus on the vaccine o brien said until more communities have broader access to vaccines o brien said it is too soon to take our foot off the pedal by relaxing covid 19 restrictions even in nations with higher vaccination rates boosting access aside from donating vaccine doses o brien said countries that have enjoyed an abundance of vaccines should also free up supply chains and share technology with other parts of the world to improve capacity to manufacture and distribute doses around the globe countries also need to evaluate export restrictions on supplies key vaccine ingredients and the finished product an announcement in late july from the who seemed like a step in that direction a technology transfer hub is planned for capetown south africa in order to undo the global imbalance of manufacturing capacity of covid 19 vaccines and technologies south africa endured months of a sluggish vaccine rollout and some estimates suggest the nation has since reported one of the highest vaccination rates across the continent but those facilities will take time to build up and won t stave off suffering and death happening right now o brien said to get vaccines where they need to be experts on the ground are working through africa cdc to train local health care workers and ramp up supplies said chris skopec executive vice president for project hope a global health organization that collaborates with and assists health ministries in other countries it s a race and we re racing from behind skopec said long way to go indongo who has a lingering cough and respiratory problems said she survived her covid infection because she knew the warning signs of the virus and where to find help she noted that most people don t have those resources and often rely on home remedies to nurse themselves back to health methods that may not work for this novel virus improving vaccine access will be crucial to saving more namibians and she becomes deeply frustrated when leaders in wealthier countries talk about giving booster shots to people who have already been fully vaccinated they should think first about those that do not have before this talk about the booster or whatever they should think first about those that do not have before this talk about the booster or whatever she said indongo already fears the next coronavirus variant especially if vaccines remain largely out of reach for most of the world s population in addition to fueling more suffering she said it also will succeed in further deepening disparities that already have cost so many people their lives if another wave comes the first thing that will happen to the world is close the borders go into lockdown she said what does that do to those ones who do not have they are still disadvantaged
islamabad finance minister shaukat tarin is chairing a meeting to discuss the revised circular debt managem ent plan on tuesday app islamabad the government on tuesday appeared set to increase the electricity tariff it had put on hold in april as part of revised circular debt managem ent plan cdmp and efforts to ensure continuous foreign inflows from lending agencies particularly the imf the world bank and the asian development bank the tariff increase along with cdmp is expected to set into motion from oct 1 but has to be discussed in detail by the economic coordination comm ittee ecc of the cabinet within a few days the tariff increases would be made through quarterly adjustments and surcharges in a phased manner to shape up the exact size of tariff increase along with other measures to contain and reduce circular debt finance minister shaukat tarin energy minister hammad azhar sapm on power and petroleum tabish gauhar and secretaries of finance and power besides other senior officials of the two divisions had a detailed discussions on tuesday mr tarin azhar and gohar did not respond to calls for comments tarin tells energy ministry team to adopt forward planning while dealing with volatile energy prices in international markets we want a final shape of the cdmp shared with the imf and the world bank by next weekend to have some sort of understanding within 15 days a senior government official told dawn he said it was important that when finance minister shaukat tarin visits washington early next month for oct 11 17 world bank imf annual meetings the ministry of finance and imf staff are on the same page regarding the revival of 6bn imf programme currently in recess the official said the world bank executive board would separately be meeting in the last week of this month to approve three different programme loans particularly the 400 million energy sector loan he said various scenarios were discussed including the full revival of tariff increase plan committed with the imf and the subsequent challenges arising out of increasing size of fuel cost adjustments fca partly because of record high lng prices on a monthly basis definitely the consumers are in double jeopardy in the shape of base tariff increase when fcas are ranging between re1 to rs1 50 per month the official conceded adding the government has so far been advocating 18 20pc increase in industrial electricity consumption because of cheaper rates on incremental consumption as a success story to address power surplus challenge but you have to take a decision at some point after committing about rs5 65 per unit increase in power tariff with imf early this year to generate about rs900bn by june 2023 the government increased tariff by about rs2 per unit early this year and backtracked from second round of rs1 40 per unit with effect from april 1 in the heat of such tariff increases prime minister imran khan replaced dr abdul hafeez shaikh with shaukat tarin as finance minister the official said the target to generate rs900bn through tariff adjustments till june 2023 remained unchanged as in the original cdmp agreed with the imf and the world bank last year the schedule and size of adjustments may be slightly different he said a finance ministry statement quoted the finance minister as telling the team of energy ministry led by mr azhar to adopt forward planning while dealing with the volatile energy prices in international markets and also emphasised the importance of risk hedging to dampen the impact of recent fluctuations in global prices of crude oil and petroleum products particularly due to supply side disruptions amid covid 19 pandemic the finance minister also stressed upon exploring cost effective options such as renewable sources of energy for a sustainable energy equation by reducing reliance on expensive power producing plants in order to make the energy sector dynamic and sustainable the energy minister explained growing demand for energy installed generation capacity transmission capability and also outlined steps being taken for improving transmission and distribution systems for reducing costs and ensuring sustainability the statement said mr tarin said the government was cognizant of its obligation to fulfill energy requirements at affordable rates for electricity consumers and was taking all possible measures to meet future energy demands under the plan committed with the imf the power sector was to get an additional financial injection of rs2 650 trillion in two years this included rs1 060tr revenue generation through various tariff adjustments and rebasing and by the government 40pc contribution followed by rs850bn worth of governance efficiency and recovery efforts of the power division 32pc and rs740bn by the finance division 28pc through realistic allocation and timely payment of subsidies similarly the power division was responsible to put together rs850bn through 5 73pc improvement in overall recovery of billing rs205bn for 2 12pc reduction in system losses rs130bn reduction in ipps markup on stock payments rs67bn impact of reduction in return on equity secured from ipps rs146bn and payment by ke worth rs303bn including rs127bn starting with july 2021 and rs175bn in fy23 the power division had estimated the average consumer tariff to increase from about rs16 per
