zoller chief executive officer thank you peggy and welcome everyone i m pleased to report yet another quarter of strong results driven by our specialty businesses which reported record results again and represented 53 of total ebitda this exceptional performance was augmented by commodity price upside as our sales in the quarter were equally supported by increased demand and higher prices we are currently well on track to achieve our strategic goals on slide 3 you can see some highlights from each division industrial products record quarter was driven by increased demand for our specialty product offerings and supported by long term contracts as some of our customers would rather purchase bromine compounds from us versus producing their own for potash during the quarter we successfully completed both our one week annual maintenance shutdown at the dead sea and the ramp project in spain phosphate solutions delivered a record breaking quarter across the board with strength in both specialty food phosphates and industrial salts combined with higher commodity prices innovative ag solutions showed sales growth across all product lines with higher prices and volumes we also completed the acquisition of compass minerals south american plant nutrition business and while i ll talk more about this exciting news a bit later i d like to turn to slide 4 where you can see just how important this acquisition is to our leadership strategy while our acquisitions in brazil will help to provide seasonal balance between the northern and southern hemispheres and provide opportunities to expand our product reach they will also firmly establish our agriculture business as a leader in the specialty plant nutrition and move us even closer to our 2025 targets our food business is also expanding as we continue to focus on food specialties in the second quarter alternative protein sales were up significantly as we are seeing organic growth from existing customers and also have a strong pipeline of new customers we are working with our new alternative protein plant in st louis which we expect to become operational in the fourth quarter of this year will help provide the means to meet this increased customer demand for our innovative products which is yet another part of our 2025 leadership strategy for our industrial business which is more than just industrial products while we continue to benefit from long term contracts in that division we are also investing in innovative new products and looking to grow our capacity to meet existing demand our research and development efforts are targeting the creation of new sustainability applications which will help us reach the 2025 targets i shared with you at our investor day last september turning to slide 5 you can see our progress over the past four quarters with sales of 1 6 billion in the second quarter up more than 30 year over year adjusted ebitda of 351 million was up more than 40 over the prior year in total we have already delivered more than 3 billion of sales this year with adjusted ebitda of well over 600 million and we expect to be ahead of our pre covid profitability for this year in the second quarter we continued to report strong cash generation with operating cash flow of 242 million up 65 million year over year free cash flow of 94 million was also very strong and up more than 350 with all divisions contributing our complete second quarter results are on slide 6 where once again you can see growth in every single financial metric this continued improvement is a reflection of the success we are seeing as we focus on providing specialty solutions while benefiting from a strong upcycle in commodities post covid 19 moving on to slide 7 let s begin our segment review with industrial products where we had an all time quarterly sales record of 410 million up 44 versus the second quarter of 2020 and record ebitda of 128 million which was up 45 the business delivered record results for both bromine and phosphorus based products with continued strong demand for flame retardance driven by the electronics automotive textiles and construction end markets other end markets also showed resilience including the supplements and pharmaceutical end markets which resulted in record results for our magnesia based products we also saw improvement in some oil and gas markets which resulted in year over year sales growth in clear brine fluids but however overall demand trends remain under pressure and have not returned to pre covid levels and such is unlikely to occur in 2021 elemental bromine prices continued to rise hitting record spot prices in china where higher demand for flame retardants is facing limited local supply while we are benefiting from the exuberance in the market we expect prices to stabilize going forward nonetheless we are currently facing higher input and logistics costs as well as some raw material constraints with tbba production at capacity we are pursuing expansion opportunities and planning to bring on additional capacity through debottlenecking and other efforts however this will take a few more months this is in addition to the tbba capacity we added last year which as you know is already sold out turning now to slide 8 and a review of potash we successfully finished our annual one week maintenance shutdown at the dead sea in early april and completed approximately 80 projects during that time as i mentioned during our first quarter call the ramp project in spain which connects our cabanasses mine and suria plant was also completed in april and is now operational and ramping up to capacity this mine is expected to reach a production run rate of approximately 1 million tons by the beginning of 2022 the positive potash environment continued in the second quarter with prices increasing across all key markets sales of 412 million were up 21 over the prior year s second quarter while ebitda of 85 million was up 6 grain prices continued to increase due to strong global demand and supply remained tight with pressure from higher freight rates we now expect to see significantly more benefit from recent price increases in the second half of this year with improvement also driven by the expected increase in production in spain turning to slide 9 and our phosphate solutions division which reported record sales for specialties commodities and our yph joint venture in total sales of 623 million were up more than 40 year over year phosphate solutions recorded ebitda of 134 million which was up nearly 125 and was the highest of all of our divisions for specialties both food phosphates and industrial salts saw strong demand with higher prices across most regions and industries food specialties saw strong momentum in north america with product innovation contributing as foodservice demand began to recover industrial salts benefited from the institutional cleaning solutions end market showing signs of improvement for commodities price improvement continued in the second quarter along with increased prices for raw materials mainly sulfur and higher freight rates combined with supply chain challenges yph sales were up on higher prices and volumes with continued improvement in efficiency growth in our white phosphoric acid business was universal across all regions but with a particular significant increase in south america finally turning to slide 10 and our innovative ag solutions where all product lines showed sales growth and total sales reached 237 million up 20 year over year record second quarter ebitda of 27 million was also up more than 20 on strong performance specialty agriculture sales were up on increased volumes of straight liquid and controlled release fertilizers with growth in all key regions our turf and ornamental business is having a great year and once again delivered record sales as all geographies showed improvement but with new markets doing especially well new categories also performed well specifically liquids biostimulants water conservation and grass seeds of course the big news which i already mentioned is the completion of our acquisition of the specialty plant nutrition business of compass minerals which was finalized on july 1 we re delighted to have this business join our plant nutrition portfolio and to welcome its team and its customers to icl as i mentioned this important step delivers on our stated strategy of achieving leadership positions in high growth specialty plant nutrition markets and accelerates our progress toward long term global leadership of our innovative ag solutions division this acquisition will significantly expand our product portfolio and profitability and allow us to deliver the critical mass we have been seeking in brazil it will also provide further seasonal balance between northern and southern hemispheres and make us the leading specialty plant nutrition company in brazil one of the world s fastest growing agriculture markets if you turn to slide 11 i d like to walk through just a few key highlights before turning the call over to kobi for a review of our financials to achieve balanced long term growth we will continue to expand the profit contribution from our specialty businesses while taking advantage when possible of commodity upside this approach has benefited us in 2021 as we have seen consistent strength in all our businesses with each contributing to our improvement in ebitda we will also remain focused on value over volume in our industrial products business by partnering with our customers to supply specialty products based on long term partnerships we will maintain and optimize our potash operations so we can continue to benefit from this very foundational part of our business we will target long term phosphates specialties growth through our focus on food products and in innovative ag solutions we will look forward to new opportunities in brazil as we expand our product offerings and take on a leadership position in specialty plant nutrition finally we remain committed to meeting our 2025 goals in our focused markets of sustainable agriculture food and industrial solutions by means of expansion innovation and plain old hard work once again this has been a fantastic quarter for icl and as always i would like to thank the truly talented family of employees we have across the globe and also extend a very warm welcome to our newest members in brazil we re glad to have you join us with that i ll turn the call over to kobi kobi altman chief financial officer thank you raviv and to all of you for joining us today as we report significant improvement in year over year results which raviv just reviewed on slide 13 you can see that in addition to our continued operational outperformance we also maintained our financial strengths and delivered continuous growth in cash generation operating cash flow of 242 million was up 65 million over the second quarter of last year and up 105 million for the first half of this year free cash flow also improved significantly in the quarter up 74 million year over year and also up 105 million for the first half of 2021 our net debt to ebitda ratio improved to 2 1 times from 2 4 times in the first quarter of this year and second quarter of last year this is good improvement and we expect to make further progress even as we make strategic acquisitions during the second quarter our investment grade credit ratings were reaffirmed on june 21 fitch reaffirmed our senior unsecured rating at bbb minus and provided a stable outlook of our long term issuer default rating just a few days later on june 23 s p reaffirmed our international credit rating and senior unsecured rating of bbb minus specifically fitch called out our strong business profile which stems from our strategic assets in the dead sea stable earnings due to our leadership in bromine our focus on increasing sales of specialty products and our efficient diversification of geographies and end markets as well as our strong liquidity for the second quarter our liquidity increased slightly over the first quarter and on june 30 we had approximately 1 2 billion available as you know we closed the acquisition of compass minerals south american plant nutrition business on july 1 and funded the purchase through our cash generation and through the monetization of some nonoperational assets from our balance sheet including the sale of some yyth shares and also the divestment of a business in china turning to slide 14 while we all know commodity prices and freight rates have been going up this visual representation helps tell the story while we have benefited from increases in potash and phosphate prices we ve also been impacted to a lesser degree by higher freight rates and raw material prices for the second quarter transportation cost had a negative impact of approximately 30 million as we saw a net increase of nearly 20 per ton shipped you can see these amounts on slide 15 as raviv mentioned earlier our sales in the quarter were equally supported by increased demand and higher prices on the right side of the slide however you can see the impact higher raw material and freight rates had on our adjusted ebitda if we net the 175 million of positive price impact for our products against the more than 50 million increase in cost of raw materials and energy and a 30 million increase in transportation cost you can see we received a tailwind of approximately 90 million if you ll turn to slide 16 we have the same results broken out by division clearly phosphate specialties was a big contributor to our growth in the quarter coming in with record sales and ebitda and it s evident we are executing on our strategic goal to create a more balanced contribution from our four growth engines with another solid quarter behind us and as we have continued to see improved market conditions we have reevaluated our adjusted ebitda guidance for the full year which you can see on slide 17 we now expect an adjusted ebitda range of between 1 35 billion and 1 375 billion and this amount includes our recently completed south american plant nutrition acquisition in addition we are in the process of adopting the recommendation of the taskforce for climate related financial disclosure known as tcfd and the standards put forward by the sustainability accounting standard board as the benchmark frameworks for our disclosure of climate related risk beginning with our fiscal 2021 annual reporting before q a i would like to talk a little bit about slide 18 and our sustainability report which will be published next week icl s vision includes ambitious goals aimed at addressing major challenges facing society and the global environment and we are committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 we are on a mission transforming from a company that extract minerals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 by 2030 to increase our share of renewable energy consumption to 50 by 2040 to increase our circular economy and water savings impact by an additional 3 annually to support community initiatives by contributing 1 of pre tax income and to promote personal environment responsibility and volunteering among our employees these are ambitious goals but as you can see on the slide we have made our commitment to sustainability a priority over the past few years as we believe these efforts benefit our communities our employees and you our shareholders on final note before we turn the call back over to the operator i would like to recognize our ceo ravin zoller who has been named chairman of the international fertilizer association sustainability committee this is a fantastic and well deserved honor recognizing icl as a sustainability leader among its fertilizer peers and on behalf of icl i congratulate him and with that operator we can begin the q a questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of alexander jones of bank of america please ask your question alexander jones bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks very much good afternoon three questions if i may please a first on potash in the context of the guidance clearly guidance has gone up and potash prices arguably have gone up even further so could you give a little bit color behind what potash price you re assuming in your guidance or what average selling price you re assuming for the second half so we can contextualize that versus the spot market the second question also on potash is around the cost side i think cost is perhaps slightly higher than had been expected this quarter is that just a freight issue or is there anything else you d like to call out there and how should we think about the evolution of costs in potash going into the second half of the year and a final question on industrial products raviv you mentioned that the chinese market has been exuberant and you would expect some normalization there over time in your pricing this quarter how much of that pricing benefit reflects that exuberance or should we not expect much downward correction in your pricing even if the chinese market normalizes a little bit thank you raviv zoller chief executive officer ok thanks alexander for the questions i ll ask you to repeat the third question because i couldn t hear it all in terms of potash prices last quarter as we spoke to you we were sold out through almost august now we re sold out through october so we actually know the realized price for q3 and it s coming in at about 297 in comparison to 251 in the second quarter so that s on third quarter potash in terms of costs you have the breakdown in the presentation in the appendixes so you can see everything other than higher freight costs and energy costs there s nothing out of the ordinary to call out and could you repeat the question about exuberance in china just so i m sure i answer the right question alexander jones bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes yeah just on your pricing benefit in industrial products how much of that is reflecting the significant rise in chinese spot prices or how much is that just the sort of gradual innovation mix benefit over time just to get a sense of if the chinese market does correct as you think it might should we expect pricing to come back down a little bit for that division raviv zoller chief executive officer ok great question the spot market prices are going up most of our business is not spot in fact 90 of our business is compounds so even if it comes down there will be very very little effect on the results in the coming months alexander jones bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you raviv zoller chief executive officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of vincent andrews from morgan stanley please ask your question will tang morgan stanley analyst hi guys this is will tang on for vincent thanks for taking my question i m just wondering if you guys can talk about your raw material costs i m wondering if any of these raw material constraints have impacted you on the volume side in any of your segments thus far and how has that raw material picture kind of developed into the second half of the year so far raviv zoller chief executive officer ok so the raw material issues are related mainly to our phosphate and industrial products division on phosphate the issue is sulfur and you re all familiar in the market prices of sulfur so sulfur prices were going up and they re not at this point so we pretty much we ve consumed the effect there was some there were some issues regarding our ports in israel that sulfur got held up coming in so we had some logistic issues but in terms of pricing everything is well known on the side of industrial products and raw materials for bromine and phosphorus the current increases that we experienced in the past few months have been passed on to our customers the market is such that there s excess demand and in fact as i mentioned in the last conference call unfortunately we could not supply all of the demand and we had to turn down customers in the second quarter to an extent that we don t like we ve debottlenecked a little and got through some complex logistic issues and we have a little more capacity in q3 so we hope that we don t need to turn down customers it s never good to turn down customers but raw materials pricing is not an issue for industrial products because of the market dynamics or demand dynamics the issue was actual availability because of force majeure of certain raw materials and fortunately that s behind us it created some issues for second quarter logistics but we re past that right now i hope that answers and thanks will will tang morgan stanley analyst yeah thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of geoff haire of ubs please ask your question geoff haire ubs analyst good afternoon i just had a couple of questions first of all i was wondering if you could help us with what the contribution from compass minerals will be in the second half or on a full year basis going forward and also can i just ask how the esg targets that you ve outlined there the sustainability targets are linked into management compensation raviv zoller chief executive officer ok so on compass geoff on compass we modeled 45 million of adjusted ebitda contribution for the second quarter i don t want to talk about 2022 at this point because it depends on the synergies that we will target for 2022 and we re going to make we re going to build our model based on the first few months we re more focused on a clean integration and not disrupting the existing business so that s the model for the second half of the year and it s not a linear model so that doesn t mean it reflects about 90 for the year brazil is second half oriented second half of the year so 45 means about 55 or 60 for the year that s in terms of this year in terms of next year again it depends on synergies and we ll get back to you on that on esg we have quite a few targets of course we ve adopted a zero neutral policy for 2050 we also adopted a policy of 40 renewable energy by 2040 and 30 decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 we also have some other esg targets regarding diversity regarding water savings and circular economy regarding safety and some others all of these we have nine kpis altogether have annual targets and they re part of management compensation each one of the gc which is the executive management committee in icl each one of us has those kpis in their remuneration it s a certain it s a different component depending on it s a different component of the bonus schedule for different people but we each have those as team goals and we each get compensated based on achieving those goals and we intend to achieve those goals geoff haire ubs analyst great thank you raviv zoller chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of joel jackson from bmo capital markets please ask your question joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning everyone i had a few questions i m going to ask them one by one raviv i thought you said on a question earlier question on this call that the potash realized price for you was 251 in q2 and things are trending to be about 297 in q3 but i mean you reported 281 per ton for potash in q2 can you just reconcile that please raviv zoller chief executive officer yes 251 is fob it s fob it s our realized price and 281 is priced before freight and others joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst ok so if we can expand upon that you re seeing that before freight pricing is now averaging about 45 to 50 a ton higher in q3 that s right raviv zoller chief executive officer correct joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst and then what would be either higher freight costs you re seeing in q3 that might scrape away some of that raviv zoller chief executive officer no no the 297 is after freight cost the we already know the realized freight cost which is about 39 so it s 336 before the freight costs coming to 297 so the first quarter was 238 the second quarter 251 not a big change as i mentioned in april we were sold out through july and in the third quarter it s 297 which is net of 336 and fourth quarter we expect obviously higher numbers joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst great that s perfect ok that s good on that can you talk about polysulphate in the first half of the year you gave some volumes volume is up a lot now what s the contribution on earnings and when do you think it could be profitable in that business raviv zoller chief executive officer it s a good question and as we stand right now our production level in the second quarter was a little less than 200 000 tons which is behind budget we were planning to produce about 220 000 in the quarter the good news is that we sold more than we expected in the quarter we sold about 180 000 tons which was well above our original target unfortunately some of those sales were fixed in the beginning of the year at lower prices than we currently realize and so unfortunately we didn t have a good result in the second quarter we lost over 10 million in that business in the second quarter we re still ramping up we re still looking at improvements on two dimensions one increased production which we re pretty sure of and the other is demanding a higher premium on the product the problem with the contracts that were settled early on in the year is that we of course didn t expect such high transportation costs and when you have low price per ton and the transportation cost per ton is fixed no matter what the pricing of the product then it hurts low priced products so that will give you a little bit of color and of course we ll report on progress in the continuation of the year joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst that was really good color on that raviv and just my final question so i look at your potash inventories they re quite low obviously you had some downtime in spain are you going to build inventory in potash here or are you going to try to run really low to add a bit more capacity into spain as 22 comes on raviv zoller chief executive officer first of all we have to prove the 1 million tons toward the end of this year and then we have the next ramp up is to 1 3 million tons we re at an all time low level of inventory in the dead sea because the market is undersupplied and there s excess demand and pricing is very very attractive you know about brazil our last sale in brazil i believe was 620 hundred in the u s our last sale i think was 540 per ton per short ton so that translates into about 600 and just this over the weekend we our last sale in thailand was also 600 so at 600 for potash we don t intend to hold inventory there s nothing to wait for and so that doesn t mean that the price won t go higher it just means that as long as we have enough inventory to operate we ll go as low as we can joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you very much raviv zoller chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of duffy fischer from barclays please ask your question unknown speaker this is sean good morning on for duffy just a couple of questions from me i guess first one tagging onto i guess an earlier question is there any way you can give a sense of how much production and ip you guys had to kind of curtail because of raw materials raviv zoller chief executive officer i m not sure i can give you an exact answer in tons i can say that the missed opportunity in sales was around 40 million in sales which comes out to over 10 million in operating income on average which means on margin is higher unknown speaker got it that makes sense appreciate that and then second question just around generally your take around the phosphate market as we sit here today if i asked you to give kind of a 12 month view looking out into the middle of next year do you get a sense that we re at peak spot pricing now or how do you see that market unfolding over the next 12 months raviv zoller chief executive officer honestly i don t know better than you guys do it s everybody is looking at the current state of the market and not seeing not seeing any reason for prices to go down at the same time the prices are highest they ve been for many years and sulfur is not going up anymore and sulfur is a catalyst for prices going up so i think the marginal catalyst now is freight costs freight costs are still going up and as long as they go up there s sort of a demand orientation in the atmosphere in the market so i can tell you that everybody around me is talking about prices stabilizing to going up i don t hear people talking about prices going down analysts are revising their assumptions so analysts had thought the second half of the year there would be a significant downturn have moved up their predictions but the short answer is i really don t know i can tell you that we re sold out on phosphate until the end of october unknown speaker appreciate it i ll turn it over thank you so much raviv zoller chief executive officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of laurence alexander from jefferies please ask your question dan rizzo jefferies analyst good morning this is dan rizzo on for lawrence have customers supply chain constraints affected demand or delayed sales in any way particularly in the industrial segment raviv zoller chief executive officer yes as i mentioned before we had some raw material issues due to force majeure and some other logistic challenges they didn t that didn t last for very long we found alternative supply but that sort of comes into the missed demand or missed sales that i referred to earlier dan rizzo jefferies analyst ok and then you mentioned i think doing some debottlenecking i was just wondering how much capacity do you expect that to add raviv zoller chief executive officer we are going to add a few thousand tons it s going to be north of 5 000 and the south of 10 000 but that s what we re talking about within about one year yes correct dan rizzo jefferies analyst ok and then finally have you given what your synergy targets are overall for the cmp acquisition raviv zoller chief executive officer no we haven t it s too early and the big question is not what the total synergies could be but rather the timing of the synergies in terms of their effect on our results in the coming couple of years so we will give transparency on that at the later part of the year dan rizzo jefferies analyst ok thank you very much raviv zoller chief executive officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of kyle quant of citigroup please ask your question unknown speaker hi there thank you for the opportunity to ask questions i ve just got a couple if i may on the industrial products i wonder if you d be able to give an indication of the weighting between sort of bromine based products and phosphorus and magnesia based just to get an idea of relative weighting that would be great and then secondly on phosphate solutions your stated aim is to become more specialty based yes aim to be a bit more specialty based but with commodity prices where they are you actually it results in a bit of a higher margin actually and would you might you pause that move for now and focus a little bit on commodities while the commodity prices are as high as they are thank you raviv zoller chief executive officer ok so i ll start with phosphate look our strategy is to increase our specialties if we can above and beyond commodities so if it s alternative proteins we don t need additional phosphate capacity for that and so we re growing that business separately but for our given capacity of phosphate production we would rather increase our specialties component to 70 we re very certain that in the long run on average specialties will be more profitable and also more stable and we have unique value added products we re creating tremendous amounts of new innovation in fact our internal accelerator which we call big in the past year and a half has created additional future ebitda at a run rate of 80 million and about half of that is coming from the phosphate division so we think that the right strategy is to be as competitive as we can where we are global leaders we have about 25 of the global phosphate specialty market and we want to increase that share and we want to increase the value add of that share so that s on phosphate that doesn t mean that if we have an opportunistic situation that we can leverage on and we can take steps in the short run to benefit and we do so it s rather marginal but we do so and we could consider but the strategy with specialties we re very determined on industrial products and the product mix about 75 of the total business is bromine related of which 10 of that is bromine and the rest is compounds and then about 10 about 20 of the business a little less about 17 or 18 is phosphorus related and the balance is the specialty minerals unknown speaker thank you raviv zoller chief executive officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of joel jackson from bmo capital market please ask your question your line is open please ask your question joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst sorry i just want to follow up on the brazilian acquisition so obviously you ve covered compass i ve covered compass so we ve got that segment in our model you didn t buy the chemical side i think you misspoke raviv you said that it did 45 million in q2 is that what you think it s going to be in the second half of the year raviv zoller chief executive officer second half of the year yes joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst ok and that business did about 60 million for compass of course you didn t buy the chemical side which is a smaller part of it what s kind of the growth you re seeing in that business because and then i also want to ask a question about compass really struggled on that business to get any kind of growth there there was some currency pressures it wasn t a natural business for compass it might be more of a natural business for you what can you do to get better results out of that business raviv zoller chief executive officer ok it s a great question first of all i think that the basic difference is that for us the compass plant nutrition business that we acquired which now is called icl america do sul is a part of our core business and it was nowhere near any part of the core business of the previous owner and i think that means a lot because it s an extension it s a new extension of our product distribution capability it s bringing into our organization additional expertise additional r d additional relationships with customers so given that some of our products we currently don t sell in brazil not because there s a lack of demand but because we don t have the right distribution system and in some cases we don t have the ability to produce locally that s definitely going to pick up and in the case of our new business it s an amazing business it has direct distribution to 50 of its customers which means that it allows us to get closer to the customer and we re becoming a very customer centric organization that can create a lot of added value and we want to get closer to the customers so the synergies are everything from global procurement which allows better procurement of raw materials to information exchange on r d to direct distribution of some of the products that don t go to direct distribution today in some cases don t even go to distributors but go to importers so we can do better on that side and of course this is all just the beginning we just acquired the company the company is already growing this year it s growing at over 20 i take that some of what you said has to do with the fact that the currency is the currency has fluctuated in a bad way over the years and so their growth sort of disappeared because the local currency was weak but we can t predict the future in terms of what happens to the currency the company is growing very very nicely in local currency and like i said over 20 this year their performance in the first half was above the budget and above the model that we used and so we re very happy with the beginning again it s m a integration needs to be seamless needs to be responsible we don t want to disrupt something that s working very very well so we re working with the local team that we think are an amazing group together in order to figure out what makes sense in terms of potential synergies everybody is excited like any new adventure and we want to do it carefully responsibly and get the most out of the acquisition joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you raviv zoller chief executive officer thank you operator we have no further questions at this time i will now hand the call back to kobi kobi altman chief financial officer thank you thank you everyone for joining us and

sequential increase of 50 compared to the first quarter of this year this performance was mainly the result of higher mobility levels throughout the country in accordance with the epidemiological traffic alert system the airports that contributed the most to our passenger traffic recovery in volume terms were mazatlan which delivered growth as compared to the second quarter of 2019 durango reynosa zihuatanejo culiacan additionally vaccination rollout programs in mexico and the united states allowed for gradual increased levels of passengers during the quarter particularly on the international side which stood at 98 5 of the international passengers in second quarter of 2019 the international passenger recovery is primarily driven by destinations such as houston san antonio and dallas in july the level of covid 19 cases had begun to increase again as well as epidemiological alert levels in the country currently of the nice states where oma has operations one state is in red status three in orange four in yellow and one in green we are confident that our passenger traffic will continue to evolve positively in the following months as the pace of vaccination dollar in mexico and the us makes progress and economic activity continues to improve it is worth highlighting that in q2 2021 three new routes opened monterrey mcallen monterrey harlingen and puerto vallarta

company on the commercial front revenues increased 88 compared to the second quarter of 2020 with largest increase on parking restaurants car rentals and retail occupancy rates for commercial space in our terminals was 85 at the end of the quarter diversification revenues increased 114 mainly due to higher revenues from hotel services and oma carga during the second quarter of 2021 occupancy rate of our terminal nh collection hotel was 56 while the hilton garden inn hotel at the monterrey airport had an occupancy rate of 46 during the quarter oma cargo delivered another outstanding performance during the quarter with an increase in tonnage handled of 102 resulting in revenue increase of 69 versus the second quarter of 2020 revenues from air and ground import cargo drove the increase in revenues total investments in the quarter including mdp investments major maintenance and strategic investments were mxn482 million additionally some of our major projects underway include the expansion and remodeling of the monterrey airport terminal anz platform reconfiguration of the monterrey airport expansion and remodeling of the tampico terminal building expansion and remodeling of ciudad juarez terminal building modernization of the zihuatanejo terminal building and green investments related to solar panels in our 13 airports finally on july 7 aerodrome infrastructure an affiliate of fintech holdings concluded tender offer process through which it acquired 60 2 million series b shares of oma equal to 15 4 of oma s capital stock as a result fintech holdings indirectly owns 30 1 of oma s capital stock i would now like to turn the call over to ruffo perez pliego who will discuss our financial highlights for the quarter ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer thank you ricardo good morning everyone i will visit with you our financial results and then we ll open the call for your questions turning to oma s second quarter financial results aeronautical revenues increased 778 relative to 2q 20 driven by 6 80 increase in passenger traffic non aero revenues increased 107 with commercial revenues having the largest contribution commercial revenues increased 88 the categories with the largest variations were parking restaurants car rentals and retail parking revenues increased 580 mostly driven by higher passenger traffic restaurants car rentals and retail increased 104 63 of 61 respectively due to lower levels of discounts granted to tenants and higher revenues from participation of sale diversification activities increased 814 mostly driven by the higher revenues from two hotels and oma carga total aeronautical and non aeronautical revenues in the quarter were mxn1 750 billion construction revenue increased 50 this is a non cash item that is required under applicable accounting standards and this equal to the construction cost of improvements to concession assets so it has no impact on earnings the cost of airport services and g a expense increased 7 relative to q2 20 due to a 42 growth in contracted services and a 38 increase in minor maintenance expenses this is a result of higher levels of passenger traffic these increases were partially offset by savings in bad debt expense payroll expenses and materials and supplies oma s second quarter adjusted ebitda was mxn1 300 million and the adjusted ebitda margin reached 74 7 during the quarter we recorded an increase in the major maintenance provision of 821 reaching mxn851 million this reflects increased future major maintenance works under the new master development program that was approved by the authorities last year our financing expense was mxn869 million and consolidated net income was mxn620 million with regards to our financial position cash generating from operating activities in the second quarter amounted to mxn1 1 billion and total cash at the end of the quarter stood at mxn4 2 billion we believe that our cash position with cash generated from operations will allow us to meet all of our investments financing and operational activations for 2021 total debt amounted to mxn5 billion and it s comprised of the three peso denominated bonds that we have and our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio stood at 0 3 times at the end of the quarter this concludes our prepared remarks operator please open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of alan macias with bank of america please proceed with your question alan macias bank of america analyst hi good morning and thank you for the call just a question on margins and adjusted ebitda margin what is your expectation going forward and if you re seeing any acceleration in costs or in cost pressures in any item in particular thank you ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer thank you alan for your question we have our during the quarter we have kept a very strict control on costs we think we believe most some of them are going to be we ve been able to keep them going forward we expect for the whole year to be slightly above 70 ebitda ebitda margin operator does that complete your question alan macias bank of america analyst yes thank you operator our next question comes from the line of guilherme mendes with jpmorgan please proceed with your question guilherme mendes jpmorgan analyst hi ricardo ruffo emmanuel thanks for taking my question i have two questions actually the first one is a follow up on the traffic recovery you guys mentioned on the opening remarks just wonder if you could provide more color on how do you see traffic recover when do you expect to be back to 19 levels and how do you see the risk related to the increased number of cases of covid 19 in mexico and the second question is related to the commercial segment what are your expectations in terms of revenues per passenger basis thank you ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer with respect to your first question we re expecting total this year to be around 17 million packs that would be about 26 below 2019 levels we are seeing a strong performance in the summer irrespective of the increase in health alert levels this as we have mentioned in previous calls to be driven primarily by vfr and domestic leisure travel however we would expect toward the end of the year a pickup in corporate travel driven by the improvement in economic conditions at this time we think we will reach the 2019 levels around early 2023 guilherme mendes jpmorgan analyst thank you ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer and sorry what was your question with respect to covid guilherme mendes jpmorgan analyst yeah in terms of how do you see the risks regarding the increasing number of cases of covid in mexico do you see an impact now in third quarter and the end of the year ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer we are seeing increased alert levels from the health authorities however we do expect that there will not be strict confinement measures such as the ones that we saw last year so we will we expect to continue to see increased mobility over the next few months the vaccination program in mexico is underway it s picking up speed so we believe that the improvement in the vaccination coverage will allow us to continue having traffic recovery for the next months and we do not foresee any such conditions as the ones we experienced last year ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer and also just to add to the point we haven t seen any we ve been tracking the numbers weekly and we haven t seen any effect so far the trend that we have seen for the last few months remains so we haven t seen any evidence in the data that supports any negative impact so far guilherme mendes jpmorgan analyst okay perfect thank you guys and just a follow up on the commercial segment how do you see revenues on a per passenger basis as we already saw an increase now in the second quarter ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer well commercial revenues we expect also to continue improving our most important line item in commercial revenues is car parking we already saw in the second quarter a stronger performance than in previous months from car parking and we expect as travel continues to improve to benefit from those line items and in the case of restaurants retail tenant car rentals we did have general discounts that were implemented in the second half of last year and we gradually phased discounts out during the second quarter of this year so we would expect less impact from those discounts going forward and that would help us get improved results from the fixed rents portion and also as passengers continue to increase we should also see a pickup in the participation on sales that we get from most of our commercial contracts so we should expect a bit of an acceleration in commercial revenues over the second half guilherme mendes jpmorgan analyst okay perfect thank you guys have a great day ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of javier gayol with gbm please proceed with your question javier gayol gbm analyst hi ricardo ruffo and emmanuel thank you for taking my questions my first question would be related to the capital structure of the company we see as you mentioned currently even with depressed numbers in the ebitda front we see a very comfortable net debt to ebitda ratio is management comfortable at this decision or would you be seeking additional debt to the balance sheet on the short term that will be my first question ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer thank you javier for your question yes as you mentioned that our debt levels are a very comfortable position as you know at mxn4 5 billion so far we plan to remain there there s we believe there is room to improvement but we will be analyzing as time moves on and also in the second half of the year we should expect the dividends it was delegated to the board of directors the decision of when and how the dividend will be paid as you remember that would amount upto mxn2 billion so at some point in late 3q or 4q we should see also that distribution being made so that would increase slightly the net debt to ebitda level javier gayol gbm analyst that s very helpful thank you guys and my second question is a follow up regarding the commercial revenue part of the business and i just i was wondering are you guys doing any new strategies in the commercial front to improve that revenue mix from commercial revenues at the airports and is this something that we should expect from the capital deployment into the airports that you guys mentioned in zihuatanejo and tampico and so on is this part of the strategy to increase the commercial front of the business ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer yes it is part of the strategy there will be new square footage commercial space for example in the tampico terminal it will be about to open culiacan juarez the new airport monterrey we would expect in the short term new square footage so we expect more commercial space there so far we have an 85 occupancy rate we believe by the end of the year we will be above 90 occupancy we also have been more aggressive in negotiating our contract with the discounts that we mentioned earlier there was a trade off and since we decreased those discounts were accompanied by an increase in the percent of revenue share that we have so yes we continue working on strategies as well as new we ll continue evaluating from diversification and commercial activities javier gayol gbm analyst thank you thank you very much for the color operator our next question comes from the line of alejandro zamacona with credit suisse please proceed with your question alejandro zamacona credit suisse analyst hi everyone thank you for the call just a follow up question on the ebitda margins so we noted that for this quarter you reached an all times high margin so i am curious to hear your thoughts around to what extent we can continue to see a margin expansion where can we see normalized margin expansion and i know that you already mentioned you expect a full year margin for 21 above 70 but going more on the medium term what br margin we can say a normalized margin and also if this margin expansion may be boosted not only by the eventual traffic recovery and the further potential increase in your spots from a further cost control thank you ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer hi alejandro so certainly this quarter we posted a very strong number in terms of i think in the following quarters we will see a slight decline relative to q2 in terms of margin there are some contracts that we negotiated during the covid crisis that will be up for renewal in the next few months so we will not expect to see such good terms in those contracts with third parties for example in cleaning or security so we ll see some pressure on those type of costs and so we would not expect to see further margin expansion in the near term relative to these levels that we are seeing at this time alejandro zamacona credit suisse analyst okay thank you ruffo and then if i may just one other question on the minor maintenance cost since the beginning of covid we have seen significant decreases so is it fair to expect a catch up in the upcoming quarters after doing the minimum required i guess maintenance during covid ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer yes so i think we as passengers and airports facilities have a greater utilization we will be seeing increased maintenance expenses last year from our view we were able to close certain areas of terminals and in that way reduce the usage of some equipment but now basically all terminals are fully open for their schedules itineraries we are see a pickup in minor maintenance expense over the next quarters i mean this quarter relative to last year you already saw an increase in maintenance still below the 2019 levels but yes probably over the next few quarters we will trend toward the 2019 levels alejandro zamacona credit suisse analyst okay ruffo thank you so much operator our next question comes from the line of gabriel himelfarb with scotiabank please proceed with your question gabriel himelfarb scotiabank analyst hi thanks for the call just two quick questions first about the routes that were closed could you give us a bit of color which routes were closed or why were closed and the second is about maximum rate do you think this year you re going to you will be able to reach maximum rates or you re going to wait till next year thanks ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer thank you gabriel for your question i ll start by your second part we expect to end this year with or complying with the maximum rate of around 95 and we expect by the beginning of next year to reach the 100 maximum rate recovery we mentioned since last year that we planned a year of pass through for the full rates to materialize as for your first question yes there were many routes that were closed a lot of them were related to interjet which as you know disappeared and aeromexico as well that has been consolidating most of their traffic in the mexico city airport so the strategy that aeromexico has been following has been to recover some of this loss that interjet left open in mexico city airport so they have been consolidating their airports there but as we move on in our conversation with them we expect to recover the regional traffic that we had with them gabriel himelfarb scotiabank analyst okay thank you alejandro zamacona credit suisse analyst our next question comes from the line of neokeatsuka with gbm please proceed with your question unidentified participant good morning thank you for the call my question is on international traffic as it is already at pre pandemic levels being related to back to vaccine the us or what do you believe to be the driver in this front ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer you re correct noke it has been very vaccine related some of the new routes that we opened for example was the mcallen route and that is we believe a vaccine route but also there is a harlingen one san antonio houston some of them we think they will remain during the quarter we had a peak for example at some point in one month we were almost 20 above pre pandemic levels so far we almost for the quarter were flat we expect international traffic to be solid for the rest of the year not all of it is vaccine related some of it is and some we believe it will remain unidentified participant okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of pablo monsivais with barclays please proceed with your question pablo monsivais barclays analyst hi guys can i have a follow up of previous questions from the commercial revenues still traffic is 20 down on the pre pandemic level but can you just explain to us how are you seeing commercial spending per passenger on the ground have you seen a change in pattern because of a lower corporate travel or have you seen just people spending less how are things behaving you at monterrey airport mainly thank you ruffo perez pliego chief financial officer so in the case of monterrey airport and this probably explains why the performance the variable performance we have had in the different line items is that recovery has been in the past few months at least in the case of monterrey primarily being driven by viva aerobus viva aerobus is as you know that the main the only user of terminal c and whereas in terminal a and terminal b were airlines such as aeromexico or in the case of volaris and interjet it used to operate in terminal a those terminals have not recovered to the levels that terminal c has has recovered in terms of of square footage of commercial spaces terminal c is the one with the least amount of space so we in an effort to balance out our performance throughout the terminals we started in july to move certain operations of viva aerobus from terminal c into terminal a and we think that given the greater commercial exposures that those passengers will have in terminal a will allow us to have a better performance of commercial revenue in the monterrey airport and also we moved certain operations of aeromar for example from terminal a to terminal b where aeromexico and delta operate also as an effort to improve the best traffic in that terminal so we are making efforts to have a more balanced traffic in our monterrey terminals and this should help our performance in commercial revenue to in monterrey also we had experienced in the previous months some vacancies during the quarter we had some 470 square meters being vacated we do expect to bottom out in this in the second quarter in terms of occupancy so we should see improvements in occupancy in the next following quarters and that will also help us improve the commercial revenue per generating operator does that complete your question ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer from our side yes operator our next question comes from the line of andressa varotto with ubs please proceed with your question andressa varotto ubs analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my question so my question is on the diversification revenues so how are you seeing hotels services revenues ramp up in the pandemic when do you expect it reach a normal level and you re also seeing very strong numbers in the car if you could also talk about which initiatives the company has been implementing to capture that and also ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer sorry andressa we didn t get your could you please repeat the question the line isn t great andressa varotto ubs analyst okay sorry so my question is on diversification revenues so on the hotel services when do you see a normalization of the business and also if you have other initiatives to increase your diversification revenues that s it ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer thank you diversification yes we re continuously evaluating new projects for the hotels the nh hotel that we have in the mexico city airport has been recovering faster than the hilton that s mainly due by the composition of our of the customers most of the nih are crew members of airlines so that has been recovering faster the profile of the hilton customer are mostly business driven hilton honors tourists that haven t recovered as fast it s hard to say a number when we expect that will normalize we believe they will normalize somewhere by mid next mid or third quarter fourth quarter of next year andressa varotto ubs analyst thank you operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments ricardo duenas espriu chief executive officer i want to thank all of you again for participating in this call ruffo emmanuel and i are always available to answer

officer good morning and thank you for joining stepan company s second quarter 2021 financial review before we begin please note that information in this conference call contains forward looking statements which are not historical facts these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including but not limited to prospects for our foreign operations global and regional economic conditions and factors detailed in our securities and exchange commission filings whether you re joining us online or over the phone we encourage you to review the investor slide presentation which we have made available at www stepan com under the investors section of our website we make these slides available at approximately the same time as when the earnings release is issued and we hope that you find information and perspective helpful now with that i would like to turn the call over to mr quinn stepan our chairman and chief executive officer quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you luis good morning and thank you all for joining us we hope you and your families have had an opportunity to be vaccinated and that you have done so the best way to protect yourself and your family is to be vaccinated although demand for cleaning disinfection and personal wash products has slowed from the pandemic peak we had stepan remain committed to doing our part by supporting customers that supply these essential products to the market the company had a good first half and delivered record results adjusted net income was 84 6 million or 3 62 per diluted share both adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were up 35 versus the first half of 2020 which was negatively impacted by the millsdale plant outage we delivered our best second quarter and had 42 2 million adjusted net income surfactant operating income was down 5 largely due to higher north american supply chain cost driven by inflationary pressures and planned higher maintenance cost our polymer operating income was up 48 on 44 sales volume growth the polymer growth was driven by both the invista polyester polyol acquisition and organic market growth overall the integration of invista s business into our company has gone well and is on track with our business plans our specialty product business results were up due to order timing and improved margins within our mct product line our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on stepan s common stock of 0 305 per share payable on september 15 2021 stepan has increased its dividend for 53 consecutive years luis will walk you through a few more details about our second quarter results luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer thank you quinn my comments will generally follow the slide presentation let s just start with the slide four to recap the quarter adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2021 was 42 2 million or 1 81 per diluted share a 10 increase versus 38 3 million or 1 65 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020 because adjusted net income is a non gaap measure we provide full reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures and this can be found in appendix two of the presentation and table two of the press release specifically adjustment to reported net income this quarter consists of adjustment for deferred compensation and minor restructuring expenses adjusted net income for the quarter excludes deferred compensation income of 1 1 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to deferred compensation expense of 1 9 million or 0 08 per diluted share in the same period last year the deferred compensation numbers represent the net expense related to the company s deferred compensation plan as well as cash settled stock appreciation rights for our employees these liabilities change with the movement in the stock price we exclude this item from our operational discussion slide five shows the total company earnings fees for the second quarter compared to last year s second quarter and breaks down the increase in adjusted net income because this is net income the figure is noted here are on an after tax basis we will cover each segment in more detail but to summarize polymers and specialty products were up where surfactant was down versus the prior year corporate expenses and all others were higher during the quarter due to higher acquisition related expenses and overall inflation the company s effective tax rate was 24 4 in the first half of 2021 compared to 23 9 in the prior year period this year over year increase was primarily attributable to a less favorable geographical mix of income we expect the full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23 to 26 the slide six focuses on surfactant segment results for the quarter surfactant net sales were 384 million a 16 increase versus the prior year selling prices were up 17 primarily due to improved product and customer mix as well as the pass through of higher raw material costs effect of foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by 5 volume decreased 6 year over year most of this decrease reflects lower volume into the north america consumer product end market this reduction was driven by lower demand for consumer cleaning disinfection and personal wash products versus the pandemic peak in 2020 additionally we continue to experience feedstock supply issues and customer inventory rebalancing efforts this was partially offset by higher demand for products sold into our institutional cleaning and functional product end markets surfactant operating income for the quarter decreased 2 6 million or 5 versus the prior year primarily due to higher north america supply chain cost as a result of inflationary pressures and planned higher maintenance costs latin america operating results benefit from a 2 1 million vat tax recovery project in the current year quarter europe results decreased slightly due to lower demand in consumer products partially offset by increased demand in functional products now turning to polymers on slide 7 net sales were 191 million in the quarter up 70 from prior year sales volume increased 44 primarily due to 41 growth in rigid polyol volumes global rigid polyol volumes excluding the invista acquisition was up 7 versus the prior year higher demand within the pa and specialty polyol businesses also contributed to the volume growth selling prices increased 21 and the translation impact of a weaker u s dollar positively increased net sales by 5 polymer operating income increased 7 5 million or 48 primarily due to double digit volume growth in the legacy polymers business plus invista acquisition north america polyol results decreased due to rising raw materials and manufacturing costs partially offset by higher volumes europe results increased due to double digit volume growth on the base business plus invista acquisition china results decreased due to the nonrecurrence of a onetime benefit in the base period in 2020 and lower volumes china volumes in the first half of 2021 grew 5 specialty products net sales were 21 million for the quarter up 33 from the prior year quarter volume was up 17 between quarters and operating income increased 3 8 million or 116 the operating income increase was primarily attributable to order timing differences within our food and flavor business and improved margins within our mct product line moving on to slide 8 our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity to invest in the business our leverage and interest coverage ratios continues at very healthy levels we had a strong cash from operations in the first half of 2021 which was used for capex investments dividends share buybacks and investments in working capital given the strong sales growth and raw material inflation we executed agreements for 100 million of new private placement debt at a very attractive and fixed interest rates of around 2 we will use a new cash to fund our organic and inorganic growth opportunities and for other general corporate purposes for the full year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 150 million to 170 million beginning on slide 10 scott will now update you on our 2021 strategic priorities scott behrens chief operating officer thank you luis we are pleased to have delivered record first half earnings to our shareholders and look forward to carrying that momentum into the second half of the year we continue to prioritize the safety and health of our employees as we deliver products that contribute to the fight against covid 19 our epa approved biocide formulations kill a specific novel virus that causes covid 19 and allow our customers to provide the public with additional tools to protect their families and to fight the pandemic based on customer feedback consumer habits have changed and these new behaviors require higher use of disinfection cleaning and personal wash products therefore we believe our surfactant volumes in the consumer product end market will remain higher versus pre pandemic levels however lower than peak pandemic demand in q2 of 2020 we believe institutional cleaning volume will continue to grow as economies around the world reopen and people demand higher standards for cleaning and disinfection in public settings we also anticipate that demand for surfactants within the agricultural and oilfield markets will continue to benefit from higher agricultural and commodity prices and improve versus 2020 we will continue working on improving productivity as well as product and customer mix to improve surfactant operating income globally we are increasing capacity in certain product lines including biocides and amphoteric to ensure we can meet higher requirements from our customers as discussed previously we are increasing north american capability and capacity to produce low 1 4 dioxane sulfates a minor byproduct generated in the manufacture of ether sulfate surfactants which are key cleaning and foaming ingredients used in consumer product formulations through a combination of process optimization and additional manufacturing equipment stepan will be prepared to supply customers ether sulfates that meet the new regulatory requirements this project is the primary driver of our 2021 capital expenditure forecast of 150 million to 170 million and will carry over to 2022 as well we are working with our customers to ensure these projects deliver our financial return targets tier two and tier three customers continue to be a focus of our strategy tier two and tier three volume grew in the second quarter driven by increased customer penetration we added 150 new customers during the quarter and more than 500 customers in the first half of this year our diversification strategy into functional markets continues to be a key priority for stepan during the first half global agricultural volume increased high single digits with strong growth obtained in the post patent pesticide segment and new products launched throughout the world oilfield volume was up mid single digits due to higher oil prices we remain optimistic about future opportunities in this business as oil prices have recovered to the 70 per barrel level we continued our consulting work in our millsdale plant and accelerated interventions and investments in both expense and capex to increase capacity and improved productivity we expect to continue this project and investment level throughout the rest of this year we are projecting a strong return on investment in this project through a combination of productivity improvements more capacity in several high margin product lines through debottlenecking key processes and improved service to our customers we anticipate starting to see the benefits of this project in 2022 and beyond polymers had a good quarter and first half of the year as the business is coming back from a challenging year due to covid restrictions the long term prospects for our polyol business remain attractive as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes should increase demand as quinn stated the integration of this business acquired from invista is going well and we expect to deliver 16 million to 18 million of ebitda in 2021 given the strength of our balance sheet we also plan to continue to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities to fill gaps in our portfolio and to add new platform chemistries i will now turn the call back to quinn for closing comments quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott the company delivered record first half earnings in 2021 looking forward we believe surfactant volumes in north america consumer product end market will be challenged versus peak pandemic levels in 2020 while we believe institutional cleaning volume will continue to grow versus prior year we do not believe it will compensate for lower consumer consumption of cleaning disinfection and personal wash products we anticipate that demand for surfactants when the agricultural and oilfield markets will improve versus 2020 global demand for rigid polyols continues to recover from pandemic related delays and cancellations of reroofing and new construction projects this recovery combined with our first quarter 2021 acquisition should position our polymer business to deliver growth versus prior year we believe that long term prospects for rigid polyols remains attractive as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes are expected to continue we anticipate our specialty product business results will improve slightly year over year despite continued raw material price increases and planned higher maintenance costs we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year this concludes our prepared remarks at this time we d like to turn the call over for questions daisy please review the instructions for the question portion of today s call questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport research partners mike harrison seaport research partners analyst hi good morning was hoping that you could walk through some of the pricing and raw material cost dynamics that you were seeing in your two key segments surfactants and polymers but overall pricing was up 20 in the second quarter how much more pricing do you feel like you need before you can offset the impact the margin impact of higher raws and maybe what does the timing look like in terms of i guess the margin trajectory in both of those segments quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer okay i ll start with that mike let me just say that the company has implemented price increases july one as well the price increase in surfactants i would say is going well and we re in pretty good shape from our surfactants business i think in polymers most likely we have a little more work to do in q4 to catch up and maintain and move our margins restore our margins in that segment particularly in north america we re in pretty good shape in polymers and europe at this point in time mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and in terms of the surfactants business you mentioned the decline in consumer surfactant demand obviously coming off the peak from the pandemic as well as some inventory destocking where do you see that consumer volume compared to pre pandemic levels once everything stabilizes especially given your view that we re going to see sustained higher cleaning demand as well as the addition of a lot of tier two and tier three customers that you ve brought on over the past several quarters scott behrens chief operating officer yeah mike this is scott it s a little bit difficult to project what s going to happen in the second half of the year we ve got economies that we re open and are questioning about restricting going forward we have economies that still have yet to be open so it s really hard to predict what it s going to look like going forward we re in uncharted times i would say based on the comments we ve made our business is up versus pre pandemic levels but below where we saw the peak last year and if you think about the peak in 2020 that basically emptied a lot of inventories throughout the production supply chain and what inventory is left in the trade at this point and in the consumers pantries is yet to be seen so i d say it s really hard to predict where we are in that continuum at this point quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer but i would say that our customers have told us that they believe that there s a higher demand for cleaning within homes and also within institutional facilities restaurants hotels etc so we do believe versus 2019 we have seen a sustained increase in cleaning in virtually all end markets that we re participating in mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and then on the polyols business it sounds like if we excluded the invista deal the volumes were maybe up mid to high single digits year over year maybe not as robust of a recovery as we might expect in some of those construction and rigid polyol applications are there either supply chain issues or pandemic issues that are still kind of dragging on construction activity and dragging on volumes within that business quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer so if we look at our legacy business our legacy business was up 7 luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer for rigid polyol quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer for rigid polyols so good market growth in your number that you calculated was kind of right on but we have seen some shortage of reaction products that our polyol is reacted within the marketplace specifically mdi has been short for periods of time and the pricing in china has been an issue that has negatively impacted our demand so we do see we are optimistic that we re going to see higher demand throughout the year for our polymer business and but there have been some supply issues on mdi and i guess that i would also say some fire retardant ingredients as well luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer yes and mike what i will complement is just the specific rigid polyol business we had a very strong quarter also on case and pa and that takes the whole legacy business excluding invista to a very strong double digit growth because case grew very strong and pa as well on top of the 7 in rigid polyols mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and then last question for now is i know you don t provide guidance but i feel like you have a lot of moving pieces going on in terms of the earnings comparisons you posted a couple record quarters here in q1 and q2 obviously the prior year included the millsdale outage impact and then 2021 is including the impact of the texas freeze which was also unusual so can you give us a sense of what your underlying earnings growth would have looked like in the first half without those effects and maybe give us a little bit more direction on what that should tell us about the pace of earnings growth as we get into the second half luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer great question mike this is luis so yes if you remember last year we had in the first half the impact of the millsdale freeze and then we had all the insurance proceed for that event basically in the second half so if we move the income to the first half to make sure that we have a clear base the 35 growth that we are reporting today in adjusted net income on an apples to apples basis will be around plus 12 so it s a good double digit growth in our business and we are happy with a strong double digit net income growth and as you know we don t provide guidance for the future but we are providing a lot of perspective about higher maintenance cost this quarter and for the next couple of quarters we continue seeing that is going as well versus what we did in q2 we know scott provided a little bit more perspective on the volume situation so but but if we look at the first half underlying apples to apple is plus 12 operator our next question comes from the line of vincent anderson with stifel vincent anderson stifel analyst i think mike covered the raw material questions pretty extensively there already but i did just want to make sure in case i missed it is there any way to quantify some of the impact on revenues rather than margins that came that basically hit this quarter from either raw material shortage or logistics shortage so specifically not being able to deliver as much as you wanted to kind of regardless of the price of that raw material quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer i think it would be difficult to break that out but from a i would say from an income perspective shortages in q2 primarily impacted our ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivative business and so i would say those two areas we probably from an income perspective operating income perspective we re probably maybe a couple of million dollars below and that dollar value would be associated with our business in north america and with our business in mexico vincent anderson stifel analyst okay that s fair and i just i m looking at what s going on in germany right now and you mentioned some mdi and flame retardant issues i think in asia is that something that we should be keeping an eye on or do you feel like that s mostly dealt with and we re not going to see another kind of likes of the 2018 2019 where we had just this just the shortage of the kind of co materials for your rigid polyol demand into inflation scott behrens chief operating officer this is scott vincent i would say it s being managed the plants are operating they re on plan some plants are on scheduled turnaround so the industry is managing it i would say it s very tight supply demand balance at this point we do expect improvement in the second half but i would not characterize this as a 2018 type of event vincent anderson stifel analyst okay that s good to know all right one more from me it might be a very short answer from you but you were linked to a fairly sizable acquisition target i figured i d be remiss if i didn t try to ask if one there had been any validity to that if there is no longer any participation by stepan in that in that target and if so would you be willing to speak maybe in general terms what drew you to a business of that size and portfolio mix maybe just as a case study in your m a strategy quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer yes so we remain interested in making acquisitions on a global basis and specifically enhancing our product portfolio so we were it was reported in the press that we were interested in an acquisition in brazil or based on a company in brazil i would tell you that our interest for that product line is primarily in north america and so our activities were not as ambitious and a little bit more focus on a geographic perspective than what s reported in the press vincent anderson stifel analyst understood so that was really just the alkoxylate capacity in texas if i remember then quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer alkoxylation on the gulf coast of the united states remains a priority for our company vincent anderson stifel analyst wonderful i appreciate the color good luck on the rest of the year gentlemen quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much vincent operator our next question comes from the line of marco rodriguez with stonegate capital markets marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst good morning everybody thank you for taking my questions i was wondering if maybe you could expand on a comment if i heard it correctly when talking about the capex expansion here in fiscal 21 you re obviously guiding to 150 million to 170 million but i believe i heard some comments it says that should carry into 2022 can you maybe provide some additional color surrounding that correctly luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer marco the comment from score was basically related to the low 1 4 dioxane project which is one of the key drivers of the higher capex this year that project will continue the execution in 2022 marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and is there is it too early to quantify maybe what additional spend might be related to that luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer yes i think we will provide very clear capex guidance for next year once we go through the budget and once we have all the projects in and out we will provide a clear perspective for next year later on marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it okay and just kind of circling back around with the price increases and the raw material price increases you guys spent some time already addressing that very much appreciated just wondering if you can maybe provide any sort of feedback from a customer standpoint on those increases in terms of them just being obviously resigned to the fact that obviously it s in the contracts but also something that s an expectation and if you can maybe perhaps comment on what sort of levels of competition you might be seeing that may be trying to kind of hold that your ability to push that through in the second half scott behrens chief operating officer yes marco this is scott i would start off by saying the inflation that our industry has seen in the first six months of this year probably has been unprecedented in the last 15 years and it s every material and every service that touches a customer or any part of their value chain so and the market is tight as well you re coming out of a covid restricted environment inventories were low you ve seen what s happening in the automotive market and the lack of inventory so it s a wave that all of us are trying to deal with in real time to the best of our ability so that s the best way i can describe the environment at this point quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer yes what i would further say is that i think transportation has been an issue not only for the whole chemical industry but i think for the whole supply chain across many different products and so i think as transportation has been limited in the marketplace it also has created less flexibility for ourselves and other people to respond to changes in demand so i would say the environment from a competitive perspective recognizes that the costs are up and pricing we ve generally been able to pass through most of the price increases or most of the price raw material price increases that we ve seen in the market particularly in surfactants and i mentioned earlier we have more work to do in our polymer business in north america marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it very helpful and last quick question for me if you can maybe just talk a little bit more about your m a pipeline just kind of where that looks what that looks like versus last quarter in terms of size and then maybe if you can just address what valuations might look like quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer generally we have a small number of active projects within our m a pipeline we have seen multiples go up significantly over the last couple of years we re seeing a little bit of maybe plateauing and maybe a little bit of a decrease for certain more commodity assets i think specialty chemicals remain at relatively peak multiples today so but so we continue to look and we ll keep you informed as projects and opportunities are announced in the marketplace luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer yes and the good news marco is that the whole industry is very active on m a and there are plenty of projects coming out every quarter so of course we will continue being very diligent about our process and we will engage in those that make sense for us quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer i would say though don t look for anything short term from us marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it very helpful appreciate the time guys thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport research partners mike harrison seaport research partners analyst just a few more from me one of the things i wanted to understand you talked about the 1 4 dioxane changes in the capital associated with that you ve been adding some other capacity can you quantify how much additional capacity has been brought on in some of these key cleaning and disinfection product lines and i guess with the pandemic elevated demand may be running its course is there still going to be a demand sorry enough demand out there in order to justify the additional capacity quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer so what i would tell you is that we have added relatively small amounts of incremental capacity in our biocide area and in our amphoteric product lines primarily driven by customer request around the world with specific enhancements in mexico and north america that s mostly where our capital expansions have been we ve also added some new reactor capability in brazil to support our agricultural business in that country scott behrens chief operating officer and mike specific to 1 4 dioxane it is not a capacity expansion of our sulfonation network it is putting a new capability on our existing assets to be able to meet the new regulations so it s not incremental capacity quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer and then the last thing relative to our polymer business the primary driver for the acquisition of invista s polyester polyol business was to provide low cost capacity opportunities for us today but also over the next decade where there is significant excess capacity within the asset that we acquired within wilmington and there are opportunities to debottleneck and expand the vlissingen the netherlands plant to support our european business mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right perfect and then on the agricultural business it s great to see the volumes higher there but just trying to understand if this is just strong ag market fundamentals that s driving that or if it s application wins or geographic expansion or maybe the product of other strategic efforts that we re seeing drive the growth there scott behrens chief operating officer yes mike it s a little bit of all the above commodity prices have risen significantly since last year corn soybean prices are 2 times of where they were that s driven increased farmer confidence and really a focus on improving yields per acre which really comes from their chemical applications so that s underlining market growth right and then there are certain differentiated wins that we re achieving through our targeted initiatives in post patent pesticide application formulations as well as new emerging smaller customers throughout our international regions so we ve seen the agricultural volumes grow in all four of our regions in the first half mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right then last question i have is on the oilfield business your slide deck mentions that you re planning a relaunch of the kmco business sometime in 2021 can you give a little more detail in terms of the timing and the potential revenue associated with that relaunch scott behrens chief operating officer yes i would say a couple of things one we re trying to replicate a product line that was manufactured in a different facility kmco s old facility so we ve had a lot of r d and process development work to do in 2021 with the impact of covid in operations and the supply chain disruptions we ve had with potentially raw materials and manufacturing partners we re a little bit behind our target however it is not going to be incremental to 2021 this was more of a rebuilding the supply chain model within the stepan network which quite honestly was more than a 12 to 24 month timeline operator our next question comes from the line of vincent anderson with stifel vincent anderson stifel analyst yes thanks i had this thought and i know you addressed it a couple of quarters ago but it wasn t in my notes so on the 1 4 dioxane that is a new york state i want to say regulation that is driving this if i m wrong correct me otherwise the question is are you already in conversations with either major customers or with regulatory bodies elsewhere in the u s where maybe you can actually get ahead of similar regulations in other states and gain market share from this or is this really going to be a just kind of coordinate with the buyers make sure you re getting paid for the capital that you re having to spend quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer so most large consumer product companies their supply chains are such that they don t want to have multiple skus in the marketplace so if you think about the vast vast majority of our customers are going to meet this standard even though it s just approved in the state of new york today they ll have one product in their product line that meets the standard for the entire united states so that s really what the vast majority of our customers are doing if you take a look at how we ve approached this market and this opportunity this challenge and the from the marketplace we worked very closely with our customers and we have to ensure that we get a fair return on the new capital that we are spending to meet the standard vincent anderson stifel analyst understood i appreciate the answer operator there are no further questions at this time please continue with your presentation or closing remarks quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much for joining us on today s call we appreciate your interest and ownership in stepan company please stay safe and healthy wash your hands frequently use disinfectants to clean surfaces and get vaccinated have a great day thank you operator duration 44 minutes call

expectations which statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our sec filings you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements actual events could cause our results to differ materially from these forward looking statements for a number of reasons including as it may relate to the continuing impact from covid 19 and with that i ll turn the call over to ernest rady our chairman and ceo to begin the discussion of our second quarter 2021 results ernest ernest sylvan rady chairman chief executive officer thanks adam and good morning everyone we are making great progress on all fronts as we focus our efforts on our rebound from covid 19 s impact by enhancing and amenitizing existing properties acquiring new accretive properties like eastgate office park in bellevue which the team will talk about more in a bit retaining and adding new customers to our portfolio furthering our development of la jolla commons of which we recently bottomed out our excavation and otherwise remain on time and on budget and of course growing our earnings and net asset value for our stockholders we have been through hard time before and each time we have emerged stronger which remains our expectations in mind now i want to mention that the board of directors has approved the quarterly dividend of 0 30 per share for the third quarter an increase of 0 02 per share or 7 from the second quarter which is we believe is supported by our increased collection efforts in the second quarter improving traffic in waikiki at our embassy suites and our expectation for operations to continue trending favorably in the near term i m also pleased to announce that the board has appointed adam wyll to the position of president in addition to his chief operating officer role and title as many of you know adam is a valuable and hard working member of our executive team and this title describes the breadth of responsibilities and leadership that he has successfully taken on prior to and during the pandemic as well as the confidence our board and myself and our management team has in him to manage in partnership with our excellent executive team the day to day operations of aat i personally am blessed with excellent health and this company is very important to me i intend to continue my role as chairman and ceo for the foreseeable future however it is very important to our board myself and shareholders that you know this company will always remain in very capable hands and that we are fortunate to have such a great management team and group of associates at aat all of whom work together as we continue on as a best in classes class reit adam bob and steve will go into more detail on our various asset management segments collections and financial results and will be available for any questions you may have at the conclusion of our prepared remarks on behalf of all of american assets trust we thank you for your confidence in allowing us to manage your company and for your continued support now more than ever and now i m going to return it back to our newly elected president adam adam wyll president chief operating officer thanks ernest i very much appreciate the kind words and leadership opportunities none of which would have been possible without your mentorship not to mention the daily collaboration with such an incredible management team and top notch team members and colleagues we continue to feel bullish about our portfolio particularly with government restrictions lifted in all of our mainland markets in hawaii having lightened its reopening restrictions considerably and we are seeing firsthand consumer behavior reverting to pre pandemic levels with packed parking lots and tons of shoppers at all our retail properties we re already seeing many of our retailers with gross sales above pre pandemic levels in our restaurants recovering which is obviously very encouraging our collections have continued to improve each quarter with a collection rate north of 96 for the second quarter furthermore we had approximately 850 000 of deferred rent due from tenants in q2 based on covid 19 related lease modifications and we have collected approximately 94 of those deferred amounts further validating our strategy of supporting our struggling retailers through the government mandated closures remaining collection challenges at this point are primarily with a handful of local retailers at our waikiki beach walk property but with hawaii tourism back in large numbers we think we ll have an opportunity to rebound to be viable long term even more so once asian countries relax their travel restrictions to hawaii later this year or early next additionally we are seeing positive activity engagement with new retailers including mid box retailers about half of our over 250 000 square feet of vacant retail space or in lease negotiations or loi stage deals that we believe we have a good likelihood of being finalized and the vast majority of our retailers are renewing their leases at flat to modest rent increases on the multifamily front with new management in place at hassalo we are currently 99 leased and asking rents are trending up almost 20 since december 2020 the multifamily collections have been more challenging in portland due to eviction protection still in place through the next month or so but we are doing everything we can to stay on top of that which include government rental assistance programs that we expect meaningful disbursements from soon in san diego our multifamily properties are currently 97 leased and we have leased approximately 90 of the 133 master lease units that expired less than two months ago and expect the remaining to be leased over the next few weeks asking rents at our multifamily properties are trending up as well in san diego almost 10 since december 2020 with that i ll turn the call over to bob to discuss q2 financial results in more detail robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer good morning and thank you ernest and adam last night we reported second quarter 2021 ffo per share of 0 51 and second quarter 21 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of 0 15 from my perspective i believe we are seeing the beginning of the recovery story for aat that we have been talking about for the last six months with embedded growth into 2022 and beyond as we have previously shared with you on our bridge in our investor presentations which you can find on our website let me share with you several data points that support my belief first as ernest previously mentioned the board has approved an increase in the dividend to its pre covid amount of 0 30 per share based on the continued improvement in our collections as expected but the overriding factor was the strong results we are seeing at the embassy suites hotel in waikiki beginning in mid june and increasing into july with a strong pent up demand q2 paid occupancy was 67 and the month of june by itself reached approximately 83 the average daily rate was 274 for q2 and approximately 316 for the month of june revpar or revenue per available room was 184 for q2 and approximately 262 for the month of june it is definitely heading in the right direction effective july 8 all travellers entering into hawaii who are vaccinated in the u s can skip quarantine without getting a pre travel covid test by uploading proof of their vaccination to the state of hawaii safe travel website the oahu is still under tier five of its reopening plan until hawaii s total population is 70 fully vaccinated which should occur in the next month or two bars and restaurants in oahu can be at 100 capacity as long as all customers show their vaccination card or a negative covid test on entry the japanese wholesale market had accounted for approximately 35 to 40 of our customer base pre covid japan is currently just 9 fully vaccinated though with its current pace of over one million vaccines a day japan is expected to be completing vaccinations by this november and to start issuing vaccine passports in the next 30 days in anticipation of opening up international travel in the meantime there is a pent up demand from u s west and canada that is expected to keep the hotel occupied and on track with this recovery secondly looking at our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended june 30th our total revenue increased approximately 7 8 million over q1 which is approximately at 9 3 increase approximately 37 of that was the outperformance of the embassy suites hotel as california and hawaii began to open up travel additionally our operating income increased approximately 6 3 million over q1 21 which is approximately an increase of 31 third same store cash noi overall was strong at 23 year over year with office consistently strong before during and post covid and retail showing strong signs of recovery multifamily was down primarily as a result of pacific ridge apartments at 71 leased at the end of q2 due to the recurring seasonality of students leaving in may including the expiration of the usd master lease and new students leasing over the summer before school starts in late august generally approximately 60 of our 533 units at pacific ridge are leased by students with the usd campus right across the street as of this week we are approximately 90 leased at pacific ridge with approximately 150 students moving in over the next several weeks in august hassalo on eighth in the lloyd district of oregon is a 657 multifamily campus at the end of q1 occupancy was approximately 84 due to the lingering impact of covid and political challenges in the prior months as of q2 we have increased the occupancy to approximately 95 but in doing so we had to adjust the rent and increase concessions pacific ridge and hassalo on eighth are the two factors that impacted our multifamily same store this quarter as adam mentioned asking rates have been trending favorably on our multifamily properties recently which we expect to provide meaningful growth going forward note that our same store cash noi does not include our mixed use sector which will return with q3 and q4 2021 after completing the renovation of the embassy suites hotel during covid and fourth as previously disclosed we acquired eastgate office park on july 7th comprised of approximately 280 000 square foot multi tenant office campus in the premier i 90 corridor submarket of bellevue washington one of the top performing markets in the nation the eastside market is anchored by leading tech life science biotech and telecommunication companies the four building eastgate park is currently greater than 95 leased to a diversified tenant base with in place contractual lease rates that we believe are 10 to 15 below prevailing market rates for the submarket additionally eastgate park recently obtained municipal approval for rezoning increasing the floor area ratio from 0 5 to 1 0 which will allow for additional development opportunities the purchase price of approximately 125 million was paid with cash on the balance sheet the going in cap rate was approximately 6 with an unlevered irr north of 7 we believe this transaction will be accretive to ffo by approximately 0 05 for the remainder of 2021 and 0 10 for the entire year of 2022 these four items are the data points that are pointing to the beginning of aat s recovery story starting to unfold one last point of interest is that on page 16 of the supplemental total cash net operating income which is a non gaap supplemental earnings measure which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance is shown for the three months ended june 30 at approximately 58 7 million if you use this as a run rate going forward it would be approximately 234 million which would exceed 2019 pre covid cash noi of approximately 212 million a reconciliation of total cash noi to net income is included in the glossary of terms in the supplemental moving on at the end of the second quarter we had liquidity of approximately 718 million comprised of 368 million in cash and cash equivalents and 350 million of availability on our line of credit our leverage which we measure in terms of net debt to ebitda was 6 0 times our focus is to maintain our net debt to ebitda at 5 5 times or below our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3 7 times as far as guidance goes we are in the middle of budget season now for 2022 we hope to begin issuing formal guidance again for 2022 on our q3 21 earnings call i ll now turn the call over to steve center our vice president of office properties for a brief update on our office segment steve steve center vice president of office properties thanks bob at the end of the second quarter excluding one beach which is under redevelopment our office portfolio stood at approximately 93 leased with less than 1 expiring through the end of 2021 our top 10 office tenants represented 51 of our total office based rent given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located with technology and life science as the key market drivers our office portfolio is poised to capitalize on improving dynamics especially in bellevue and san diego q2 portfolio stats by region were as follows our san francisco and portland office portfolios were stable at 100 and 96 leased respectively city center bellevue was 93 leased net of a new amenity space under development and san diego is 91 leased net of new amenity spaces being added to torrey reserve we had continued success in q2 preserving pre covid rental rates with 13 comparable new and renewal leases totalling approximately 50 000 rentable square feet with an over 9 increased over prior rent on a cash basis and almost 15 increase on a straight line basis the weighted average lease term on these leases was 3 6 years with just over 7 per rentable square foot in tis and incentives we experienced a modest small tenant attrition during the quarter due to covid resulting in a net loss of approximately 16 000 rentable square feet or less than 0 5 point of occupancy none of which was lost to a competitor our outlook moving forward is one of positive net absorption with 200 proposal activity picking up significantly at this point in time we are seeing smaller tenants willing to commit to longer term leases at favorable rental rates even more exciting is the push to return to the office in the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality larger blocks of space in select markets including san diego and bellevue of which we have current availability and active prospects our continued strategic investments in our current portfolio will position us to capture more than our fair share of net absorption as the markets improve the renovation of two buildings at torrey reserve is near completion we have aggregated large blocks of space to meet demand and take advantage of pricing power and we have active large deals and negotiations on both buildings the final phase of the renovation will include a new state of the art fitness complex and conference center both serving the entire 14 building torrey reserve campus construction is in full swing on the redevelopment of one beach street in san francisco delivering in the first half of 2022 and construction is nearly complete on the redevelopment of 710 oregon square in the lloyd submarket of portland one beach will grow to over 103 000 square feet and 710 organ square will add another 32 000 square feet to the office portfolio as ernest mentioned construction is well underway on tower three at la jolla commons with expected completion in q2 q3 of 2023 and we are encouraged by the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality large blocks of space and utc finally leasing activity is robust for our upcoming availabilities at eastgate office park in suburban bellevue even prior to executing the exciting renovation plans under development to take this special property to the next level of quality and customer experience in summary our office portfolio is on offense as we move forward into the rest of 2021 and beyond operator i ll now turn the call over to you for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from haendel st juste with mizuho lydia mizuho analyst hi this is lydia on behalf of haendel congratulations adam my first question is can you discuss the status of la jolla commons your new utc development and also the decision to build spec and how are you thinking about the utc market and expected returns adam wyll president chief operating officer why don t you handle the construction and then steve will handle the leasing opportunity robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer sure i think so right now we are at the bottom of the hole as ernest mentioned earlier and we are beginning the first phases of pouring our mat foundations to ernest s point we remain on schedule and on time and on budget our first concrete pour is going to be over 3 500 cubic yards of concrete and almost 430 000 pounds of rebar so there s a lot of work to do between now and august 14th but we remain pretty confident in our ability to execute this so adam wyll president chief operating officer and i think as we pointed out before we were fortunate enough to buy it during buy it out during the last quarter of last year and construction costs have escalated since so that it would cost us more substantially if we were to buy it today and steve why don t you describe your strategy of holding out for the right tenant steve center vice president of office properties well as we ve said before you have not only life science venture capital flowing into san diego at record rates but also technology venture capital is flowing in as well you ve got apple amazon google facebook you ve got the big tech companies taking advantage of the quality student population that s we ve been net exporters of talent for years and now these big companies are coming to take advantage of that the market dynamics are in our favor we re the only pure office development coming out of the ground the rest of the new developments are life science or lab targeted buildings furthermore in the three adjacent submarkets of del mar heights utc and serena mesa approximately three million square feet of office product has been or is being converted to lab so that s taking away competing inventory so we think we re well positioned to take advantage of that the market demand continues to be strong for those big users and there s not going to be much available product as the prediction for 2023 when we re delivering this building to the marketplace so we re confident we re going to do well in leasing that building lydia mizuho analyst and as a quick follow up with office being the largest percent of abr and noi are you at all worried about work from home and adding to your offices exposure at this time adam wyll president chief operating officer i think our strategy is to be in markets that are buoyant i think if we were in markets that were not buoyant i would really have more concerns than we do now but i think our strategy of having top notch office in the best in some of the best markets in the country will allow us to perform better than many of the markets that will not perform as well because growth is growth and we re in the path of growth anybody want to add anything to that robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer i think you covered it well adam wyll president chief operating officer yeah it s a good question though everybody is asking what s going to happen when people return or don t return to office it will be different but i think that a well located office in the path to growth will do extremely well and that s our strategy operator great your next question comes from todd thomas with keybanc todd thomas keybanc analyst hi thanks adam wyll president chief operating officer morning todd todd thomas keybanc analyst good morning first question i have is on the mixed use on the hotel and hotel retail bob i appreciate the color on june and it sounded like performance has continued into july can you just provide some additional detail around july and maybe talk about the outlook for august and september in terms of bookings and i guess the outlook for occupancy and rates robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer yeah good morning todd in terms of the data points for july we re still getting that in but what we can see is we can see the pent up demand we can see the pace of bookings that are generally we can see we have a vision into about 90 days out so july august september is the high season for the embassy suites hotel so it is seasonal so then it will generally go down a little bit in the fourth quarter and then pick up at the end of december but for july august and september we are expecting a similar if not greater breakout at the embassy that we ve seen in just the last half of june adam wyll president chief operating officer just as additional color if you recall todd we used the pandemic downtime to refresh the rooms paint the exterior and deal with its falling so we re ready when the tourism market does recover and we expect a strong recovery todd thomas keybanc analyst okay and i guess how should we think about the results in the quarter and i guess sort of thinking about what you re experiencing there relative to what you were expecting for 21 or 22 when we look at that noi bridge that you ve provided has the outlook for the mixed use asset changed as we ve moved further into the year robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer well on that bridge that we ve shared with our investors and research analysts over the last year or so is that we intend to update that at the next conference or the next presentation but basically my comment in there todd was that if you look at the cash total cash noi and you just use that to as a run rate and you re about 238 and you can adjust that down for some nonrecurring collections that occurred in the second quarter so even then even after the adjustments to that you re still significantly higher than our 2019 cash noi that we ended with so really all we re doing is say hey this we are seeing the recovery we are now ahead of 2019 pre covid cash noi and from here we expect to build upon that adam wyll president chief operating officer bob s bridge has given me great confidence in saying that we re going to come out of this better off than ever so here we come todd thomas keybanc analyst all right and then on the in the retail portfolio i was wondering if you could comment on the negative leasings spreads in the quarter and talk about the outlook for leasing going forward robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer so do you want to handle that adam wyll president chief operating officer no i just went out for a cup of coffee now go to the mens room robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer can you hear that tom cause hes quiet away from the microphone todd thomas keybanc analyst yeah i was just looking for a little bit of detail in the negative retail segment of the quarter and if you can talk about the outlook there adam wyll president chief operating officer majority of those numbers are as you know because you re not buying that much quicksilver these days quicksilver has had some struggles out there at beach walk with us so there lease was coming to an end and we were having troubles with them we replaced them with the first hawaiian bank and so there was a drop in the lease rate between those because those rates were done at a time they were historically very high and so as we brought in the new lease rate with first hawaiian bank there was a drop there we also as i know you know beach walk in the middle of beach walk we have peter lick art gallery there that was also under historically a pretty high lease rate and we had an opportunity to bring another quality gallery in to cover that space at a good market rate i don t remember exactly what it was but to cover that whole it would have been in our 50 yard line and we occupied it so unfortunately as leasing has picked up and things have definitely gotten better when you take out a couple of key deals or lease rates it can leave a mark i was surprised at the market it left but fortunately i think that s a temporary event just because of the two being the also to what chris was saying todd is that when we replaced quicksilver on the endcap of kalakaua and waikiki beach walk and waikiki the net impact of bringing in the bank was less than 0 005 of ffo and the reason for that is because by replacing quicksilver we also terminated our i think our we terminated the sublease that we had with the bank at that point in time the sublease rent on that was 1 7 million a year so that goes away so it s actually a win win on that transaction just from a macro point of view we ve always said that 75 of all the properties in hawaii are subject to a ground lease we had one ground lease about the size of the room we re in now now 100 of our property has we have fee simple and titled so a very high quality portfolio todd thomas keybanc analyst okay and just looking ahead are you expecting more roll downs within retail or do you think you re through that it sounds like in retail just more broadly rents have firmed up and fundamentals have firmed up quite a bit are you seeing that across your retail portfolio as well robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer yes todd for the most part things are starting to stabilize they re still going to be hit and miss there s still some categories that are still suffering as we re going through the turbulence of covid which unfortunately is not over but looking out we re in pretty good shape but there s still going to be a little bit of turbulence wnd i know you ve been to our beach walk property and out there in hawaii but it really is an impressive rebound that we re seeing i m pretty bullish i will say as we sit in this new conference room when i look out on that freeway and i see it get more and more jammed with school coming back on and back to school is coming up it s going to be a very big quarter for retailers so i m very bullish compared to what i ve seen a year ago todd thomas keybanc analyst all right thank you robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer thank you todd thank you for your interest operator our next question comes from craig schmidt with bank of america adam wyll president chief operating officer good morning craig craig schmidt bank of america analyst thank you good morning i was wondering when you think occupancy may return to 4q 19 levels by the different sectors robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer for which property you re talking about craig schmidt bank of america analyst i just meant from the retail multifamily adam wyll president chief operating officer all the properties robert f barton executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer well multifamily is going to be there it s almost there now as a matter now yes one of our properties which we re repositioning is 100 leased we have the move ins at pacific ridge portland your guess is as good as mine but things are getting better and not worse which is the right direction as far as office goes we ve never had a decline really in occupancy to speak of if anything it s on the upswing we ve had some attrition over the last year and i can go into detail on that but if you want so looking from q2 21 to q2 20 it was about 139 000 feet of attrition about 21 000 feet or amenity spaces that will be absorbed if you will in the next two quarters we re taking spaces and adding amenities to buildings but we ve remeasured buildings as well we just remeasured two projects in our portfolio one is growing by 26 000 feet and the other is growing by 11 000 feet so that will work itself out some was just transition or strategic but in terms of losing tenants we had 23 tenants averaging 4 000 feet that either downsized in place or left about a third was related to covid but two thirds was what i ll call cycle it s part of the office cycle so we had a big institutional financial firm at city center bellevue that had been a 4 5 for over 20 years they renewed their lease at rents that were 65 higher on one floor and they just gave back in june a 9 400 foot suite on the 20th floor and we re actively touring that space right now and we think we re going to achieve the 65 rent versus a 39 ending rent so these vacancies part of the business cycle provide opportunity to ratchet rents up further that s why you see our noi continue to grow even though we ve had some attrition and square footage leased so that s kind of the take line it s been largely smaller tenants we had another law firm the two named partners decided to retire after 40 years the silver lining of that is they vacated 16 000 feet and we did a new 5 000 foot lease with their younger partners so our portfolio is solid we have great assets and we continue to generate increasing rents even through covid and it s as i said in our remarks i expect net absorption in our office portfolio moving forward substantial net absorption so we re bullish ernest sylvan rady chairman chief executive officer i think that strategy is going to produce substantial shareholder accretion to value and that s our strategy in order to achieve these increased rents we have improved the properties and we manage the properties better thanks to steve s leadership so we re optimistic about our office and are putting our money where a as they say in french and sulli you want to answer something on retail christopher e sullivan vice president of retail properties i mean it s a steady client but i can t say when we re going to recover to where we were in q4 19 it could be a year out a year and a half sometimes it s one step forward two steps back three steps forward one step back just it s going to revolve on consumer spending which i think will be good but it will get there ernest sylvan rady chairman chief executive officer our retail properties are well positioned our management in spite of trip is excellent and i say that in retail we ll do as well as anybody because of a the management and b the locations so if you look at the industry and we ll do as well as anybody in the industry and of course you know as well as i that there s a fair amount of uncertainty craig schmidt bank of america analyst and then just maybe just a little more color is there enough pent up demand on domestic travel to hawaii to make up for japan which doesn t sound like it could get really started until november or later but it sounds like just given the short time of the reopening you ve done so well i m just wondering if you think there is enough domestic demand to compensate for the absence of japan ernest sylvan rady chairman chief executive officer well that embassy suites has been a very pleasant surprise during the covid it broke even and that was so much better than all of us expected there has been a rebound now from domestic demand but the way i describe domestic demand that s the cake the icing on the cake is asia and so as that unfolds we will return to pre covid levels steve center vice president of office properties yes let me add to that craig is that yes to answer your question yes there is sufficient demand on u s west and canada to maintain a high 80 occupancy our strategy at the embassy is to keep it around 87 88 occupancy and then we push rate and there s less what i want to call it it s less worrying on the host if you have 100 occupied if you have something 100 occupied whether it s a hotel or apartments you re not charging enough and so we keep it at 88 for the most part and then push the rate but june was all u s west and i can see on our star report and i can see in our bookings 90 days out that s where it continues to be craig schmidt bank of america analyst great thanks for the color guys bye adam wyll president chief operating officer thank you craig operator and i m not showing any further questions at this time i d like to turn the call over to our chairman ernest rady for any closing remarks ernest sylvan rady chairman chief executive officer again thanks for your patience we re glad to have the dividend back to where it was pre covid we wish we didn t have to go through this covid and reduce that dividend we re glad to have it back we were upset that we had to but we thought that survival was and conserving the cash was most important as you all know we had a bond offering which is 4 5 times oversubscribed we now have substantial liquidity we look forward to employing it in projects that will continue to increase our net asset value and shareholder wealth thank you for your confidence and we look forward to a great future thank you operator duration 39 minutes call

follow up questions but ask that you rejoin the queue if you have a second question now let me turn the call over to terrence for opening comments terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member thank you sujal and i also appreciate everyone joining us today to cover our results for the third quarter as well as our expectations for our fourth fiscal quarter before heath and i get into the slides and the details of the quarter i want to frame our view of the environment that we re operating in as well as our performance we are in an economy that is showing strong gdp growth globally driven by the recovery from last year s covid shutdowns with consumer spending that is robust as well as corporations around the world increasing investment to capitalize on this recovery in addition to the recovery it s also important to note that we ve strategically focused te around select secular trends and these trends are accelerating in the key markets that we serve you ll see this in our transportation segment with electric vehicle adoption accelerating in our communications segment around cloud investment and in our industrial segment with capital spending accelerating globally around factory automation as well as digitization while we have a recovery that is happening faster and is more robust than we all thought the reality is that the world is dealing with supply chains trying to catch up to this faster recovery this is causing volatility for our customers as well as everyone that s in our customer supply chains in this backdrop we are performing well in this environment and our strong results for the quarter and our performance so far this year demonstrates the strength and diversity of our portfolio you ll see this with contributions from each of our three segments we are generating sales adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share that are above pre covid levels and we remain excited about the additional growth and margin opportunities that we ll be on this year with this backdrop let me provide some key messages from today s call about our performance first i am pleased with our execution in the third quarter and the quarterly records that we achieved these records include sales of over 3 8 billion adjusted earnings per share of 1 79 and adjusted operating margins of over 19 our results were ahead of our expectations driven by the continued recovery in most end markets that we serve our broad leadership positions and strong operational performance by our teams it s also important to note that while we are in a recovery our growth also continues to be driven by the secular trends across our markets that are driving our market outperformance this year and will continue to drive the outperformance going forward another key factor that you see is that we are continuing to demonstrate our strong free cash generation model and continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximately 100 for this full fiscal year and as we look forward you ll see and we ll talk about our orders in quarter three remain consistent with our second quarter and we expect our quarter four sales to be roughly flat to our quarter three sales and we expect that these revenue levers will translate into strong performance with 1 65 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter as i mentioned our results are demonstrating the strength and diversity of our portfolio with growth and margin contributions from each segment in communications you see the growth opportunities in the cloud and the ongoing increase in capital expenditure trends by the cloud providers in our industrial segment you see increased investments in capacity and higher levels of factory automation and in transportation you see content growth trends for electrification as well as further electronification of both autos and trucks and in each of our segments we are delivering strong operational performance which are evident in the margins and when we look back to our discussion we had in october we did indicate that our first quarter would be the peak of global quarterly auto production for our fiscal year but not the peak of our earnings this is playing out as we anticipated because of our diverse portfolio for this fiscal year we are expecting over 20 growth in sales approximately 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and over 50 growth in adjusted earnings per share i am very pleased with this level of progress toward our business model and our team s ability to execute especially with some of the markets continuing to recover and the broader challenges we ve faced in the supply chain so now let me turn and i want to take a moment to frame the current market environment and our business relative to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke so starting with transportation consumer demand for autos remains robust but ongoing challenges with semiconductor supply continue to impact our customers ability to produce global auto production came in slightly lower than expected in the third quarter and we re expecting auto production to be approximately 19 million units in our fourth quarter the trends around our content growth remain strong in the transportation segment our content per vehicle has accelerated from the low 60 range a few years ago into the 70 range this year we continue to benefit from increased electronification and higher production of electric vehicles which will enable us to continue to outperform auto production going forward as content continues to grow in our industrial segment we continue to see an industrial backdrop that is improving which is benefiting our industrial equipment as well as our energy businesses also in our quarter our orders in medical have begun to recover and we returned to growth as interventional procedures have started to increase again and the one area where we are not seeing acceleration is in our ad m business but i will highlight the business does feel stable at current revenue levels from 90 days ago let me talk about communications the end market trends that we mentioned last quarter are continuing consumer demand continues to be robust in appliances and capital expenditure trends remain strong in cloud applications and while that to look at where we were versus 90 days ago by our segments i do want us all to remember that we are in a world that s still dealing with covid and the uncertainties around variants while all our global factories are operational we continue to watch developments in each of the regions we operate and our focus has been and will continue to be on keeping our employees safe while also helping our customers capitalize on the improving economic conditions so now let me get into the slides and please turn to slide three so i can get into some additional details for the third quarter as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter in the third quarter sales of 3 8 billion were better than our expectations and were up over 50 year over year demonstrating strong performance through the economic recovery with growth in all segments also on a sequential basis sales were up 3 and our earnings per share was up 14 with sequential margin expansion in each segment compared to last quarter industrial segment sales were up 5 driven by ongoing strength in industrial equipment and increases in energy and medical and in the communications segment sales were up 16 with double digit growth in both data and devices and appliances on a sequential basis and in our transportation segment our sales were in line with our expectations when you look at orders in the quarter they remained strong at 4 5 billion consistent with the levels we had in the second quarter and this reflects market improvement along with ongoing inventory replenishment by our customers if you think about the balance sheet we continue to maintain the capital strategy between making sure we re returning capital to shareholders as well as m a earlier this month we entered into an agreement to acquire erni a european connector manufacturer that has a complementary product line and serving the industrial market this acquisition has a purchase price of approximately 300 million and is consistent with the bolt on strategy around acquisitions that we talked to you about as we look forward we expect our strong performance to continue into our fourth quarter we expect sales to be up in the high teens over the year to approximately 3 8 billion adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately 1 65 and this will be up 40 year over year and as you can see on the slide we ve included our full year numbers and our performance relative to both fiscal 2020 and 2019 which i highlighted earlier so let s turn to slide four and i ll get into orders a little bit more for the third quarter our orders remained strong at approximately 4 5 billion consistent with the second quarter levels that i mentioned earlier order levels continue to reflect economic recovery and replenishment across a number of our end markets year over year we saw orders growth in all businesses and in all regions transportation orders remained elevated due to the market recovery as well as the auto industry supply dynamics in our industrial segment orders grew 8 sequentially and with growth in industrial equipment energy and medical and flat orders in ad m which indicates the stabilization that i mentioned earlier in communications sequential order growth was driven by strength in data and devices so let me also add some color on orders and what we re seeing from a geographic perspective on a sequential basis we continue to see growth in asia where our china orders were up 6 sequentially in europe our orders were down 7 sequentially and in north america our orders were essentially flat versus last quarter so with that as a backdrop around orders let me get into our segment results that you ll see on slides five through seven and i ll cover this briefly starting with transportation our sales were up approximately 70 organically year over year with growth in each of our businesses our auto business grew 90 organically and we are benefiting from the market recovery and are demonstrating continued content outperformance due to our leading global position we continue to benefit from increased production of electric vehicles as te s technology and products are enabling high voltage architectures and applications with every leading oem on the planet in commercial transportation we saw 56 organic growth driven by the market recovery ongoing emission trends as well as content outperformance we are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards around the world and increased operator adoption of euro 6 which reinforces our solid position in china the other key point is that we continue to gain momentum with wins on electric powertrain platforms and trucks which while this doesn t give revenue or orders today it will provide future content growth for our leading position in commercial transportation in sensors we saw 20 organic growth driven primarily by auto applications and we also saw growth in the commercial transportation and industrial applications as well for the segment adjusted operating margins expanded sequentially to 19 4 on essentially flat sales so let me turn to the industrial segment and in this segment sales increased 13 organically year over year in our industrial equipment business sales were up 36 organically with growth in all regions and benefiting from the momentum in factory automation applications where we continue to benefit from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor and automotive manufacturing our ad m business sales declined 7 organically driven by the continued weakness in the commercial aerospace market in our energy business we saw 9 organic growth driven by increases in renewables especially global solar applications and lastly in our medical business as i mentioned earlier a return to growth in the quarter and was up 10 organically year over year with the recovery in interventional procedures around the world from a margin perspective adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded year over year by nearly 300 basis points to 15 8 despite the volume declines in our ad m business and this was driven by solid operational performance by the teams now let me turn to the communications segment and our team continues to demonstrate strong operational execution while capitalizing on the growth trends in the markets that we serve sales grew 31 in the segment organically year over year with robust growth in both data and devices and appliances in data and devices we grew 16 organically year over year due to the solid position we built in high speed solutions for cloud applications we continue to see capital expenditures increasing by our customers and our content growth is enabling us to grow cloud related sales at double the market rate this year in appliances sales grew 57 organically versus the prior year with growth in all regions driven by market improvement our leading global market position and ongoing share gains i do want to say that our communications team continues to deliver outstanding performance to complement the higher sales levels that they re executing to and you see this with our adjusted operating margin in the segment of 23 5 which is up 760 basis points versus the prior year overall across our segments our teams are capitalizing on growth trends in their end markets demonstrating the diversity of our portfolio while delivering strong operational execution and with that let me turn it over to heath who will get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward heath mitts executive vice president and chief financial officer board member thank you terrence and good morning everyone please turn to slide eight where i will provide more details on the q3 financials adjusted operating income was 734 million up significantly year over year with an adjusted operating margin of 19 1 gaap operating income was 714 million and included 11 million of restructuring and other charges and 9 million of acquisition related charges we still expect total restructuring charges to approximate 200 million for fiscal 2021 as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization adjusted eps was 1 79 and gaap eps was 1 74 for the quarter which included restructuring acquisition and other charges of approximately 0 05 the adjusted effective tax rate in q3 came in as we expected at approximately 18 with our fourth quarter tax rate expected to be around 20 we expect to continue our we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to be around 19 importantly we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported etr for the full year if we turn to slide nine our results and progress you see on the slide reflects the strength and diversity of our portfolio and business model execution as terrence mentioned we delivered record performance in q3 on sales adjusted operating margins and adjusted eps we are not only showing progress versus the prior year but we are also delivering higher sales margins and adjusted eps versus fiscal 2019 which represents a pre covid baseline sales of 3 8 billion were up over 50 versus the prior year and up 3 sequentially with solid performance in each of our segments currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by 138 million versus the prior year adjusted eps of 1 79 was up significantly year over year and up 14 sequentially reflecting our strong operational performance adjusted operating margins were 19 1 also up significantly versus the prior year year to date our adjusted operating margins are running at around 18 and our fourth quarter is expected to be a continuation of this strong performance turning to cash flow in the quarter cash from operating activities was 682 million we had very strong free cash flow for the quarter of 539 million and year to date free cash flow is approximately 1 5 billion in q3 we returned approximately 445 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our cash flow performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100 for the full year we remain committed to our disciplined use of capital and overtime we continue to expect two thirds of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and one third to be used for acquisitions as terrence noted we entered into an agreement to acquire erni earlier this month and we expect to close by the end of this quarter erni has revenues of approximately 200 million annually and will be reported as part of our industrial equipment business before we go to questions i want to reiterate that we are performing well in this environment despite challenges in the broader supply chain our results for the quarter and our performance so far this year demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio with contributions from each of our three segments we delivered record performance in q3 our fourth quarter guidance represents a continuation of our strong performance and we are excited about growth and margin opportunities beyond this fiscal year in line with our business model let s now open up for questions sujal sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay ludy could you please give the instructions for the q a session questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of mark delaney at goldman sachs your line is open mark delaney goldman sachs analyst yes good morning and thanks very much for taking my questions terrence you mentioned several secular trends that the company is addressing and longer term that te can grow revenue and margins so i was hoping you could speak a bit more about what the company is seeing with respect to this industry backdrop and what that may mean for the company s fundamentals in the intermediate to longer term terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member yeah thanks mark and i think when you sit there you see the performance we put up which we re very proud of but in many ways a lot of where the recovery is across our business is still pretty early and i think the first thing framed to your question is probably around where can we meet demand a little bit and i would still tell you one of the things is with this quarter with some of the supply chain elements that happened within te there is about 100 million of revenue we estimate across our segments that due to our supply chain we couldn t get out to customers so we are still trying to get up to the level of demand that s out there and certainly with the supply chain issues we estimate it s about in quarter three 100 million we think it will be a similar amount in quarter four but and that s really where materials impact us around metals and resins and we think that will be with us a little bit but when you think through the markets and you think about where auto production is at right now auto production this year with the 19 million we expect in the fourth quarter is still significantly below 2019 levels that 81 million units this year will still be down from 88 million in 2019 and certainly are being troubled a little bit by some of the semiconductor supply chain so we think as you think through the cycle auto production can go up as we do look forward certainly content is going to help us we also have in industrial as i mentioned in my comments it really feels like it s just getting started our medical business is picking up our energy business that was pretty resilient continues to be strong and you re seeing what we started a couple of quarters ago around industrial equipment we continue to see that picking up as you have capex and then in communications cloud capex was up 20 this year it s expected to be up 10 next year so we still see there are big drivers for us that will help us and on the margin side we still have margin improvement that we need to deliver in two or three segments and they are our largest segments so certainly we re working through the supply chain elements that i think everybody in the plant is working through and we still see margin improvement back up to where we told you on our business model going forward so the cycle is a recovery and one of the things we feel very good about is the consumer is showing up whether it be to buy cars whether it be to buy appliances and companies now are showing up so it ll probably be lumpy but i would tell you it feels very good from the drivers that we positioned te around sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you mark next question please operator our next question comes from the line of david kelley of jefferies your line is open david kelley jefferies analyst hi good morning terrence and thanks for taking my question wanted to focus maybe on the fourth quarter earnings guidance implies based on our math sequentially lower margins relative to the third quarter it feels like we re seeing rising input costs some ongoing supply chain disruptions but also improved pricing and clearly volume recovery so with that out of mind could you talk about some of the dynamics that play here in context of how you re thinking about the fourth quarter margin trajectory heath mitts executive vice president and chief financial officer board member sure david this is heath i ll take the questions listen i mean first of all i think what we effectively had commented in my prepared statement was we re running at around 18 year to date in terms of margins and we see that more or less continuing as we work our way into the fourth quarter if you pick a particular quarter you re going to have timing issues given the how diverse we are how we re set up globally you re going to have timing issues in any one particular quarter so i think you ve got to be careful about just picking out a quarter and trying to compare it forward or backwards within our world there is price cost differences between the different businesses in some cases we re able to pass along that price more quickly particularly if it runs through our channel partners where we have distribution in some of our businesses some are heavier dependent upon that and in places where we don t have that distribution partner and that mechanism to pass along price that quickly it takes a little bit longer so the realization of that is very mixed within our portfolio the other thing to consider is we re still as we ve talked about in the past we re still on this restructuring journey with some of our footprint optimization and as part of that you re going to have timing issues of when you start to realize some of those savings versus the cost of getting some of those things done and you spend a little bit ahead of before you take things offline so there s all kinds of different moving parts in a portfolio like ours from an eps perspective sequentially we will have from a third quarter to fourth quarter we will have a tax headwind our tax rate is going to step up a couple of hundred basis points and that s fairly normal in terms of timing for the fourth quarter so some of the eps drop sequentially is tied to that tax rate sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you david next question please operator our next question comes from the line of amit daryanani of evercore your line is open amit daryanani evercore analyst good morning thanks for taking my question i guess terrence wondered if you could maybe expand a bit more on the supply chain dynamics you ve talked about there s been fair bit of discussion around this by everyone including your peers so i d love to get your perspective on what does really all of it mean for tel and maybe you can explain what are the supply chain pressures you re referring to and then what impact does it have with your operations and p l broadly thank you terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member yes no thanks for the question let me supply chain i guess we re all using more than we would like to use on coal so let me make sure what it means to te first of all let s it all starts with end demand in our customers so let me spend a little bit on what we re feeling from customers certainly customers are trying to make sure they recover and in some cases when you think about what we go into and you can take a car a car has 30 000 parts if one or two or three parts they can t procure they struggle making a car and so what you have right now because of the recovery being faster you have everybody s scrambling and also you have a lot of the data signals that are coming down from our customers are changing a lot as they re trying to make sure they meet customer demand so the first thing i would say from a supply chain is pretty severe volatility coming from our customers as they re trying to make sure they get up and running and unfortunately in some cases you ve seen customers having to stop production because of things like semiconductors so that creates volatility now when you look in our world it is important that when you think about te we are a manufacturer we start from very base materials with what we innovate we make and so from that viewpoint the biggest things that we use are things that are plastic certainly resins from commodity all the way up to very highly engineered things that help with flame retardancy and temperature as well as metals that are used for conductivity so when you sit there in those two key areas we did have some areas where resin supply was impacted and certainly metal supply has been impacted and what that has created for us is not only is supply impacted we ve had to do some things that aren t as natural for te which is we might have supply due to our global supply chain in certain parts of the world and we may be shipping things around the world so not only the availability it s also created some of those pressures as you said it in your question that we re managing because guess what we re trying to really make sure we ramp we help our customers and the reality of it is this is going to be with us we ve been dealing with it in the recovery i wouldn t say it s getting better but i would say we re going to continue to begin with it through our fiscal year and into early next year as we re trying to pick up to a world that s recovering and this type of recovery whether you see it in our orders or in the supply chain means there s a fast recovery that s happening out there as people are trying to catch up to so hopefully that gives some flavor and i think our teams have actually been managing it through the volume the price and the productivity as you ve seen our results sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you amit we have the next question please operator our next question comes from the line of joseph spak of rbc your line is open joseph spak rbc analyst thanks good morning terrence you talked about some of the bev wins and how that doesn t really impact the numbers today but it helps for future growth i was wondering if you could help dimensionalize that for us at all like maybe quantify the bookings in this quarter or the lifetime backlog and how fast are some of those factors going how should we think about that terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member so number one is from a momentum perspective the momentum that we ve talked about has not changed and there s really two factors we benefit from our global position we also benefit from the technology that we bring as you move to high voltage architecture whether that being connecting it being to sensors that are resolvers and current sensors when you get into electric motors and when you look at it to conceptualize a little bit i ll go back to what i talked a little bit about last call or the call before which is what it means to our content a few years back we were in the low 60s before in content we re in the 70s now and when you think about that 10 increase in content approximately half of that is due to high voltage so that s about 5 of content at the total te level across all production that has translated into revenue and that s a key driver as we say for our content can grow above 80 so realize there s only 9 million electric vehicles made this year what s great is that that adoption continues to accelerate it didn t stop during covid and certainly as that accelerates that s going to continue to drive content outperformance for us and it actually just continues to accelerate all around the world and it s nice to see the traction in places even like the united states which has always been a slower adopter of the technology actually pick up as well as the models that are coming out from all our global customers are showing how this trend is picking up sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you joe can we have the next question please operator our next question comes from the line of scott davis at melius research your line is open scott davis melius research analyst good morning guys terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member hey scott scott davis melius research analyst great to see you surviving this mess that s out there and thriving but i kind of just wanted to follow up on that last question a little in the context of the chevy bolt recall and perhaps the architecture that is being utilized there on the high voltage side is there are there learnings from that recall and that perhaps increases your content growth going forward and having more backup and safety systems around particularly around high voltage is there anything to be gleaned there or nothing new terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member scott great question and good to hear from you i think the thing that you look at i wouldn t say when you think about does that learning out of that recall provide extra content i wouldn t say it does but i think it shows how fast the technology is moving as well as when you look at the architecture evolution the pace of which it s coming at when you think about combustion engines and how long they took to develop as well as everybody getting their models out you will have situations where there will be events that there will be learnings of what how do you need to harden the electrical architecture i don t think that will create incremental content opportunity but what i would tell you for te is when those issues occur we re the type of company that they look to because we re working on up to 1000 volts we play not only from the charger inlet we play into where the motors go the high voltage there you also play on what s happening on the cell to cell or module to module connections as well as the sensing that occurs so certainly gm will really work hard to make sure those types of events won t occur in the future but actually it also creates a bigger opportunity for stickiness for us and certainly on the new truck platforms at gm we have very strong content that s in line with that tewo time content we ve talked to you about sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you scott can we have the next question please operator next question comes from the line of chris snyder with ubs your line is open chris snyder ubs analyst thank you my question is around te s high voltage differentiation the company has invested significantly in both in developing but also scaling these solutions globally in recent years and is this leading to high voltage share gains relative to low voltage it also seems like the oems would lean more heavily on top suppliers just given how important these initial ev rollouts are and then particularly within high voltage as it s a new but also extremely critical component for them terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member yeah so chris when we look at it i think let me take a step back just for a second with what we do around our interconnect and sensing portfolio anywhere you have data you have power you have sensing and guess what getting into smaller packages and then higher power and higher data that s what our engineers do and so when you deal with high voltage architecture in a car certainly our customers that s why they like the position we have and it s a global position as i said where we design all around the world with all the oems so when you think about it it is one point i want to highlight is the low voltage architecture carries over for us because you re not putting in your low voltage applications onto the battery and the motors so our low voltage carries over and where we really get into and i mentioned it to scott s question it starts at the charging inlet it goes into how does you get the connections and the sensing occur around the high voltage connection that you need around the motors it gets into the battery solutions it gets into the contactors that we provide to switch the power over as you go from dc to ac and back as well as the position in the current sensors so it s completely across and i think the other thing that s unique for us versus some others that might be a tier i now we re tier ii our customers really like that we re agnostic we are there to solve their challenges that they re trying to get to how are they trying to solve fast charging what type of cells are they using in their battery pack and that agnostic element is what they really like about our global position as they come into and we focus on the connection systems we don t get complicated about harnesses and other things that s what the tier one s do but it s really about the connection technology that we invest in as they think about the platforms and how they have to evolve these platforms and that s where you get the content increase that we mentioned and we shared examples but it gives us a real content opportunity to double our content in electric vehicles and like i said earlier the content growth you re seeing in te about half of it over the past couple of years is due to high voltage wins sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you chris could we have the next question please operator our next question comes from the line of wamsi mohan of bank of america your line is open wamsi mohan bank of america analyst yes thank you terrence you had a pretty solid fiscal third quarter you re guiding to a pretty strong exit for this fiscal year can you maybe share some early thoughts into next fiscal year it feels like there should be some nice production growth since other end markets seem to be in recovery mode as well so any bookends around dimensioning fiscal 2022 will be helpful thank you terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member thanks wamsi and i guess i have to give you the caveat that we only guide for the fourth quarter and we ll talk to you in 90 days about what we see going into 2022 but i just do want to reflect on what we say our business model is maybe before i talk to markets it is about the content we ve talked about even to your questions it is about where our underlying production go in the different various markets that we serve and it is about also continuing to capitalize on some of the execution things that heath talked about on restructuring we re still not at the target margin in two of our three segments and its how do we use that capital to return it to you so i do think it s important that s the way we think about te and it s important that we keep it in front of us and some of this i talked about in transportation we do still see a runway around production semiconductors had been a little bit of a governor this year that probably will get fixed i think people see in 2022 at some point but also that the consumer demand and inventory being depleted on car lots really are something that you could see auto production going up certainly our content will continue in industrial manufacturing capex is accelerating i mentioned we re seeing it in semiconductor we re benefiting from that we re seeing it in the automation we re benefiting from that and what we re seeing in medical as well as energy looks like very nice legs to it the one spot that we don t sort of see any signs of acceleration is around aerospace and defense and that s just something there s good consumer trends we aren t seeing it yet in that supply chain and then in communications i would just say cloud we expect to be strong when it comes to appliances the consumers are showing up strong that probably will normalize at some point i don t know if that will be in 2022 or later but certainly we re benefiting from a very strong appliance cycle here around the consumer so really like how the end markets could be teeing up for 2022 and we ll share more with you in 90 days sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you wamsi could we have next question please operator next question coming from the line of joe giordano of cowen your line is open joe giordano cowen analyst hey guys good morning terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member hey joe joe giordano cowen analyst hey just curious on in auto on the customer inventory side of component parts a lot of different commentary coming out so far in earnings season from what different companies are seeing just curious what you do internally to kind of make sure you re understanding whether order what percentage of orders that you re getting are for like actual production of cars right now and how much is for your own customers building some stock so like what s the internal procedure for kind of fleshing that out terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member well a couple of things that we do so it s not unreasonable to assume that people will be trying to hold a little bit more buffer stock right now but as i said we re not even able to make current full demand and i said that was about 100 million we do actually make sure as we check with our customers actually in some cases we visit their warehouses to make sure we don t see hoarding occurring and we also talk to our oem customers because let s realize in some cases we ship into tier ones and there s lots of discussions between the oem the tier ones to make sure flow continues to happen so i m sure in some parts there maybe some people trying to build up a little bit extra buffer stock especially in the supply chain environment i would tell you we re still trying to get to make sure we keep demand flowing to keep production going with the oem lines sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you joe could we have next question please operator our next question comes from the line of christopher glynn of oppenheimer your line is open christopher glynn oppenheimer analyst yes thanks also wanted to double down a little bit on the relationship between orders and consumption and as pertains to revenue i m wondering if there s any mismatch relative to the actual production now with the transportation segment specifically that we might qualify our view of production advancement next year and then as far as orders go would we anticipate a quarter or two where maybe you have the reciprocal of what we re seeing now and kind of mismatched the other way with the continued outsized book to bills for the trailing periods terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member you asked about three questions there so no let me start at the total company level first and we ve had 4 5 billion of orders last quarter and this quarter and if you take this quarter we built 3 8 billion i think when you look at that gap that gap is certainly larger than normal there is about 100 million of that gap that is real demand that due to our supply chain we could not fulfill when you look at that remaining gap i sort of think about it in a couple of buckets and certainly we look at it a lot we study it by our different end markets there is probably about half of that element which relates to our distribution partners that is where people may not be able to get goods from us they re looking to our channel partners to procure and from that viewpoint we have seen an increase a very strong increase over the past two quarters in our channel partner orders but what i would tell you our channel partner inventory is at the same levels as last year so their turn is up very big they re placing orders certainly we re not able to meet them to the levels that they re ordering the other portion would be from our direct oem customers and it will be that they re trying to make sure te parts are not that one two or three parts that they can t make something so we have seen people go out an extra quarter in some of their ordering patterns due to the current environment and i think as the supply chain continues to get better what you would see in places like transportation and transportation book to bill is typically around one it s not typically 1 1 1 2 and i think as the supply chain catches up you will see things get more normal and get closer to where they should be as they normalize and the whole supply chain gets better so i would expect at some time orders will get closer to billings clearly as the supply chain continues to improve and things become better sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you chris operator next question please operator our next question comes from the line of samik chatterjee of jpmorgan your line is open samik chatterjee jpmorgan analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question i guess terrence just wanted to follow up on your comment about order trends by geography and seem like europe is kind of the outlier there where you re still you re seeing some weakness in the order so just if you can talk about what you re seeing in terms of the difference there in europe and the recovery there and why probably kind of the order trends being kind of an outlier to the other regions terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member no honestly when you look at that i know it s down by about 7 sequentially i would say when you look at that that s more around some of the normal summer shutdowns in transportation then i would say it s a big deceleration i would say we continue to see orders even as we re into july stay at elevated levels because the conditions we re in aren t changing and i wouldn t say it s one barometer negative or positive it s just a little bit slower and certainly we would normally see that as some of our customers do summer shutdowns in europe in the automotive space and they are still doing those sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you samik operator next question please operator next question is from william stein of truist your line is open william stein truist analyst great thanks for taking my question terrence you mentioned earlier this fact of manufacturing where a car has 30 000 parts or whatever it is and you need all of them to make the car not just a subset even if you re missing a couple you have a problem it s certainly true in almost all products in autos though i m sure you d acknowledge that there are cases where these companies can decide well there s a feature or two that we can isolate and perhaps decontent it and get a car shipped we re picking this trend up pretty clearly from multiple sources that we re seeing decontenting going on in order to get around the shortages i m wondering if te is seeing this if so to what degree and in particular does it take away from your growth in sort of the next couple of quarters in any way where perhaps a more content rich car would have provided a better opportunity but what the company is shipping is something of a smaller content opportunity or vice versa terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member hey will great question number one let s face it the auto manufacturers are being creative because there s consumer demand and let s face it they want to get the vehicles out and if there s a feature where they can t get a component they certainly are taking some of those features out near term i would tell you on our revenue while we do see that around certain oems that is not having a meaningful effect where we play in the core architecture and the electrical network as well as in the backbone in an ev you may lose a couple of interconnects but that is not that much from a big picture content and even if you look at our content growth this year over production it s not evident in any way so i would also say in this type of environment while you have some of that decontenting they are also being able to add options to it which we also benefit from but that isn t meaningful and a big number either so it would probably impact others more than us but with our breadth that we have across where we play in the architecture while they re doing it it s not having a meaningful impact on te sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you will next question please operator your next question from matt sheerin of stifel your line is open matt sheerin stifel analyst yes good morning terrence i wanted to just ask about the strength that you re seeing in the communications segment and specifically the cloud business and the margins there it looked like record margins so the question is how sustainable is that and then within the cloud demand side how diversified are you i know obviously there s just a handful of really big hyperscale players but in terms of the diversification and the lumpiness of that business if you could provide more color terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member sure matt and thanks so a couple of things let me talk about the cloud element and then i ll talk about segment margins on the cloud element what s really been nice is and those of you that follow us we very much our d d business years ago we basically made the strategic decision to get at consumer so we could focus on just high speed and i remember when we had less than 100 million with our cloud customers it s well over 300 million today and our market share at one point in time was with one of the cloud providers our market share is pretty even across all the cloud providers and not only the us cloud provider but also globally so the breadth and the strengthening of it as well as the share gain it s both the growth of the capex and their investment but also how our teams executed on share gain as well and bringing important technology to it and it has been a strong cloud environment i think i mentioned already close to 20 capex growth in cloud what s nice is next year we still see double digit again and as you not only get that underlying growth it goes back to the secular trend around content is content to next generation as new chips come out on those servers we also benefit from our next generation products from what the content is so we feel very good with where we re positioned there when you look at the segment margin performance by the team has been very strong it s benefited not only by what we ve done in cloud i would also say our appliance business and that global leading position that growth there in that business has also very much contributed to the margin in that segment so we still think that s a high teens business through cycle so with having both segments being very strong it s benefiting the margin there and it s something that as probably appliance normalizes we could have some pressure but net net that that segment is above target margins is something we re proud of sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you matt can we have the next question please operator next question is from steven fox your line is open steven fox fox advisors analyst hi good morning everyone terrence and heath i was just curious if you could talk about when you start considering some of these supply chain pressures and inflation pressures to be sort of a new normal and how you might change managing your supply chain how you might change hedging how your customers might change and within that context can you just sort of give us a baseline for what you re doing on hedging inflation thanks heath mitts executive vice president and chief financial officer board member sure steven this is heath i ll take that our biggest input pressures that we have when we talk about things that are impacting our p l would be around resins and being around certain specialty metals right that we use in our products in many cases for the metals we do have a hedging program that generally hedges out about 18 months of our anticipated usage or purchase and subsequent usage so when we see inflation or deflation relative to the metals that tends to kind of layer in more quietly into our results both directions so that is unchanged and we ll continue to do that the bigger issue that we are seeing when we are looking at some of these and we throw them into the broader supply chain bucket is we do have local sourcing which is really good it enables a lot of nimbleness and agility for our businesses whether that s in asia europe or in the americas to be able to procure product locally versus shipping things around the world it also has the challenges that when we do have supply chain disruption in a particular location or in a particular region whether that s driven by natural causes like floods or otherwise the situation down in texas earlier this year where a lot of the chemical companies came offline and put a lot of pressure through the resins and so forth in the americas those types of things when they happen or floods in germany so when those things happen we still have to be responsive to our customers so sometimes that means we are then moving some of our supply around the world and that can get very expensive so the freight costs it s a long winded way of saying some of the freight costs layer into some of the supply chain pressures as well from us because of some of our structure for us we re going to continue to take advantage of those local supply chains and we just need to make sure that we have that flexibility going forward in terms of our ability to manage it and when do we foresee it being part of the new norm i don t know i mean the semicon doesn t impact us directly but impacts our customers so you re probably better equipped to come up with answers to when semicon shortages dissipate in terms of some of the other things relative directly to us i would say we re working through those and feel pretty good about how we re ready to jump into fy 2022 sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you steve can we have the next question please operator next question coming from the line of jim suva of citigroup your line is open jim suva citigroup analyst thank you and my one question is actually a follow on to your response heath that you just gave and not talking about the semiconductor shortages but the resins input costs and all that you talked about hedging and such i m wondering as shipping costs have been around for a while now the same amount of time all through covid and these additional raw material costs i m wondering is there come time to start like repricing some of your contracts with customers or put in indexing for raw materials or all your answers so far talk more about hedging and dealing with your supply and stuff so i m just wondering is it time to go back to talk to the customer or are we just not there yet terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member no jim it s terrence twofold we ve been there quite frankly so to sort of go where we are on it across our channel partners we did a price increase and this is 20 of our business in january we just implemented another price increase and we re going to continue to look in this environment and our direct customers we are having those discussions right now we do have metal riders in many of our agreements that are sort of like towers if you bust out of an area on metal we have ability to recapture and then when you deal with resins and freight which are newer we are having those discussions with our customers it s very different by industry and that s what has been going on and that they will layer in at different times but i feel we are having those discussions real time sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you jim next question please operator next question coming from the line of luke junk of baird your line is open luke junk baird analyst thank you probably a question for heath this morning i was hoping you could walk us through the sequential margin walk in industrial margins given the step up that we saw versus first half levels and also looking forward here maybe just in the fourth quarter if you could give us any help on what the what that margin outlook might look like in industrial specifically heath mitts executive vice president and chief financial officer board member sure well i mean first of all thanks for the questions we ve been pretty public with the journey that we re on within the industrial segment margins right and we started this in the low teens and with the multiyear trajectory through a lot of rooftop consolidations of getting this business into the high teens we re kind of we re in that journey we made a lot of improvements here in the quarter certainly a couple of the things that industrial benefits from one the restructuring activity that has been underway continues that comes in chunks of time as operations get taken offline and so you might have some costs in one quarter before something comes offline and that tends to create quarter to quarter lumpiness but we smooth it out over a year or longer you can kind of see that result the other thing is and terrence just hit on this the industrial segment does benefit from the opportunity on the price side because more of the industrial business goes through distribution and so fairly large chunks of our industrial segments did have the opportunity to not only do price increases back at the beginning of the calendar year but in july implemented additional price increases and that does have more of a near term benefit for the segment versus some of the other segments where it s more of a direct to oem relationship and it takes a little bit longer to work that way through so those are a couple of the pieces as we look forward in the fourth into the fourth quarter listen timing on things you re always going to have that with the business as big and complex as we are our industrial segment being a 4 billion segment has a lot of moving pieces but i feel very good about the trajectory as we move from the first half to second half or third quarter to fourth quarter but i think even more importantly as we work our way into 2022 and beyond there is still margin upside for the segment and the team is hyper focused on that so more to come thanks for the question sujal shah vice president of investor relations thank you luke can we have the next question please operator next question is from nik todorov of longbow research your line is open nik todorov longbow research analyst yes thanks good morning i think the near term dynamics on supply chain are well publicized but my question is terrence do you see any impact on the longer term dynamics like design by your customers specifically in automotive do you see any changes in the way they operate or think about design in the current environment and if you do what s the impact that you have from these changes on your business thanks terrence r curtin chief executive officer and board member two fold from a design perspective when i think about the velocity and even coming through covid the velocity did not change during covid so if anything especially in transportation specifically on evs you see the launches that are happening you see the innovation that s happening real time what typically happens with customers i think with all of us is just seeing the pace continues to accelerate because the consumer expects it so and that s that i think not only is in transportation it s everywhere but it s also how it goes through their supply chain and also some of the benefits we get in our industrial business over people s investments including our own around how their factories have to be more flexible and digitized when it comes to the question about supply chain design clearly customers will reflect going through this period of what needs to be different and the more jit you are they ll probably pick some spots of what do they have to do differently i would say we re not seeing anything near term we don t see people thinking about vertically integrating interconnects versus maybe some other areas especially in the transition to ev but what s good is we re very close to our customers and hopefully we can take advantage of it for opportunity for te versus risk as they work through it because once again being with every oem we have a pretty good purview especially in automotive as we go forward sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thank you nik can we have the next question please operator and our last question coming from the line of rod lache of wolfe research your line is open shreyas patil wolfe research analyst hey this is shreyas patil on for rod just two quick ones one could you help quantify the supply chain impact that you saw in the quarter i believe last quarter you mentioned it was a 50 million headwind and then second just looking at the year over year comparison i know it s a bit challenging given the base effect but it looked like your incremental margin ex currency was maybe closer to 40 and i think in the past you ve talked about 30 to 35 incremental margins so maybe just how we should think about that going forward heath mitts executive vice president and chief financial officer board member sure this is heath i ll take the question i think in the quarter and terrence mentioned this earlier that we quantify the supply chain impact to us and define it more or less as our availability to or in some cases inability to get the input materials that we need but that impact to us was about 100 million and i would say that probably two thirds of that would have been in transportation so our inability to ship was about 100 million that i would quantify on the topline for the supply chain impact and obviously the teams are scrambling day by day to recover that and keep customers happy in terms of the flow through listen the year over year flow through i would we re proud of it we re proud of it when we look at it and not just in the third quarter and anticipated flow through in the fourth quarter but also on a year to date and full year basis and we are proud of it i think yes i would caution you last our compares last year were so far off relative to the severe downtick and that had a disproportionate impact to our margins as well last year so when we look at that on the downtick versus the recovery a year later you re going to see some in a quarter in a given quarter you re going to see some outsized numbers i don t i would not want to guide you to reset your expectation that 40 is the new norm for our flow through we are still confident in that 30 to 35 number which was up which we took up earlier this year due to some of the restructuring activities that have been underway and i think it normalizes into that range but you re going to have a quarter noise from time to time particularly in a year over year basis like we had in the third quarter sujal shah vice president of investor relations okay thanks for the question shreyas and i want to thank everybody for joining us this morning if you have more questions please contact investor relations at

commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases in the united states and internationally the company is focused on developing its lead product candidate defencath a purported novel antibacterial and antifungal solution designed to prevent costly and dangerous catheter related bloodstream infections crbsis in july 2020 cormedix completed submission of a new drug application nda to the u s food and drug administration fda for defencath as a catheter lock solution with an initial indication for use of preventing crbsis in patients with end stage renal disease who are receiving hemodialysis via a central venous catheter the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and or misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company s business operations and prospects specifically defendants made material misrepresentations concerning the following i deficiencies existed with respect to defencath s manufacturing process and or at the facility responsible for manufacturing defencath ii in light of the foregoing deficiencies the fda was unlikely to approve the defencath nda for crbsis in its present form iii defendants had downplayed the true scope of the deficiencies with defencath s manufacturing process and or at the facility responsible for manufacturing defencath and iv as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 1 2021 cormedix issued a press release announc that the cannot approve the for defencath in its present form cormedix informed investors that the fda noted concerns at the third party manufacturing facility after a review of records requested by fda and provided by the manufacturing facility that the fda did not specify the issues and cormedix intends to work with the manufacturing facility to develop a plan for resolution when fda informs the facility of the specific concerns that hen we are informed of the issues we will schedule an investor conference call to provide an update on our expected timeline for resolution and that dditionally fda is requiring a manual extraction study to demonstrate that the labeled volume can be consistently withdrawn from the vials despite an existing in process control to demonstrate fill volume within specifications on this news cormedix s stock price fell 5 98 per share or 39 87 to close at 9 02 per share on march 1 2021 then on april 14 2021 defendants announced that cormedix would have to take additional steps to meet the fda s requirements for defencath s manufacturing process including ddressing fda s concerns regarding the qualification of the filling operation may necessitate adjustments in the process and generation of additional data on operating parameters for manufacture of defencath on this news cormedix s stock price fell 1 44 per share or 15 37 to close at 7 93 per share on april 14 2021 finally on may 13 2021 cormedix announced that ased on our analyses we have concluded that additional process qualification will be needed with subsequent validation to address the deficiencies identified by fda after an analyst pressed for clearer information on defencath s manufacturing deficiencies on a conference call held that same day phoebe mounts cormedix s executive vice president and general counsel finally disclosed inter alia that there are times when there may be unexpected results obtained that the fda expect us to generate sufficient data to demonstrate that process is a controlled process and is consistent with the agency s requirements for good manufacturing practice that sterility is a very important part of that process as well as the accuracy in making sure the right volume of defencath is loaded into the vials that we are talking about thousands of vials during the manufacturing run that defendant must generat of a lot of data to make sure that all the equipment has been qualified for the intended use and every step in the manufacturing process has been qualified that th process needs to be very robust needs to be reproducible and that the burden is on the manufacturer to demonstrate that the facility can do that process reducibly and generate the required product for commercial distribution on this news cormedix s stock price fell 1 51 per share or 19 97 to close at 6 05 per share on may 14 2021 the pomerantz firm with offices in new york chicago los angeles and paris is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in

1005a edward grace of messrs ford s tractor works sits on the first fordson tractor to roll off the assembly line 3 july 1919 source cork city library the first fordson tractor made in cork in late june 1919 citizens of cork welcomed the announcement that edward grace managing director had arrived in cork with a party of engineers from messrs ford s tractor works to expedite the completion of the marina factory there were visible signs of big developments at the works the glass roof on the newly erected iron work was making rapid progress as well as the installation of the large amounts of glass work in the main buildings the first world war was deemed responsible for the building delay many cargoes of materials such as steel fell victim to submarines attacks off the irish coast by 3 july 1919 the first ford tractor left the assembly line an obligatory commemorative picture was taken at the time in addition the cork examiner carried a notice that from 30 june 1919 hours and pay were posted up at the office of the tractor works the work hours were monday to friday inclusive 8am to 4 30pm with a half hour lunch break from 12 30 to 1pm saturday s hours were 8am to 12pm the total working hours were therefore 44 per week the minimum rate per hour paid at the works for men over 18 were 2s 5d with a share of profits per hour set at 3d the total rate per hour was 1s 8d for boys under 18 wages were 6d per hour with share of profits set at nil profit sharing was based on good conduct and was paid at the discretion of the company it was also subject to employment for at least six months male office staff over 18 were paid 1s 5d per hour and a share of the profits at 6d per hour female office staff over 18 were paid 1s per hour with 3d share of the profits girls under 18 in the office were paid per hour with no share of the profit by the end of 1919 303 fordson tractors had been built at the cork factory during 1920 which was the first full year of production 3 626 tractors were produced the sum of 327 000 was also spent on a machine shop foundry expansion new wharves and equipment the sale of the fordsons was primarily in ireland and britain large numbers were also shipped to bordeaux cadiz copenhagen romania and the near east in april 1920 the acquisition of henry ford son the company from the ford family by directors of the detroit ford company meant disorganisation in sales strategies fordson tractors that were previously sold by specialist dealers were now been sold by car and truck agents with limited knowledge of the product the tractor venture became more and more uneconomical world markets also suffered depression and many european countries adopted a protectionist approach tariff and currency barriers also made exporting difficult political unrest on the irish scene hampered the consistent arrival of workers to the plant every day edward grace managing director realising that it was uneconomic and unwise for the cork factory to rely on tractor production noted a number of home truths the high cost of establishing the cork factory and maintaining an efficient work force meant that it was cheaper for european distributors to buy fordson tractors in new york and ship them across the atlantic rather than purchase them in cork grace s solution to the profit problem was logical manchester needed extra production facilities for model t cars cork had a machine shop and foundry that were not being used to their full capacity to get parts made in dearborn michigan would have been cheaper but freight costs from the states was more expensive than exporting from cork to britain where there would be no import duty this was due to ireland being part of the united kingdom by august 1921 the foundry at the cork plant was producing all manchester s cast iron requirements including the engine however in 1921 tractor output from cork fell to 1 433 the plant could only operate economically with 1 600 men the 1918 corporation lease of the land had specified that fords provide work for 2 000 cork workers in february 1922 cork corporation ordered the company to comply with the terms of the lease or face expulsion the directors of henry ford son opposed the rationale claiming that the economic and political climate had changed radically within three years of the company setting up in cork cork corporation backed down from their requests during the rest of 1922 the cork company narrowed its tractor operation by clearing its stocks and building another 2 233 fordsons on 29 december 1922 the 7 605th cork built tractor came off the line edward grace assembled all the equipment used in tractor manufacture and shipped everything to dearborn michigan the cork factory now focussed on being an assembly plant producing cars for the irish market in fact in the early 1920s whilst a ford factory was being built in england cork also manufactured components for the home and export markets cork manufactured model t parts and supplied both uk s trafford park and the continental ford plants with all their requirements of engines and rear axles up until 1927 when the european production of the model t ceased upcoming historical walking tours saturday 13 july the victorian quarter historical walking tour with kieran of the area around st patrick s hill wellington road and mccurtain street

conference call i would now like to turn the call over to joe margolis chief executive officer joseph d margolis chief executive officer thanks jeff and thanks everyone for joining the call before i turn to the results i want to take a moment and congratulate the entire extra space team one of our goals for this year was to get to 2021 stores in the year 2021 and we ve achieved that which is a great thing when i first started with extra space we had 12 stores and it s incredible to see the exceptional growth of this company the value we ve created for our shareholders so i want to thank all the folks at extra space who contributed to our achieving that goal i m also happy to announce that we recently published our 2020 sustainability report with disclosures and information related to the company s environmental social and governance initiatives i invite our listeners to review the report on the sustainability page of our investor relations website heading into this quarter i m sorry heading into the second quarter our management team had high expectations due to our record high occupancy levels significant pricing power and a relatively easy 2020 comparable and actual performance far exceeded these elevated expectations same store occupancy set another new high watermark at the end of june at 97 which is incredible as you consider the diversification of our national portfolio the elevated occupancy led to exceptional pricing power with achieved rates to new customers in the quarter over 60 higher than 2020 levels while this is inflated by an artificially low prior year comp achieve rates were over 30 greater than 2019 levels and accelerated through the quarter in addition to the benefit from new customer rates we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as more of the state of emergency rate restrictions are lifted throughout the country other income is no longer a drag on revenue due to late fees improving year over year and actually contributed 20 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter and finally higher discounts primarily due to higher rates were offset by lower bad debt these drivers produced same store revenue growth of 13 6 a 900 basis point acceleration from q1 and same store noi growth of 20 2 an acceleration of over 1 300 basis points in addition our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same store pool resulting in ffo growth of 33 3 turning to external growth the acquisition market continues to be in our view expensive given the pricing we are seeing in the market we have listed an additional 17 stores for outright disposition which we expect to close during the back half of 2021 we continue to be actively engaged in acquisitions but we remain disciplined year to date we have been able to close or put under contract acquisitions totaling 400 million of extra space investment these are primarily lease up properties and several of the properties came from our bridge loan program we have increased our 2021 acquisition guidance to 500 million in extra space investments looking forward many of our acquisitions will be completed in joint ventures and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long term value for our shareholders we were active on the third party management front adding 39 stores in the quarter and a total of 100 stores through the first six months our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties in the quarter we purchased 11 of these stores in the reit or in one of our joint ventures our first half outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improved outlook for the second half of 2021 allowed us to increase our annual ffo guidance by 0 50 or 8 3 at the midpoint while we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation of approximately 300 basis points from this summer s peak to the winter trough the moderation will begin from a higher starting point than we previously expected as a result we assume minimal impact on revenue growth from the negative occupancy delta in the back half of the year our guidance assumes moderating but still strong rate growth for the duration of 2021 which should result in another great year for extra space storage i would now like to turn the time over to scott scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe and hello everyone as joe mentioned we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same store revenue growth driven by all time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers core ffo for the quarter was 1 64 per share a year over year increase of 33 3 property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution coming from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees despite property tax increases of 6 we delivered a reduction in same store expenses in the quarter these increases were offset primarily by 13 savings in payroll and 31 savings in marketing our guidance assumes payroll savings will continue throughout the year however at lower levels due to wage pressure across the u s marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue but it should also remain down for the year in may we completed our inaugural investment grade public bond offering issuing 450 million in 10 year bonds at 2 55 access to the investment grade bond market provides another deep capital source at low rates and will allow us to further extend our average maturities our year to date dispositions equity issuances and noi have resulted in a reduction in our leverage our quarter end net debt to ebitda was 4 8 times giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities since we generally target a range of 5 5 to 6 times on this metric last night we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions we raised our same store revenue range to 10 to 11 same store expense growth was reduced to 0 to 1 resulting in same store noi growth of 13 5 to 15 5 a 750 basis point increase at the midpoint these improvements in our same store expectations are due to better than expected achieved rates higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense we raised our full year core ffo range to be 6 45 to 6 60 per share a 0 50 or 8 3 increase at the midpoint due to stronger lease up performance we dropped our anticipated dilution from value add acquisitions and c of o stores from 0 14 to 0 12 we re excited by our strong performance year to date and the success of our customer acquisition revenue management operational and growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio with that let s turn it over to latif to start our q a questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of jeff spector of bank of america jeff spector bank of america analyst good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter joe my first question is on the point you discussed on seasonal occupancy and the moderation you re still building into guidance 300 basis points are there any signposts right now pointing to that or to be fair would you say that there s still some conservatism here joseph d margolis chief executive officer thanks jeff thanks for the question and for your kind words so far we don t see any signs of it and we are actually over 97 occupied in july so we re still waiting for that moderation to begin but we do believe that slowly over time customer behavior will revert to normal jeff spector bank of america analyst okay i guess let s flip the question then on the other side in customer acquisition i mean where are the surprises coming from because we ve been talking about the moderation and of course this past year has been much stronger than expected i guess let s talk about customer acquisitions is it particular regions where are they coming from any changes what are the nice surprises you ve seen just even in let s say the last quarter or last month joseph d margolis chief executive officer yes it s really on the vacate side i would say our q2 vacates were 10 below 2019 vacates right they used 2020 as a comp doesn t really help so we still see people staying in the units and gives us fewer units to rent up and more pricing power and it s all good jeff spector bank of america analyst great thank you joseph d margolis chief executive officer thanks jeff operator our next question comes from juan sanabria of bmo capital juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning just hoping we could touch on rate growth how are you guys thinking about that growth going forward the year over year comps have been clearly impacted by covid discounting but your in place rents are at record levels near 18 a square foot if we look back to 2015 16 you had kind of two years of rate growth of about 6 5 do you think we could see something similar in terms of the quantum and duration of the year over year growth in in place rates scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes juan i can maybe walk you through some of our assumptions and i m not sure i can tell you exactly what s going to happen i think that s the big question here we ve seen very good rate growth if you look at our rates year over year we mentioned that we re 60 ahead of where we were last year last year was an odd comp if you look at it compared to 2019 you re 30 ahead so we continue to push our street rates and the expectation is that we will continue to push them through the year we do come up against a more difficult comp at the end of this year as we started pushing rates at the end of last year so that is one thing that we re looking at as we move into the fall a couple of other maybe data points discounts are up slightly in the quarter mainly due to rates being higher our discounting strategy hasn t changed significantly we ll continue to use them as a tool but we ll continue to monitor those also our existing customer rate increases are running above where they ve historically been and part of that is an odd comp again from last year where last year you had many state of emergencies where we paused rate increases and so from a year over year perspective those existing customer rate increases are contributing more than they were last year juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst and if you guys just look at the net street rates for new customers have you seen any sequential deceleration in the pace of that growth through july scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer no significant change in july from what we ve seen in june juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst perfect thank you very much scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks juan operator our next question comes from todd thomas of keybanc capital markets todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hi thanks in terms of the revised guidance and joe i appreciate the comments around revenue growth in the back half of the year but i m just curious and maybe scott can chime in here but what are you anticipating for same store revenue and same store noi growth as you exit the year if you can maybe provide some detail around the trajectory throughout the balance of the year based on what s implied by the revised guidance that would be helpful scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s without providing exact kind of monthly sequential here i ll just give you a few data points we are seeing rate contributing more in terms of the overall percentage as the occupancy delta wears off by the end of the year occupancy won t be benefiting us and it s all coming from rate but we do not expect it to accelerate significantly through the rest of the year but also contribute through the remainder of the year as we come up against these tougher comps todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay and what s the spread right now between rates for customers moving out and the achieved rates on customers moving in scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the disclosure we ve given maybe a little bit different than that what we ve typically disclosed is our in place rents compared to our new move ins and that right now is high teens which i would tell you right now is exceptional and typically in the summer months it s flat to slightly positive meaning customers moving in pay slightly more than our in place rents and this year it s high teens which is as good as we ve seen todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay and just last question for joe your comments on investments i think you mentioned you characterized the market as expensive and said that you would look to do more investments through joint ventures and the joint venture platform used to be a bit bigger and you ve been acquiring assets from within the jv platform with all the capital looking to invest in storage would you look to do something of size and maybe generate premium returns and backfill the pipeline a bit at the same time joseph d margolis chief executive officer so we are kind of governor and what we re willing to do isn t how big or small it is it s what we view the risk adjusted returns to be so we ll do as big a deal and we have capital to do as big a deal as necessary or is available provided the risk adjusted returns are good or we ll buy one off stores and historically we ve done both and we re not focused on what s too big or what s too small we re just fully focused on what we believe the risk adjusted returns to our shareholders are todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay should we expect investments going forward to be primarily weighted toward joint ventures versus on balance sheet investments joseph d margolis chief executive officer i think that s a fair assumption given where pricing is today we can significantly improve the price the returns to our shareholders by investing in the joint venture structure which makes deals that we would look at as dilutive on a wholly owned basis being accretive to us in a joint venture structure todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst alright thank you joseph d margolis chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from smedes rose of citi smedes rose citigroup inc analyst hi thanks i was just wondering you mentioned existing customers are coming closer to kind of overall market levels assuming so what sort of percent i guess of the portfolio maybe will still be subject to more rent increases i guess maybe as restrictions come off or is that pretty much behind you now scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer so we only have a few markets that have restrictions in place so they re very limited to a few specific california markets that have restrictions that go back to buyers from several years ago you have a few others across the u s that are between 10 and 20 so the majority of the portfolio is open to rate increases there are a few that still have some limit smedes rose citigroup inc analyst okay thanks and then could you talk just a little bit more about what you re seeing on the labor side you mentioned some of the savings sort of updated what you re seeing there but i mean are you having to pay people more are you having trouble staffing or how are you just a little more color around how that s working out joseph d margolis chief executive officer yes it s a significant issue that we re working with we have fewer applicants for open spots it takes longer to fill and it s more expensive so we re working real hard to try to be appropriately staffed with quality people we do see that as supplemental unemployment insurance burns off in certain states the problem gets better so i m sorry the problem ameliorates so we re hoping that that pattern continues but we absolutely are aware that there s wage pressure we re feeling it and it s going to be an issue we re going to have to deal with smedes rose citigroup inc analyst okay okay and then just last question i was just interested to see that you did not reup your atm in the second quarter and you mentioned that you would do it in the third quarter was there a reason for not doing it during the second quarter scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we were focused on getting our inaugural bond offering done we then turned to recasting our credit facility both projects were done during the quarter we feel like we had a great quarter of getting those done and then we ll refile the atm as we finish the quarter and file the q smedes rose citigroup inc analyst okay thank you scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks smedes operator our next question comes from michael goldsmith of ubs michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my questions how are you thinking about managing the interplay between occupancy and rate i understand the goal is to maximize revenue but like how are your models thinking about pushing rate maybe at the expense of occupancy in this environment joseph d margolis chief executive officer yes so it s a great question and you re right to focus on the different levers that lead to maximizing revenue but i would suggest there s many others it s not just occupancy and rate it s marketing spend it s discounting it s days you allow customers to reserve a unit there s many other tools we can use to maximize revenue and the data scientists and the algorithms take all of these factors into play in setting daily pricing and occupancy targets to try to maximize revenue michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst that s helpful and what are you seeing on the supply front given the strength of trends and they ve remained strong does supply pressure inevitably come back and if so how far away are we from that joseph d margolis chief executive officer really good question so based on what we see on the ground that affects our same store pool so not national statistics things we care about we continue to believe that there is going to be some moderation of deliveries in 2021 from 2020 just like there was from 2019 to 2020 but that being said i think we re going to see more development in the future just this week i talked to two developers who had projects that did not hit underwriting they were making no money and they re selling them and they re getting bailed out by current pricing and i asked both of them what they re going to do with the proceeds and they said we re going to go stick shovels in the ground so between great fundamentals low interest rates lots of capital floating into the space albeit i get that costs are higher i think we re going to continue to see development and it s going to be something we re going to have to deal with just like we ve been dealing with for the past four or five years no difference and that being said i d point out that one of the advantages of having a broadly diversified portfolio like extra space is we have exposures to many many different markets some of which are heading into a development cycle some of which are coming out of a development cycle some of which have never been affected by development and all those markets are in some different stage and because of that diversification our returns are smoothed out michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst very helpful and just if i can squeeze one last in on the acquisition front has there been any change in market conditions from the first to the second quarter and are you seeing any new bidders joseph d margolis chief executive officer i m not sure there s new bidders from the first to the second quarter i mean there s certainly a lot of new entrants in the market it s hard for me on the top of my head to think about one that appeared in the second quarter i don t see any material change i think there s a lot of capital interest rates are low and self storage has proven itself to be a great investment michael goldsmith ubs investment bank analyst thank you very much good luck on the second half joseph d margolis chief executive officer thank you so much operator our next question comes from samir khanal of evercore samir khanal evercore analyst thank you for taking my questions i guess just sticking on supply i mean are there any just to elaborate a little bit more on maybe the markets that are a bit any indication or initial kind of concerns that you re seeing in any markets to call out joseph d margolis chief executive officer i think our list of markets is pretty similar to the list of markets we ve had in the past the boroughs of new york we continue to be concerned about and we continue because of that new development have results there that are below our portfolio average northern new jersey atlanta vegas maybe a new market on the list we re starting to watch philadelphia also maybe a new market those are i would say the markets that where we have significant exposure that we re focused on right now samir khanal evercore analyst and i guess my second question is really around on the disposition side i mean could you see yourself bring more assets to market considering how strong pricing has been here joseph d margolis chief executive officer so we closed the disposition of 16 assets into a joint venture and we expect to close the second half of that transaction shortly to reduce our interest in the venture further we have another 17 assets on the market now for outright sale we have a couple ordinance that we re working on to get in a position to sell but nothing major and we re constantly looking at the portfolio and trying to decide what moves would be optimal to rebalance to have the right amount of exposure in different markets so we ll always consider it but that s what we have on the plate now samir khanal evercore analyst got it thank you so much joseph d margolis chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from caitlin burrows of goldman sachs caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst hi everyone maybe just a question on the bridge loan program the guidance now assumes that you retain 100 million of bridge loans this year but it seems like you re running below that pace considering what you ve closed and sold so far this year so wondering if you can go through the outlook there and what visibility you have to activity in the second half joseph d margolis chief executive officer yes that s a great question so yes we are behind initial projections in terms of timing we are confident we re going to achieve our guidance it is going to be more back end loaded we currently have 200 million worth of loans with signed term sheets and deposits to close in the back half of this year and the beginning of next year so nothing is guaranteed but i m pretty comfortable we will get to our guidance caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst got it okay and then just in terms of the customers i know you mentioned that you re finding that there s lower vacates than you ve had in the past but just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the new interest that you re seeing for space that s helping that occupancy too do you have any insight into what s driving customer storage needs this year and how that compares to the past joseph d margolis chief executive officer so this is more of a longer term answer not just this year but we saw during the pandemic the reasons people gave us for storage traditionally the number one reason has been they re somewhere in the moving process and then that declined and what increased during the pandemic was lack of space and that became the number one reason for a while those lines have since crossed again but we interpret lack of space as i m at home and i need a bedroom to for in home school or in home office or a workout room or i m going to find a cleaner garage or whatever and those customers tend to stay longer than customers who give the reason of staying is moving so i would point to that as why we re seeing currently declining vacates and i don t think all of those customers eventually take their stuff out of storage and convert the home office back to a bedroom or whatever i think some of not all of them but i think some portion of them will be longer term customers caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst okay thank you joseph d margolis chief executive officer sure operator our next question comes from spenser allaway of green street spenser allaway green street analyst thank you just going back to the transaction market once more have you guys observed any shift in pricing spreads just in terms of quality or any notable outliers in terms of geography joseph d margolis chief executive officer so we re not very very active in tertiary markets so it s hard for me to comment about that i would tell you that for good stores in primary and secondary markets there s very very little spread in pricing spenser allaway green street analyst okay and then just in terms of your inaugural public bond offering what role should we anticipate the unsecured market playing for you guys in terms of its source of funds moving forward scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think that you ll see us be a repeat issuer going forward there s two or three things driving that i mean obviously you re always looking at the rate and you re trying to get the lowest rate possible i think that we re looking to extend the tenure of our debt and then we want to have as many capital sources as possible so we are going to access the capital source that we feel like is the most advantageous to us at this time spenser allaway green street analyst great thank you scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks spenser operator our next question comes from mike mueller of jpmorgan mike mueller jpmorgan analyst you talked about buying lease up assets so i was curious for the 500 million that s baked into acquisition guidance can you give us a sense as to what an average going in cap rate or average occupancy would be joseph d margolis chief executive officer so i ll talk about our recent deals because i think to talk about deals that we signed up last year that closed this year is probably not indicative of current pricing so our for the wholly owned lease up deals we have recently approved our first year yield is 3 1 low 3s with an average 17 months to stabilization at an average stabilized cap of 6 so we re happy to accept or willing to accept that initial dilution because we have confidence in our ability to underwrite lease up and get to those accretive returns for the deals we ve done in ventures the first year yield to extra space not at the deal level is 7 2 13 months average to stabilization and a stabilized yield of almost 11 so you can see how the venture structure significantly helps our returns mike mueller jpmorgan analyst got it got it and is that what s the typical occupancy on the wholly owned where you re getting that 3 initial versus the 7 for the jv is it comparable it s not a comparable going in occupancy would it be joseph d margolis chief executive officer so the occupancies were higher than you would imagine a lot of them were in the 60s or 80s but that s physical occupancy and we look at stabilization when you get to both physical occupancy and rate stabilization right we have one that s or a couple there in the 90s physical occupancies but have significant rate growth before they get to economic stabilization does that make sense did i explain that correctly mike mueller jpmorgan analyst i think so i think so that was it thank you operator our next question comes from ronald kamdem of morgan stanley ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst hey thanks for taking my questions just going back to the ecri questions that was asked earlier maybe thinking about the entire portfolio number one just what percentage does still have some sort of restrictions on it is it sort of 5 is it 10 and the second question is are you able to sort of charge even higher ecri than you have historically given the rate environment scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t have the exact percent in front of me but it s a small percent a very low percent so even in california it s not a majority ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst got it and then on the ability to push the rate increases are you seeing sort of an ability to do it at a higher and faster level than historical given sort of the record rate environment scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer that is what we are currently doing we re pushing things more toward street rate today and part of that has to do with the fact that sometimes you ve had rate caps in place or state of emergencies that have been in place that have hindered our ability to raise rates for the past 12 to 18 months depending on the location and so we have brought them up more significantly as well as the fact that many of these customers moved in very steep discounts that were unprecedented also ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst got it makes sense and then my last question was just on the preferred investments is there anything that changed or is there any call risk with sort of the pricing environment that you re seeing today on those preferreds or are they sort of maturity thank you joseph d margolis chief executive officer so one of the things we ve changed in our guidance this year is there is a 100 million piece of the preferred to jcap that opens in the end of october i believe and our initial guidance had assumed that was outstanding for the entire year and given how well the properties are doing the company is doing we have changed our assumption that that gets paid off prior to year end reducing our dividend income from that so i think it s a safe assumption that that company will want to retire 12 money as soon as it can ronald kamdem morgan stanley analyst makes sense thank you joseph d margolis chief executive officer sure operator we have a follow up question from smedes rose of citi smedes rose citigroup inc analyst hi thanks just two more quick ones the first one i wanted to ask you it looked like the third party managed platform the number of assets under management declined sequentially on a net basis and i was just wondering is that just you just see that as a normal ebb and flow of business or is there anything in particular that went on during the quarter and then the second question was could you just talk about length of stay i think last on your last call you mentioned that length of stay had shortened a little bit and i was just wondering is it returning back to maybe what you ve seen historically joseph d margolis chief executive officer so smedes i think you re right to observe that we have a lot of churn in our management platform a lot of people are taking advantage of pricing in the market and selling but even given that churn we continue to grow that platform we ended the year at 724 properties we ended the first quarter at 763 we ended the second quarter at 768 and that includes 19 properties that left the platform that we bought so we continue to grow that we have a very very healthy pipeline we project to add net 100 to 130 properties this year it s not guaranteed we don t know what else is going to sell but we continue to grow that quarter after quarter and expect to continue to do that scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer smedes i think that also might be a little confusing when you look at the buckets we re moving sometimes between buckets and so when you take the total of jv and third party it actually did move slightly as we had some jv partners sell some of the assets in the quarter but the third party management business just the third party management actually saw a net increase and then the second question smedes on the length of stay our length of stay is now back up we saw a tick down slightly and then it s back up today smedes rose citigroup inc analyst thank you scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks smedes operator our next question is a follow up from juan sanabria of bmo capital juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst just a follow up on the balance sheet which you noted is in a very strong position 4 8 times at the end of june how should we expect that to trend and where do you see capital going and as a kind of a side question how much in proceeds should we expect from the 17 assets that are now being marketed for disposition scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer so the 17 assets that are being marketed for disposition are over 200 million in terms of where we expect to spend our next dollar or where we expect to borrow i think it will depend on the opportunities to invest i think that we ll look at the cheapest cost of capital whether that s debt i think that we typically want to operate in that 5 5 to 6 times today we re sub five so we do have a lot of capacity there and i think depending on the size of the deal you would also consider equity at times but right now we do have a leverage capacity juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst okay but the focus for incremental spend sounds like it s on acquisitions via the joint ventures there s not necessarily new investments that could be used as you think about kind of taking the balance sheet to where you want to from a target leverage perspective joseph d margolis chief executive officer so the with the exception of the second half of the joint venture sale that recapitalization if you will that i mentioned earlier we believe future joint venture acquisitions will not be out of our portfolio they ll be from the market so it won t produce additional investable dollars for us we ll invest a portion of the acquisition price juan sanabria bmo capital markets analyst got it thank you scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks juan operator our next question comes from kevin stein of stifel kevin stein stifel analyst good morning guys i was just wondering on the expense side i know marketing and payroll expenses were down i was just wondering if you could give us some color on what s driving that and how sustainable that is going forward scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes on the expense side we mentioned we had an increase of property taxes our property taxes are running about 6 year over year on the payroll side we have seen a decrease that s driven by a couple of things one is a year over year comparable that is quite easy from last year last year first half of the year you were essentially fully staffed and we were providing some we were generous in the covid benefits making sure that our employees were taken care of in terms of going forward and the how sustainable that decline in payroll is i think it s to be seen we expect some benefit but not necessarily to the degree we saw in the first and second quarter as we are expecting some wage pressure and we have more difficult comps in the back half of the year in terms of the marketing we are expecting a benefit but again if that s always the wildcard to some degree in that if we do see an opportunity to spend on marketing we will use that if we feel like we can get higher rate and higher occupancy kevin stein stifel analyst okay that s helpful thanks scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks kevin operator our next question comes from caitlin burrows of goldman sachs caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst i had a follow up question again on the acquisitions you guys gave some detail earlier about how in the i think wholly owned properties you were looking at the initial yield was 3 1 stabilized was 6 and then in the jv properties it was 7 2 initial and stabilized almost 11 i was just wondering if there was any real detail you could give us into what s driving that difference is it just fees that you earn in the joint venture or something else joseph d margolis chief executive officer so the primary driver is we collect the management fee from the joint venture and we retain 100 of that tenant insurance income so we re retaining all of that income against a much smaller capital investment versus 100 capital investment in some of our ventures we do get acquisition fees or other fees we also have the opportunity to earn promotes and in some of our older ventures we are earning promoted cash flow promotes but that s not assumed in any of these numbers caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst got it okay and then just maybe obvious but in raising the acquisition guidance to the 500 million then that just means that this year volume of transaction will be that much higher just your portion is going to be 500 million is that it joseph d margolis chief executive officer correct that s correct caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst okay thank you joseph d margolis chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from todd thomas of keybanc capital markets todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hi thanks two quick follow ups here first i think the comments from earlier were that rate growth does not accelerate in the second half of the year but the revenue growth for guidance for the second half of the year implies an increase versus the first half and you talked about the contribution from occupancy gains diminishing as we move further into the back half of the year so it would seem that rate growth is expected to accelerate can you just clarify those comments or perhaps i misheard scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i think really what you re what i m saying is q3 is better than q1 so q1 is dragging it down q3 will bring it up q4 will also be better than q1 but i m saying they re not accelerating from where they are today in june and into july todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay okay and then seasonally what s typically the beginning of the off peak season for you where move outs are higher than move ins and are you expecting anything different from a seasonality standpoint this year with schools and return to schools relative to last year scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer peak occupancy from a month end perspective is july from an actual when it peaks it s mid august but then you do see some decline as students move out and we are expecting some of those students to move out and typical student volatility todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay and that begins that coincides with that mid august timing scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer correct todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay alright got it thank you scott stubbs executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator at this time i d like to turn the call back over to ceo joe margolis for closing remarks sir joseph d margolis chief executive officer thank you thanks everyone for participating in the call and your interest and support of extra space i mean obviously we re having a fantastic year we have all time high occupancy exceptional new customer rate growth we re continuing our innovative external growth strategies as well as innovating at the store level and we expect to have a very strong same store and core ffo growth this year thank you again and have a good day operator duration

the prior year quarter due to strong oil sands operations production including record in situ volumes partially offset by the impact of planned turnaround maintenance at syncrude significant turnaround activities were completed at syncrude buzzard and across all of the company s refineries during the second quarter of 2021 the company exited the quarter with refinery utilization of approximately 94 and with syncrude and buzzard having returned to production the company is set up for a strong second half of the year canadian gasoline and diesel demand in the second quarter of

across canada with the lifting of many restrictions in july gasoline and diesel demand is estimated to have improved to 6 below the comparable 2019 levels the company shared its updated strategy which focuses on increasing shareholder returns while accelerating its greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction targets growing its business in low ghg fuels electricity and hydrogen sustaining and optimizing its base business and transforming its ghg footprint to be a net zero company by 2050 suncor together with four industry partners representing 90 of canada s oil sands production announced the oil sands pathways to net zero alliance whose initiative is aimed at working collectively with the federal and alberta governments to achieve net zero ghg emissions from oil sands operations by 2050 in the second quarter of 2021 suncor remained focused on maximizing the return to its shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 23 million common shares for 643 million under the company s share repurchase program and payment of 315 million of dividends share repurchases in the quarter represent 1 5 of suncor s issued and outstanding common shares as at january 31 2021 since the start of the normal course issuer program ncib in february 2021 the company has repurchased 961 million in common shares representing approximately 35 million common shares at an average share price of 27 47 per common share or the equivalent of 2 3 of suncor s issued and outstanding common shares as at january 31 2021 subsequent to the second quarter of 2021 suncor s board of directors the board approved an increase to the company s share repurchase program to approximately 5 of the company s outstanding common shares as at january 31 2021 concurrently the toronto stock exchange tsx accepted a notice to increase the maximum number of common shares the company may repurchase pursuant to its ncib to approximately 5 the increase to the program demonstrates management s confidence in the company s ability to generate cash flow and its commitment to return cash to shareholders financial results operating earnings loss suncor s second quarter 2021 operating earnings were 722 million 0 48 per common share compared to an operating loss of 1 345 billion 0 88 per common share in the prior year quarter in the second quarter of 2021 crude oil and refined product realizations increased significantly compared to the prior year quarter which reflected the impact of the unprecedented decline in transportation fuel demand due to the impacts of the covid 19 pandemic and the increase in opec crude supply the improving business environment in the second quarter of 2021 also resulted in a net inventory valuation gain reflecting a first in first out gain as a result of the increasing value of refinery feedstock operating earnings were partially offset by an increase in royalties and operating expenses associated with suncor s increased production in the second quarter of 2021 and reflected lower costs in the prior year quarter related to specific measures taken by the company to reduce operating costs in response to the covid 19 pandemic net earnings loss suncor s net earnings were 868 million 0 58 per common share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of 614 million 0 40 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors impacting operating earnings loss discussed above net earnings for the second quarter of 2021 included a 156 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a 10 million after tax unrealized loss on risk management activities the net loss in the prior year quarter included a 478 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a 144 million after tax unrealized loss on risk management activities funds from operations and cash flow provided by used in operating activities funds from operations were 2 362 billion 1 57 per common share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 488 million 0 32 per common share in the second quarter of 2020 funds from operations were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings loss noted above cash flow provided by operating activities which includes changes in non cash working capital was 2 086 billion 1 39 per common share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to cash flow used in operating activities of 768 million 0 50 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by a use of cash associated with the company s working capital balances in both periods the use of cash in the second quarter of 2021 was primarily due to an increase in production and commodity prices at the end of the quarter resulting in an increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances which was partially offset by a decrease in income tax receivable balances related to the receipt of a portion of the company s 2020 income tax refund operating results suncor s total upstream production increased to 699 700 boe d in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 655 500 boe d in the prior year quarter reflecting strong oil sands operations production during the quarter partially offset by the impact of planned turnaround maintenance at syncrude the prior year quarter was impacted by the significant decline in crude oil demand due to the impacts of the covid 19 pandemic the company s net synthetic crude oil production increased to 437 200 barrels per day bbls d in the second quarter of 2021 from 436 600 bbls d in the second quarter of 2020 strong mining and upgrading performance at oil sands base resulted in upgrader utilization of 96 compared to 93 in the prior year quarter at syncrude both periods were impacted by planned maintenance and following the completion of planned turnaround activities in the second quarter of 2021 syncrude ramped up to full operating rates subsequent to the end of the quarter due to the impacts of the covid 19 pandemic in the fort mcmurray region the company staggered its planned turnarounds at oil sands base plant upgrader 2 and syncrude resulting in the deferral of the oil sands base turnaround to the third quarter of 2021 this decision supported the safe and efficient completion of the syncrude turnaround activities and minimized the overlap between the two assets the deferral of the turnaround activities at oil sands base is not anticipated to impact annual production volumes and has been reflected in the company s 2021 guidance suncor continues to work with the community of fort mcmurray various levels of government and other industry stakeholders to accelerate rapid testing and vaccinations in the region the company s non upgraded bitumen production increased to 178 500 bbls d in the second quarter of 2021 from 117 100 bbls d in the prior year quarter which for the second quarter in a row included the best in situ quarterly production in the company s history during the quarter the increase in non upgraded production to market was further supported by strong mining performance at oil sands base which resulted in less firebag volumes utilized at the upgrader and overall higher oil sands operations production volumes at mackay river production in the prior year quarter was impacted by an outage that occurred in late 2019 production at fort hills during the quarter reflected the previously communicated change in the mine ramp up strategy this strategy is principally focused on building ore inventory as appropriate ore inventory levels are required to operate the plant at 90 of nameplate capacity on a two train operation by the end of the quarter ore inventory build was slower than expected with access to additional contract equipment and labour being more constrained than expected access to additional resources has increased and we anticipate being at expected contractor capacity by august 2021 subsequent to the quarter slope instability on the south side of the mine which contains the majority of the exposed ore will require overburden removal to occur earlier than expected to provide full access to the exposed ore and maintain slope integrity this activity is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021 as a result fort hills plans to continue at the current production level for the remainder of the year with a transition to both primary extraction trains beginning in late 2021 to enable full production in early 2022 2021 annual guidance for fort hills production and fort hills cash operating costs have been updated to reflect these changes exploration and production e p production during the second quarter of 2021 decreased to 84 000 boe d from 101 800 boe d in the prior year quarter primarily due to planned turnaround activities at buzzard and natural declines both periods were impacted by the absence of production from terra nova as the asset has remained off line since the fourth quarter of 2019 during the second quarter of 2021 the company announced that the co owners of the terra nova floating production storage and offloading facility and associated terra nova field have reached an agreement in principle to restructure the project ownership and provide short term funding towards continuing the development of the asset life extension project with the intent to move to a sanction decision in the third quarter of 2021 the agreement is subject to finalized terms and approval from all parties to the agreement and is contingent upon the previously disclosed royalty and financial support from the government of newfoundland labrador refinery crude throughput was 325 300 bbls d and refinery utilization was 70 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to refinery crude throughput of 350 400 bbls d and refinery utilization of 76 in the prior year quarter reflecting planned turnaround activities in the current quarter and reduced rates in response to lower demand due to the covid 19 pandemic in the prior year quarter during the second quarter of 2021 the company completed turnaround activities for the year across all its refineries enabling them to exit the quarter with a refinery utilization of approximately 94 refined product sales in the second quarter of 2021 increased to 463 300 bbls d compared to 438 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter due to improved refined product demand and a draw in product inventory as we strategically built inventory in support of significant planned turnaround activities and an improving business environment with the completion of turnarounds across the company s refineries and the phased lifting of covid 19 related restrictions the company is positioned to capture improved margins in the second half of the year as domestic demand continues to recover towards pre pandemic levels in the first half of 2021 we achieved strong oil sands base mining and upgrading production and consecutive quarterly production records at in situ leading to the best start to the year in the company s history at oil sands operations said little during the quarter we completed significant turnaround activities at syncrude and across all our refineries following the quarter we ve ramped up our assets and are positioned for a strong second half of 2021 the company s total operating selling and general expenses increased to 2 720 billion in the second quarter of 2021 from 2 129 billion in the prior year quarter due to increased production at oil sands base and higher planned maintenance that was conducted at the same time as the planned turnaround activities at syncrude these expenses were partially offset by cost reductions related to digital technology and transformation initiatives increased production in the quarter resulted in higher absolute costs but lower cash operating costs per barrel at oil sands operations despite a significant increase in natural gas prices compared to the prior year quarter the prior year quarter reflected lower costs related to specific measures taken by the company to reduce operating costs in response to the covid 19 pandemic and was also favourably impacted by the government of canada s emergency wage subsidy strategy update in may suncor held its investor day event to outline the company s medium term corporate outlook provide an update on the progress made to date on its 2 15 billion incremental free funds flow target and discuss other strategic objectives in the near term the company expects to continue to execute its plans to structurally lower its cost base and improve productivity including ensuring the smooth transition of syncrude operatorship and continuing suncor s digital transformation once syncrude operatorship is transferred gross synergies of approximately 100 million are expected for the joint venture owners within the first six months with an additional 200 million through 2022 2023 building on the achievements in 2020 which included debottlenecks and tailings management initiatives in 2021 such as mine optimization and digital process and technology projects are expected to contribute to the company s 2 15 billion incremental free funds flow target suncor also announced its new strategic objective to become a net zero ghg emissions company by 2050 on emissions produced from running its facilities including those it has a working interest in and to substantially contribute to society s net zero ambitions while suncor will continue to track and report emissions intensity the company has set a more ambitious near term goal to better align with its objective to reach net zero emissions and to provide a clearer way to demonstrate progress targeting annual emissions reductions of 10 megatonnes across its value chain by 2030 suncor plans to achieve this by reducing its base business emissions investing in profitable low emissions ventures and technologies taking actions that reduce others emissions and investing in offsets outside its business additionally suncor together with canadian natural resources cenovus energy imperial oil and meg energy who together operate 90 of oil sands production announced the oil sands pathways to net zero alliance the goal of this alliance is to work collectively with the federal and alberta governments to achieve net zero ghg emissions from oil sands operations by 2050 the pathways initiative will explore several parallel pathways to address ghg emissions including the creation of a carbon capture utilization and storage trunkline connected to a carbon sequestration hub to enable multi sector tie in projects as well as the implementation of other next generation technologies suncor s new strategic objectives and targets around absolute ghg emissions reductions will be supported by pragmatic and economic investments that are part of or synergistic with the company s core capabilities this includes investments in the cogeneration facility at oil sands and the forty mile wind power project which are expected to generate mid teen returns additionally during the second quarter of 2021 suncor and atco ltd announced a partnership on a potential world scale clean hydrogen project to be developed in alberta canada a sanctioning decision is expected in 2024 and the facility could be operational as early as 2028 provided it has the required regulatory and fiscal support to render it economic the company also recently released its 2021 report on sustainability and climate report marking over 25 years of dedication to improve sustainability performance and increase transparency and reporting the details of suncor s new ghg emissions reductions objectives can be accessed at sustainability suncor com we continue to progress on our ambition to be canada s leading energy company focusing on increasing shareholder returns while accelerating our ghg emissions reduction targets said little our strategy will optimize the value of our base business improving its cost and capital efficiency while supplementing it with economically robust energy expansion investments that will contribute to increasing free funds flow this balance will be critical to increasing our shareholder returns fortifying our balance sheet while significantly lowering ghg emissions by 2030 and progressing to net zero by 2050 the updated strategy and progress on the company s ghg emissions reduction objectives will continue to be underpinned by capital discipline the company has set an annual ceiling for total capital expenditures of 5 billion including lowered sustaining and economic capital to sustain its base business while investing in energy expansion and building out its low carbon business over the medium term suncor expects to allocate approximately 10 of its annual capital budget approximately 500 million per year on investments that are intended to advance its lower carbon energy offering the company plans to allocate incremental funds to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks as well as towards debt reduction with the company targeting absolute net debt inclusive of leases of 12 15 billion by 2025 dividends are expected to increase in line with the 2 15 billion incremental free funds flow growth with additional free funds flow being allocated to share buybacks to accelerate reaching these debt reduction targets in 2021 the company plans to allocate two thirds of its annual free funds flow after its dividend towards debt reductions and one third toward shareholder cash returns through share buybacks in the second quarter of 2021 the company returned

continue to deliver results and fuel momentum across our integrated and focused portfolio deanna will follow with additional details on our second quarter results our progress against financial targets and our current financial position starting on slide 5 our recent investor day we announced the results of our strategic review including the areas of our business that we will continue to invest in and expand on as well as select markets and products we will exit and we shared how these priorities enable us to reach our financial targets and deliver against our strengthened capital management approach our resulting go forward strategy is focused on our growth drivers of retirement in the u s and emerging markets global asset management and u s benefits and protection these businesses offer the greatest opportunity for growth leverage our differentiators and integrated business model and meet our financial objectives of being more capital efficient with higher returns we re exiting u s retail fixed annuities as well as the retail segment of u s individual life and we are seeking transactions for the related in force blocks allowing us to free up capital and derisk our portfolio we are focused on executing on the transactions and expect they are actionable in the near term these moves will better enable us to achieve our financial targets which include delivering 9 to 12 annual growth in earnings per diluted share from 2020 to 2023 achieving a 15 return on equity by 2023 and generating free capital conversion of 70 to 80 and lastly we outlined a plan to return more capital to shareholders totaling 3 billion between 2021 and 2022 this does not include any excess capital that may be generated from potential transactions bottom line the changes to our business portfolio and capital management strategy will drive future growth reduce capital intensity improve risk profile sharpen our strategic focus and reinforce our commitment to returning more capital to shareholders all aimed at driving long term shareholder value we are in a strong position to continue to create long term shareholder value and to grow meaningful ways for our customers and shareholders as evidenced by our second quarter results as shown on slide 6 we reported 467 million of non gaap operating earnings in the second quarter excluding significant variances earnings increased 21 over the second quarter of 2020 driven by continued execution of our long term strategy and improvement in macroeconomic conditions in many of our markets we closed the second quarter with total company aum of 990 billion including record pgi managed aum and more than 130 billion of institutional retirement and trust retirement assets that migrated over the last nine months total company net cash flow was a positive 2 1 billion in the second quarter including 1 6 billion of pgi managed net cash flow our growth drivers continue to deliver performance for the enterprise generating strong earnings growth and creating long term value for shareholders in our u s retirement business the underlying fundamentals remain strong and are fueling growth in the business reoccurring deposits increased 33 over the second quarter of 2020 with more than half of the growth coming from our legacy block and the remainder from the irt migration participant withdrawals were 2 4 of average account values in the second quarter in line with our historical average and lower than the 2 8 we experienced a year ago during the pandemic however as a result of strong equity markets participant withdrawals increased 3 billion over the second quarter 2020 this is consistent with prior periods of strong equity performance and the opposite is true when equity markets decline these withdrawals led to negative net cash flow in ris fee of 400 million in the second quarter as the strong growth in sales and reoccurring deposits as well as the low contract lapses were offset by higher dollars of participant withdrawals we completed the migration of the irt retirement business during the second quarter as we discussed at the investor day the migration of the trust and custody business will be completed in the first quarter of 2022 over the last nine months through the irt migration we ve added 2 4 million retirement participants and 140 billion of account value to our platform increasing scale driving growth and positioning principal as a top three retirement provider the strategic benefits of the acquisition continue to emerge including revenue and expense synergies we re beginning to see lower tsa expenses increased proprietary investment management opportunities and greater ira rollovers and expanding retirement plan and total retirement solution opportunities our sales pipeline has nearly doubled over the last year with the strongest growth in the large plan market which we expect to largely benefit sales in 2022 in the ris spread business we had approximately 750 million of mtn issuance in the second quarter and 500 million of pension risk transfer sales the prt business continues to be a core offering of our total retirement solutions and we remain disciplined in pricing to ensure opportunities meet our return thresholds looking forward our u s retirement business has four key growth engines which we referenced at investor day momentum from the irt acquisition differentiation from an unmatched set of total retirement solutions and engaging participant experience evolving with more digital enhancements and pgi s world class investment management solution these four powerful engines will drive future growth for our retirement business as well as the rest of the enterprise outside the u s our emerging market retirement and long term savings business is facing near term challenges from macroeconomic conditions and the pandemic in chile second quarter aum was negatively impacted by 1 6 billion of covid related afp hardship withdrawals as the country approved a third wave of withdrawals during the quarter as a reminder this does not impact our revenue in chile as fees are collected on salary not aum principal international reported a flat net cash flow and 167 billion of aum in the second quarter a 7 increase on a constant currency basis compared to a year ago china aum which is not included in reported aum was 143 billion in the second quarter and was pressured by negative net cash flow from institutional money market funds despite these challenges we have the competitive advantage needed to drive growth over the long term within our chosen markets we have strong local and global investment management capabilities the right joint venture partners with meaningful reach distribution and brand recognition locally and a digital strategy that allows us to access and service customers where they are we continue to diversify our offerings in principal international for example in brazil our multimercado funds balanced funds and investments in equities or fixed income have become more attractive due to the decline in interest rates at the end of the second quarter these funds accounted for over 20 of aum in brazil pref with brl28 billion of net cash flow year to date we ve captured 54 of the market share and 55 of second quarter sales were in these funds emerging markets are long term investments we re well positioned to navigate the inherent volatility that comes with doing business in emerging markets we will continue to capitalize on our competitive advantages by offering higher value added products and differentiated solutions to our customers as well as leveraging our global asset management capabilities to drive future growth in principal international our global asset management business is driving growth and demonstrating the strength of our integrated operating model in the second quarter pgi delivered 1 8 billion of sourced net cash flows a 45 margin strong pre tax operating earnings as well as record pgi managed aum of 532 billion and pgi sourced aum of 263 billion and we continue to deliver strong long term investment performance as 70 of principal mutual funds etfs separate accounts and collective investment trust were above median performance for the 3 year period 74 for the 5 year and 88 for the 10 year this performance positions us well to attract and retain assets going forward and is contributing to positive net cash flow we re continuing to see strong interest in our flagship real estate products and continued demand for our yield oriented products including preferred securities high yield and our scaling emerging market debt strategy together our strength in high growth investment capabilities our ability to leverage principal s global multichannel distribution to develop and deepen customer relationships our highly efficient globally integrated operating model and our ability to attract and retain top talent will continue to drive growth in our global asset management business in u s benefits and protection our small to medium sized business customers continue to show signs of resiliency and are returning to normal sales levels expected retention levels and positive in group growth in group benefits trailing 12 months in group growth turned positive for the first time since the pandemic increasing nearly 0 5 for the total block with the strongest growth in businesses with under 200 employees our focused customer segment in individual life premium and fee growth increased reflecting very strong nonqualified corporate owned life insurance sales which are critical to our business market strategy and our total retirement solutions offering our latest well being index reiterates the strength of this market 57 of small to medium sized businesses that responded to our survey said they are optimistic about the overall economic outlook for the next 12 months this is a higher level than before the pandemic began esg continues to be a priority for principal as highlighted on slide 7 our esg approach is aligned to the united nations sustainable development goals it is woven into our investment philosophies our approach to diversity and inclusion and is embedded in our philanthropic strategies we ve recently published specific esg commitments and will provide continuous updates to our sustainability website on principal com and our annual corporate social responsibility report we re very optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead as momentum has returned in many of our businesses and we ve evolved our portfolio to bring greater focus to our growth drivers deanna deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dan good morning to everyone on the call this morning i ll share the key contributors to our financial performance for the quarter our current financial and capital position and additional details on how the outcomes of the strategic review will drive improved financial results net income attributable to principal was 362 million in the second quarter including 106 million of net realized capital losses with 5 million of credit losses we reported 467 million of non gaap operating earnings in the second quarter or 1 70 per diluted share excluding significant variances non gaap operating earnings of 453 million or 1 65 per diluted share increased 21 compared to a pressured second quarter of 2020 this is also a 14 increase compared to the pre pandemic second quarter of 2019 as shown on slide 8 we had a number of significant variances during the second quarter these had a net positive impact to reported non gaap operating earnings of 10 million pre tax 14 million after tax and 0 05 per diluted share pretax impacts included a 61 million benefit from higher than expected variable investment income a 15 million benefit from lower dac amortization and ris fee and model refinements in individual life a net negative 11 million impact from covid related claims a negative 21 million impact from irt integration costs and a negative 33 million impact in principal international including a negative 24 million impact of inflation in brazil and 9 million of lower than expected encaje performance in latin america additional details of the brazil inflation impact are available on slide 20 the second quarter financial impacts from covid were limited to mortality and morbidity in ris spread and u s insurance solutions with just over 50 000 u s covid related deaths in the second quarter the net 8 million after tax impact was higher than our rule of thumb primarily due to a large claim in individual life this is a significant decline from prior quarters and we expect the impact will be relatively immaterial to results the remainder of the year looking at macroeconomic factors in the second quarter both the s p 500 index and daily average increased 8 compared to the first quarter and the daily average increased 43 from the year ago quarter benefiting revenue aum and account value growth in ris fee and pgi foreign exchange rates continued to improve in the second quarter but remained a headwind on a trailing 12 month basis impacts to reported pre tax operating earnings included an immaterial impact compared to first quarter 2021 a positive 13 million compared to second quarter 2020 and a negative 14 million on a trailing 12 month basis turning to the business units my following comments exclude the impacts of significant variances as dan mentioned we completed the migration of the irt retirement business in the second quarter and we are seeing the benefits begin to play out in ris fee we continue to expect 55 million to 65 million of irt integration expenses for the full year as we continue to work to integrate the trust and custody business pgi benefited from strong management fees performance fees and disciplined expense management in the second quarter boosting growth in revenue and earnings and expanding the margin to 45 pretax operating earnings benefited 11 million from performance fees specialty benefits pre tax operating earnings declined from the year ago quarter due to higher dental and group life loss ratios driven by severity corporate pre tax operating losses were in line with expectations as higher one time expenses were offset by higher variable investment income turning to capital and liquidity on slide 9 we remain in a strong financial position with 2 5 billion of excess and available capital including 1 7 billion at the holding company more than double our target of 800 million to cover the next 12 months of obligations 325 million in excess of our targeted 400 risk based capital ratio estimated to be 421 and 460 million of available cash in our subsidiaries as shown on slide 10 we deployed 431 million of capital during the second quarter including 266 million of share repurchases and 165 million to common stock dividends through the first half of the year we ve returned more than 680 million of capital to shareholders last night we announced a 0 63 common stock dividend payable in the third quarter a 0 02 or 3 increase from the second quarter our dividend yield is approximately 4 and we continue to target a 40 dividend payout ratio for the full year through the first half of the year the impact from credit drift and credit losses has been relatively immaterial and we expect it to remain immaterial for the full year this has improved from the 100 million estimate at the end of the first quarter as we discussed at investor day the strategic review validated that our capital and leverage targets are appropriate we plan to return to our targeted levels by the end of 2022 including a 400 rbc ratio by year end 2021 and 800 million of excess capital at the holding company by the end of 2022 we will continue to maintain a 20 to 25 leverage ratio and expect to pay down 300 million of long term debt when it matures in late 2022 between 2021 and 2022 we plan to deploy approximately 3 billion of capital to shareholders to return to our targeted capital levels including 1 4 billion to 1 8 billion of share repurchases and 1 3 billion to 1 4 billion of common stock dividends this excludes any impacts of potential transactions through our refined focus and strengthened capital deployment strategy we will invest in areas where principal has established competitive advantages while increasing our returns to shareholders we have a clear path to becoming a higher growth more capital efficient company creating long term value for shareholders we are actively pursuing transactions for several in force blocks including fixed deferred annuities and single premium income annuities with 18 billion of reserves and universal life secondary guarantees with 7 billion of reserves while we don t have details to share on transactions we will continue to update you as we know more including timing as well as the financial and capital impacts as a result of these portfolio changes this results in approximately 110 million of lost pre tax operating earnings on an annual basis but we expect a seven to 10 percentage point increase in free capital flow conversion and a positive impact on our return on equity as we look forward we are targeting a 9 to 12 annual growth in earnings per diluted share we have a path to a return on equity of at least 15 and we expect to generate 70 to 80 free capital conversion these targets exclude proceeds from potential transactions but reflect the lost earnings and capital impacts from discontinued products and segments the path forward is attractive and will benefit returns capital and our risk profile this concludes our prepared remarks operator please open the call for questions questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of tom gallagher with evercore tom gallagher evercore analyst good morning deanna i just had a first question is just a follow up to your comment about specialty benefits did you say the weakness in the quarter was related to one large claim in group life and if so how large was that claim that s my first question deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes tom i ll comment and then i ll turn it over to amy to see if she has more to add that comment was relative to the covid impact in that we were slightly above our rule of thumb of 10 million after tax impact for every 100 000 of u s debt and that one large claim was in individual life and then that took us just slightly above our rule of thumb and so it wasn t a comment on specialty benefits it was a comment on the covid claims within individual life and total company daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer anything further amy amy c friedrich president of u s insurance solutions no tom gallagher evercore analyst okay great and then my follow up is dan a competitor great west recently announced that it s acquiring pru s 401 k business and i guess my question it surprised me a little bit just because great west is still in the process of integrating their massmutual block but it obviously raises the bar in terms of scale by competitors i guess just in light of that transaction just curious how you re viewing the market your scale do you still feel like post the irt deal you have sufficient scale for the next several years or do you think this raises the bar for you to consider future m a in 401 k daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes thanks tom for the thoughtful question the first thing i d say is i certainly like the valuation ascribed to the block of business i think that speaks volumes about our platform which i would emphasize is inclusive of more proprietary asset management we have a lot of success in roll ins and rollovers we also have a lot of success around nonqualified deferred compensation and all the other drivers of our trs business model so all that hangs together really well the other comment i d make tom is that this thesis that apparently is out there in the marketplace is the rationale behind why we bought the wells fargo irt business in the first place which was to gain scale gain access to additional distribution capacity certainly create new capabilities and allow us to have a bigger footprint out there with distributors marketers and intermediaries so frankly we enjoy good scale today we have good capabilities we re constantly supplementing those and building on it from a digital perspective but we think that we ve got a really good place to fight from at this point in time so renee anything you d like to add on top of that question please renee v schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes i think dan you did a great job of covering exactly how we re thinking about it it s clear that the market will continue to consolidate and scale is important as our capabilities we re really happy with the irt acquisition in terms of what it did bring to us and does bring to us in terms of scale and increasing access to consultant channels that we may not have had before as well as really rounding out our set of capabilities to benefit not only the irt customers that were acquired but our legacy customers as well so as we think about consolidation in the future we re very mindful about the need to continue to watch our unit costs and scale if acquisitions make sense in terms of scale and capabilities we ll keep a close watch on those but we re happy with the acquisition that we made and we continue to watch the market very closely daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tom for the questions tom gallagher evercore analyst okay thanks operator our next question comes from the line of hung fai lee with dowling partners hung fai lee dowling partners analyst good morning and taking my question my first one is on pgi so looking at the performance for this quarter both fee income and margin were very strong and you highlighted there s a component of performance fees but even if you kind of back that out the margin is still kind of around 44 just can you talk about the moving pieces for the strong margin for the quarter and how should we think about that in the near term especially if the market conditions remain relatively stable daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes and it really was a really strong quarter across the board for pgi i couldn t be more proud of the team pat do you want to provide some additional comments and details here patrick g halter chief executive officer and president principal global investors yes humphrey thanks for the question i think one of the things that i want to highlight is that we continue to see strong revenue growth because we have strong investment capabilities that are desired in the marketplace and we re seeing the desire from retail from retirement and from institutional clients so our multichannel multi distribution model is really playing well with capabilities that are desired in the marketplace so i think that s been a nice sort of revenue generator for us as an organization both in terms of sales and in terms of retention in terms of the margin question humphrey if the macro market and markets continue to i think cooperate we believe we re going to continue to generate i think these strong margins in the upper end of our guidance range which is 37 to 40 and probably likely a little bit north of that 40 guidance range going forward as you kind of think about the expense control as we continue to have in place in the organization and our sort of view that our capabilities will continue to be desirable in the marketplace and so i feel pretty good about the ability to continue to have some fairly strong margins in the second half of the year i think we may have a little bit of additional sort of performance fees on the margin in the second half of the year also but the margin outlook looks quite strong yet as i look forward into the second half of the year humphrey hung fai lee dowling partners analyst got it thank you for the my second question is related to specialty benefits i think as you in deanna s prepared remarks you talked about dental you had some severity in the quarter i was just wondering if amy or deanna can talk about like what you saw in the quarter and how has that trended kind of into july daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes very good question amy please amy c friedrich president of u s insurance solutions yes sure thanks for the question so just to take a little bit of a step backwards we always expect to see either loss ratios in the first half of the year that are going to be greater than that second half of the year just in terms of how these benefits get utilized and in the first quarter we saw the type of utilization that we expected second quarter we would have assumed we drew down on that a little bit in terms of frequency and severity and what we saw is frequency actually stayed pretty well within the ranges that we expected it was severity that was a little bit higher so when we think of severity for dental severity for dental is going to be those unit two or unit three procedures being done so something all the way from a bridge or a crown to a filling and so i think what we would say there is we have really great plan design features really great maximum features that tend to be sort of self regulating mechanisms on those plans so even if severity comes up a little bit in the second quarter what we re going to see that second half of the year is that it s going to come back down so we re seeing a little bit more of those procedures and again i ve heard lots of people speculate on what s causing that we don t tend to speculate as much as we tend to make sure our pricing is aligned to what we re seeing in terms of the patterns and again we have great access to a bunch of in network dentists who give us some good insight into this so what we re saying is that second half of the year we think it s going to return to normal those types of things like severity don t tend to keep happening in second and third and fourth quarter because we ve got plan design features that are good self regulators daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer i think we ve got that advantage humphrey in addition to the fact that this business is annually priced and coming out of a global pandemic i would expect some degree of volatility in our claims experience so thanks for the questions operator your next question comes from the line of andrew kligerman with credit suisse andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst good morning just to maybe first layer on to tom s earlier question about scale and multiples paid we re seeing huge multiples being paid in emerging markets specialty benefits asset management so maybe just along the same lines do you feel that you ve got scale in those businesses and if so when you do divest of the cited operations and you raised i think you had cited over 1 5 billion or at least we think as much would that more likely go to share repurchases as opposed to acquisitions given the scale question daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes so appreciate that one of the benefits we have just still being 30 days out of having reported on our strategic review and again i won t reiterate all of what was said during the course of our investor day but we literally interrogated every one of our businesses our markets our look back and our look forward and so we do feel as if any gaps that might exist around capabilities and scale are under our clear understanding and frankly we feel like we re in a very strong competitive position across the businesses the ones we re exiting is where we didn t feel that the economics were in our best interest relative to a go forward basis and we felt there were other organizations that were better owners of these assets we need to complete these transactions before coming to a conclusion on how we ll deploy those proceeds but we are on the record already with investors that for the 2 year period of time we re going to deploy 3 billion back in the form of dividends and stock buybacks we feel we ve got our arms around our capital position we re in a very strong position which gives us frankly a lot of optionality i ll ask deanna if she has any additional comments she d like to make here deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think one of the things we did lay out at investor day is the fact that one of the reasons why we have a low leverage ratio it does allow us to fund any potential inorganic acquisitions through the issuance of more debt as well as our strong free capital flow position allows us to use some of the near term free capital flow to also help aid in that so obviously we re going to be looking to see if there are organic or inorganic opportunities i think what dan said is we feel good about the scale and the capabilities of our go forward growth strategy but we ll continue to be good stewards of capital our plan is to return that capital release from transactions unless there is a clear value accretive opportunity to deploy it in another way so hopefully that helps daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks andrew do you have a follow up andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst yes a follow up very helpful answer i m just curious now in ris fee now that you ve brought the irt onboard sales were 3 3 billion up from 2 8 billion year over year just kind of curious now that it s all onboard what kind of sales trends you will likely see as you re now expanding your reach into larger markets so could we see a big uptick in sales daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think one way to look at that is we ll help frame that as we get fully integrated as we sort of set our targets here in 2022 they might be premature your observation is a good one with regards to increase in sales from 2 8 billion to 3 3 billion i d also remind you that embedded within those pgi numbers in terms of strong results we had another 3 8 billion of dcio sales and so these strategies are working very well and maybe with that i ll ask renee to talk a little bit about the markets that we have historically have not played in that will be additive to our existing distribution strategy renee renee v schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes andrew thank you for that question because i think there s a lot to be said in terms of the organic growth that we re seeing within ris fee so maybe starting with first quarter you ll recall that in first quarter 2021 we had about 8 billion of sales which was an exceptionally strong result and included a couple of very large plan sales in there as well as strength in the small to medium sized market so that indicates that we are we can and we will play in the large plan market we are successful and we re winning then we turn our attention to the second quarter and what we see is a very strong 3 3 billion which is up 17 from a quarter a year ago quarter the second quarter sales were really dominated by small and medium sized plans which again speaks to the fact that we have strength in small medium and large sized plans we communicated at investor day and in last quarter s call that we are seeing a really nice increase in our institutional or our large plan pipeline and we re very pleased with that and it reflects the fact that we re making good inroads and relationships with top tier consultants the large plan market however has a longer sales cycle so we would anticipate that those sales will hit in 2022 so all said very pleased with the momentum that we see in organic growth it s strong across small medium and large plan markets and the we continue to be very optimistic about our capabilities and our ability to compete in this marketplace daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks andrew for the questions andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question will come from the line of jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan jimmy bhullar jpmorgan analyst good morning so first just had a question on investment performance and if you look at the data that you disclosed on your funds it seems like the one year performance is worse than three year that s worse than five year and that s down from the 10 year so just wondering if this is because of a few funds or more broad based and then what the implications of this are in your ability to attract flows daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer very good pat please patrick g halter chief executive officer and president principal global investors yes thanks for the question i think in terms of our performance we still feel very positive about our long term performance our one year has dropped off a little bit and specifically it dropped off in our u s and non u s equity performance as you know the u s equity markets in the first half of the year because of just a strong stimulus fiscal and monetary optimistic growth the environment was really one of owning risk in that marketplace and you re rewarded for that our sort of overall fund sort of approach is more it s not universal but it s probably biased more toward higher quality and lower higher quality than lower quality sort of the companies and that s probably held back a little bit of our performance our investment approach process we have a lot of conviction that will come back again we ve had periods in the past where we had sort of this risk on approach and our high quality low vol sort of style has been made out of favor as we talk to our clients they know our process they know what they re investing in in terms of our processes they feel very confident and comfortable with what we re doing so we have not seen any drop off at all in terms of either retention or sales because of that so that s probably the most important part of the sort of if you want to say less drop off or a little bit of a drop off in performance daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer jimmy do you have any follow up jimmy bhullar jpmorgan analyst yes and then on the international business your flows seem weak across a number of regions so if you could just talk about that and then also on the chilean pension market given how the election has gone thus far how do you feel about the sort of any potential pension reform there daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes all good questions so the first place i d start is in relative to pi net cash flow i think it was a challenging quarter but frankly on a trailing 12 month basis you ve got 4 4 billion of positive net cash flow that s three percentage points at the beginning of year account balances it s up 10 compared to the trailing 12 months second quarter 2020 and that s up 25 on a constant currency basis i could get into the details but examples might be for example last quarter we saw 900 million positive in southeast asia in malaysia negative 300 million this quarter entirely attributable to an institutional money market fund moving in and moving out so again when we look at our long term equity strategies across the board they re actually holding up really well in these markets and where there is downward pressure some of that of course is coming from they are frankly still struggling from an economic recovery perspective in large part due to covid and some of what s happening here in the u s so at the end of the day we still feel we ve got a really strong position as you could see when you adjust oe for encaje inflation in the chile variable investment income it s a good result for pi and still retaining 32 margins as it relates to the chilean elections that s interesting a couple of candidates who are challengers here have what i would consider and categorize as more moderate approach to afp reform obviously we re involved and engaged and talking about those topics with regulators on the value creation to chilean citizens and how the afp system has actually worked quite well it s frankly what s allowed them to use it as a funding vehicle as they ve authorized these 10 withdrawals coming out of the afp system so we ve got a lot of work to do to continue to inform legislators inform the public it s a concerted effort to do that it has served the people there well in the past and we believe it still will survive going forward as you know we ll have the first round of elections in november second round of elections in december and we ll continue to be vigilant in making sure that our point is made relative to the strength of the afp did that help jimmy bhullar jpmorgan analyst yes thank you daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer and you are welcome thanks for the question operator your next question comes from the line of ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger kbw analyst hi good morning i just had one quick one in terms of the guidance that you had given at the investor day the 9 to 12 eps growth i know you included stranded overhead did you include anything for lost fees that you earn on the general account assets that would be reinsured within pgi daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer deanna deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that was included ryan daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer so the loss fees on ga were included in the nine percent to 12 yes ryan krueger kbw analyst ok thanks that s all dan daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks ryan appreciated it next question operator our next question comes from the line of erik bass with autonomous research erik bass autonomous research analyst hi maybe just a follow up on ryan s question on the eps growth guidance i do continue to get some questions from investors so i just want to clarify that we re looking at it correctly but i think you re starting from a base of 5 67 in 2020 then assuming 9 to 12 growth which would imply a range of roughly 7 35 to 7 95 for 2023 and i believe the growth rate assumes the 110 million pre tax drag from lost earnings from the businesses you re exiting and you re not assuming any benefits from redeploying that capital so i guess first do i have that baseline correct and then if so should we assume that a sale of the fixed annuity and or sgul blocks would be accretive to your eps growth as you redeploy the proceeds daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer deanna deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes you are correct and then just following up on that last question from ryan it also included an estimate around stranded costs and pgi lost revenue from the general account obviously those last two items are estimates and they would be dependent on the specifics of the transaction but you have that right and so again relative to that guidance there could be some upside relative to the deployment of the proceeds from the transaction obviously the magnitude of that will depend on the process and the specifics of the deal but again the confusion was probably that i made a comment slightly dilutive slightly dilutive was not relative to that outlook it was relative to a bau result that obviously would be hindered by that lost earnings that i just discussed daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer erik does that help are we clear on that one erik bass autonomous research analyst yes that helps and then maybe the follow up on it could you give a sense of what you re assuming for growth in the ris spread and individual life businesses in your guidance and should we assume that earnings from these businesses are flat or maybe even down over the period given the planned product exits from the stranded costs deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes what i would say there is standard costs are not just in those lines of business they go over into pgi and they actually go across the entire enterprise the reason we didn t go into a walk forward on those two lines of businesses as well as obviously corporate is those are the ones that are going to be impacted by the transactions and likely what we expect to see is somewhat of a reset and then a growth that would be more typical from what we have seen up to this point and so again i think that s one that we ll give you more insight as we transact and as we go forward but again the three that we didn t give you specific guidance are rolled up into that nine percent to 12 but that s how i would think of it as somewhat of a reset and then a growth from there erik bass autonomous research analyst perfect that s helpful and so just take out the 110 million is a fair assumption deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks erik for the questions operator your next question comes from the line of john barnidge with piper sandler john barnidge piper sandler analyst thank you very much can we talk maybe a little bit about the pgi in the equity product because i look at the withdrawal activity experience it looked like it was the lowest level since 2q 2016 and clearly the turnaround in equity flows really helped pgi there can you maybe talk about what you re seeing from a withdrawal activity perspective as well as your expectations going forward daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer pat some insights patrick g halter chief executive officer and president principal global investors yes so john thanks for the question i think on the institutional side we re actually seeing a positive net cash flow on the equity side some small cap international are two notable areas we re also i think i mentioned at our investor day discussion at origin which is one of our emerging market investment boutiques has had some very strong sales growth and they continue to attract some institutional sort of sales activity so the institutional side the activity looks quite good on the equity side i think what you re probably referring to john is what you re seeing maybe within our platforms platforms we are seeing some withdrawals within the mutual fund particularly the mutual fund we re actually seeing some i think on a broader sort of commentary we re seeing actually some positive net cash flows in our international wealth platform and our sma sort of product line specifically with aligned investors which is a very strong sort of mid cap large cap manager so it s going to be a mixed bag in terms of mutual funds but i think we still believe we have a very strong lineup of equity capabilities across the different segments that we cover john daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer follow up john john barnidge piper sandler analyst yes great thanks for answering yes dan a follow up maybe on the specialty benefit side and the increased loss ratios in dental and vision in the first half of the year can you talk about addressing that from a pricing dynamic on renewal and how you re maybe thinking about whether this could lead to more regular frequency than pre pandemic since we all suddenly became aware dentist offices could be closed on a long term basis daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer amy please amy c friedrich president of u s insurance solutions yes sure happy to give an answer to that so i think dan mentioned that at the tail end of the question that we took before but that is that the dental business is one of our highest product lines in terms of annually renewable so when we look at those things that are going to be naturally repriced every year that s going to include dental we do trend we do a look on trend on a regular basis we do a lot of regular pricing scrutiny in fact more than once a year probably on more of a quarterly basis to look at our dental prices exactly what they need to be in the marketplace so the good news there is the brokers and employers who have those products are used to sort of that regular cadence and so what i would say we re seeing first half of the year though isn t probably indicative of big pricing changes i would say we tend to look at those over the course of the full year now the pandemic has put some different dynamics at play so we ll continue to be really agile in responding to those but if the second half of the year emerges the way that we believe it s going to we will not be facing a large pricing movement now what i would say is that when we look at april and may in terms of their utilization and severity those were more notably higher than even what we re seeing in june and july so those getting to taper off so that s increasing our certainty that that second half of the year is going to behave on a more normalized pattern and so i don t foresee we re going to have to make large movements daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer hopefully that helps john john barnidge piper sandler analyst it does thanks for the answers and good luck daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer alright thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of tracy benguigui with barclays tracy benguigui barclays analyst thank you turning to your strategic update i know you re not saying a lot about it but is it fair to say that an fa block sale could potentially happen sooner than ulsg since on the buyer side there s a lot more saturation from alternative asset managers daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think the best way to think about it is we view these as potentially one transaction and there s no shortage of interest in these blocks whether it s the annuity or the life as you can expect we are pulling a lot of data together and initiating the process but we our intention is to go in is to maximize shareholder value and whatever structure that is you re correct in making the assumption that there is sort of a better path or a more well worn out path relative to the annuity blocks than something like ulsg but again we feel like there are good buyers out there deanna anything you d like to add to that deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think if we think about the outreach that we ve had since the announcement and the discussions that we ve had we do think there s a path for execution on both of those we re diligently focused on that and we think that we ll have further announcements over the next six to 12 months on both transactions daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer on full completion tracy a follow up tracy benguigui barclays analyst yes my follow up is i m wondering why you wouldn t refinance your 300 million 2022 debt maturity would still be in the 20 to 25 leverage range and it would leave more room to get to a capital return at the higher end of your range deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer we are planning to refinance that so is your question why we would do that tracy benguigui barclays analyst okay yes it wasn t clear to me in your comments i thought you just mentioned you ll pay that down which felt to me that there was no refinancing but you re deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer no we are planning we are not refinancing our plan is to pay that off when it comes due in the third quarter of 2022 if you remember back we during the pandemic took the opportunity to issue 600 million of extra debt due to uncertainty in the marketplace at very very attractive rates fast forward today we found that we do not need that for that volatility or any credit pressure from the pandemic and so we felt it was prudent to again take down the debt and retire that 300 million that comes due in third quarter of 2022 tracy benguigui barclays analyst okay so i should think about that as prefunding and more likely you would want to operate at the lower end of that range daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer that s correct deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer correct daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer that s exactly right tracy benguigui barclays analyst okay thank you daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tracy operator your next question comes from the line of suneet kamath with citi suneet kamath citi analyst thanks good morning i wanted to come back to the scale issue in ris fee and maybe just ask for your thoughts on something so last week empower said on the call that they viewed scale in kind of a dc business as six million plan participants which was up from two million five years ago and i guess what surprised me was just the rate at which that changed like a threefold increase in plan participants to get to scale and i guess i m wondering if you had any thoughts on that change like that pace of change or if there s something different about your business mix or your target market that maybe would be inconsistent with that commentary daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes everyone s entitled their own views and opinions on what is the right scale and those people with a lot of scale like principal would argue that having more is better and it helps drive down your unit cost so i would agree with the overall arching view that more is going to be better and then you have to start focusing on the things that really matter which is what is the quality of the customer service that you re able to deliver what are your capabilities and that gets around the total retirement suite in db and nonqualified and clearly the importance of defined contribution 401 k and of course what is that customer experience so the scale is one key component it s an important component we re there and we re going to continue to enhance and deploy technology to help us be more efficient renee i don t know if you have any additional thoughts on this topic renee v schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes thanks and dan really you ve nailed the really critical pieces of this i think the thing to remember when we talk about our value proposition and how we compete in the marketplace we differentiate on several things first off is total retirement suite and our ability to take our capabilities far beyond defined contribution defined contribution there s no doubt that is a highly competitive marketplace and record keeping fees are being driven down not only by competition but also just automation and digitization of the business but when we look at our ability to pull together multiple retirement plan types and serve that up to the plan sponsor and the participant in a fully integrated basis using proprietary capabilities and technology it sets us apart and the same thing is true with the participant and the plan sponsor experience that we deliver again fully integrated across multiple plan types and last of all our ability to work closely with a global asset manager that truly is expert in retirement and so all of those things create a differentiation that allows us to successfully compete against other competitors that might be more solely or primarily focused on the defined contribution market daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer does that help suneet suneet kamath citi analyst yes no that makes a lot of sense thanks for that and then i guess my follow up for deanna on the 110 million of pre tax earnings from the blocks that you plan to divest our assumption is that the vast majority of that is from the fixed annuity block and there s not much of an earnings contribution from the sgul block is that a fair characterization and can you give any help in terms of that 1 5 billion of capital that s in those businesses what the split is between the two blocks thanks deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that s a fair assumption on the earnings i don t think we feel it s prudent to split those numbers into the underlying pieces given the fact that we are planning to market the divested business as a single transaction and we re already providing incremental disclosure to interested parties we ll take the opportunity when we announce the transactions to determine whether disclosing more details on the specific blocks that we transact is warranted but at this point i think your assumption on the earnings split is directional daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer hopefully you can appreciate the rationale behind the discussion suneet suneet kamath citi analyst yes understood thank you daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of josh shanker with bank of america josh shanker bank of america analyst sorry about that i just had a question about calculating this inflation issue in brazil is that a year over year change or is that a quarter over quarter and if the if the quarter were to end today how could we sort of translate that into an outcome for the quarter daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer deanna do you want to shed some light on that deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer so a couple of things i ll talk about there and again that is a quarter impact and so this is all coming about and if you actually go back to the it s actually a true up is basically what it is right and so we have to calculate based on this closed block of business that we have not sold since 2001 daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer there s a little bit of feedback coming in on the line you might want to go on mute josh shanker bank of america analyst i m going to mute while you re talking daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thank you deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so the liability and the underlying contract provision links the inflation to an index the igp m due to unavailability of those assets only about 50 of the assets backing that liabilities we re able to exactly match to that indice the other remainder we track to a retail inflation index the igpa over a long period of time this has actually been very benign back to 2011 it s actually been a cumulative benefit but it has been a hit over the last 12 months there s a portion of that in the given quarter that is a lag but the majority of that impact is the fact that there s a mismatch between what we re earning on the assets versus what we re crediting on the liability we can take it offline with ir and get into some more details of how you could potentially track this a little bit more closely but we do believe that over the long term this will come back into more congruence between the two indexes but we have a little bit of a mismatch just given the economic and financial volatility that s occurring in the brazilian market daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer it s also probably worth noting josh that this is a this is an active conversation with the regulators and the appropriate authorities they re aware of it there s a lot of domestic players that are obviously impacted including our joint venture partner so this is getting a lot of air time and a lot of debate and discussion on what is an appropriate solution i cut you off go ahead your question josh shanker bank of america analyst i ll take the month to date conversation offline with you guys and figure out what i can do there i just wanted to change to pgi for a second the results were very good in the quarter i m wondering if there is a strategy shift going on where you re able to push more money into the higher fee generating strategies and is there can we talk about really what led to the really strong results in the quarter daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer i don t think we want to ever push i think the idea is that we re going to have very attractive products for our customers and right now the performance and the asset classes line up well with what customers are asking for but pat some additional color patrick g halter chief executive officer and president principal global investors yes josh i think it really is that we have an incredibly very vibrant marketplace right now both in terms of market conditions and in terms of the flow of capital and some of our flagship capabilities like real estate which are absolutely higher fee generation capabilities are in vogue right now so i think that s one area just to highlight we re very sort of active specialist capabilities where we re really providing that sort of upper first and second quartile performance we re getting a lot of strong support with that and i think our multichannel distribution model our distribution teams led by tim hill and kirk west both on the platform side the u s side and on the international side are really performing very well right now so we seem to be doing really well both in terms of the capabilities that we can offer to the marketplace and getting those capabilities to the broad reach of the retail retirement and the institutional marketplace so it just seems to be coming together quite nicely right now daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks pat josh josh shanker bank of america analyst thank you operator our final question will come from the line of mike ward with ubs mike ward ubs analyst thanks for fitting me in good morning i was just wondering if you could maybe frame the strategic review results you recognizing you still have to get through the business exits and derisking that you ve identified which is no easy feat i m sure but i m just wondering if we should think about the review as being largely complete or is it sort of ongoing was this kind of the first step could there be more incremental derisking or divestment in other lines over time daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes i really appreciate the question mike and what i would first say is our board and our board finance committee just did an incredible job under clare richer s leadership and scott

purposes to mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce the technical reports referenced in this press release uses the terms defined in canadian national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum the cim cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves adopted by the cim council as amended the cim definition standards these standards are not the same as reserves under the sec s industry guide 7 and may not constitute reserves or resources under the sec s newly adopted disclosure rules to modernize mineral property disclosure requirements sec modernization rules which became effective february 25 2019 and will be applicable to the company in its annual report for the fiscal year ending december 31 2021 under the currently applicable sec industry guide 7 standards a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report reserves the three year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and all necessary permits and government approvals must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority additionally the technical reports uses the terms measured resources indicated resources and measured indicated resources we advise u s investors that while these terms are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with ni 43 101 such terms are not recognized under sec industry guide 7 and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the sec mineral resources described in the technical reports have a great amount of uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility the sec normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute sec industry guide 7 compliant reserves as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that any or all part of an inferred resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category u s investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into sec industry guide 7 reserves under the sec modernization rules the definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves have been amended to be substantially similar to the corresponding cim definition standards and the sec has added definitions to recognize measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources which are also substantially similar to the corresponding cim definition standard however there are differences between the definitions and standards under the sec modernization rules and those under the cim definition standards and therefore once the company begins reporting under the sec modernization rules there is no assurance that the company s mineral reserve and mineral estimates will be the same as those reported under cim definition standards as contained in the technical reports prepared under cim definition standards or that the economics for the mt todd project estimated in such technical reports will be the same as those estimated in any technical report prepared by the company under the sec modernization rules in the future

after my comments alex will provide you with additional details on our results and increases to our 2021 full year guidance then i ll wrap up with closing remarks before moving on to q a the neuromodulation and cardiovascular businesses continue to recover from the depressed levels of activity that began early in 2020 related to covid 19 after a slow start in 2021 trends improved in march and showed good momentum in the second quarter especially in the u s while some regions continue to be impacted we saw sequential progress in case volumes and less apprehension by patients seeking treatment although we anticipate continued impact from covid 19 we expect procedure volumes in the second half to show further improvement in the u s and globally moving to recent events on june 1 we completed the initial closing of our heart valve divestiture including both manufacturing sites further closings related to the sales infrastructure in various geographies around the world will follow in the second half of the year financial results for the heart valve business are deconsolidated effective june 1 also during june we received investigational device exemption fda approval to proceed with our confirmatory clinical trial in obstructive sleep apnea or osa the osprey trial will seek to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the aura6000 system our implantable hypoglossal neurostimulator intended to treat adult patients with moderate to severe osa after receiving approval we immediately launched the start up phase of the osprey study and anticipate enrolling our first patient later this year osprey is a randomized controlled trial and will include approximately 20 sites across the united states and enroll a maximum of 150 adult patients who do not achieve results from traditional cpap therapy or have declined its use now i ll discuss our core growth drivers epilepsy and acs epilepsy sales increased 102 globally versus the second quarter of 2020 with growth across all three regions this increase from the nadir that was experienced in april of 2020 reflects improved market dynamics resulting from increased hospital access and patient willingness to return to clinics u s epilepsy sales increased 108 versus the second quarter of 2020 total implants improved versus the prior year driven by replacements which have benefited from a catch up in the procedure deferred in 2020 importantly new implants grew 40 year over year and 13 sequentially our progress in u s epilepsy is being bolstered by our go to market initiative which currently encompasses 12 dedicated teams three of which were formed during the second quarter the nine established teams accounted for approximately 16 of u s sales up from approximately 10 in q1 these teams are delivering sales in implant growth that is trending above the baseline business compared to the second quarter of 2020 as well as in comparison to the second quarter of 2019 levels epilepsy sales in europe grew 105 versus prior year led by the u k italy and germany meanwhile we achieved growth of 65 in the rest of world region led by asia pacific as non emergent procedures continue to recover based on performance in the first half of the year we now expect global epilepsy sales to grow 25 to 30 up from our prior guidance of 15 to 20 our forecast includes sequential growth in new implants as patients and their caregivers return to in person physician visits in addition we anticipate a continued tailwind in replacement implants related to the backlog created in 2020 acs sales were 13 million in the quarter an increase of 120 from the second quarter of 2020 growth was driven by the continued adoption of lifesparc and an increase in procedure volumes given our performance in the first half of the year we now forecast acs to grow at least 25 in 2021 up from our prior guidance of at least 20 turning now to dtd sales in the second quarter were 3 million in 2021 we continue to anticipate dtd sales of approximately 10 million to 15 million from a combination of the recover study and replacement implants for cms eligible patients during our investor event held last month we provided initial key metrics for the recover study around site activation patient consents and patient implants we ve continued to make progress since this update based on the sequential acceleration of patients consenting into the study we continue to expect to implant 250 unipolar patients and or 150 bipolar patients in their respective recover rounds by year end in heart failure the anthem hfref u s pivotal trial continues to advance after reaching a key milestone of 300 patients enrolled in april as previously discussed we expect to start analyzing the functional endpoint data in the first half of 2022 for the cardiopulmonary business sales were 118 million in the quarter an increase of 12 versus the second quarter of 2020 oxygenator sales increased in the high teens globally with the u s and europe leading the growth heart lung machine sales decreased in the mid to high single digits this unfavorable variance was primarily impacted by the timing of hospital capital equipment purchases largely in the middle east and latam these impacts were partially offset by better than expected sales in the u s moving to heart valves sales for the quarter were 15 million which was a decline of 22 compared to the sales for the second quarter of 2020 it should be noted that this comparison only includes heart valve sales through june one in the second quarter of 2021 versus a full quarter of heart valve sales in the second quarter of 2020 i ll now turn the call over to alex for an overview of the financial results alex alex shvartsburg chief financial officer thank you damien i ll discuss our second quarter results in greater detail and then provide an update to our revised 2021 guidance sales in the quarter were 265 million an increase of 41 versus the second quarter of 2020 sales in the quarter excluding the heart valve business were 250 million an increase of 48 as compared to the same quarter of the previous year cardiovascular sales were 146 million up 13 from the second quarter of 2020 neuromodulation sales were 118 million an increase of 102 compared to the second quarter of 2020 adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales in the quarter was 70 up from 61 in the second quarter of 2020 the margin increase was primarily driven by product and geographic mix adjusted r d expense in the second quarter was 44 million compared to 35 million in the second quarter of 2020 r d as a percentage of net sales was 16 5 down from 19 3 in the second quarter of 2020 overall r d on an absolute dollar basis is increasing behind continued progress in the anthem hfref pivotal trial and the recover study adjusted sg a expense for the second quarter was 102 million compared to 80 million in the second quarter of 2020 sg a as a percentage of net sales was 38 4 down from 43 7 in the second quarter of 2020 the dollar increase in sg a is primarily due to commercial related variables and discretionary spending last year as a result of covid 19 adjusted operating income from continuing operations was 39 million compared to an adjusted operating loss from continuing operations of 4 million in the second quarter of last year adjusted operating income margin from continuing operations was 15 compared to a loss of 2 in the second quarter of 2020 the adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 14 7 compared to 2 8 in the second quarter of 2020 the higher tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic income mix adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter was 0 52 compared to an adjusted diluted loss per share from continuing operations of 0 15 in the second quarter of 2020 the cash balance at june 30 2021 was 329 million up 77 million from the cash balance of 253 million at year end 2020 net debt at quarter end was 426 million versus 505 million at year end 2020 the decrease in net debt is driven by our increased cash balance our adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter of 2021 was 20 million capital spending for the first half of 2021 was 15 million which is 3 million lower than the first half of 2020 now turning to our revised 2021 guidance as damien mentioned based on our performance during the first half of 2021 we are increasing our previously announced full year sales eps and adjusted free cash flow guidance overall we anticipate the momentum of the neuromodulation business to continue and we re now forecasting 2021 sales growth between 5 and 10 on a constant currency basis which assumes 1 tailwind from exchange rates this is up from our prior guidance of 0 to 5 growth we are projecting adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of 1 60 to 1 90 up from our prior guidance of 1 31 to 1 81 we assume our share count to be approximately 50 million adjusted cash flow from operations is expected to be between 35 million to 55 million up from our previous guidance of 30 million to 50 million with that i ll turn the call back to damien for some final comments damien mcdonald chief executive officer thanks alex in summary we ve built good momentum during the first half of the year and we are optimistic regarding the growth outlook for the remainder of the year and taking this into consideration we increased the midpoint within all our guidance ranges while we acknowledge that we continue to live with changing market dynamics resulting from the pandemic we remain focused on execution to deliver our pipeline commitments and our updated full year guidance and with that crystal i ll open the line up for questions questions and answers operator so your first question comes from the line of mr rick wise from stifel rick wise stifel analyst good morning everybody nice to see the solid quarter damien mcdonald chief executive officer thanks for that rick wise stifel analyst maybe damien let s start off with neuromod with epilepsy i mean it s great to hear that all three regions showing improved performance and maybe you could talk in a little more detail just about what you re seeing and what we can expect both on the new implant side and the replacement side i mean tremendous momentum on new implants is that to what extent is that the new sales team approach versus new accounts just help us better understand what s happening there damien mcdonald chief executive officer yes great question good to hear from you and good morning rick yes we re very pleased with how the team is executing and getting us back to what i think looked more like 2019 levels of performance total u s implants rose 70 year on year which is a very strong performance for the team the epilepsy implants in the quarter also grew slightly from 2019 and i think again that s a really important signal for that business bouncing back to 2019 levels in the past few quarters end of service has recovered faster than npi we ve been talking about that tailwind from the backlog of procedures from 2020 they grew about 85 year on year and nearly 20 sequentially which i think is a big sign too npis grew about 40 and low teens sequentially so again end of service really leading the way there i think a lot has to do with the new go to market strategy as i pointed out in the script they ve gone from around 10 of the u s sales to 16 of the u s sales and that is important for us because we believe that s how we re going to continue to make changes in our awareness and impact on new patient implants over time i don t know matt if you wanted to add anything on that matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development no i would say then rick the u s is the majority of the business but we re also seeing a lot of good trends in areas in europe and some of the other international markets as well in the quarter we just know most of the focus is in the u s so we gave a few more nuggets there rick wise stifel analyst maybe two more you ve made encouraging comments about the dtd trial and i think your words damien were we ve made good progress in the quarter for that 250 150 by year end can you give us any sense of as things are reopening recovering hopefully returning to normal was enrollment in line did it accelerate why are you it sounds like you re more confident in reaching your year end targets but any more detail there you can share damien mcdonald chief executive officer yes i think since the education events we hosted we ve seen the progress in line with our forecast and we noted in may that we re over 3 4 of our sites were activated over half of our target number of patients have consented and just so everyone s aware the consent is like a technical precursor to the implant stage and then over 1 3 of the target number of patients have implanted and that s continued to progress and we ve seen that basically running on our model since then rick wise stifel analyst alex congratulations to you and i give you full credit for the excellent trend already but maybe you could help us think through the second half in a little more detail how do we think about the third quarter fourth quarter sales cadence i mean i sort of think about the third quarter is normally in life and med tech life as being sequentially softer because of seasonality indications or no that s not it could be more flat to up this year because of the business trends you re seeing and new sales initiatives and recovery how do we think about splitting up and thinking about the second half alex shvartsburg chief financial officer yes so you re right rick first of all thanks for the congratulatory remarks i would say look the trends the seasonal trends we expect to be similar as we ve seen historically q3 sort of being a slower quarter relative to q4 one thing i will remind you is that heart valves are out of our sales trajectory for the second half of the year so that s going to have an impact in terms of comps we feel good about the sales trajectory and as damien said we are expecting sequential growth in the second half now that we ve reached the midpoint of the year we re more comfortable updating our guidance and putting all of our eps upside generated into our new guidance range just continue rick wise stifel analyst just if i could interrupt just and so as we think about the third quarter ex heart valves does it match the first quarter revenue levels is that the right way to think about it as we get ready for the full year alex shvartsburg chief financial officer yes at least yes look we i think we feel pretty good about the second half of the year we continue to see unpredictable impact of covid especially in pockets of apac middle east and in latin america the u s trends have obviously improved but not yet quite back to normal on epilepsy particularly on npi or new patient implants so as we look for the back half of the year we re assuming delivering the same level of eps as we delivered in the first half rick wise stifel analyst thanks for all that color alex shvartsburg chief financial officer thanks rick operator your next question comes from the line of mike matson from needham company sir your line is open mike matson needham company analyst good morning thanks for taking my question i guess i want to start with neuromodulation so obviously good performance there but i wanted to ask about the strength of replacements you did mention there s a bit of a backlog there so is there a risk that that slows down the replacement part of the business and maybe we see a air pocket before the new implants sort of continue to pick up i guess in other words how much confidence do you have visibility do you have in the backlog that that part of the business can be sustained the replacement portion matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development hey mike it s matt so on the replacements like we said before that in 2020 we thought there were about 1 200 replacements that based on our modeling should have occurred that did not we ve eaten into that a little bit but we still think there s at least 1 000 of those replacements that are still out there and available so we did burn a little bit in the first and second quarter but just thinking about that math that should carry into 2022 so i don t think it s going to if anything you need to worry about through this year and then in terms of the new implants as damien said we did actually show nice growth sequentially and our expectation is that we ll show growth sequentially again in the third quarter so not quite back to what we call baseline but getting there mike matson needham company analyst and then i just had a couple on the osprey trial so is this in fact a pivotal trial in other words will it support fda approval of aura6000 i was a little confused because the slides called it a confirmatory trial so not really sure what that meant and then i wanted to get a better understanding of the timing what s the follow up period for the endpoint and the trial of when could we see results damien mcdonald chief executive officer so the things for us that are important here is that we finished the thn3 trial and weren t happy with how that was executed as we took that over and so we re calling it a confirmatory trial but yes it does support as a pivotal the fda approval cycle for pma so that is correct it is a pma pivotal approval trial and as far as follow up it s a 6 month follow up and then the timing mike we re assuming approval in 2024 right now mike matson needham company analyst okay got it matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development thanks mike operator our next question comes from the line of adam maeder from piper sandler sir your line is open adam maeder piper sandler analyst hey guys thanks taking the question congrats on the results and to you alex on the appointment to permanent cfo maybe just one kind of short term question to start i guess i was just hoping to get a little bit more color on q2 and how the business progressed over the course of the quarter or by month and just trying to get a better sense for the recent trajectory there and exit momentum that you have and then if you re seeing any kind of early impact from the delta variant and recently because i had a couple of follow ups matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development adam thanks for your question yes look as damien mentioned in his remarks we started to see strength in our trajectory in march and it s continued throughout the quarter so we came out at the end of q2 with really good trends so really happy with the type of trends that we saw in epilepsy u s in particular across the board across all franchises we saw some really strong trends so that made us feel pretty good about the balance of the year second half so also in terms of beyond the sales trend we saw some good progress in terms of gross margin and we re seeing leverage across the rest of the p l so all positive damien mcdonald chief executive officer in terms of delta like i m sure everyone is doing we watch this carefully some time ago we started an internal monitoring through matt s sedar team and we ve been tracking that by geography extremely closely and then on our focus friday calls we talk about this with the teams every week to look at where we see pockets and hotspots latam is an issue middle east africa still being an issue and in the u s we re tracking pretty carefully this whole florida georgia louisiana spike that s important too for us the east is an important geography for us in all the franchises so we re watching it again i m sure like everyone else that we re confident at the moment that we re going to be able to execute to the goals we just laid out adam maeder piper sandler analyst and then for my next question just on cp i think you said that s expected to grow low to mid single digits this year you talked a little bit about capital being soft but maybe i was hoping to get a little bit more color or puts and takes there and then i know you re not giving obviously guidance for 22 at this time but just conceptually i wanted to ask about the cp business when the new heart lung machine is launched what s the right way to think about the growth trajectory of that business what type of impact did polaris have and just how do we think about kind of the stage rollout timing and then i have one quick follow up damien mcdonald chief executive officer all right adam so on your question around the cp in oxygenators we saw we continue to see progress in the quarter we had approximately 12 sequential growth which was positive in terms of the capital cycle the hlm sales tend to be kind of lumpy so it s we re not seeing anything that we hadn t predicted in our forecast earlier this year matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development and then in terms of 2022 we ve said this is a low single digit market so with polaris coming online i would say at least for now maybe think mid single digits until we get more visibility on the exact timing adam maeder piper sandler analyst and then just sneak in one more if i may just to ask about obstructive sleep apnea i just want to learn a little bit more about the technology itself this next gen device kind of relative to the previous generation aura6000 what changes have been made to the design and the feature set how do you kind of view the value proposition versus the other available technologies damien mcdonald chief executive officer so in terms of the technology not a lot of changes to the device overall in terms of what it does the number of electrodes on the lead really just i think we re finding and enhancing the components for reliability i d say two of the big differences versus the current therapy out there inspire we don t have the second lead right now so it s just a single lead and we have more electrodes we have six electrodes they sit further back on the nerve in inspire so you can theoretically recruit additional muscle fibers and you can sort of adjust the shape of the tongue a bit better versus just stick it out so that s kind of a core component we think that that will actually help a little bit more with complete concentric collapse which is about 1 3 of patients so there is some differentiation i think in the way it works but in terms of the device it s i wouldn t call this like an enhanced device from a therapy effect adam maeder piper sandler analyst got it crystal clear thanks matt operator your next question comes from the line of anthony petco from jefferies sir your line is open matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development crystal do you want to jump to the next one and then we ll come back to anthony if he can get back in operator sure so your next question comes from the line of mr michael polark from baird sir your line is open michael polark baird analyst hi good morning can you hear me a question for probably alex on just gross margin into the second half obviously we pull heart valves out which just should be an accretive exercise to the gross margin i previously did some math last year when you first announced it probably 200 basis points of lift just from stripping heart valves out of the model on gross margin is that in and around the ballpark alex shvartsburg chief financial officer that s right mike we expect the gross margins to increase in this year relative to 2020 by about 300 basis points so the outlook is trying to get to 70 and beyond all of that positive trend is really driven by the product mix right as we sell more neuromodulation also the increased volumes on cardiopulmonary that will drive will definitely drive some upside there adam maeder piper sandler analyst on r d always trying to model the or frame the shape of this curve i know you re investing in a lot of important initiatives since are we at a quarterly run rate or a quarterly number here 44 million is this going higher kind of flat here for the next few quarters how do you see this playing out rest of this year into next damien mcdonald chief executive officer yes we see a little bit of a step up in the second half especially as we enroll the osprey trial so a bit of a step up but we re sort of in the ballpark there with our first half trends on the other trials and go to the base adam maeder piper sandler analyst and then on operate this is my last one on the matt the ccc comment are you is the protocol for the study designed such that all these patients go through the drug induced sleep endoscopy and you pull the triple c patients out and then run a trial kind of consistent with the current fda indication for hypoglossal nerve stimulation or are you expecting that this study is going to have a ccc and a non ccc subgroups matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development so you got me on the endoscopy i m going to have to get back you on that one the ccc it s going to include the ccc patients i don t think they re going to be separated from the other patients in the trial but if that s wrong i ll let you know but they re definitely going to be in the trial adam maeder piper sandler analyst yes you run the dies to identify the nature of the airway so i presume that s part of the protocol then matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development i ll check on that michael polark baird analyst okay thank you matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of mr anthony petrone from jeffries sir your line is open anthony petrone jeffries analyst hi good morning apologies we re hopping between calls so apologies if some of these got asked my first question would be on vns backlog you mentioned last quarter there was still about 1 000 patients really that were backlog and i believe those were replacement patients so just wondering if there s an update there and how long of a tailwind does that represent i think last quarter you mentioned into 2022 and then on the margin side just trying to quantify there was certainly an outperformance both at the gross and operating level versus our estimate certainly the outsized revenue beat helps there just sort of trying to work through that how much of that was the revenue beat versus just cost savings and if you can alex maybe just some high level thoughts on where you see the adjusted operating margin profile trending perhaps over the next several years congratulations on a good quarter matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development thanks anthony it s matt so for vns it s still over 1 000 patients the way that works is we probably reduced the 2020 number by about 150 to 200 but we re still not back to normal i would say in u s epilepsy in terms of market trend so there were some additional ones added so the net is still i would say north of 1 000 alex shvartsburg chief financial officer anthony in terms of the margin profile so gross margin yes it was sort of outperformed on the basis of sales volumes but that s it s a kind of a mix phenomenon right as we sell more neuromodulation which is carries a higher gross margin than the rest of the fleet that really helps i mean we re trending at somewhere in the 70 range and we expect to maintain that or improve that in the back half of the year and into 2022 in terms of the operating margin we feel pretty good about where we landed in q2 i would say it s going to be pretty similar in the second half our goal i think we ve stated all along that we wanted to we re striving to get to 20 not sure we can get there in 2022 but we re certainly going to give it a try anthony petrone jeffries analyst that s very helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mr matt taylor from ubs sir your line is open matt taylor ubs analyst so i wanted to ask more about the epilepsy dynamics just as a follow up on replacement versus the de novo could you talk about how that mix looks today in different geographies and how you expect it to change over time when might you be able to recapture those 1 000 that are still out there and any more color on the trends would be really helpful matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development for u s we re currently getting closer to 70 now 1 5 years ago we were closer to the 60 range so no surprise it s slowly gone up we do expect it to eventually start to go down next year internationally in europe it s about our split is about 52 npi 48 in the u s so not quite as high as the u s but almost 50 50 and then in the other markets international markets it s like 85 npi and again all of them over time we do expect the end of service to move up matt taylor ubs analyst and what have you seen in the recapture and i guess versus your modeling how are those coming along and what s the pace that you could recapture those 1 000 that are out there matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development so again it s not perfect matt but we think 150 to 20 were captured in the second quarter there were some captured in the first quarter we d expect it to continue to go up in the back half of the year what we don t know is how long the tail lasts because with the therapy and the settings it really depends by patient even when you get the alert that your battery is below 17 you could potentially go a year so we don t have a perfect window on when a patient is going to come in by month but within a year period we have very high confidence so what we think right now is more in the third and fourth quarter some will spill over into 2022 and then by 23 we re largely back to normal matt taylor ubs analyst and i just wanted to ask a hypothetical question on recover assuming that you do hit your enrollment s goals for the cohorts by the end of the year and based on what you have seen in the registry data previously could you just clarify some goalposts about when you might be able to see separation of the curves enough to make a signal that you have a high success chance for a positive result how long i guess could that take in a reasonably good scenario matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development right now we re assuming it s sometime in the back half of 2022 again it s basing and we get to look a lot for each arm we get to look every 25 patients so we don t have long intervals of waiting but based on the statistics that was designed on it s somewhere in the back half and again we ve committed to late 22 early 23 from a shift to registry that just gives some time for cms to decide and then also we are in the back half we think the odds are the highest so that s how we re currently looking at it matt taylor ubs analyst and just on the softer side of things what can you do ahead of time i guess to start to raise awareness and see the market what are you doing now and what can you do next year to start to get the psychiatry can we get excited about this matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development i think our real focus is just on recover but we ve also done a i think a very good job in working with a publications subgroup of the investigators to map out a publication strategy and so we are actively publishing in the area and engaging more with interventional psychiatrists we re also working to make sure we ve got capacity to implant so whether that s a neurosurgeon ent or general surgeon and so that we can make sure that the flow works from interventional psychiatrists to the implanter back to the interventional psychiatrist so they re two of the steps we re taking among the many aspects of what the team is doing and very focused too on mapping using drg data where the centers are and how we would think about commercial expansion strategy once we get to certain milestones with cms matt taylor ubs analyst kay thank you very much operator we have our last question from the queue we have mr scott bardo from berenberg company your line is open scott bardo berenberg company analyst so congratulations alex for the appointment so the first question please just relates to operating margin this quarter which i think came in pretty reasonable at 14 9 now of course that margin is somewhat benefiting from the revenues that you booked for heart valves for a couple of quarters so i wonder if you can give us a sense alex as best you can what you think the underlying margin for your cardiopulmonary advanced circulatory support and neuromod business was this quarter if you were to completely net out sales and costs from heart valves that would be helpful i guess follow on question sg a trending up to about 105 million now that you ve exited heart valves there s an awful lot of folks there within that business and the basis all remains flat goes up some sense that would be helpful and second question just relates to cardiopulmonary please i think correct me if i m wrong that your guidance or the outlook for that is being somewhat moderated and you were flowing to weak capital trends on top of what was already a weak capital year the year before are you confident that you re not losing market share here we know that getting that now into the market with a heart lung machine and claiming strong momentum i wonder if you can comment there and furthermore then some sense of declinings for both polaris and your new vns device please alex shvartsburg chief financial officer right so let s take this one at a time so our operating margin excluding heart valves are largely the same scott because as you know the heart valves business carries a lower gross margin relative to the rest of the fleet so taking that out of the mix the operating margin isn t drastically affected recall when we announced the divestiture we said we were going to be dealing with some stranded costs in the back half of the year so that s absorbed in our guidance in our margin for the balance of the year and that s we re working on costs to get those out as soon as possible but we re supporting the transitional services agreement with corsam which requires us to continue to spend from an sg a perspective now just look i believe your second question was on cardiopulmonary and in particular the hlm cycle so in the quarter we saw some really good trends in the u s rest of world i would say it was pretty lumpy we had forecasted during the year that the hlm business the capital business would be down versus 2020 because remember we are coming up on the end of the s3 to s5 conversion cycle so the hlm business we are not losing share we believe that it is in line with the business is running in line with our forecast yes matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development a couple more things scott it s matt last year we thought the hlm business would do worse than it did capital didn t fall as much as we thought it was down about 15 last year for the full year in terms of the getting hlm we certainly know it s out there we know they launched it we check with the cp team all the time they have just not said much about that product having an impact yet and then in terms of the timing of polaris no change we ve still said first half in europe around midyear in the u s and then in some of the other markets in the back half of the year matt taylor ubs analyst and maybe just one clarification please and alex just to fully understand what you re saying on selling and marketing costs so this 105 million that you book in the quarter do you expect that to remain stable if you like into the second half of the year until you work down some of these stranded costs i m just trying to understand what sort of costs come out of the business now you ve exited heart valve alex shvartsburg chief financial officer that s correct scott damien mcdonald chief executive officer remember we re still investing behind our go to market initiatives in neuromodulations and acs matt taylor ubs analyst maybe last one from me i very much appreciate all of these investor education sessions you ve done on the various different divisions they re helpful but i think what would be most helpful is a midterm framework for margin and growth to get some sense of your operating costs your expected delivery of your pipeline and so forth you ve talked a little bit about cmd have we now got a definitive date in your diary for fiscal 21 matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development we re still looking at the fourth quarter we were hoping to be live in fact our plans had been to be live of course the issues with the border crossings and who s been vaccinated and who hasn t is just complicating our planning but our current plan is mid fourth quarter operator we have a follow up question from mr rick wise from stifel mr rick wise stifel analyst sorry for the follow up i just wanted to hear you comment publicly if you would a little bit on tandemlife and lifesparc target obviously terrific year over year numbers but if i m looking and understanding the numbers correctly sort of flattish in terms of dollars sequentially just what s going on where are we in the rollout what s next how do we think about the second half etc etc alex shvartsburg chief financial officer yes rick look we still expect acs to accelerate its growth in the second half of the year we like the trajectory i mean the comps versus last year if you recall in the quarter basically as lifesparc was anticipated in q3 there was a sort of a slowdown in placements so i would say we re looking at the business sequentially we like the sequential progress we re making in terms of procedure volumes as well as the capital placement matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development and rick it s accelerated growth on an absolute basis not a percent basis just in case damien mcdonald chief executive officer and we ve talked about previously what are we doing it s about the account acquisition and those plans are right on track with the team through the midpoint which is terrific we re also committed to putting on up to 20 heads this year we re about halfway through and we re about halfway through the recruiting we like what we re seeing in terms of talent attraction too we ve been able to i think really up the talent that we re bringing into the team and i think that will ultimately read through into faster uptime of those people in the field and we re really pleased with how this is progressing mr rick wise stifel analyst but we should anticipate further sequential dollar acceleration or it s third fourth or into next year it s going the direction you want matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development correct that s correct rick yes operator there are no questions over the phone sir please continue matthew dodds senior vice president corporate development okay thank you crystal and thank you everyone for your time and there s a whole series of questions in your interest on behalf of the entire team i appreciate your support for livanova and we look forward to

life our earnings were 130 6 million in the second quarter for 2021 and compared with 130 9 million for the same period in 2020 the second quarter of 2020 included a tax benefit for net operating

billion on march 31 2021 primarily due to 359 million decrease in the ppp loans on june 30 2021 the company had 780 million of ppp loans compared with 1 4 billion of the ppp loans on june 30 2020 and 1 1 billion of ppp loans on march 31 2021 the linked quarter loans excluding the warehouse purchase program and ppp loans increased 148 million or nine basis points 3 7 annualized from the 16 2

or 1 2 4 8 annualized from the 28 7 billion on march 31 2021 we believe that the deposit inflows are starting to normalize as people are spending money again and stimulus payments have been reduced however the child tax credit payments should again add deposits to the banks our asset quality has always been one of the primary focuses of our bank our nonperforming assets totaled 33 7 million or 11 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets as of june 30 2021 compared with 77 9 million or 28 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets as of june 30 2020 a 56 8 decrease from last year nonperforming assets were 44 2 million or 15 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets as of march 31 2021 m a seems to be regaining momentum we ve had more conversations with bankers considering opportunities this quarter the continued net interest margin pressure the higher technology costs the salary increases loan competition succession planning concerns and increased regulatory burden all point to a continued consolidation as mentioned in my opening comments we believe the u s economy is starting to normalize which has helped reduce

million compared to 259 million for the same period in 2020 a decrease of 13 6 million or 5 2 the current quarter net interest income includes 12 2 million in fair value loan income compared to 24 3 million in the second quarter 2020 a decrease of 12 1 million net interest income also continues to be impacted by the paycheck protection program and warehouse purchase program the second quarter 2021 net interest income excluding the impacts of ppp loans warehouse purchase program loans and fair value loan income improved compared to the same results in the first quarter 2021 the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 3 11 for the three months ended june 30 2021 compared to 3 69 for the same period in 2020 and 3 41 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 excluding purchase accounting adjustments the net interest margin for the quarter ended june 30 2021 was 2 96 compared to 3 33 for the same period in 2020 and 3 19 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the decrease was primarily due to a change in the mix of interest earning assets and excess liquidity noninterest income was 35 6 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 compared to 25 7 million for the same period in 2020 and 34 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 noninterest expense for the three months ended june 30 2021 was 115 2 million compared to 134 4 million for the same period in 2020 on a linked quarter basis noninterest expense decreased 3 9 million from 119 1 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the current quarter benefited from gains on sale of ore assets of 1 8 million and a decrease in salary and benefits the decrease in salary and benefits is primarily due to lower employment related taxes for restricted stock vested during the first quarter 2021 and lower discretionary incentives for the third quarter 2021 we expect noninterest expense of 118 million to 120 million the efficiency ratio was 41 for the three months ended june 30 2021 compared to 46 6 in for the same period in 2020 which included 7 5 million in merger related expenses and 41 3 for the three months ended march 31 2021 during the second quarter 2021 we recognized 12 2 million in fair value loan income this amount includes 4 3 million from anticipated accretion which is in line with the guidance provided last quarter and 7 9 million from early payoffs we estimate fair values sorry we estimate fair value loan income for the third quarter of 2021 to be around 3 million to 4 million this estimate does not account for any additional fair value loan income that may result from early loan paydowns or payoffs looking forward we expect the income from early paydowns and payoffs will continue to slow down as we approach the end of life for many of these loans including most of the pcd loans with large discounts the remaining discount balance is 25 million also during the second quarter 2021 we recognized 10 3 million in fee income from ppp loans as of june 30 2021 ppp loans had a remaining deferred fee balance of 28 3 million the bond portfolio metrics at 6 30 2021 showed a weighted average life of 3 9 years and projected annual cash flows of approximately 2 3 billion and with that let me turn over the presentation to randy hester for some detail on loans and asset quality randy randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer thank you asylbek our npas at quarter end june 30 21 totaled 33 664 000 or 0 17 of loans and ore compared to 44 162 000 or 0 22 at march 31 21 this represents approximately a 24 decline in npas the june 30 21 npa total was comprised of 33 210 000 in loans 310 000 in repossessed assets and only 144 000 in ore of the 33 664 000 in npas 8 378 000 or 25 are energy credits all of which are service company credits since june 30 21 1 448 i m sorry 1 448 000 in npas have been put under contract for sale it doesn t necessarily mean they re guaranteed to close but they are under contract and expected to close net charge offs for the three months ended june 30 21 were 4 326 000 compared to 8 858 000 for the quarter ended march 31 21 no dollars were added to the allowance for credit losses during the quarter ended june 30 21 nor were any dollars taken into income from the allowance the average monthly new loan production for the quarter ended june 30 21 was 641 000 this includes a total of 73 8 million in ppp loans booked during the second quarter loans outstanding at june 30 21 were approximately 19 3 billion which includes approximately 780 million in ppp loans the june 30 21 loan total is made up of 39 fixed rate loans 36 floating and 25 variable resetting at specific intervals i will now turn it over to charlotte rasche charlotte m rasche executive vice president and general counsel thank you randy at this time we are prepared to answer your questions sean can you please assist us with questions questions and answers operator certainly the first question for today will come from jennifer demba with truist please go ahead jennifer demba truist analyst thank you good morning kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director good morning jennifer demba truist analyst first question is on mortgage warehouse just curious as to what the outlook is in that business line and are you seeing any uptick in refi here in the last few weeks kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director jennifer this is kevin we ve seen only a minor uptick in refi in the last couple of weeks it takes a while once rates go down to pull through to us there s usually about a six week lag from decline in rates and when we start seeing volume on the warehouse line so most of what i ve seen at this point is just anecdotal evidence out of our client base if we just look like what s happened quarter over quarter for instance in the current quarter the second quarter of this year 66 of our volume was purchased whereas in the first quarter only 47 of our volume was purchased so there was a pretty big shift between q1 and q2 toward purchase volume that may moderate again a little bit here in the early stages of this quarter as we look at volumes they ve held up pretty well so far for the month of july but throughout the quarter i would say if i had to pick a number i would expect our average loan volume to be down about 150 million from where it was in q2 jennifer demba truist analyst okay and how about pricing what are you seeing in that kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director yes it s really held in there pretty well if you just look at weighted average coupon again q1 was 3 23 i believe and it dropped only two basis points to 3 21 in q2 so we have really done a good job of holding the line on pricing there s always been pressure and as you know every now and then pressure gets grave enough that we don t succumb we usually just let that client go and try to find another one that values us a bit more and we are seeing some encouraging things going on from that perspective we ve got a couple of new clients that are in the queue to be boarded and we ve seen a couple of our larger clients with volumes being down this happens every time in this cycle as volume goes down folks look to kind of pare back the number of lending institutions they have so we ve had a couple of our big clients come to us and ask for us to take a larger piece of their overall volume because of our balance sheet size where they re weeding out some of the smaller lenders in their bank group so we ve been the beneficiary of some larger increases for existing clients as well jennifer demba truist analyst thank you separate question on m a david have you ever seen a frenzy like we re seeing right now in this m a market and does that concern you david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i would say that it is active right now although i have to say that i ve seen it more active than it is today that we re talking and so i don t think that it concerns me i mean again like i said before i ve seen it more active i will say it is active there is no question if you when we talked in our last quarter i said with stock prices down things are kind of things have really the phone calls have not been incoming as much but as the stock prices have gone up and everything that s happening with the current administration we are seeing more and more people talking about doing something and so but having said that i ve actually seen it i ve seen it more active than this before so i think going forward you re going to see you ve seen a lot of deals i think you re going to see more deals before the end of the year there s no question about it and i think it s going to be a pretty active year jennifer demba truist analyst alright i will let the others hop in thanks operator the next question today will come from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead dave rochester compass point analyst hey good morning guys kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director good morning dave rochester compass point analyst saw the loan growth ex pp and the warehouse this quarter that was definitely stronger than the recent trend of what we were looking for this quarter and i know this has been one of the major concerns surrounding the stock recently as to what those trends could look like this year so just wondering how does the loan pipeline look heading into 3q ex that warehouse since you just talked about that and what are you thinking regarding the runoff that s left in that structured cre book i think you mentioned it was about 400 million left to go back in april thanks kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director yes this is kevin again pipelines look more robust than they have in quite some time and i would tell you that in our earlier calls we didn t think we d see growth until the second half of the year and fortunately some of that pulled through and gave us a second quarter where we had a bit of loan growth 3 7 but we really were thinking that that was going to show up as soon as it did and it s continued into the first month of the q3 here it s actually been pretty solid running at a better pace than it did in q2 so far and i think as we look at the pipeline and number of deals that are in the pipeline to close i haven t seen it like this in a number of quarters and it s i m probably more encouraged by it than i ve been in quite some time things are active david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i d also add dave when randy was talking to a while go i heard one thing and i don t know if you said the right thing but the average monthly new loan production for the quarter ended 6 30 21 was 641 million we re modest at 641 000 so that s a pretty good number for us so kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director yes and in structured cre that portfolio is down to about 1 billion in q2 there was about 250 million in runoff so to produce some loan growth in the face of 250 million in runoff in that in the quarter is an accomplishment in its own right i think it will pare back a little bit but i wouldn t be surprised if we saw another 150 million to 200 million runoff in q3 but as i say when i look at the pipeline i m pretty encouraged that we re going to be able to face that headwind and still put up some pretty decent numbers in q3 david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes really if you took out the structured cre and just if we wouldn t have had the runoff in the structured cre or participated more in that i mean our numbers would have probably been double digit for the most part randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer and we dave rochester compass point analyst are you thinking that that go ahead randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer i d say we have a good number of loans on the books right now that are funding up that are past the pipeline stage the loans should fund up and that will help us over the next quarters kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director dave another way to think about it on structured cre i think there s going to be a 400 million or 500 million of that remaining 1 billion that sticks with us dave rochester compass point analyst okay so you get maybe 250 million that you said drawn in 3q and then maybe you have a little bit more runoff after that but not a material amount kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director i think closer to 200 million in q3 would be my guess and maybe another 200 million in q4 and then that will about do it dave rochester compass point analyst okay great and maybe on the resi segment that growth really jumped this quarter is that solely just a function of greater activity in the market or has your appetite increased there and then what s your outlook for that in the back half of the year david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i didn t hear the question can you say that one more time kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director it s residential you are referring to dave rochester compass point analyst yes residential the strength in the growth this quarter if that was just a function of the market activity or if you have an increased appetite there and then what s your outlook for the back half edward z safady advisory director and vice chairman i would say the market activity is just very robust throughout the entire footprint of the bank and we ve not seen any slowdown or seasonality to that so far the pipeline looks just as strong as it has all year long so we re feeling pretty confident about the increase continued activity within the mortgage market and we re portfolio in about 90 of what we originate dave rochester compass point analyst sounds good maybe just one last one on capital so the cet1 ratio is over 15 now your other ratios are very strong seems like you have enough capital for a deal and buybacks so i was just curious what your thoughts were on that maybe starting up the buyback again just to maintain capital ratios where they are david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i think you re accurate in what you re saying i think we re really building a lot of capital we have a lot of earnings we do pay a good dividend and generally we try to increase it a little bit but you re right we are retaining a lot of capital but historically we ve used that to four acquisitions and i d still like to keep it for that but having said that again with the stock price when it dropped into the 60s it s something certainly that we re going to consider maybe buying back some of our own stock if it stayed that low dave rochester compass point analyst okay great thanks guys operator and the next question will come from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey kbw analyst great thanks good morning guys so when i look at the bond book i know we had talked about you guys putting some cash to work there we saw a decent amount of growth in the second quarter i think period end balances has a bond book at about 12 billion how do you think about continuing to grow that bond book at this level i know the long end of the curve has kind of gone i guess just here recently but how do you think about continued growth in that bond portfolio david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i would say brady that we ve worked you can see we continue to buy bonds and as deposits just keep on rolling in all the time so we have that to contend with but again i will say as of today probably we have over 1 billion 3 billion 4 billion just in overnight investments and a little bit we pulled back from investing because the tenure has gotten too low we feel so we ve just kind of pulled back from investing and we re probably waiting a little bit we probably could have made more money investing and i would say overall it s probably a smart thing to keep invested because if you keep that average three to four year 3 5 year average life you re going to you re probably going to make more money but again when interest rates go as low as they have we still have pulled back but we will be back in purchasing when they return a little bit to a normalization anyway but again it s just a lot of money in trying to keep it invested when you have this much and just trying to plow everything you can when rates are the lowest may not be the smartest thing in the world brady gailey kbw analyst okay and then this is the third quarter that we ve seen a zero provision from you guys and as i look at the reserve if you include the reserve for unfunded commitments i mean you re still north of 2 which is just a big reserve relative to how clean your credit quality is i mean if you all are not going to take a negative provision i mean to me it seems like you re going to have a zero provision for a while like maybe years is that the right way to think about the provision asylbek osmonov chief financial officer likely david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer you always have to be careful there s another variant of covid out there again and the long and short of it is like we said it is a calculation that we go through there seems to be a lot in there but again at the same time we ve always said that we would like to grow into it instead of just playing with the numbers and bringing money back and forth all the time if we can and i think there s still reasoning out there that justifies that we still don t know there s a lot of variables out there that you just don t know what could happen so i think as long as we can we can keep the calculation we ll probably keep the money in there as long as we can probably asylbek osmonov chief financial officer yes and just to add on brady so we run our model we have a baseline and we ll layer on this pessimistic scenario on that one so we ll probably continue a little while but we just have to see how the economy continues especially there s so much unknown still out there because it takes time for loans to show the quality of it so from that standpoint we have to run the model and if it s run model stage that we need to take provision gain we ll take provision gains so we re just going to run the model david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer but again i think it s premature i mean i see a lot of banks doing it but again there s still again like they re talking about mask again and another variant and all this stuff coming out and so i just think it s premature just to say everything is just great right now so and it is good there s no question in fact when you look at our asset quality and it decreased 58 from last year i mean knock on wood things do look pretty good but again i feel we re in the right place at the right time right now brady gailey kbw analyst okay got it thanks guys operator the next question will come from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose raymond james analyst hey thanks for taking my questions nsf fees were down a little bit this quarter but there s clearly been some pressure out there in some banks curtailing some of those fees can you just walk us through the thought process on your nsf program at this point maybe what you re doing to help out customers and if you re starting to hear any political or regulatory changes there thanks asylbek osmonov chief financial officer okay i ll just give a little bit of highlight on nsf yes nsf a little bit down compared to the first quarter but as you remember in the end of march there was a big stimulus package that was sent out to customers so what we saw in april and may there was less usage of nsf at that time but in june it s rebounded so if you re looking forward i think for especially with the summer time and people going to vacation and all that i think nsf s going to be better in the third quarter if i m just looking at the numbers but overall if you look at environment and from the regulatory side yes we hear more about more focus on nsf right now we haven t changed anything because we want to a little bit wait before we do anything but yes i agree with you there s more focus on nsf as we go david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer it s really you make nsf fees when people are really buying stuff and there s so much stimulus money out there and there s so many deposits and consumers have so many deposits but we were talking earlier in here and it doesn t seem like the people who are spending all the money that they have it s i guess going through what we ve gone through over the last year 1 5 years maybe they re cautious but then somebody said there s not enough inventory or products out there to spend the money on so that s another spin or that side of it so i think people are they re spending money but again they re just not out there they re not out there spending everything they re still trying to leave money for a rainy day which is so different that i ve ever been used to but again and i think that deposits are going to continue as long as there s more stimulus we re still talking about a 300 tax credit that s going to be given to individuals again so i think that s going to be another form of stimulus so i think that maybe nsf fees may not get back to where they were exactly for some time probably asylbek osmonov chief financial officer yes with the liquidity i don t think it s going to get back to where we had it pre pandemic but what i see at least seeing in june and july it s improving david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean it will it s getting better all the time and it will get better but there s just more money out there right now michael rose raymond james analyst okay that s helpful maybe just as a follow up asylbek i appreciate the color on the expense guide for the third quarter was there anything that happened in the salaries line i may have missed it but it did ramp down almost 4 5 million or so it seems like that maybe will rebound back upwards just trying to kind of reconcile how you get from the kind of 115 million back to the 118 million to 120 million thanks david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer kevin felt philanthropic and gave his salary and bonus back asylbek osmonov chief financial officer we appreciate that no primarily was in the first quarter we had employment related taxes for restricted stocks that were vested in the first quarter that s why we had a higher taxes that s what we had higher in the first quarter and also discretionary incentive in the second quarter were a little bit lower than we had in the first quarter but you re right when i gave you guidance 118 million to 120 million that include all of it right because we have quite a lot of spending on it side that s going to bump up a little bit i think the salary is going to go up but probably not back to that 80 million you saw in the first quarter and we had the merit increase annual merit increase that s going to pop in so from that all the aspects that i kind of outlined that our expectation 100 million to 120 million it s a good guidance for next quarter michael rose raymond james analyst great thanks for taking my questions asylbek osmonov chief financial officer thank you operator the next question will come from brad milsaps with piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps piper sandler analyst hey good morning asylbek osmonov chief financial officer good morning brad milsaps piper sandler analyst i just wanted to follow up on kind of the loan runoff discussion from a yield standpoint just kind of curious what rates on new loans you re bringing on versus kind of some of the books that you re running off just trying to get a sense of maybe how much more yield compression you could see on the loan side david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer again i don t have the numbers in front of me but i would say probably the average rate or at least what the rate that i m looking at loans right now is what about 4 5 randy right now randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer 4 5 3 99 to 4 5 range david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer 4 to 4 5 probably the average i mean you re floating your large loans are not getting that your large loans are probably in the 3s but if you look at the overall portfolio so it s randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer that s true david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i would say though it s a good bet that the loans that are running off or probably a higher yield than what we re putting back on probably they re probably in the 5s or something i don t again i don t have that in front of me but it would be it s probably pretty easy to that would be a good analogy i think brad milsaps piper sandler analyst okay great and david just a bigger picture question around m a some deals that have been announced have been received better than others how do you sort of balance kind of the best long term move for the company versus what might be a stock price reaction that might not be as favorable kind of in the near term based on kind of what we ve seen thus far in the market david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer well i think that s one of the hardest deals we do have even when we were negotiating with somebody because when our stock price is down and compared to what they want it s just hard to give them what they want all the time i mean if you re going to do a deal with those you have to really bank that our price of our stock is really down a little bit because we re just basically not going to do a deal that i ve said in the past it s not accretive or it doesn t increase our franchise value so we re not out there just to do deals and we re not going to do it so whoever teams up with us if they re taking stock they really have to believe in the long term future of us and stay with us basically it may not be the same price they could get somewhere else i don t know brad milsaps piper sandler analyst okay and just one final housekeeping question asylbek do you have the average balance of ppp loans in the quarter asylbek osmonov chief financial officer yes i think the average balance for the quarter was i ll give you around 1 billion for the second quarter brad milsaps piper sandler analyst great thank you guys operator and the next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache wolfe research analyst thank you good afternoon i had a follow up on your credit comments and the idea that rather than releasing reserves you prefer to grow into it can you give a rough sense of what you view as a sort of normalized level for your reserve rate david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i guess what s normalized today may not be normalized what i was used to in banking and growing up in banking i always thought that if you had 1 loans you re in pretty good shape in today s world again you have to take into consideration regulators and everybody else and they might not necessarily see it that way i think everybody went off a cliff last year when we saw everything and everybody wanted 1 5 in there now everybody is kind of coming back and pulling money out of reserves and taking them back down to probably 1 5 1 25 probably i still think in my opinion this is just my opinion i think in the long run if you run a good clean bank 1 25 is a pretty high rate in a reserve in my opinion that s just my opinion but again taking into consideration anything that may happen another pandemic or another something that we re not aware of then you have to have extra money in my opinion kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director maybe another way to think about it which i think gets almost the same exact number is if you took our post cecl pre pandemic combined legacy prosperity and all that happened all about at the same time i know but if you just took our combined cecl kind of numbers pre pandemic we re in that 1 25 to 1 30 range so if you had to pick a normal i d pick a 1 30 bill carcache wolfe research analyst that s really helpful color thank you separately can you speak to what you re hearing from clients about labor shortages they re facing any color on if it s getting better or worse just any broad commentary across your client base would be helpful david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer well you want to hear about our labor shortages eddie safady is there in austin and eddie you said basically that we may have to just have drive throughs on two of our locations because edward z safady advisory director and vice chairman we may have it s just very difficult to find enough teller help and frontline people that are willing to come back to work with face to face type and the pay scales with all the other companies competing for the same population of workers in hourly rate and what some of the private industry is offering in the way of additional benefits and those that are allowing them to work from home whereas we really need some in store people david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean we re really going through again i ve said this god it s really dating me but what i m seeing is really something different than i ve never seen before right now even i ve never seen as many people changing jobs going from one job to another it just i don t know if it s just psychological because there s been some companies like bank of america that have raised their tellers to 20 25 and then so there s this competition other i think walmart offered today that they re going to be able to send if you work for them they re going to send your kids through school so there s so many different incentives and then you have the other dynamic that s been real that i m trying to get in my mind i m seeing people that really aren t i don t know if they just wore out or they re tired right now it seems like everybody s worked so hard that maybe that s not everything or maybe rethinking things and you re seeing this other group that had got to work from home and now we re asking all those people who come back to the office and some of those especially the older people are saying you know what it s not worth and maybe i have taken care of an older parent or at home made a lot of money so i m not answering your question but again i m trying to give you some color though there s a tremendous amount of dynamics going on right now in the workforce and i don t know what it s all going to pan out my thought is it will get back to normalization but it s going to take some time we ve all gone through a lot of different way we do things there s been a lot of different psychological strains on a lot of people and it s just going to take some time but i do know i do think that there will be some people working from home you ll probably have combination you ll let a combination but i think for the most part businesses want most of the people to come back to the job and come back to work but having said that there may be some exclusions for people that are really good that just that you can t get back at least for short term while they still want to finish out the rest of their careers kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director and i think just feedback from our clients this is kevin particularly in homebuilding restaurants and some other folks that just can t get staffed i see full restaurants but service quality is not what it used to be in places i in places i am pretty well known it s where i expect to get service it s down from where it used to be because they just don t have enough staff our homebuilders are having to pay up to get staff to crews out there on homebuilding sites and their business is robust but they re just struggling to get people back so it s pretty pervasive there s still some supply shortages i was talking to somebody who receives a lot of their product from overseas he said just the cost of getting a container is ridiculous just the container to ship stuff because there s a shortage there so it s pretty pervasive and i do i m in the camp that tends to think old some of this isn t going away some of it is transitory clearly but once wages go up i don t think they re going back down and i think once restaurant prices go up they re probably not going back down so i think some of this stuff is going to be in the system and that s actually going to stick david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes i don t think it s done with you kevin i don t think it s just transitory as everybody said in fact all the price increases that people that were they re minimum wage and they ve taken it up i think if you ever go to the grocery store you can see they lost that the price has just gone far more than what their than their wages have i think bill carcache wolfe research analyst that s super helpful color i think what i was trying to get at is to what extent you think it may be inhibiting investment and it sounds like it s hard to tell because there s a lot of moving parts but it may be across your customer base and so to the extent that that gets better at some point then maybe that should be a positive david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i think that it will get back to some point and i think a lot of it just depends on your investment i think people that are doing good are going to continue to invest but again it may be a slower it may be slower than what everybody thinks too but again the economy you got to remember the economy has been shut down for so long the gdp numbers that you re seeing right now an 8 and 10 on that it s going to be so much more than it was previous year but at some point hopefully we ll get back to normalization but i guess what we re saying is a lot of the inflation rates that we re seeing and stuff like that may not be transitory i guess is what we re saying bill carcache wolfe research analyst understood and if i could squeeze in the last one maybe if you could give a little color around whether your commitment across different verticals is evolving in any way just curious whether you d look to get bigger or smaller in any areas in light of the increased focus that the investment community has been placing on esg and just wondering if that s becoming a consideration at all as you look at the business going forward kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director not really for us i think maybe in the energy space it is for some maybe some of the bigger banks would like to report lower energy balances and some of the bigger oil companies would prefer that but you see independents their production picking up and in our case there s probably more oil and gas opportunities than we ve seen in the past i will say i haven t seen pricing or structure improved to the extent that capacity is restrained and it should and we have just speaking about oil and gas we ve done a lot to derisk this portfolio which was at one point maybe as high as 800 million it s down to 502 million at quarter end that s been a massive derisking mostly of the legacy side of the portfolio but in oil and gas it was 550 million when we merged it s probably 160 million now so most of that derisking has occurred in the legacy portfolio so esg is certainly having an impact on oil and gas i don t expect that to in our case to result in any massive increase in oil and gas lending we re pretty selective in what we do there and in terms of the rest of the verticals we re still interested in growing most of them outside of big growth in oil and gas so it s as long as we can find customers who are willing to pay the right kind of structures we re going to grow our verticals david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i mean i just think you have to be careful i mean esg is an important part of any business i guess everybody is on the climate deal right now but if you were just to focus that you re not going to do anything i mean look around i mean everything on the coast it s chemical plants they make chlorine they make anything on a daily basis so that stuff is not going to go away i mean it s true that they re saying that they want oil and gas or cars ought to be electric within the next 10 years or so so you re definitely going to see a change but as a bank we couldn t just walk away from so many of our businesses i mean it s just going to be it s going to take time you just can t do it overnight and that will evolve as people change and you have different businesses that come up with a new type of environment it just happens over time you just have to be with the right people and making sure the loans that you do go the people still have enough money to pay it back in time so that doesn t run out for them i think that s the main thing bill carcache wolfe research analyst understood that is really helpful thank you all for taking my questions appreciate it operator the next question today will come from peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead peter winter wedbush securities analyst good afternoon hello david i wanted to ask about just a follow up on m a if there s more of a focus or emphasis on maybe doing a larger sized deal outside of texas versus within texas would kind of be more of a fill in type opportunity david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i guess you re asking the question are we looking outside of texas more than inside of texas or is that question peter winter wedbush securities analyst i guess more about i guess size is it are you more interested in doing a larger size deal versus a fill in that tends to be a little bit smaller david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer first of all i would say that we ve always said we d like deals if we can do it in the states that we re in texas and oklahoma we re more focused on that and you know me you re setting me up here but i like bigger deals that s there s not any question about that but sometimes you can t always get the bigger deals so you can try and try and sometimes you can date somebody for a long time and you just can t get to that base and so you look at what s next what s out there that you can do and you go to that other deal that you can do and sometimes it s not exactly what you want to do but if that other opportunity exists where we can get accretion whether it s here or into another state we would probably do that i would say that if we go into another state though the franchise has to be big enough that it s worth us going and we can really grow it i can t see us going to another state for example for a 2 million deal maybe not even a 5 million deal it would have to be a little bit kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director billion david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean yes billion i m sorry i m doing with randy very well sorry for the miss yes a 1 billion deal i mean it would have to be a bigger deal so and something that we could be we always like to be if we re going to be somewhere we d like to be in the top five market share in that state if we re going to be so it would have to be a bigger deal peter winter wedbush securities analyst okay that s helpful and then just asylbek on the core margin it came in lower than what i was expecting i was just wondering part of it is the increase in premium amortization expense and the excess liquidity i m just wondering how you re thinking about the margin next quarter the core margin asylbek osmonov chief financial officer yes if you look at the core margin i think what we re trying to focus on actual net interest income if you look at our deposits right if since q2 end of q2 of last year to now we ve grown 3 billion if you look at from the end of 2019 pre pandemic we have grown our deposits like 4 9 billion so that s a mix of money that we put in our balance sheet you saw that we have grown our bond portfolio significantly it s impacting the core margin but we re looking at more like core net interest income so i kind of came up saying super core what s a super core net interest income that s excluding warehouse excluding ppp and loan fair value income if you look at that super core net interest income it s improved in the second quarter because of combination of growth in the bond portfolio and loans and if you look forward if you look at a core super core net interest income with growth of the loans i think it s going to be improved in the third quarter and that s what we re focusing right now it s kind of hard to focus on the margin right now just because of the interest rate environment right now david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer now he s going to trademark that super core peter so don t use it without trademark or giving him credit peter winter wedbush securities analyst that s the first i ve heard it so far thanks for taking my questions operator the next question will come from matt olney with stephens please go ahead matt olney stephens inc analyst thanks guys just a quick follow up on loan growth we saw a pretty material growth in single family loans in the second quarter just curious if we re going to see continued growth in that portfolio over the next few quarters thanks edward z safady advisory director and vice chairman i would say yes we continue to have very robust production and of course there are payoffs but the new production is far exceeding what s rolling out and we have a very skilled mortgage team and the application volume continues to be as strong as it s been all year so i would anticipate that that portfolio would grow david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i would also add eddie that i think that over the last few quarters that when overall commercial loans have been down that s been a good thing to be able to replace it with and we would say that as commercial lending picks up there may be a point in time where we may not keep the majority of not all everything that we do because if we were selling some of this mortgage stuff off as you pointed out that may add 18 million a quarter or so to our income but we ve just kept that kept it in that over the long run we should benefit from it but we re not getting any points for selling or anything like that so as commercial lending picks up that may be something we made but sell off later on but in the short term it was a good fill in to replace some of the stuff the more risky assets that we were trying to get out of randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer our lender referrals throughout our footprint really pushed that number of that pipeline full david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes matt olney stephens inc analyst and just following up on that david as far as the new loan yields i think you mentioned before a lot of the new loan yields are in that 4 4 5 range but that s kind of a small deal so larger deals maybe in that 3 range when you layer in a single family i assume that s going to be quite a bit lower so maybe kind of on an all in kind of a weighted average basis how should we be thinking about kind of the newer core loan yields david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer what do you all think guys asylbek osmonov chief financial officer probably 3 5 if you were to factor in the mortgage because the average mortgage yield is coming in right under 3 right now david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer before we throw that in i would rather try to do some numbers on that i think you re going to probably be we don t know we are throwing out numbers i think we re going to be closer to 4 but again don t book that let us try to get you a better number than that matt matt olney stephens inc analyst sure no understood thanks guys david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes operator the next question will come from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning everyone a question for you on you talked about deposit inflows starting to moderate somewhat wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you re seeing there david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer well i mean it s pretty much jon it s probably about as simple as that i mean last year we saw what was our growth rate lag i mean if you look year over year we were at 11 but if you look at the full year from december from january to december the numbers were in the 20 plus range do you have that asylbek osmonov chief financial officer yes just to give the numbers if you look at the end of june of last year till end of june of this year deposits grown 3 billion but if you look at from the pre pandemic times of 12 31 19 our deposits grown 4 9 billion so that s a significant deposit growth but i agree if you look at just the second quarter our deposits i think annualized grown 5 so we do see some moderation in the deposit growth and but it s a combination of people using money and less stimulus david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i think it s less stimulus and people using money and again you would think that people will start using some of those deposits too fortunate or unfortunately deposits to me are still it s the bread and butter of the bank it s the mother s milk as i used to say but the i think that even though you ll see deposits decrease because people are using them just because what we ve normally done on an average basis we usually grew deposits organically 2 to 4 a year so you re probably not going to see it may take a couple of years for them to use some of these deposits you probably won t see a decline in our deposits because we re growing organically that much or more so there s a process that you probably won t be able to see but again for the first part of this year the first six months we re at what 4 8 i think so consider annualized asylbek osmonov chief financial officer in the second quarter david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer yes second quarter annualized so you had a bigger chunk in the first quarter but i think you re starting to see i guess i hope i m giving enough color jon you re starting to see deposits not rolling quite as much jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst do you think you re at the point where loans can start to outgrow deposits at least for the next few quarters and that loan to deposit ratio starts to come back up david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i think we are i normally wouldn t say something like that but i do i think that the growth that we have right now is pretty impressive when you look at the amount of loans that we were you ve been with us a long time and you saw how banks join us our loans would go down because we this is the kind of loans that we would outsource and what we wanted to get the portfolio too it s a hard deal to do if you look at the amount of loans that kevin talked about earlier on the oil and gas that we ve outsourced and you look at the structured commercial real estate that we outsource and still it s showing the growth if you look at the rest of the bank and just took out the dallas market because of the ones we lost in that particular deal you probably you re probably looking at 10 plus in growth overall so once we get once we quit losing the loans or i d say losing or outsourcing what we didn t want in the dallas market and they re growing i saw the growth this quarter i m pretty excited kevin is a real leader i think and focused on building loans where i wasn t in the past as much i was always a core deposit guy and as long as you could take the money and deposit it in in a bond i was happy and not less risk in making it but kevin s worked real hard and he s got his team together and i think they re doing a good job and with his help in pushing us i think that we will have some growth kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director yes i agree david i think particularly with deposits moderating and let s just say deposits grow at 4 instead of 11 or 12 which is probably way more likely the growth in the loan portfolio aided by less runoff of the old legacy portfolio so that s we re about done with that derisking the pipeline as i said at the beginning of the call looks better than it s looked in a really long period of time the loan pull through in terms of just we had some growth last quarter the growth we ve had quarter to date this quarter would indicate that we re running well ahead of where we did last quarter so that s north of 5 kind of growth rates so i do think we re in a position today for a period of time where we can grow the loan portfolio faster than we re growing the deposit portfolio and that s obviously excluding warehouse and ppp david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer right kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director i m talking about core loan portfolio david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer and i don t think the other thing is consider i don t think we have to be the first to ever raise rates as rates go up we have so much have so many core deposits i think that we re going to have a better lever than our competition is because most of our money i think we probably have 10 of our money in cds asylbek osmonov chief financial officer yes david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer i mean so it s a very low amount all most everything we have is really transaction accounts kevin j hanigan president chief operating officer and director yes and just to kind of couple the thought with i think it was matt s question previously about the blended rate i do think we re seeing the growth i m seeing in the pipeline is growth that s outside of mortgage growth so eddie has talked about the mortgage growth i m talking about c i construction lending middle market lending cre lending we re seeing nice pickups in those categories that are coming with a higher weighted average coupon obviously than we re seeing in the mortgage side david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer the only caveat i would put again is if our administration decides to shut down the economy that could change a lot of things again but having where we re at now we can keep going and every i mean we need not only texas to keep going we need the other economies in the rest of the u s to keep going too because they have to produce the goods that we need to sell and everybody has to chip in so if we can keep that going it will be an ok deal jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst okay good thanks for all that and i guess one last one asylbek you ve kind of got halfway to my question on the super core concept but david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer trademark trademark jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes exactly and i was focused on ppp and some of the fair value income you talked about running off and this concept of net interest income bottoming but how big is that gap between what you call the super core and your stated number and how quickly are those two converging together asylbek osmonov chief financial officer so if you let s take them two separately if you look at our fair value income that we generated 12 2 million in the second quarter but if you look at what the remaining balance it s about 25 million left so probably we re going to be earning next few quarters that 25 million but it all depends on the how fast does the early payoffs and paydowns we know that the payoffs and paydowns are definitely slowing down the guidance that we look at it on the amortization basis it s 3 million to 4 million next few quarters just looking at but then we have 25 million so if you take that it could be another five six seven quarters before we earned up on the ppp side we earned 10 3 million on the ppp fee income and we have about 28 3 million remaining if we look at when we it s kind of hard to tell when we re going to earn that ppp fee but if you look at the first round of ppp it took us about to get majority of its first three quarters i would say and i think if you take what the ppp round dictated we re probably going to earn that next in the third fourth and first quarter of next year the remaining majority of 28 3 million that were remaining so i hope this gives you a color on those two items jon arfstrom rbc capital markets analyst yes that helps thank you operator and the next question today will come from gary tenner with d a davidson please go ahead gary tenner d a davidson analyst thanks good morning just had a quick follow up actually on ppp which you sort of answered just a moment ago but in terms of how you see working down that portfolio for the back half of this year and then related to that given that you don t want to necessarily invest in bond portfolio at current rates how you think about replacing some of that yield on earning asset asylbek osmonov chief financial officer so if you look at on the ppp so on the round one forgiveness it s pretty much it s very close to be done on round two we just kicked off in june and i think like i mentioned we expect probably it s all dependent on timing right when the customer want to file the forgiveness process application but probably it s going to be the next three quarters we think that the forgiveness will be done i mean it s kind of hard to say when it s going to be heavier in the first third or fourth quarter but between three quarters i think the forgiveness will be done and i think it comes down to how we re going to replace that i mean we re growing our loans that will be priority number one so all the excess liquidity from the ppp loans will be put into as much as possible to new loan but if there s excess money left probably we ll definitely put it in a bond portfolio because we want to earn some income on that we wouldn t be probably leaving a lot just sitting on the cash but we just have to wait when we see to see rates improve on the bond portfolio randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer i think they have 10 months left to file for forgiveness so it won t happen it s not going to all happen this year it will happen like you said over the next three maybe four quarters david e zalman senior chairman and chief executive officer and the bottom line the full focus is taking the money and put it in the loans if we can randy d hester senior executive vice president and chief lending officer yes definitely gary tenner d a davidson analyst yes very good thank you operator this will conclude today s question and answer session and i would like to turn the conference back over to charlotte rasche for any closing remarks charlotte m rasche executive vice president and general counsel thank you sean thank you ladies and gentlemen for taking the time to participate in our call today we appreciate the support that we get

i want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion these can be found in the investors section of our website at bunge com under events and presentations reconciliations of non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are posted on our website as well i d like to direct you to slide two and remind you that today s presentation includes forward looking statements that reflect bunge s current view with respect to future events financial performance and industry conditions these forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the sec concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors on the call this morning are greg heckman bunge s chief executive officer and john neppl chief financial officer i ll now turn the call over to greg gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you ruth ann and good morning everyone so turning to the agenda on slide three i ll start with some highlights of the second quarter before handing it over to john who will go into more detail on our performance i ll then share some closing thoughts on how we re thinking about the remainder of the year before opening the line for your questions let s start with an overview of the quarter turning to slide four i want to start by thanking the team for great execution in a highly volatile quarter we re very pleased with how we ve managed our operations as well as our earnings at risk with the appropriate level of discipline we also helped our customers navigate and manage through the volatility of this quarter that came from weather issues domestic and international supply chain challenges and other complexities in the current environment turning now to our segment performance results in agribusiness were down versus a very strong quarter last year but exceeded our expectations as the team effectively managed trade flows and capacity utilization we set quarterly and year to date records in soy crush volume capacity utilization and lower unplanned downtime additionally we reduced power consumption to an all time low in our european rapeseed crush operations while we faced complexities in the quarter related to freight transportation and other areas that affected many other companies and industries our results clearly demonstrate that with our commercial and industrial teams working closely together we have built resilient supply chains that allow us to be successful through a range of macro environments results in refined and specialty oils improved in most regions with particular strength in north america in the u s we saw foodservice demand come back stronger and faster than and anticipated and we re experiencing a greater impact from renewable diesel demand than we expected in response to the higher demand for refined and specialty oils we ve been working to find greater efficiencies to increase supply we ve also worked with our food customers to help them manage their risk as well as reformulate products where it makes sense the multiple drivers behind the strength in edible oils gives us confidence there are significant growth opportunities ahead of us i also want to highlight that this was a strong quarter for our noncore sugar jv as we ve noted in the past we continue to assess our strategic options regarding this business but we re very pleased with the improvement over the last year taking into account our year to date results and based on what we can see now in the forward curves we are increasing our outlook for the year and expect to deliver adjusted eps of at least 8 50 for the full year 2021 despite the global volatility we have confidence in our ability to deliver in the back half of the year based on the business already committed the crush outlook and the demand for refined and specialty oils as we look ahead we re confident that the performance of our operating model and market trends provide support for a higher mid cycle earnings so in our june 2020 business update we outlined our earnings baseline of 5 per share with the changes we ve made in our business as well as the fundamental shifts in the marketplace we re taking that baseline eps up to 7 and that s a 2 increase and consistent with last time this reflects our existing portfolio only and does not include any future growth investments i ll now hand the call over to john to walk through the financial results the 2021 outlook and additional detail on the updated earnings baseline i ll then close with additional thoughts on some of the trends we re seeing john neppl chief financial officer thanks greg and good morning everyone let s turn to the earnings highlights on slide five our reported second quarter earnings per share was 2 37 compared to 3 47 in the second quarter of 2020 our reported results include a negative mark to market timing difference of 0 24 per share adjusted eps was 2 61 in the second quarter versus 1 88 in the prior year adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes for ebit was 550 million in the quarter versus 564 million last year reflecting lower results in agribusiness partially offset by improved performances in refined specialty oils and milling in processing higher results in north america and argentina were more than offset by lower results in europe and to a greater extent in brazil which reflected a decreased contribution from soybean origination due to an accelerated pace of farmer selling last year in merchandising improved performance was primarily driven by higher results in ocean freight due to strong execution and positioning in our global corn and wheat value chains which benefited from increased volumes and margins in refined and specialty oils the outstanding performance in the quarter was largely driven by higher margins and record capacity utilization in north american refining which benefited from strong foodservice demand and increased demand from the growing renewable diesel sector improved results in south america were due to the combination of higher margins and lower costs more than offsetting lower volumes europe benefited from increased volumes and margins from higher capacity utilization and product mix in milling higher volumes lower costs and good supply chain execution in south america were the primary drivers of improved performance in the quarter results in north america were comparable with the last year the increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to performance based compensation accruals a portion of which was not allocated out to the segments as was done in previous years the increase in other was related to our captive insurance program improved results in our noncore sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher ethanol volume and margins prior year results were negatively impacted by approximately 70 million in foreign exchange translation losses on u s dollar denominated debt of the joint venture due to significant depreciation of the brazilian real for the six months ended q2 income tax expense was 242 million compared to an income tax expense of 113 million in the prior year the increase in income tax expense is due to higher year to date pre tax income partially offset by a lower estimated effective tax rate for 2021 net interest expense of 48 million was below last year primarily driven by lower average variable interest rates partially offset by higher average debt levels due to increased working capital let s turn to slide six here you can see our continued positive earnings trend adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past four fiscal years along with the most recent trailing 12 month period this improved performance not only reflects a better operating environment but also the increased coordination and alignment of our global commercial industrial and risk management teams due to our new operating model slide seven compares our year to date sg a to the prior year we have achieved underlying addressable sg a savings of 20 million of which approximately 80 is related to indirect costs through our team s disciplined focus on costs we were able to continue to achieve savings even when compared to last year which was already lower as a result of the pandemic and the actions we took to reduce spending looking ahead we are monitoring cost inflation in many markets especially in brazil and we ll be working to offset this impact where we can while still making the necessary investments in our people processes and technology moving to slide eight for the most recent trailing 12 month period our cash generation excluding notable items and mark to market timing differences was strong with approximately 2 billion of adjusted funds from operations this cash flow generation was well in excess of our cash obligations over the past 12 months allowing us to strengthen our balance sheet shortly after quarter end we closed on the sale of our u s grain interior elevators receiving additional cash proceeds of approximately 300 million and another 160 million for net working capital slide nine details our year to date capital allocation of adjusted funds from operations after allocating 76 million to sustaining capex which includes maintenance environmental health and safety and 17 million to preferred dividends we had approximately 800 million of discretionary cash flow available of this amount we paid 141 million in common dividends and invested 57 million in growth and productivity capex leaving over 600 million of retained cash flow as you can see on slide 10 readily marketable inventories now exceed our net debt with the balance of rmi being funded with equity please turn to slide 11 for the trailing 12 months adjusted roic was 18 4 11 8 percentage points over our rmi adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6 6 roic was 13 seven percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6 and well above our stated target of 9 the spread between these return metrics reflects how we use rmi in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit moving to slide 12 for the trailing 12 months we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately 1 7 billion and a cash flow yield of nearly 24 please turn to slide 13 for our 2021 outlook as greg mentioned in his remarks taking into account our strong q2 results and our outlook we have increased our full year adjusted eps from 7 50 to at least 8 50 above last year s record of 8 30 our outlook is based on the following expectations in agribusiness full year results are expected to be up modestly from the previous expectations but still down from a very strong 2020 in refining and specialty oils we expect full year results to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher compared to last year due to our strong first half results and positive demand trends in north america we continue to expect results in milling and corporate and other to be generally in line with last year in noncore full year results in our sugar and bioenergy joint venture are expected to be a positive contributor additionally the company expects the following for 2021 an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 17 to 19 which is down from our previous outlook of 20 to 22 net interest expense in the range of 220 million to 230 million which is down 10 million from our previous expectation and capital expenditures in the range of 450 million to 500 million which is up 25 million from our previous forecast and depreciation and amortization of approximately 420 million shifting to our updated mid cycle baseline the waterfall chart on slide 14 shows the areas and magnitude of increased earnings being primarily driven by what we see as a structural improvement in the oilseed market fundamentals this is due to increased vegetable oil demand by the renewable diesel industry and greater benefits as a result of the change in our operating model to a global value chain approach turning to slide 15 and the drivers behind these increases consistent with our approach in june 2020 we introduced when we introduced our 5 baseline we were defining our long term average oilseed crush margin range by using the weighted average of our footprint over the past four years plus the trailing 12 months this increases our average soy crush margin by 1 a metric ton to a range of 34 to 36 per metric ton and more significantly it increases our average softseed crush margin which is more sensitive to oil demand by about 10 a metric ton to a range of 48 to 52 per metric ton we feel these ranges reflect more reasonable normalized numbers in the go forward structural market environment we have also increased the normalized earnings of our oilseed origination and distribution businesses and our merchandising subsegment reflecting the more coordinated and aligned approach within the value chains from our new operating model the approximate 30 increase in refined and specialty oils earnings is driven by a higher capacity utilization in north american refining and increased contribution from specialty oils due to improvement initiatives that are underway importantly we assume that margins in north american refining normalize back to historical averages as we expect in time that the renewable diesel industry will add pretreatment capabilities to their facilities there are no changes from our prior baseline in milling corporate and other are down primarily due to higher performance based compensation from the increase in our baseline there is no change in the assumed contribution from our sugar and bioenergy jv net interest expense is reduced by approximately 25 million compared to the 5 baseline reflecting debt paydown from strong cash flow in 2021 and normalized working capital given potential tax policy changes in the future we are increasing our estimated effective tax rate by two percentage points it s important to note that our earnings baseline of 7 is not earnings powered aside from upside that may come from higher margin environment we have a number of opportunities that we are pursuing that can drive earnings upside as summarized on slide 16 strengthening our oilseeds platform with targeted acquisitions is a top priority expanding our industry leading refined and specialty oils position to serve new and existing customers with differentiated products and services is an area of opportunity we re also excited about the growth and demand for renewable feedstocks and plant based proteins and finally we re continuing to invest in technology that will drive increased efficiency throughout our global operations turning to slide 17 at a 7 per share baseline we should generate approximately 1 4 billion of adjusted funds from operations after allocating capital to sustaining capex and preferred and common dividends to shareholders we should have about 800 million of discretionary cash available annually for reinvestment in the business or returns to shareholders this is an increase of approximately 200 million of cash per year from our 5 baseline with that i ll turn things back over to greg for some closing comments gregory heckman chief executive officer thanks john before opening the call to q a i want to offer a few closing thoughts from where we sit it s clear there s a structural shift underway in the consumer demand for sustainable food feed and fuel the conversations we ve been having with existing and new customers are significantly different than they were even just six months ago we re pleased with our position to help support meaningful change and with our global platform we have the ability to do so at scale consumers have demonstrated they will pay more to get what they care about and it s our job to provide these alternatives to our customers to meet this demand we work with customers on sourcing sustainable alternatives under or helping them reformulate we help food and feed customers source ingredients to minimize the carbon impact of moving them and we work with fuel customers to source and transport feedstock for renewable fuels importantly we do all of this with the goal of driving value back to farmers to allow them to invest in stewardship to support regenerative agriculture and to encourage production in optimal locations which means getting the highest production per acre using the least amount of inputs we re really excited about the role we can play in this accelerating shift i want to end by thanking the team again for their continued incredible execution and with that i ll open the call to your questions questions and answers operator the first question comes from robert moskow with credit suisse please go ahead robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi thanks for the question good morning i wanted to know when you ve developed your baseline assumptions did you consider a what if scenario if soybeans suddenly go back to historical levels like 8 9 a bushel because of a supply response does that affect your baseline and or do you just think the margins that you can make with all the renewable diesel activity and plant based are structurally high so it doesn t matter gregory heckman chief executive officer yes i ll start and let john come in but yes it s a holistic look at history as well as what s currently happening with the key supply and demand factors and sure we re seeing coming forward in the next couple of years the market is doing its work right we re drawing more supply out but the thing that is different this time is it wasn t one big crop shortage that s caused these higher prices it s been demand and a structural demand shift in a number of areas so yes we rerolled all that into the thinking robert moskow credit suisse analyst okay and then one quick followup also on the baseline some agtech companies are introducing soybean varieties that require less processing so that the i guess the protein can be extracted cheaper is that a structural benefit to you is it material enough to improve your earnings or because i guess you would get cheaper byproducts as a result gregory heckman chief executive officer yes how we think about technology look is the largest global lc crusher we re of course working with people on seed technology we re working on cover crops we re working at continually becoming more efficient in our own operations so as we re seeing the demand not only on the traditional food business and the feed customers but now on the renewable diesel and the growth in the plant proteins it s going to draw more innovation into the space and as the largest operator here it s our job to be in step with that and find ways to take advantage of that so we re excited about it john neppl chief financial officer but i would say rob this is john we haven t baked any sort of i ll say new technology into our thinking and our numbers so it s really based on what s here today what we re operating today and in what we think is a reasonable outlook on margin environment so anything that would bolster improve the margin environment for us going forward would be additive to that robert moskow credit suisse analyst thank you operator the next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please go ahead steve haynes morgan stanley analyst hey this is steve haynes on for vincent just wanted to ask it might be a little early to start talking about 2022 but when we think about your 7 baseline and maybe what might be implied for the second half of 2021 it might suggest something a bit lower than 7 so can you help us kind of think about where the exit rate for this year would kind of put us relative to your new baseline gregory heckman chief executive officer yes no i d say we see that differently i think part of the confidence in raising the baseline to seven years is or to 7 and doing it this year is what we see in the momentum for the balance of this year and the structural shift in demand carrying into 2022 and 2023 we were very comfortable putting that baseline out there because we feel we can exceed it here with what we re seeing right now for the next couple of years john neppl chief financial officer yes i think it s important to note that the baseline and maybe it wasn t clear enough in my remarks but it doesn t include the refining premiums that we re seeing today it does include additional volume from refining as we go forward from the demand but we did pull back the refining premiums to a more normalized level assuming the long term that the energy consumers end up doing their own pretreatment but for now we re realizing much higher refining premiums than what we had built into the 7 steve haynes morgan stanley analyst thank you operator the next question comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone so i guess maybe first question just on the revised 2021 outlook and from the way you had characterized the increase in the press release and the prepared remarks it doesn t seem like your second half outlook has really changed all that much from where you were in the first quarter or coming out of the first quarter and i just want to confirm that that s true and if so just help us think about kind of the puts and takes around the world in terms of farmer selling in terms of kind of the crush margin outlook that you see and the opportunities and risks as we think about the second half gregory heckman chief executive officer sure yes you see that correctly and in fact as always we re looking at what we ve delivered and then we re looking at the curves for the balance of the year the curves are definitely weaker than the last time we talked and so we ve reflected that in the outlook now that being said if you look historically we ll be really surprised if they stay there but that s what we see right now you probably if we kind of talk around the world on the crush margin side of course north america is the strongest with china probably being the weakest europe has definitely felt some pressure as argentina has ran harder this year and that meal got pushed out into europe but we re seeing argentina now traditionally starts to slow down after harvest as well as the producer as we move toward an election and maybe perceived higher risk of devaluation now starting to slow the marketing so we ll see argentine crush start to slow down as far as the farmer selling of course in brazil on the corn side the producer has not been as quite as sold as prior because you had a tough weather situation there in a smaller safrinha crop black sea a little bit behind in corn but in the u s just slightly ahead of history and so the next kind of wave in corn selling will be i think as people see how the u s crop as the weather continues to play out and get a look at kind of what people feel comfortable about the yields and we ll see the next marketing the u s farmers pretty sold up on the 2021 crop a little bit ahead of last year and i think that s really the story again of getting through the weather which has got to play through august here get comfortable with the yields and then we ll probably see another wave of marketing and then in brazil of course we re behind prior year which last year was pretty special the way things formed up and with what happened with the fx and the heavy marketing so we didn t really expect that to repeat but overall curve is pretty weak but historically we ll be really surprised if they stay there and in fact we re starting to see a little glimmer of improvement in china even this week adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst all right that s really helpful and then just a follow up on the new baseline and i guess i m trying to think about kind of where some of the pluses could come from on the capital allocation front and i guess first it doesn t include really anything significant in terms of the sugar jv or potential proceeds from kind of eventual sale or ipo of that business and then if i m looking at the excess kind of funds from operations that you would be generating in that scenario just how we thought about the reinvestment or repurchase kind of benefits of that in the 7 john neppl chief financial officer yes adam this is john we haven t assumed anything so let s take sugar we kind of assumed status quo for sugar so not any additional contribution in terms of from earnings or additional impact from a divestment of that business we ve kind of left it as is which we think is pretty conservative and on the growage front we have not assumed any big growth capital investments in that number so as we talked about on one of the slides anything that we do from an investment standpoint and growth projects will be additive to the number adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst got it so to be clear there i mean after your common dividend you re going to be at there about 7 of equity cap today per year roughly that s been allocated effectively from a growth capital perspective or reinvest or return to shareholder perspective gregory heckman chief executive officer correct so you can kind of think of that baseline as being sort of a 20 23 ish number but clearly over time either we re going to invest in growth projects or we re going to buy back stock one or the other we re not going to continue to accumulate cash forever and both of those would be upside from the 7 adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst that s really helpful thank you the next question comes from ben bienvenu with stephens please go ahead ben bienvenu stephens analyst hey thanks good morning everybody i want to follow on adam s question there just on capital allocation and if i look on page 16 in your slides the buckets you provided are those in order of importance or attractiveness and or the opportunities that exist today and if so could you talk through that if not could you also just talk about where you see the greatest opportunities and how you think about i know you ve talked about wanting to make a risk adjusted return profile in your investment paradigm that you put into place can you talk about that relative to the decision to buy back stock and to adam s point on a yield basis the stock is going to be quite cheap so i would imagine that increases your hurdle rate for the stuff you would want to buy gregory heckman chief executive officer yes let me start on the projects and then i ll let john take it from there but no i think what s exciting now is we ve turned to the growth phases so the teams are really working across all the growth platforms and they ll be competing for that capital as we put it to work and then as you said and i ll let john talk to that it always competes versus buybacks right that s always a baseline as well but look we re excited what we re doing on our oilseeds platform as well as the origination distribution businesses so we re doing all the debottlenecking we re looking at some brownfield opportunities and then of course even looking at some greenfield opportunities because there s going to be more capacity needed to meet this demand growth we ll continue to support our strong areas but we re also looking to fill in some areas and whether that s with bolt ons or if we can do something meaningful on the acquisition side i mean we feel we re as good as anyone to do that we ve shown that we can execute and we re building the cash and looking for those strategic opportunities our specialty oils business you saw a better performance there across that business and really gaining momentum so we ll continue to look at not only the organic growth but where we have bolt on acquisitions or tuck in acquisitions in that business we really like that and with all the reformulation and innovation that s going to be going on with customers is what s happening in the oil complex we re really glad to have that in the portfolio and then of course what s happening in plant proteins that trend is firmly in place that s a business that will be a slower build for us we re working with the customers and really working backwards in how we build that business and so we ll be thoughtful and again it is about the returns we re not going to run out and overpay for anything to do that we re going to maintain our discipline around capital allocation and lastly on the renewable feedstocks it supports really all of the business but it s not only the products to serve that new demand which is in the oil which is really important as you know historically a lot of times the oil has been the drag for crush which just makes that no longer the case but it s not only the products but it s the services that will be wrapped around that and as we work with people because the conversations are everybody wants a lower carbon impact and that s whether that s in feed food or fuel and so as we work with the producers to help them deliver that lower carbon product and work it all the way through the value chain into our customers whether it s on the b2b side or the b2c side so teams are working very hard the portfolio rationalization over and we ve turned to growth and this is we re doing the hard work now but lots of great opportunities and we re excited about it john neppl chief financial officer yes ben in terms of returns i think we ve talked before about how we think about the allocation process and we look holistically from the top of the house on where the best opportunities are and we obviously adjust return requirements based on geography based on familiarity with that business how it folds in closely with what we re doing or if it s an adjacency but in any event we re looking at things that are accretive to our targeted roic so and again it s a pretty disciplined centralized approach and we do expect frankly as we re generating additional cash down the road to utilize that availability to continue to look at growth opportunities i do expect for next year with the pipeline of capex that we have that we ll probably see a ramp up in capital spending next year over what we re expecting this year ben bienvenu stephens analyst okay great greg you mentioned china crush starting to maybe get a little bit better could you talk more broadly about china and the demand backdrop there i know there were some corn cancellations a couple of weeks ago that rattled the grain markets we ve seen what pork prices have done how do you feel about where we are on the curve for demand from china and how that bears out both in crush and origination as we move forward gregory heckman chief executive officer sure look let s start by the demand has been very solid there if you look at the usda is forecasting corn imports to be three times last year so that s a different story than we have seen historically and so yes there ll be some ups and downs but the trend has been more and been up and we think that that s going to repeat and be sustainable the higher corn prices did cause some wheat feeding one thing about as they ve rebuilt that commercial industry right they re running lease cost formulation now and when there was some wheat released from the reserve with the corn high corn prices they reformulated and wheat being four points higher on protein that did hurt meal demand so we felt that we think we re kind of getting to the tail end of that and then as you said hog margins have softened but that seems to have stabilized and then crush margins were under pressure this was kind of all happening at the same time but again that seems to have stabilized and historically if you look at that in that industry the marginal producers will pull back and those crush margins will recover so we feel good about the long term there but there will always be some ups and downs in the demand look ben bienvenu stephens analyst ok thanks for the comment and congratulations gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from luke washer with bank of america please go ahead luke washer bank of america analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask about the refined the premium on the refined soybean oil versus the crude soybean oil john i think you talked about you expect that to come down as it relates to your new 7 eps baseline but we re seeing a lot of renewable diesel capacity coming on over the next really three to four years and this premium seems to have blown out to the near double of what it historically has been so when you think about that going forward do you see that coming down sooner than later or do you think with all this renewable diesel capacity and most likely a lot of them are bringing on those pretreatment facilities too soon we could see that premium really last for a few years here john neppl chief financial officer yes we re really looking at normalization over time but it s tough to predict how quickly that will happen i think our view would be over the next year or two it s going to be it will remain elevated you re right and we re seeing premiums nearly double what they have been historically and a lot of the demand that s coming on in the near term won t have pretreatment so it s really going to be a question of how fast and over what period of time so we wanted to be conservative in our 7 baseline that we didn t assume extended time period of elevated margins in that area but certainly it s possible that that will happen gregory heckman chief executive officer yes here in the near term you re exactly correct we re starting to see the benefits of that already and we really haven t seen the volume really start to pick up yet that will happen here in the second half and then to your point it will take a couple of years for some of that to get built but we wanted to separate the near term environment from what we had put in the long term baseline luke washer bank of america analyst yes to take advantage it looks like debottlenecking some of your oil are you exploring any greenfield potential too to build a new crush plan or right now it s just really focused on debottlenecking gregory heckman chief executive officer no everything is on the table luke washer bank of america analyst got it okay helpful and maybe just one more quick one i was hearing a lot about supply chain disruption particularly as it relates to ocean freight and it sounds like in your merchandising business it s almost helped you to some extent i guess could you frame how that s helped your results or hurt your results and whether this disruption could last for a while what that means for the back half of the year here gregory heckman chief executive officer yes the one thing about having a global system and over 30 of our own ports when there is tightness and there is dislocation it allows us to be able to help solve problems for customers and to manage our own processing businesses to serve customers with products so from that standpoint it becomes somewhat of an opportunity is it difficult is it challenging does it create a lot of complexity absolutely some of the other things a little more problematic no doubt but they re not unique to us in our industry or unique to this industry alone but if you look in north america the shortage of truck drivers and the tightness in truck freight and that s really challenging on the logistical side and we re all working through that and then of course the tightness in containers globally has made some supply chain management very difficult but you switch modes of transportation where you can and work through stocks try to manage stocks with customers to manage where you ve got logistical risk but that s part of having a great global platform and having a great team luke washer bank of america analyst thank you operator the next question comes from ben kallo with baird please go ahead ben kallo baird analyst hey thanks for the question congrats greg and john first a housekeeping question on the jv could you just remind us what the period is where you can t you couldn t do anything to spin or sell it and then i have a much broader question john neppl chief financial officer sure yes ben we re now in a we re past the time line in which we could go out and market our half of the ownership of the jv so that was at 18 months and so we passed that about a month or so ago so we have the ability to go out market our half at the same time we ll have the ability to trigger ipo at the two year mark which is december 1 and certainly we re talking to our partner we re assessing our opportunities down the road here we re keeping an eye on what s happening in the brazil financial markets as well as what s happening with raizen and their recent ipo of a portion it s a small ipo relative to the size of their business but we re watching that to see how the market reacts over time here and certainly keeping our options open ben kallo baird analyst got it and then greg you ve been at the helm since april 2019 and with the new 7 baseline and like adm establishing a baseline a new baseline yesterday i guess what of the 7 number has been under your control and your team s control of getting there versus the macro environment whether it s a structural change or it s a temporary change and if you could i know that s a lot there but if you could slice it up into what you think has led to that 7 number from where you started from that would be helpful gregory heckman chief executive officer sure look a lot of it are the things within our controls we re not assuming any big macros in that that is if you think right what we ve lived through the last two years put aside the fact of trade war asf and covid what we lived through is we changed this portfolio we re running a different set of assets and we ve gone through all the work at the same time of unwiring those from the machine as we did the divestitures i mean sure these are distracting tough projects and super proud of the team and what they ve been able to do we changed the operating model on a global company and that took rewiring right rewiring the systems and the processes and we re still in the final throes of that and getting better information more quickly to all of our industrial and commercial teams and then the disciplined approach that we re taking on risk management and that really focusing on the assets and how we re running the assets and how we re managing the earnings at risk in those assets in the tens of thousands of customers that we ve got and then as we ve talked about the discipline around our industrial and seeing making improvements in how we run those assets and how the industrial and commercial teams work together and looking at the best of bunge globally to learn from ourselves as we think like a global company and make that systemic improvement that we get to keep and then we ve done this in some really tough environments and with a lot of people remotely and that s given us a lot of confidence even since a year ago when we were putting this baseline out amid this change so this is the underlying the company here the great global platform the great team and the way that we re operating and getting some miles with it now the environment has improved so when you say a 7 baseline remember that s a framework so when you see the crush margins higher than what s in the baseline that s showing how the over improvement is there and that s happening in soy and soft crush and when you see the edible oil volumes and now margins on the refining overages higher than what s in the model and that s what we were speaking to that s overperforming the baseline and that s what we talked about we re comfortable with what we re seeing here for the next couple of years and that s why it was time to raise the baseline and also why we were comfortable raising the outlook for this year ben kallo baird analyst thank you operator the next question comes from ken zaslow with bank of america excuse me bank of montreal please go ahead ken zaslow bank of america analyst hey good morning guys it s still ken with bank of montreal just a couple of questions one is i wanted to confirm that you re actually increasing your implied ebitda for mid cycle more than what you re increasing the eps given that you re raising the tax assumptions is that a fair assumption so the ebitda the assumption is actually stronger than even the eps raise from 5 to 7 if i didn t imply john neppl chief financial officer yes that s the the biggest driver is tax and then we do have a small increase in share count just over time through normal comp equity comp structure but that s pretty minimal but those would be the two drivers ken zaslow bank of america analyst so the ebitda is going is increasing your mid cycle ebitda is increasing at a faster case than your eps john neppl chief financial officer right correct yes ken zaslow bank of america analyst okay so cash flow matters okay i just want to make sure the second question john neppl chief financial officer it definitely matters ken zaslow bank of america analyst right that s what i m saying effective tax rate is less important than the ebitda that s associated with it that s what i m saying i just want to make sure if i did it implicitly i can back into what the ebitda calculation would be and it would be higher than the eps group that s what i just want to make sure john neppl chief financial officer yes ken zaslow bank of america analyst second question is there any reason not to believe that 2022 will be at least mid cycle numbers just making sure i got that just through all the context gregory heckman chief executive officer yes you re correct and with what we see right now we expect it to be above mid cycle numbers i think the next couple of years yes the next couple of years with the momentum and what we see here and look it takes time to build things whether that s capacity or pretreatment or some of the things that have to happen it s some of the oil that has to find its way into the u s that s complicated so there s a big shift going on and it s going to take some time for that to happen ken zaslow bank of america analyst okay and not getting ahead of myself but i get the sense that you re trying to continue to build on the mid cycle earnings over time through capex so if in three years or whatever the years are as you build the capacity and use your capital judiciously there is you re trying to build a higher mid cycle earnings over time as well right this is not the end of the mid cycle number is that a fair way of thinking about it gregory heckman chief executive officer that is correct no no this is the beginning if you will so if we make an acquisition we ll come in and talk about what change that makes to the baseline when we make a sizable capital investment we ll come in and talk about what change that makes to baseline so those will be probably the next things you hear about the baseline are when we make investments and the difference that makes to the underlying earnings power of the machine john neppl chief financial officer yes think of it another way ken to hit 7 over time as we reinvest capital wisely in the company it lowers that bar on the need the margin we need to get to 7 will drop so today we re at call it 35 and 50 over time as we reinvest those numbers would go down in terms of the margins we would need to hit 7 that s another way to look at it ken zaslow bank of america analyst thank you thanks alot john neppl chief financial officer thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to greg heckman for any closing remarks gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you just want to thank everybody again for your interest in bunge to wrap up we re really pleased with the continued outstanding performance we re pleased to be able to revise our outlook this global platform just continues to demonstrate its resiliency and with our role in the global food supply chain we re in a great position to benefit from what we see as an accelerating shift in demand for sustainable food feed and fuel and we look forward to talking to you again soon thanks again

lily bowles is a netflix subscriber and shareholder she believes in the company s ability to not only entertain but also challenge prejudice and create a greater sense of human connection as a self described steward of her capital bowles wanted to know how netflix nflx whose stock she first bought in 2016 was performing on material environmental social and governance risks these are sustainability issues that can be reasonably expected to have a financial impact on a company bowles finance background and her roughly 20 years as a netflix viewer made her uniquely positioned to get information on netflix s material esg risk performance in previous jobs she had worked with esg data sets and was curious how truly financially material these risks were and not just as a public relations play i fundamentally believe that material esg factors do affect the bottom line and i have a curiosity of how they re doing on material esg issues she says bowles story with netflix while a successful one also highlights how difficult it is for individual investors to engage with companies they own a task that has only gotten harder since the sec passed new rules during the waning days of the trump administration who is lily bowles bowles interest in sustainable investing sparked in 2009 while she was studying political and social thought at the university of virginia in charlottesville bowles attended a talk by muhammad yunus a nobel peace prize winning economist in which he discussed the concepts behind microfinance she says wanting to see how business was a direct solution to local problems bowles interned at grameen bank a microfinance organisation in bangladesh she also interned at b lab an organisation that certifies a company s social and environmental performance and village capital a venture capital firm that funds startups trying to solve social and environmental issues driven to learn how social problems and inequities develop bowles received her master s degree in international development at the london school of economics in 2015 this education helped her to understand the power of multinational corporations the amount of people they employ their environmental footprint and the importance of corporate governance bowles founded and co leads the los angeles chapter of the women investing for a sustainable economy or wise she works with the sustainability accounting standards board and us sif the forum for sustainable and responsible investment bowles also holds the fundamentals of sustainability accounting credential from sasb submitting shareholder resolution to netflix according to sasb netflix s most material esg risks include the environmental footprint of hardware infrastructure data privacy and advertising standards data security workforce diversity and intellectual property to get more information about how netflix performed on these issues bowles submitted a shareholder resolution in december 2018 in her proposal she asked netflix to disclose its material esg related policies practices and performance using company specific information and sustainable accounting metrics in its next annual report bowles also explained reporting could be done at reasonable cost and omit proprietary information or data the company was reluctant to share and with that the ball was in netflix s court working with netflix to disclose esg performance it didn t take long for bowles to realise how willing netflix was to share its performance on material esg issues as a result she withdrew her shareholder resolution a typical move shareholders make when they have confidence the company will follow through on a proposal says morningstar s head of policy research aron szapiro in february 2020 just over a year after bowles filed her resolution netflix released its first sustainability accounting standards board report detailing how the company performed on material esg risks for example this report identified that netflix matches 100 of nonrenewable energy use with renewable energy certificates it uses a similar matching program for nonrenewable energy consumption from its cloud hosting partners this report was a success for bowles was truly exactly what i and other members of the sustainable investment community needed in order to feel more informed and confident about our decision to invest in netflix she says bowles says the report might have been published even without her efforts but her involvement certainly helped the process a netflix spokesperson says the company had a positive experience working with bowles and had already been working to disclose its performance on material esg issues when her resolution was introduced since then it has disclosed its esg performance and what s material to its business and industry using sasb s framework in annual reports it has also hired a head of sustainability and outlined other esg information to its investors despite netflix s efforts sustainalytics a morningstar company only ranks netflix 44 out of 66 on its esg risking rating among other companies in the movies and entertainment subindustry this ranking is explained by its low management scores on issues like corporate governance business ethics and human capital jennifer vieno a sustainalytics analyst who covers netflix says the lack of disclosures and programs targeting these issues are the main reasons behind the company s scores how unique is bowles story there is a history of individual investors like bowles submitting resolutions to their companies for better shareholder outcomes according to james mcritchie founder of corporate governance the securities and exchange commission in 1942 allowed shareholders to submit 215 word proposals with no minimum ownership requirements no holding period limits and no limits for resolution submissions in 1947 a judge ruled in sec v transamerica that a corporation is run for the benefit of its stockholders and not for that of its managers this decision helped individual investors like bowles who wanted to improve their companies some investors even filed thousands of resolutions to spur action on corporate governance although many of their resolutions didn t have majority support these investors helped secured the right for shareholders to file proposals and vote on auditors mcritchie says however the average individual investor would find it difficult to replicate bowles efforts today resolution filers now must understand the whole proxy process and have a keen sense of corporate governance says jackie cook morningstar s director of sustainability stewardship research such individuals also need to engage with the company s management team which is no easy task this is where bowles stands out cook says most successful resolutions require significant time and effort which is easier for large asset management firms that can devote entire teams to engagement cook says the success of these resolutions depends on the company a corporation whose founder owns a majority of stock like facebook fb or amazon com amzn makes them really impervious to shareholder pressure cook says the sec proposes new restrictions when bowles submitted her resolution in december 2018 individual investors had to own at least 2 000 worth of stock and be a shareholder for at least a year before submitting resolutions to resubmit a failed resolution the proposal must have received 3 of the supporting vote once in the last five years 6 of the vote if voted on twice in the last five years and 10 of the vote if voted on three times or more in the last five years according to an sec press release however just weeks before bowles submitted her resolution the sec held a roundtable aimed at changing the way shareholders communicate and submit resolutions this discussion would lead to rules that make it harder for individual investors to do what bowles did with netflix cook says the rules enacted in september 2020 upped the thresholds of support needed to resubmit a failed resolution from 3 to 5 6 to 10 and 10 to 20 and shortened the resubmission window for failed resolutions from five years to three years these changes went into effect during the trump administration under sec chair jay clayton what this means for individual investors in a letter to the sec szapiro cook and morningstar s associate director of policy research jasmin sethi explained why this hurts investors this rulemaking is not necessary for the protection of investors instead the proposal would make it more difficult for shareholders to exercise their voices in corporate governance they wrote bowles expressed similar concerns and calls the changes absolutely un american investor participation in shareholder engagement shouldn t be viewed as a burden to corporations but rather as an opportunity to listen learn reflect and improve she says the us corporate investor relationship is unique and there is no doubt the sec rule fundamentally weakens this relationship going forward with a new sec with democratic president joe biden now occupying the white house the sec has a new chair gary gensler he is the former chair of the u s commodity futures trading commission under former president barack obama serving with gensler are two democratic commissioners and two republican commissioners the appointment of gensler gives democrats a 3 2 majority in the sec which favors democratic leaning proposals szapiro says as a result the rule proposed to limit shareholder resolutions has come back into discussion in a june 1 public statement gensler announced that he s directing the staff to consider whether to recommend further regulatory action regarding proxy voting advice sec commissioner allison herren lee highlighted in march 2020 the importance of proxy voting and how essential it is to the sec s mission of protecting serving and empowering investors she told attendees of the 2020 investment adviser association compliance conference how she viewed the effects of the proxy voting rule a reduction of investor engagement with the companies that they own is

metric to assess our operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions income taxes and certain non core and non recurring items in our financial statements the presentation of adjusted ebitda and core net income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains we consider to be outside the ordinary course of our business the use of adjusted ebitda and core net income has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations items excluded from adjusted ebitda and core net income are significant components in understanding and assessing our operating and financial performance depreciation and amortization expense for various long term assets income tax and share based compensation have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted ebitda each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results additionally adjusted ebitda and core net income does not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity we compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization interest expense income gains losses from investments in equity securities income tax expenses share based compensation share of loss in equity investees government subsidies and other relevant items both in our reconciliations to the corresponding u s gaap financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance the term adjusted ebitda and core net income is not defined under u s gaap and adjusted ebitda and core net income is not a measure of net income operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with u s gaap when assessing our operating and financial performance you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with u s gaap in addition our adjusted ebitda and core net income may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda and core net income or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other

quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you luis good morning and thank you all for joining us we hope you and your families have had an opportunity to be vaccinated and that you have done so the best way to protect yourself and your family is to be vaccinated although demand for cleaning disinfection and personal wash products has slowed from the pandemic peak we had stepan remain committed to doing our part by supporting customers that supply these essential products to the market the company had a good first half and delivered record results adjusted net income was 84 6 million or 3 62 per diluted share both adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were up 35 versus the first half of 2020 which was negatively impacted by the millsdale plant outage we delivered our best second quarter and had 42 2 million adjusted net income surfactant operating income was down 5 largely due to higher north american supply chain cost driven by inflationary pressures and planned higher maintenance cost our polymer operating income was up 48 on 44 sales volume growth the polymer growth was driven by both the invista polyester polyol acquisition and organic market growth overall the integration of invista s business into our company has gone well and is on track with our business plans our specialty product business results were up due to order timing and improved margins within our mct product line our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on stepan s common stock of 0 305 per share payable on september 15 2021 stepan has increased its dividend for 53 consecutive years luis will walk you through a few more details about our second quarter results luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer thank you quinn my comments will generally follow the slide presentation let s just start with the slide four to recap the quarter adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2021 was 42 2 million or 1 81 per diluted share a 10 increase versus 38 3 million or 1 65 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020 because adjusted net income is a non gaap measure we provide full reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures and this can be found in appendix two of the presentation and table two of the press release specifically adjustment to reported net income this quarter consists of adjustment for deferred compensation and minor restructuring expenses adjusted net income for the quarter excludes deferred compensation income of 1 1 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to deferred compensation expense of 1 9 million or 0 08 per diluted share in the same period last year the deferred compensation numbers represent the net expense related to the company s deferred compensation plan as well as cash settled stock appreciation rights for our employees these liabilities change with the movement in the stock price we exclude this item from our operational discussion slide five shows the total company earnings fees for the second quarter compared to last year s second quarter and breaks down the increase in adjusted net income because this is net income the figure is noted here are on an after tax basis we will cover each segment in more detail but to summarize polymers and specialty products were up where surfactant was down versus the prior year corporate expenses and all others were higher during the quarter due to higher acquisition related expenses and overall inflation the company s effective tax rate was 24 4 in the first half of 2021 compared to 23 9 in the prior year period this year over year increase was primarily attributable to a less favorable geographical mix of income we expect the full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23 to 26 the slide six focuses on surfactant segment results for the quarter surfactant net sales were 384 million a 16 increase versus the prior year selling prices were up 17 primarily due to improved product and customer mix as well as the pass through of higher raw material costs effect of foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by 5 volume decreased 6 year over year most of this decrease reflects lower volume into the north america consumer product end market this reduction was driven by lower demand for consumer cleaning disinfection and personal wash products versus the pandemic peak in 2020 additionally we continue to experience feedstock supply issues and customer inventory rebalancing efforts this was partially offset by higher demand for products sold into our institutional cleaning and functional product end markets surfactant operating income for the quarter decreased 2 6 million or 5 versus the prior year primarily due to higher north america supply chain cost as a result of inflationary pressures and planned higher maintenance costs latin america operating results benefit from a 2 1 million vat tax recovery project in the current year quarter europe results decreased slightly due to lower demand in consumer products partially offset by increased demand in functional products now turning to polymers on slide 7 net sales were 191 million in the quarter up 70 from prior year sales volume increased 44 primarily due to 41 growth in rigid polyol volumes global rigid polyol volumes excluding the invista acquisition was up 7 versus the prior year higher demand within the pa and specialty polyol businesses also contributed to the volume growth selling prices increased 21 and the translation impact of a weaker u s dollar positively increased net sales by 5 polymer operating income increased 7 5 million or 48 primarily due to double digit volume growth in the legacy polymers business plus invista acquisition north america polyol results decreased due to rising raw materials and manufacturing costs partially offset by higher volumes europe results increased due to double digit volume growth on the base business plus invista acquisition china results decreased due to the nonrecurrence of a onetime benefit in the base period in 2020 and lower volumes china volumes in the first half of 2021 grew 5 specialty products net sales were 21 million for the quarter up 33 from the prior year quarter volume was up 17 between quarters and operating income increased 3 8 million or 116 the operating income increase was primarily attributable to order timing differences within our food and flavor business and improved margins within our mct product line moving on to slide 8 our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity to invest in the business our leverage and interest coverage ratios continues at very healthy levels we had a strong cash from operations in the first half of 2021 which was used for capex investments dividends share buybacks and investments in working capital given the strong sales growth and raw material inflation we executed agreements for 100 million of new private placement debt at a very attractive and fixed interest rates of around 2 we will use a new cash to fund our organic and inorganic growth opportunities and for other general corporate purposes for the full year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 150 million to 170 million beginning on slide 10 scott will now update you on our 2021 strategic priorities scott behrens chief operating officer thank you luis we are pleased to have delivered record first half earnings to our shareholders and look forward to carrying that momentum into the second half of the year we continue to prioritize the safety and health of our employees as we deliver products that contribute to the fight against covid 19 our epa approved biocide formulations kill a specific novel virus that causes covid 19 and allow our customers to provide the public with additional tools to protect their families and to fight the pandemic based on customer feedback consumer habits have changed and these new behaviors require higher use of disinfection cleaning and personal wash products therefore we believe our surfactant volumes in the consumer product end market will remain higher versus pre pandemic levels however lower than peak pandemic demand in q2 of 2020 we believe institutional cleaning volume will continue to grow as economies around the world reopen and people demand higher standards for cleaning and disinfection in public settings we also anticipate that demand for surfactants within the agricultural and oilfield markets will continue to benefit from higher agricultural and commodity prices and improve versus 2020 we will continue working on improving productivity as well as product and customer mix to improve surfactant operating income globally we are increasing capacity in certain product lines including biocides and amphoteric to ensure we can meet higher requirements from our customers as discussed previously we are increasing north american capability and capacity to produce low 1 4 dioxane sulfates a minor byproduct generated in the manufacture of ether sulfate surfactants which are key cleaning and foaming ingredients used in consumer product formulations through a combination of process optimization and additional manufacturing equipment stepan will be prepared to supply customers ether sulfates that meet the new regulatory requirements this project is the primary driver of our 2021 capital expenditure forecast of 150 million to 170 million and will carry over to 2022 as well we are working with our customers to ensure these projects deliver our financial return targets tier two and tier three customers continue to be a focus of our strategy tier two and tier three volume grew in the second quarter driven by increased customer penetration we added 150 new customers during the quarter and more than 500 customers in the first half of this year our diversification strategy into functional markets continues to be a key priority for stepan during the first half global agricultural volume increased high single digits with strong growth obtained in the post patent pesticide segment and new products launched throughout the world oilfield volume was up mid single digits due to higher oil prices we remain optimistic about future opportunities in this business as oil prices have recovered to the 70 per barrel level we continued our consulting work in our millsdale plant and accelerated interventions and investments in both expense and capex to increase capacity and improved productivity we expect to continue this project and investment level throughout the rest of this year we are projecting a strong return on investment in this project through a combination of productivity improvements more capacity in several high margin product lines through debottlenecking key processes and improved service to our customers we anticipate starting to see the benefits of this project in 2022 and beyond polymers had a good quarter and first half of the year as the business is coming back from a challenging year due to covid restrictions the long term prospects for our polyol business remain attractive as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes should increase demand as quinn stated the integration of this business acquired from invista is going well and we expect to deliver 16 million to 18 million of ebitda in 2021 given the strength of our balance sheet we also plan to continue to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities to fill gaps in our portfolio and to add new platform chemistries i will now turn the call back to quinn for closing comments quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott the company delivered record first half earnings in 2021 looking forward we believe surfactant volumes in north america consumer product end market will be challenged versus peak pandemic levels in 2020 while we believe institutional cleaning volume will continue to grow versus prior year we do not believe it will compensate for lower consumer consumption of cleaning disinfection and personal wash products we anticipate that demand for surfactants when the agricultural and oilfield markets will improve versus 2020 global demand for rigid polyols continues to recover from pandemic related delays and cancellations of reroofing and new construction projects this recovery combined with our first quarter 2021 acquisition should position our polymer business to deliver growth versus prior year we believe that long term prospects for rigid polyols remains attractive as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes are expected to continue we anticipate our specialty product business results will improve slightly year over year despite continued raw material price increases and planned higher maintenance costs we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year this concludes our prepared remarks at this time we d like to turn the call over for questions daisy please review the instructions for the question portion of today s call questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport research partners mike harrison seaport research partners analyst hi good morning was hoping that you could walk through some of the pricing and raw material cost dynamics that you were seeing in your two key segments surfactants and polymers but overall pricing was up 20 in the second quarter how much more pricing do you feel like you need before you can offset the impact the margin impact of higher raws and maybe what does the timing look like in terms of i guess the margin trajectory in both of those segments quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer okay i ll start with that mike let me just say that the company has implemented price increases july one as well the price increase in surfactants i would say is going well and we re in pretty good shape from our surfactants business i think in polymers most likely we have a little more work to do in q4 to catch up and maintain and move our margins restore our margins in that segment particularly in north america we re in pretty good shape in polymers and europe at this point in time mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and in terms of the surfactants business you mentioned the decline in consumer surfactant demand obviously coming off the peak from the pandemic as well as some inventory destocking where do you see that consumer volume compared to pre pandemic levels once everything stabilizes especially given your view that we re going to see sustained higher cleaning demand as well as the addition of a lot of tier two and tier three customers that you ve brought on over the past several quarters scott behrens chief operating officer yeah mike this is scott it s a little bit difficult to project what s going to happen in the second half of the year we ve got economies that we re open and are questioning about restricting going forward we have economies that still have yet to be open so it s really hard to predict what it s going to look like going forward we re in uncharted times i would say based on the comments we ve made our business is up versus pre pandemic levels but below where we saw the peak last year and if you think about the peak in 2020 that basically emptied a lot of inventories throughout the production supply chain and what inventory is left in the trade at this point and in the consumers pantries is yet to be seen so i d say it s really hard to predict where we are in that continuum at this point quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer but i would say that our customers have told us that they believe that there s a higher demand for cleaning within homes and also within institutional facilities restaurants hotels etc so we do believe versus 2019 we have seen a sustained increase in cleaning in virtually all end markets that we re participating in mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and then on the polyols business it sounds like if we excluded the invista deal the volumes were maybe up mid to high single digits year over year maybe not as robust of a recovery as we might expect in some of those construction and rigid polyol applications are there either supply chain issues or pandemic issues that are still kind of dragging on construction activity and dragging on volumes within that business quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer so if we look at our legacy business our legacy business was up 7 luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer for rigid polyol quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer for rigid polyols so good market growth in your number that you calculated was kind of right on but we have seen some shortage of reaction products that our polyol is reacted within the marketplace specifically mdi has been short for periods of time and the pricing in china has been an issue that has negatively impacted our demand so we do see we are optimistic that we re going to see higher demand throughout the year for our polymer business and but there have been some supply issues on mdi and i guess that i would also say some fire retardant ingredients as well luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer yes and mike what i will complement is just the specific rigid polyol business we had a very strong quarter also on case and pa and that takes the whole legacy business excluding invista to a very strong double digit growth because case grew very strong and pa as well on top of the 7 in rigid polyols mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and then last question for now is i know you don t provide guidance but i feel like you have a lot of moving pieces going on in terms of the earnings comparisons you posted a couple record quarters here in q1 and q2 obviously the prior year included the millsdale outage impact and then 2021 is including the impact of the texas freeze which was also unusual so can you give us a sense of what your underlying earnings growth would have looked like in the first half without those effects and maybe give us a little bit more direction on what that should tell us about the pace of earnings growth as we get into the second half luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer great question mike this is luis so yes if you remember last year we had in the first half the impact of the millsdale freeze and then we had all the insurance proceed for that event basically in the second half so if we move the income to the first half to make sure that we have a clear base the 35 growth that we are reporting today in adjusted net income on an apples to apples basis will be around plus 12 so it s a good double digit growth in our business and we are happy with a strong double digit net income growth and as you know we don t provide guidance for the future but we are providing a lot of perspective about higher maintenance cost this quarter and for the next couple of quarters we continue seeing that is going as well versus what we did in q2 we know scott provided a little bit more perspective on the volume situation so but but if we look at the first half underlying apples to apple is plus 12 operator our next question comes from the line of vincent anderson with stifel vincent anderson stifel analyst i think mike covered the raw material questions pretty extensively there already but i did just want to make sure in case i missed it is there any way to quantify some of the impact on revenues rather than margins that came that basically hit this quarter from either raw material shortage or logistics shortage so specifically not being able to deliver as much as you wanted to kind of regardless of the price of that raw material quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer i think it would be difficult to break that out but from a i would say from an income perspective shortages in q2 primarily impacted our ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivative business and so i would say those two areas we probably from an income perspective operating income perspective we re probably maybe a couple of million dollars below and that dollar value would be associated with our business in north america and with our business in mexico vincent anderson stifel analyst okay that s fair and i just i m looking at what s going on in germany right now and you mentioned some mdi and flame retardant issues i think in asia is that something that we should be keeping an eye on or do you feel like that s mostly dealt with and we re not going to see another kind of likes of the 2018 2019 where we had just this just the shortage of the kind of co materials for your rigid polyol demand into inflation scott behrens chief operating officer this is scott vincent i would say it s being managed the plants are operating they re on plan some plants are on scheduled turnaround so the industry is managing it i would say it s very tight supply demand balance at this point we do expect improvement in the second half but i would not characterize this as a 2018 type of event vincent anderson stifel analyst okay that s good to know all right one more from me it might be a very short answer from you but you were linked to a fairly sizable acquisition target i figured i d be remiss if i didn t try to ask if one there had been any validity to that if there is no longer any participation by stepan in that in that target and if so would you be willing to speak maybe in general terms what drew you to a business of that size and portfolio mix maybe just as a case study in your m a strategy quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer yes so we remain interested in making acquisitions on a global basis and specifically enhancing our product portfolio so we were it was reported in the press that we were interested in an acquisition in brazil or based on a company in brazil i would tell you that our interest for that product line is primarily in north america and so our activities were not as ambitious and a little bit more focus on a geographic perspective than what s reported in the press vincent anderson stifel analyst understood so that was really just the alkoxylate capacity in texas if i remember then quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer alkoxylation on the gulf coast of the united states remains a priority for our company vincent anderson stifel analyst wonderful i appreciate the color good luck on the rest of the year gentlemen quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much vincent operator our next question comes from the line of marco rodriguez with stonegate capital markets marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst good morning everybody thank you for taking my questions i was wondering if maybe you could expand on a comment if i heard it correctly when talking about the capex expansion here in fiscal 21 you re obviously guiding to 150 million to 170 million but i believe i heard some comments it says that should carry into 2022 can you maybe provide some additional color surrounding that correctly luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer marco the comment from score was basically related to the low 1 4 dioxane project which is one of the key drivers of the higher capex this year that project will continue the execution in 2022 marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and is there is it too early to quantify maybe what additional spend might be related to that luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer yes i think we will provide very clear capex guidance for next year once we go through the budget and once we have all the projects in and out we will provide a clear perspective for next year later on marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it okay and just kind of circling back around with the price increases and the raw material price increases you guys spent some time already addressing that very much appreciated just wondering if you can maybe provide any sort of feedback from a customer standpoint on those increases in terms of them just being obviously resigned to the fact that obviously it s in the contracts but also something that s an expectation and if you can maybe perhaps comment on what sort of levels of competition you might be seeing that may be trying to kind of hold that your ability to push that through in the second half scott behrens chief operating officer yes marco this is scott i would start off by saying the inflation that our industry has seen in the first six months of this year probably has been unprecedented in the last 15 years and it s every material and every service that touches a customer or any part of their value chain so and the market is tight as well you re coming out of a covid restricted environment inventories were low you ve seen what s happening in the automotive market and the lack of inventory so it s a wave that all of us are trying to deal with in real time to the best of our ability so that s the best way i can describe the environment at this point quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer yes what i would further say is that i think transportation has been an issue not only for the whole chemical industry but i think for the whole supply chain across many different products and so i think as transportation has been limited in the marketplace it also has created less flexibility for ourselves and other people to respond to changes in demand so i would say the environment from a competitive perspective recognizes that the costs are up and pricing we ve generally been able to pass through most of the price increases or most of the price raw material price increases that we ve seen in the market particularly in surfactants and i mentioned earlier we have more work to do in our polymer business in north america marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it very helpful and last quick question for me if you can maybe just talk a little bit more about your m a pipeline just kind of where that looks what that looks like versus last quarter in terms of size and then maybe if you can just address what valuations might look like quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer generally we have a small number of active projects within our m a pipeline we have seen multiples go up significantly over the last couple of years we re seeing a little bit of maybe plateauing and maybe a little bit of a decrease for certain more commodity assets i think specialty chemicals remain at relatively peak multiples today so but so we continue to look and we ll keep you informed as projects and opportunities are announced in the marketplace luis rojo vice president and chief financial officer yes and the good news marco is that the whole industry is very active on m a and there are plenty of projects coming out every quarter so of course we will continue being very diligent about our process and we will engage in those that make sense for us quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer i would say though don t look for anything short term from us marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it very helpful appreciate the time guys thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport research partners mike harrison seaport research partners analyst just a few more from me one of the things i wanted to understand you talked about the 1 4 dioxane changes in the capital associated with that you ve been adding some other capacity can you quantify how much additional capacity has been brought on in some of these key cleaning and disinfection product lines and i guess with the pandemic elevated demand may be running its course is there still going to be a demand sorry enough demand out there in order to justify the additional capacity quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer so what i would tell you is that we have added relatively small amounts of incremental capacity in our biocide area and in our amphoteric product lines primarily driven by customer request around the world with specific enhancements in mexico and north america that s mostly where our capital expansions have been we ve also added some new reactor capability in brazil to support our agricultural business in that country scott behrens chief operating officer and mike specific to 1 4 dioxane it is not a capacity expansion of our sulfonation network it is putting a new capability on our existing assets to be able to meet the new regulations so it s not incremental capacity quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer and then the last thing relative to our polymer business the primary driver for the acquisition of invista s polyester polyol business was to provide low cost capacity opportunities for us today but also over the next decade where there is significant excess capacity within the asset that we acquired within wilmington and there are opportunities to debottleneck and expand the vlissingen the netherlands plant to support our european business mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right perfect and then on the agricultural business it s great to see the volumes higher there but just trying to understand if this is just strong ag market fundamentals that s driving that or if it s application wins or geographic expansion or maybe the product of other strategic efforts that we re seeing drive the growth there scott behrens chief operating officer yes mike it s a little bit of all the above commodity prices have risen significantly since last year corn soybean prices are 2 times of where they were that s driven increased farmer confidence and really a focus on improving yields per acre which really comes from their chemical applications so that s underlining market growth right and then there are certain differentiated wins that we re achieving through our targeted initiatives in post patent pesticide application formulations as well as new emerging smaller customers throughout our international regions so we ve seen the agricultural volumes grow in all four of our regions in the first half mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right then last question i have is on the oilfield business your slide deck mentions that you re planning a relaunch of the kmco business sometime in 2021 can you give a little more detail in terms of the timing and the potential revenue associated with that relaunch scott behrens chief operating officer yes i would say a couple of things one we re trying to replicate a product line that was manufactured in a different facility kmco s old facility so we ve had a lot of r d and process development work to do in 2021 with the impact of covid in operations and the supply chain disruptions we ve had with potentially raw materials and manufacturing partners we re a little bit behind our target however it is not going to be incremental to 2021 this was more of a rebuilding the supply chain model within the stepan network which quite honestly was more than a 12 to 24 month timeline operator our next question comes from the line of vincent anderson with stifel vincent anderson stifel analyst yes thanks i had this thought and i know you addressed it a couple of quarters ago but it wasn t in my notes so on the 1 4 dioxane that is a new york state i want to say regulation that is driving this if i m wrong correct me otherwise the question is are you already in conversations with either major customers or with regulatory bodies elsewhere in the u s where maybe you can actually get ahead of similar regulations in other states and gain market share from this or is this really going to be a just kind of coordinate with the buyers make sure you re getting paid for the capital that you re having to spend quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer so most large consumer product companies their supply chains are such that they don t want to have multiple skus in the marketplace so if you think about the vast vast majority of our customers are going to meet this standard even though it s just approved in the state of new york today they ll have one product in their product line that meets the standard for the entire united states so that s really what the vast majority of our customers are doing if you take a look at how we ve approached this market and this opportunity this challenge and the from the marketplace we worked very closely with our customers and we have to ensure that we get a fair return on the new capital that we are spending to meet the standard vincent anderson stifel analyst understood i appreciate the answer operator there are no further questions at this time please continue with your presentation or closing remarks quinn stepan chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much for joining us on today s call we appreciate your interest and ownership in stepan company please stay safe and healthy wash your hands frequently use disinfectants to clean surfaces and get vaccinated have a great day thank you operator duration 44 minutes call

vehicle identification and management systems based on artificial intelligence in the united states canada and internationally one of the main drivers of rekor s business is its automatic license plate recognition alpr technology which the company has pitched to investors as a major market opportunity since at least 2018 for example rekor has consistently touted the purportedly lucrative prospects of its uninsured vehicle enforcement diversion uved partnership with the state of oklahoma oklahoma under which the company receives compensation and commission fees in exchange for using its technology to scan vehicle license plates and compare them against a database to identify vehicles without auto insurance fueled by management commentary rekor s stock price has ballooned under the market perception that the oklahoma uved partnership is not only lucrative but the first stepping stone to capturing similar deals with other municipalities the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i rekor s alpr technology and uved related business is outclassed by global competitors with an established dominant market share ii it was unlikely that states would pass legislation authorizing deals similar to rekor s oklahoma uved partnership because of inter alia state and local privacy laws and related public concerns iii rekor s uved partnership was not as profitable as defendants had led investors to believe because of known impediments to enrollment rates and costs associated with the partnership iv accordingly rekor had overstated its potential revenues profitability and overall alpr and uved related business prospects and v as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on

private investor western edge published a report addressing rekor entitled rekor systems lackluster growth runway and exaggerated insurance scheme raise substantial downside risk the western edge report alleged among other things that global competition was miles ahead of rekor in alpr development and market establishment that the company s realized results suggest management s potential revenue guidance could be overstated by up to 80 and that investors were at risk of facing a massive downside if growth doesn t show up the western edge report also noted that rekor s predecessor in the oklahoma uved partnership had exited it because the program is not economically feasible given costs associated with the program and because there was typically no consequences for individuals that simply ignored the fines insurance requirements after they were identified also on may 26 2021 mariner research group mariner published a report addressing rekor entitled rekr government documents do not support investor expectations the mariner report highlight government documentation which shows that rekr s revenue opportunities are likely a fraction of what investors expect among other things mariner alleged that oklahoma government budgets imply that rekr s much vaunted uved program is a sub 2mm revenue opportunity almost 96 less than the 40mm in revenue intimated by rekor s ceo the mariner report likewise echoed the issues disclosed in the western edge report including inter alia those that had caused rekor s predecessor in the oklahoma uved partnership to exit the

officer good morning and thank you for your time we hope everyone is enjoying their summer i ll start by thanking our team for a great quarter they continue performing at a high level and reaping the rewards of a very positive environment our second quarter results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market some of the results the team produced include funds from operations coming in above guidance up 10 5 compared to second quarter last year and 0 03 ahead of our guidance midpoint this marks 33 consecutive quarters of higher ffo per share as compared to the prior year quarter truly a long term trend our second quarter occupancy averaged 96 8 up 20 basis points from second quarter 2020 and at quarter end we re ahead of projections at 98 3 leased and 96 8 occupied our occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market with accelerating e commerce and last mile delivery trends quarterly releasing spreads were among the best in our history at 31 2 gaap and 16 2 cash and year to date those results are 28 gaap and 16 cash finally cash same store noi rose by 5 6 for the quarter and 5 8 year to date in summary i m proud of our team s results putting up one of the best quarters in our history today we re responding to the strength in the market and demand for industrial product both by users and investors by focusing on value creation via development and value add investments i m grateful we ended the quarter at 98 3 leased matching our highest quarter on record to demonstrate the market strength our last three quarters were the highest three quarterly rates in the company s history looking at houston we re 96 5 leased with it representing 12 3 of rents down 150 basis points from a year ago and is projected to continue shrinking brent will speak to our budget assumptions but i m pleased that we finished the quarter at 1 47 per share in ffo and are raising our 2021 forecast by 0 09 to 5 88 per share helping us achieve these results is thankfully having the most diversified rent roll in our sector with our top 10 tenants only accounting for 7 9 of rents as we ve stated before our development starts are pulled by market demand based on the market strength we re seeing today we re raising our forecasted starts to 275 million for 2021 this represents a record annual level of starts for the company and to position us following the pandemic we ve acquired several new sites with more in our pipeline along with value add and direct investments more details to follow as we close on each of these opportunities and brent will now review a variety of financial topics including our 2021 guidance brent w wood executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning our second quarter results reflect the terrific execution of our team strong overall performance of our portfolio and the continued success of our time tested strategy ffo per share for the second quarter exceeded our guidance range at 1 47 per share and compared to second quarter 2020 of 1 33 represented an increase of 10 5 the outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better than anticipated particularly the quick releasing of vacated space during the quarter from a capital perspective during the second quarter we issued 60 million of equity at an average price over 162 per share and we issued and sold 125 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 2 74 in a 10 year term in june we amended and restated our unsecured credit facilities which now mature july 2025 the capacity was increased from 395 million to 475 million while the interest rate spread was reduced to 22 5 basis points and our ongoing efforts to bolster our esg efforts we incorporated a sustainability linked metric into the renewal that activity combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet has kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility our debt to total market capitalization was 17 debt to ebitda ratio at 4 9 times and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio increased to over eight times our rent collections have been equally strong bad debt for the first half of the year is a net positive 90 000 because of tenants whose balance was previously reserved that brought current exceeding new tenant reserves looking forward ffo guidance for the third quarter of 2021 is estimated to be in the range of 1 46 to 1 50 per share and 5 83 to 5 93 for the year a 0 09 per share increase over our prior guidance the 2021 ffo per share midpoint represents a 9 3 increase over 2020 among the notable assumption changes that comprise our revised 2021 guidance include increasing the cash same property midpoint by 18 to 5 2 increasing projected development starts by over 30 to 275 million and increasing equity issuance from 140 million to 185 million in summary we were very pleased with our second quarter results we will continue to rely on our financial strength the experience of our team and the quality and location of our portfolio to carry our momentum through the year now marshall will make some final comments marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer thanks brent in closing i m excited about our first half of the year we re ahead of our forecast and are carrying that momentum into the back half of the year our company our team and our strategy are working well as evidenced by our quarterly statistics and it s the future that makes me the most excited for eastgroup our strategy has worked the past few years and we re seeing an acceleration and a number of positive trends for our properties and within our markets meanwhile our bread and butter traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last mile distribution space in fast growing sunbelt markets these along with the mix of our team our operating strategy and our market has us optimistic about the future and we ll now open up the call for any questions questions and answers operator our first question is from daniel santos of piper sandler please go ahead daniel santos piper sandler analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a strong quarter so my first one is on development yields last quarter you spoke about potentially seeing some development yield pressure but from your results it seems like you ve been able to maintain fairly consistent yields so i guess i would ask for some commentary there marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer sure good morning and thanks dan you re right i guess it shows my inability to predict perhaps but i ll compliment the team construction prices have continued to rise and actually deliveries are continuing to get elongated so i still expect more downward pressure on our development yields to date the offset the market has been so positive as we ve been able to offset that with rent growth in the markets and maintain those seven yields and probably especially if we look back at last year the other kind of gratifying part of that is cap rates have come down they ve been low in the major markets within our footprint say the los angeles dallas atlanta but they ve continued to come down maybe another 50 to 70 basis points really across almost all of our significant markets so our spread to develop yields to market value is probably closer to 300 basis points at a seven probably almost everywhere we re developing is probably close to four and in some cases below four today in a number of cases so i still think they ll come down but thankfully they ve got room to come down and perhaps there ll still be pretty profitable opportunity for eastgroup daniel santos piper sandler analyst perfect that s super helpful my next question is more of a big picture question employers across the country have all lamented about the labor shortage and the number of unfilled positions but it seems like despite that tenants are still growing and taking more space so i guess my question is are you seeing any sort of on the ground impact from the labor shortage as far as taking space or are tenants really commenting that their expansion is hindered by the labor shortage marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer good question and typically the larger the tenant the more it makes sense the larger the labor challenges for them or the more they think about that i ve had brokers say to me in the past the kind of main factors are always the rent the tenant improvement allowance the lease term and now where do you draw your labor pool becomes part of that a bigger and bigger part of that equation for us we probably see it more and it s not given the leasing velocity that we ve seen this year that has been better than we had anticipated and feels like it s certainly continuing into the back half of the year probably more in construction costs of getting the trades and we are seeing a rise in construction pricing and things like that it s probably we are at we re getting it done but it s probably where we re feeling it the most but it does feel like there s inflation out there and labor will be a factor in that but to date it hasn t affected our leasing you re right daniel santos piper sandler analyst got it that s it for me thank you marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer thanks dan brent w wood executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dan operator the next question is from emmanuel korchman of citi please go ahead chris mccurry citi analyst hey this is chris mccurry on with manny just a quick question on development starts so with the increase in development starts guidance can you just provide some commentary on funding sources and the balance between common stock as well as dispositions and how this may impact the acquisition pipeline brent w wood executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hi good morning this is brent yeah the good news is we have we view great access to capital both via issuing equity and or the debt markets as we disclosed this quarter we just renewed our credit facility increasing our total capacity from 395 million to 475 million and really pleased to have decreased our spread our rate on that by 22 5 basis points which is going to be significant over the course of each year so from a capital standpoint we re not constrained the guys as they can unearth opportunities which are more and more challenging but we have that ability and really our dispositions are more of just good pruning from being good steward of operating our portfolio and just kind of pruning from the bottom but not so much as a source of capital needs we just don t need capital in that manner again we view our stock price relative to whatever you want to compute nav has is attractive and again debt market is attractive we re pretty much at historical lows in terms of our debt to ebitda now being 4 9 and debt to total market cap in that 16 to 17 range so very very good shape for capital sources for sure chris mccurry citi analyst got it and just a quick follow up on can you comment on some of the markets you are focused on expanding in right now and are some of your top performing markets this quarter a good read through on where you ll choose to grow marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer good question chris this is marshall certainly some although to us i kind of think of it more we think really longer term of a portfolio allocation to me it s we ve been working the past few years we like houston but kind of reducing that houston exposure so it s gratifying to see as we were looking back a 50 basis point drop from quarter to quarter down in the low 12s and that will continue dropping but we ll still stay active in the houston market we re under allocated out west when you look at the california markets denver las vegas some of those love to grow there but they re really the ones we re under allocated are also the most it feels like the most competitive markets we like miami continue to develop down there austin texas and dallas have been really hot markets and we certainly have an allocation there but we d love to keep growing in those and i kind of view it as brent and i if we can manage the portfolio allocation and sometimes that comes from it s a good time to be a seller of assets so that in each of the teams in the field have that runway of when they find the right opportunity to go create value and we can execute on that and if it requires us to sell an older asset in the market that s a good problem to have because we thankfully there s still 1 031 opportunities out there that we can recycle that capital and put it back in the development pipeline so i hope that s helpful it s really more of a long term like you think of your 401 k allocation or something like that chris mccurry citi analyst got it thank you marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer sure operator the next question is from elvis rodriguez of bank of america please go ahead elvis rodriguez bank of america analyst good morning guys and great quarter perhaps marshall you can share an update on your atlanta land acquisition and i know you mentioned some potential opportunities to acquire more in the balance of the year in particular how much runway does that give you to develop in atlanta and then also what are the markets that you re currently looking into marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer sure and i hope you re well atlanta and i was just there recently and i ll compliment john coleman and our team there we are acquisition this quarter was really an add on to a parcel on i 20 west that we had acquired at the end of the year that will hopefully put to production later this year pending steel deliveries and timing of that and then they ve got a few sites tied up that we re working our way through zoning and permitting and kind of the pricing given the topography is a little more challenging at atlanta i d say than most of texas for example or things like that but we ve got some good runway for growth in atlanta and the other nice aspect of atlanta is going back to the end of the year we had tied up three buildings on the value add that we had agreed to purchase when they were complete and we ve been able the team has to execute all three of those are in the portfolio at 100 leased and blended yield on all three of those is probably a 6 8 6 9 so taking the construction risk out the market cap rate on each of those is probably around to 4 so we love the value creation from there other markets where we re looking and it really kind of depends on where we ve got land but we ve got various stages between a little bit of time left to close but charlotte we re running out of land thankfully at steele creek and have some land that s been publicly announced there that the airport authority is selling charlotte austin as i mentioned a market we like we ve got some land parcels there phoenix working on land dallas kind of each of the markets it s harder and harder and i will say the number of developers the strength in the industrial market broadly is not a well kept secret so the number of active developers in our market is up pretty materially over the last couple of years so it s harder and harder to find those good parcels but we ve got a fair amount several hundred acres kind of tied up and working our way through diligence on those and hopefully we ll close as many of them as makes sense as we get to the end if we can get permitting and zoning and all the things like that they take time elvis rodriguez bank of america analyst thanks marshall for the update and then perhaps you can maybe speak to the tenant retention in the quarter and how you look at that versus rent growth sort of like that push and pull of keeping a tenant and the revenue in the portfolio versus really pushing for that higher rent that you can probably expect from a new tenant marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer sure no good question and typically we we ve been keeping a well performing tenant long term is where you d rather go and thankfully almost every tenant i d say high 90 have their own tenant rep broker by the time they sit down with us and so they re aware of the market and we ll push rents obviously there were gap over 31 so we ve had lower tenant retention year to date but we typically we retain about 70 of our tenants last year we were closer to 80 and probably two factors have driven our retention down year to date as we think about it are one as covid hit last year everybody understandably put their growth plans and what they were thinking on hold and that helped us in the short term and that most tenants just stay put and didn t move and i think now as the economy kind of stabilizes or people get comfortable operating in this environment we are seeing tenants expand that helped us lease a number of our developments have been existing tenants that have taken on more space and we ve moved them from building two in a park to building eight in a park for example and things like that and then the other thing i ll complement the team on there s been a few of our of the 2020 rent deferral customers that they came and they struggled through it but given how tight the market are is as it s not as much pushing rents is improving our credit quality so we ve vacated some pretty large tenants within our buildings up 190 000 foot amazon lease that we signed in san diego in first quarter was a tenant that had struggled over the years another one in southern california in the second quarter and we got strong releasing spreads in each of those cases but it was also a good opportunity to move a tenant where maybe their business was struggling a little bit and put a better quality tenant and you saw one it s in our top 10 tenants but it s a 3pl and it replaced a tenant who had struggled a bit over the past couple of years so that s if that helps that s really how we think about it a great time now to improve our credit quality of our tenants i like how diversified our portfolio is with our top 10 under just under 8 and then in the meantime push rents as best we can but probably not create vacancy because i think most of the tenants know where the market is certainly by the time we finish negotiations elvis rodriguez bank of america analyst thank you marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer sure operator the next question is from tom catherwood of btig please go ahead tom catherwood btig analyst thank you and good morning everyone marshall in your opening remarks you mentioned continuing demand from e commerce tenants and specifically last mile delivery we ve it kind of feels like we ve been talking about last mile delivery in gateway cities for a while now but with population growth in the sunbelt it seems like there s been more attention on swifter fulfillment where are your markets in terms of the build out of last mile distribution facilities and are you seeing any shifts in how your tenants are using your shallow base space for this marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer yes yes and no i guess we certainly see it we ve part of the leasing volume this year it seems to be more and more also 3pl kind of that freight fulfillment and really last mile delivery i do see tenants we ve seen an increase in retail oriented tenants taking space for delivery and as the brokers explained it to us anything that speeds up delivery whether it s a good or a service that s where the world is going right now so in a lot of our cases we also have the it can be the train air conditioning goodman any of those baker the large hvac companies the pool supply guys so if you re in atlanta or dallas and you re i guess residential or commercial operator this time of year if your hvac goes out you want that delivery person this service person there quickly and then we do see it within e commerce also as well as it s really what used to be acceptable demand was maybe three to four days if you go back even further than that and now it s amazon prime amazon prime now and we really anticipate amazon has certainly been as we ve all talked about a large consumer of space over the last call it 18 months and doesn t really feel like they re slowing down their program and we think the other retailers if our business cards were switched you ve got to find ways to compete with amazon on price and delivery so i think that s where our portfolio fits well and our pitch to a number of these retailers whether it s e commerce or delivery or even as retail agreement curbside pickup our buildings are efficient and close in and last mile and you re going to have to compete with amazon prime now so it s moving in that direction and it really depends more on that retailer than it does market by market yes you re right certainly in los angeles and new york but i don t think dallas phoenix atlanta or miami are very far behind we certainly see it in miami where our project is our park is pretty far east compared to the competition and when you think in south florida that basically means we re closer to the coast closer to where the high end residential is all along the atlantic tom catherwood btig analyst got it appreciate that marshall and then final for me you ve picked up some additional value add properties this quarter kind of two parts first when you re doing underwriting of value add versus stabilized what s the kind of spread in terms of yield that you re typically underwriting on these deals and then second are there some markets that have more opportunities for value add than others right now obviously you ve been active in atlanta and greenville so far but kind of what are you seeing as far as trends in specific markets marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer i guess historically you re looking back we would say we developed to a seven and maybe the market and now as i mentioned down to four and then a value add with maybe pencil out around mid 5s to 6 so you re getting maybe half is the spread is maybe half of what it is but you don t carry the land go through the zoning the entitlement the construction risk everything like that so the returns should be a little lower the teams executed well and so we ve had really strong returns almost the same as our development yields without that land carry or construction risk the tricky part now i think is the market the appetite is so great for industrial what we ve seen over the years we really moved to our value add because acquisitions lease products got so expensive we said why don t we take on the leasing risk and we can do that and development but i think the market is less and less afraid of vacancy so we ve seen the spreads continuing to come down on value adds it really depends on those developer relationships of their they usually have a financial partner and the model works where we ll talk to them and say we ll buy you out at certificate of occupancy you ll get part of your promote with your financial partner and you can move down the street and go build the next building so that s where it s worked and it s typically where we ve been developed a relationship with that particular developer and maybe do multiple transactions and i do think where the market is more and more of those cases we see them listing it with one of the national brokerage groups and that s where the pricing but it s rather than we re buying at a six and the market s four the market is paying 4 25 in the market cap rates that spread has gotten awfully tight because of the fear of vacancy continues to go down with this much capital and only so many places for it to go to work tom catherwood btig analyst understood thank you marshall marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer yes sure thanks tom operator the next question is from dave rodgers of baird please go ahead nick baird analyst hey guys it s nick on for dave i just had a question on utilization store shelves continue to be somewhat empty and then warehouses are somewhat full just and import activities rising i guess what s the disconnect on getting products to the consumer in this market marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer i guess if i m answering it and brent jumped in what we we ve kind of used the phrase that demand feels like it s here today and certainly we ve seen it with our leasing and our tenant growth and what s been a mess and it doesn t feel like it s going to get resolved anytime soon as you mentioned is getting product there s still a backlog of ships at the ports of l a and long beach and with the delta variant and things like that that the supply chains are just snarled and won t be resolved anytime soon so it s seem to be purchasing what s available not what s your choice of appliances or whatever item it is you seem to pick and i think that whereas we watch it and try to evaluate it and experience it too it s putting stress on our development pipeline because it takes longer for us to get this deal which is usually historically made in china but there s no capacity right now with the ships and the ports and things to get the steel to the u s and it s more expensive but in the meantime although it s taking us longer to build out our spaces it s the same impact on all of our competition so that s partially why our occupancy and percent leased have been so high and we think that s going to last for a few more quarters absent some economic shutdown again unless there s another big enough covid spike that the government shuts down the economy nick baird analyst great thanks for that and then i guess one question just on development you had that build to suit opportunity in san diego last quarter just commentary on have any tenants approached you on build to suit opportunities on your land bank or what s your appetite for that marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer yes good catch or good note yes we were happy about that and that we were planning a multi building park and it worked for amazon for a facility there so we re under construction hopefully we ll deliver it in first quarter of next year and really we set our goal when we bought the land we like the building design although it s a building rather than five or so which we originally had planned for this site but we are seeing more and more of that the tenant sizes seem to be growing and we ve got another one or two you never know i mean it s always competitive for those pre lease opportunities but if we can manage the construction risk which we have by the time we give them their bids but if worst case we run out of land which is what was our goal when we acquired it and now we re looking for other sites in san diego so we ll find that but we had a bunch of land in atlanta or in san diego in fourth quarter and suddenly we re out so now we re scrambling to find the next land parcel but i hope we ll see a few more and more of those and where cap rates are we think we re getting a great return with a long 12 plus year lease with amazon on that side nick baird analyst great thanks guys marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer sure operator the next question is from michael carroll of rbc capital markets please go ahead michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst hey marshall talk a little bit about the land acquisitions and i think you mentioned this in your prepared remarks and a little bit through the q a that you have a number of pending transactions for potential land sites i think you re talking about that you need to get them entitled before you close on those deals maybe you could provide some color on what type of sites that you re looking at and the timing of those acquisitions and when could they close and how much development could they support marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer i m trying to be working back through that we do and i ll really speak which i don t know like our model everybody s got a little bit of a different model and brent and i were both in the field although especially with me it s been a minute but where if you have texas for example you re responsible for everything in texas and that s existing portfolio as well as finding opportunities so we don t have a chief operating officer we don t have a chief investment officer so the sites may be saving a little bit of g a it s really up to those teams in the field to go find the opportunities so it s typically you re looking at aerials on the computer or in the car with brokers and just turn over a lot of stones and i ll complement the team they keep finding ways to unearth parcels every once in a while it s a greenfield usually it s something in this market as many developers a number here s a stat that surprised me recently when i was in dallas and was meeting with the cbre team that they said they were tracking maybe five years ago 20 plus active developers in the dallas market and now that number is approaching 100 for industrial and so that tells you how before we ve got 20 call it 28 people out looking for land sites and maybe in the 90s today how hard it is to find land but our building footprints are smaller and so sometimes there s parcels work for us that may not work for a developer that s building bigger boxes and things like that which is mostly where the new supply falls is it s the edge of town and 0 5 million square foot in a 1 million plus square foot building so they keep finding them we have and again we ll see where these all shake out but several hundred acres still under contract that would close by the end of the year and then value add as well and then a few probably another close to 100 i have to look further out into 2022 but i know there s some parcels that take longer than that and what we ll try to do obviously we ll tie it up as long as that seller will allow us to reduce that construction risk ideally we in a lot of cases we re ready to go and put it into production as quickly as we can but the more we can minimize any of that construction risk zoning risk permitting things like that getting through the cities we think that kind of risk reward is helpful for our shareholders so it s they ll tie it up and the whole process we ll go through and then as soon as we close ideally we d love to break ground the next day to minimize the carry michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst that s a great color marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer yes that s a big part of their job brent sorry carroll you ve lived that world for a long time too brent w wood executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no i think that s exactly it when we say entitlement in some states like texas is a little easier to migrate through the process but in the end you re trying to make sure you ve got a clear path to close meaning there s no surprises regarding zoning or improving your plans or those type things and like i say in some markets that process is quicker like in texas and in some other markets that process takes quite a bit more time and so one thing that behind the scenes has become more noticeable internally maybe not externally is just the time it takes to procure land when you guys see it hit the supplemental schedule and you say well you always say it s land constrained but you re always buying sites but i would say our lead time over the last 15 years have probably come from three to six months from tying up land and closing to 18 to 24 months and maybe the time it takes to go through the hoops or to if you ve got a redevelopment where you re going to close a golf course or a horse race track or move someone off the size that type of thing it just takes away more time and so that s one of the good it s what the public reits have an advantage over others is that you ve got boots on the ground and we ve got a great team in the field that can continue to make that happen and it s allowing us to create tons of nav through that platform michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst so what s increasing that time frame is it just that you re being more creative trying to find sites that could support industrial and you need to entitle it that was before maybe you re buying stuff that was already entitled for industrial as there s more competition i mean what is increasing that time line brent w wood executive vice president and chief financial officer it s the it s what s available i mean when i moved out to houston 20 years ago i mean you literally could still pull up to the green figure green we say rigid day undeveloped track of land that had utilities at the street and you put out your contract buy it build buildings in town and the street and you went about your business and then now those type opportunities aren t there so you re looking at trying to rezone a property which is trying to get most of the time that s down zoning meaning it s probably a higher and better use or view higher and better than industrial so you re trying to get it zone down to industrial you re trying to buy a business or two and close them and replant the land into one piece i mean there s now there s just so much other leg work that goes into getting it shovel ready as opposed to literally just pulling out and sticking your shovel in the ground there s a lot of behind the scenes work that has to go into it it s not an easy it s one reason that you ve seen supply not be as great some people like why aren t more people doing this well quite frankly it s not the development side of the business is not an easy some of the public reits have great teams to make it look easy but it s not an easy thing to do it would not be easy for you and i to go out and get a great track of land in a major metropolitan area and just go to town on it i mean there s a lot of people trying to do that michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst okay great thank you marshall a loeb president and chief executive officer sure operator this concludes our question and answer session i

chris christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer thank you alex and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call business activity and revenue grew steadily throughout the second quarter as existing and new customer openings increased and covid related restrictions eased across many key markets as the quarter progressed our customers benefited from the growth in both indoor and outdoor dining capacities strengthening consumer demand and the early stages of menu expansion thanks to our teams working tirelessly in delivering the chefs warehouse premium products and service model to our customers in a very challenging environment we exited june trending in line with 2019 revenue inclusive of acquisitions added in 2020 and 2021 similar to our previous reporting i will compare sales and gross margin results of the quarter of the current quarter sequentially to the first quarter of 2021 jim will provide the comparison to prior year in his comments later in this call during the quarter net sales increased approximately 51 versus the first quarter of 2021 specialty sales increased approximately 48 1 sequentially versus the first quarter of 2021 with average unique customers increasing 22 and we saw higher placements of approximately 36 specialty cases increased 41 versus the first quarter of 2021 while center of the plate pounds sold were approximately 29 4 higher sequentially versus the first quarter of 2021 excluding the impact of acquisitions gross profit margins increased approximately 163 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021 gross margin on the specialty category increased 316 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2021 while gross margin in the center of the plate category increased 31 basis points jim will provide more detail on gross margin and inflation in a few minutes in mid june we completed the acquisition of nicola imports based in phoenix arizona the addition of nicola contributes to our continued expansion out west by growing our presence in arizona and giving us an entry point into denver colorado a key restaurant hospitality market that we feel will be well served by chef s unique culture and service model going forward on the technology and operations front during the second quarter we implemented several systems and process improvements targeting improved efficiency in routing and warehouse management and we now have close to 100 of our specialty locations utilizing mobile truck scanning in addition we completed a key enhancement to our cybersecurity platform during the quarter now to move on to an update on recent business activity recent sales have been trending generally in line with 2019 sales inclusive of the acquisitions completed in 20 and 21 to date as july and august are typically quieter months revenue trends remained at similar levels coming out of june and into july while difficult to predict at this point there are observed expectations that the return to office buildings in certain large urban markets and continued growth in travel and hospitality could lead to additional industry growth as we move into the full months i would like to take this moment to express my sincere thanks to all chefs warehouse team members across our amazing company the extreme nature of this comeback in customer demand as markets reopened in may and june presented an unprecedented set of challenges their ability to execute amid the unique dynamics in labor supply chains price inflation and logistics created by the pandemic affected reopening has been a significant achievement and we are grateful for their dedication hard work and expertise our teams not only delivered our high quality products and service but also worked with customers to find solutions to issues created by this unique environment whether it was finding the right substitute ingredients among our 55 000 plus products making that last minute delivery or consulting on menu enhancement amid multiple supply chain disruptions and food inflation i would also like to thank our customers and suppliers for their cooperation and partnerships during the challenging but exciting time with that i ll turn it over to jim to discuss more detailed financial information for the quarter and an update on our liquidity jim james f leddy chief financial officer thank you chris and good morning everyone i ll now provide a comparison of our current quarter operating results versus the prior year quarter and provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity our net sales for the quarter ended june 25 2021 increased approximately 111 to 423 million from 200 5 million in the second quarter of 2020 the increase in net sales was the result of an increase in organic sales of approximately 106 1 as well as the contribution of sales from acquisitions which added approximately 4 9 to sales growth for the quarter net inflation was 11 5 in the second quarter consisting of 10 6 inflation in our specialty category and inflation of 12 1 in our center of the plate category versus the prior year quarter gross profit increased 120 8 to 95 9 million for the second quarter of 2021 versus 43 4 million for the second quarter of 2020 gross profit margins increased approximately 101 basis points to 22 7 multiple factors combined to drive gross profit margin improvement during the quarter including product mix changes volume driven efficiencies and effective inventory management we were extremely pleased with our sourcing sales and operating teams execution within a challenging food inflation and logistics environment specialty inflation was driven by broad based inflation across most specialty product lines inflation in the center of the plate category was driven by higher pricing across most beef categories partially offset by product mix changes associated with our allen brothers direct to consumer segment total operating expense increased approximately 32 5 to 91 2 million for the second quarter of 2021 from 68 8 million for the second quarter of 2020 the primary drivers of higher operating expense were higher in transportation costs associated with higher year over year volume growth and route expansion total operating expense is inclusive of a onetime benefit of approximately 1 4 million associated with the employee retention tax credit as part of the american cares act this credit has been added back to our presentation of adjusted ebitda for the quarter as a percentage of net sales adjusted operating expenses were 18 6 for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 28 5 for the second quarter of 2020 operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was 4 7 million compared to operating loss of 25 4 million for the second quarter of 2020 the increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher gross profit partially offset by higher operating cost income tax benefit was 0 8 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 10 8 million for the second quarter of 2020 our gaap net income was 1 1 million or 0 03 income per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of 20 3 million or 0 62 loss per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 on a non gaap basis we had positive adjusted ebitda of 17 2 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to negative adjusted ebitda of 13 7 million for the prior year second quarter adjusted net income was 1 5 million or 0 04 income per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to adjusted net loss of 18 7 million or 0 57 loss per diluted share for the prior year second quarter turning to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity as of june 25 2021 we had total liquidity of 247 7 million comprised of 146 9 million in cash and 100 8 million of availability under our abl facility net debt as of june 25 2021 was approximately 254 5 million inclusive of all cash and cash equivalents at this time due to continued uncertainty regarding the pace of broader economic recovery and the timing of events and travel related business activity we will not be providing guidance for 2021 we hope to provide more color as we gain more clarity on the pace of recovery outlook and the broader post pandemic related environment thank you and at this point we will open it up to questions operator questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of alex slagle with jefferies to may proceed with your question alex slagle jefferies analyst great thank you good morning everyone congrats great quarter maybe you could just provide some more color on how this quick ramp in demand played out and how you re able to capture so much i know it s been a challenge hiring enough drivers and staff to raise the service levels which i imagine possibly also provide even more flow through on margins if you could touch on that dynamic also james f leddy chief financial officer yeah sure so the cadence in the quarter was a little surprising i mean the big cities that had been a lag for us earlier in the year and then all through covid san francisco chicago and new york they all started to open really in mid to late may and so we really started to see as we reported coming out of april we were just shy of 80 of 2019 we really saw the ramp really happened in late may and then june was kind of explosive as new york and the metro areas around the big cities really started to open we had already seen good business activity in earlier in the quarter through the states that were pretty much already opened so that was a big driver and regarding labor it continues to be a challenge but as we stated in our prepared comments our teams really came together and executed delivered our product and our service model to our customers and we were able to start to build the business back to 2019 levels alex slagle jefferies analyst got it so as we think about the recent sales level and the uptick how much of it do you think was due to the spur of openings and pantry loading and the unusually strong period of celebrations and everything going on in may and june just trying to get a sense for what the underlying run rate trend would be as we look out to the 3q and 4q i know there s a lot of moving parts but any color there would be helpful james f leddy chief financial officer sure so as we mentioned recent business activity is very similar to what we saw coming out of june we haven t obviously the second part of q2 is always a little less busy just seasonally than may and june so it s i m sorry the early part of q3 i should say so we haven t seen a significant change in our numbers as we ve come into the more quieter season so we re not providing guidance for the rest of the year but right now we haven t seen a significant change christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and we got to keep reminding ourselves we still i mean we re back to these numbers where i think it s a little better than we expected we knew the pent up demand was there but we still don t have any major events we still don t have tourists we still don t have real business travel so if i had to look in a crystal ball i would say that any of that comes back ok you have a tremendous fourth quarter if it comes back partially you still have a really good quarter and if it just continues as is it s just the money the money is changing where it s being spent so we re still obviously midtown manhattan is still not back downtown san francisco is not back chicago isn t bursting at the seam so the spending at our customers is really just continuing to be in a lot of the suburbs a lot of the downtowns of say new york city downtown and uptown people want to go out and people are getting together i think they re being careful we have all sorts of outdoor dining venues now that have been added to traditional restaurants that never had it so we continue to see the spend the demand and we can only be optimistic as we get through this it could be a little bumpy in the next month or two but we think again going into 22 all that built up convention business and conferences and business travel starts to come back you can t help but get really optimistic alex slagle jefferies analyst congrats help your team get indication thanks james f leddy chief financial officer thanks alex operator our next question comes from the line of kelly bania with bmo capital markets may reserve your questions kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning thanks for taking our questions good morning wondering if you could just unpack the sales for us a little bit just really curious what s maybe sales per customer looks compared to 2019 how much of contribution is coming from new customers just trying to get a gauge of market share gains here or just how you re thinking about that outside of the m a activity christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer sure again kelly it s coming from new customers it s coming from market share i think that our extra efforts to supply service obviously we don t have full employment among the ranks we re not running all our trucks and i m sure we are disappointing some customers but i think that our decision that we need to keep the company together rather than just do tons and tons of more layoffs and try to crank up the numbers even though the numbers are good i think the extra effort in offering service that customers are used to as much as possible obviously we re still short handed allowed us to take market share we have thousands of new customers during the pandemic which i was so pleasantly surprised we continue to see tons of new leases being signed so i would say restaurateurs open restaurants right so they re not going to let a an opportunity like this to grab prime locations pass by and we re starting to see more and more credit applications for key real estate and there s just a lot of demand people as i kind of predict we re going to get tired of cooking i did my wife stole my pans and my knives and said we re going out after so many months of cooking so i think it just continues to build america loves to go out and dine and i think that s what we re seeing and we re nowhere near out of this and where we have vibrant midtowns of all our cities but as you can see the restaurants are starting to really thrive they re short handed i mean nothing is easy right now but the demand is there james f leddy chief financial officer and kelly i would just add that while we don t disclose that level of detail we are approaching we measure the average weekly customers that are actively buying we are very close to approaching our 2019 levels and so that s encouraging kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst okay that s very helpful and then also just thinking about gross margin here it looks like it s about 300 basis points below 2019 levels in this quarter that year just curious if you can talk about the factors that need to happen to get that back to normal if you think that s possible it maybe looks like it s largely just some more pressure in the center of plate area just curious if that s accurate how much of that is just inflation or other factors that could get us back to 2019 gross margin levels james f leddy chief financial officer well i think what you re comparing are not apples to apples so as you recall we adjusted our processing cost and we moved them from opex into gross profit per the sec and we did that earlier in the year so actually when you look on the apples to apples basis because that s about 150 to 170 basis points adjustment our prior gross profit margins were between 25 and 25 5 you really have to rebaseline that to 23 5 to 24 when you re comparing gross profit now to then so we re really maybe 50 to 70 basis points below what you compare on an apples to apples basis and really the difference there is just coming back to our normal volumes some of the revenue performance right now is price and so we re not back to 100 of volume we re getting close and some of it is the efficiencies that come with buying on volume some of it is managing the inflation volatility right now i think we re extremely happy with our team s ability to improve sequential gross profit margin as inflation exploded from q1 into q2 i mean we went from mid single digits to double digit inflation and we drove significant gross profit margin improvement really that was not only managing price that was better buying that was better inventory management really across all of our teams in the company so as we continue to build volume back that will move back toward normal kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst great and maybe early to ask this question but just curious anything you re seeing in the business whether it be wages or other factors that make you think about eventually at some point returning to those pre covid margins and even maybe your longer term margin goals closer to 7 christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it s just so hard to predict the total future kelly but i think the pivot has been how do you do more with less and our team has done an unbelievable job of doing that i mean it s not easy there s too many people working six and seven and 20 hours a day and we don t want that we don t think it s healthy it s burn out but we have learned a lot and we ve learned that we can do more with less i always say nature finds a way and it s the necessity is the mother of invention couldn t be truer of what we ve had to do and continue to do so by being more efficient in asking our customers to cooperate i don t mind this model going forward actually prefer it but the market will dictate if we re going to have to add more service and we re going to see where it goes we re a high touch service model with a long tail in items but we ve kind of shortened it all up for covid for many many reasons and it s a very profitable model kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst thanks for much christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ben klieve with national securities corporation you may proceed with your question ben klieve national securities corporation analyst thank you this is ben klieve now with lake street capital markets thanks for taking my question got a couple questions here first around inflation curious what if anything you can provide about how inflation was really absorbed throughout the supply chain i mean were you guys did you guys see the ability to pass costs on were your customers able to pass those onto the diners and really how quickly was the pricing model able to adapt to inflation as it came throughout the quarter james f leddy chief financial officer yeah thanks for the question ben yes i think just like a lot of industries we ve observed pricing power throughout the value chain from the manufacturers to the distributors to our customers to the through to the end consumers that are accepting it right now i think when you look at inflation it looks so pronounced versus q2 of 2020 but the baseline effect is a big part of that when you compare food inflation at least in our categories to 2019 it is it s less pronounced it s still double what is a normal for our market which is somewhere between 1 and 3 in normal times but it is less pronounced so some of that is the baseline effect that will fall away as you move further away from comping to 2020 we we re still seeing volatility especially in center of the plate although we re starting to see some easing in a number of the center of the plate categories and that s some encouraging signs freight remains elevated and that s a big part of product cost so while freight remains elevated we expect pricing to remain elevated especially in imported products but once again i d go back to there s a lot of pricing power in the market right now really throughout the value chain and until the end consumer stops accepting it we expect it will continue for a little bit here ben klieve national securities corporation analyst got it that s helpful jim jim another question probably directed to you regarding cash flow and inventory build with how dramatic the ramp was in the quarter the obvious need to refill your pantry where did you guys stand at the end of the quarter regarding inventory levels how i don t know it s difficult to forecast out the next couple of quarters but do you think you guys are at a normalized run rate now for inventory levels or do you think you re going to need to ramp that spend up still here in the second half of the year james f leddy chief financial officer well we have a really strong cash position our cash flow during the quarter was really some capex on our building build outs in florida and la we spent some money on acquisitions and then we invested in working capital our team has done an amazing job of managing working capital everything from bringing our dsos down and really effectively managing inventory so we have a significant cash position we can easily fund additional working capital investment i think the bulk of it happened pretty quickly but there ll be some additional investment or some additional capex but as we reported we have 250 million of accessible liquidity between cash and availability on our revolver so we re not really concerned about that we re looking forward to putting that capital to work to generate the ongoing returns for the business going forward ben klieve national securities corporation analyst yes duly noted that certainly liquidity is not an issue right now but that was helpful color i didn t hear much about the texas ramp up can you elaborate on where you stand there both in terms of investments and converting those investments to business christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer was the question about texas s ramp up james f leddy chief financial officer yeah i mean chris can comment as well we made the texas investment pre covid obviously covid has delayed that but actually we re very pleased our texas business has moved toward breakeven faster than we expected some of that is the team there really starting to build the business some of it is texas being a covid state that opened very early so we re pleased with our progress there i mean we d obviously like to do some acquisitions eventually we haven t gotten there yet but chris i don t know if you have anything you want to add about texas christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer well again texas is it s an investment in the future we re continuing to hire salespeople we ve we re looking at multiple opportunities in houston and you have dallas san antonio austin so it s pretty spread out i actually just came back spending a little bit of time on the west coast and in texas to see what our up and coming opportunities i still think texas will be a top three market for chefs so we re basically in the first inning at this point but extremely excited of what we re seeing and what the team is doing and the new people that are joining us ben klieve national securities corporation analyst perfect very helpful thank you both for taking my question congratulations on a good quarter and ill get back into you here christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer thanks james f leddy chief financial officer thanks ben operator our next question comes from the line of todd brooks with c l king associates you may proceed with your question todd brooks c l king associates analyst hey good morning gentlemen what a difference a year makes huh a couple quick questions for you you talked about the natural july august slowdown where you re still with the acquisition still running at kind of 100 of fiscal 19 but if we think about this seasonal slowdown before what could be a fall spike with back to work back to travel again what s this digestion period look like chris you had a couple of interviews during the quarter just outlining the extreme measures that you guys were having to undertake to maintain service levels are we digesting the spike in demand that we ve seen now could you just qualitatively talk about the organization and what you ve been able to do so that maybe we re a little bit better matched to demand trends going into the fall christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer yeah well it s still a big headwind labor in the warehouse and qualified drivers so there was more demand than we could meet so i always hate to turn down some business but we had to have the discipline to say we re going to service our best customers like any other business right you re going to say these are the people that we have the best relationships that are loyal before covid and after covid and customers that maybe just want an interim supplier they re going to go back to where they were buying from before because we could service them but their regular suppliers can t those people kind of fall to the back of the line pure capitalism right you re going to try to service the people that are going to be your customers of the future so the demand is there now it s every day we re hiring every day it s i sent out a memo this morning it s like train but make sure you retain because it costs money to train and it s not an easy market and we want the best people in the industry to work for us because our customers expect the service levels and we go down basements in the big cities and we go upstairs and they re difficult deliveries in our major cities so it s hard work it was a hard job it was hard to find these kind of people with the work ethic and ability to do those jobs before the pandemic so the pandemic actual obviously made it harder but we got great leaders they continue to recruit and as you could see the numbers they re executing obviously we want to get better and i think we do get better every day but i just think the opportunity right now for our growth and take advantage of m a and take market share has never been greater james f leddy chief financial officer and todd i ll just add that as we talk to our operators on a weekly or even daily basis while it s still challenging there are initial green shoots around some easing in certain markets around finding frontline workers so there is a little bit of positivity out there and i would just add that we re doing everything that we had started before the pandemic in terms of consolidating routes we re building new buildings where we re making investments in consolidating our operations and providing a lot of technology based tools to our operators and our sales force and our customers to drive efficiency through the entire value chain that chefs works in so it s not like we re not doing anything against it to offset it it s an ongoing process todd brooks c l king associates analyst very helpful second question you talked about some early evidence of menus broadening out again can we just talk about how early we are in that process i know at the restaurant level a lot of the operators are labor constrained too especially in back of house which may make it harder to do but where do you see where are we in that process of the benefit of broader menus and what that does to case counts christopher pappas founder chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i mean we re getting really close to normal which is amazing we re not there yet because obviously all the banquets are not back and that s a tremendous amount of skus you still don t have the labor obviously in the restaurant industries but so there s still so much upside for us some of our most profitable categories like pastry and all that are still way below category sales in a normal time but i can t complain todd it s amazing to see the creativity at the restaurant like i always say restaurateurs they multitask they have to have a bit of expertise in finance and people management as well as being really creative at putting out food and it s a competitive field as more and more restaurants open people like myself that dine out every day you want variety and i m starting to see it i m starting to see more and more things on the menu because many people eat in the same restaurants weekly so you got to keep it interesting and i think that s why we re seeing it and that s why we re almost back to lines per customer of 2019 i think that s really the only reason it s not back to where it is is because our very large customers are not back yet todd brooks c l king associates analyst okay great and a final question you along this whole process have kind of shared a goal for what you were hoping the exit rate for fiscal 21 would be entering fiscal 22 and obviously we re all surprised by the how robust the revenue recovery was in this quarter just wondering if it s changed your thoughts i think previously you ve talked about an 85 to 90 of 2019 pro forma for the acquisitions as a targeted exit rate but where is the thinking now for what we should look like coming out of the back end of the year james f leddy chief financial officer you know todd you know i hesitate to change our kind of conservatism that in this environment you want to under promise and over deliver certainly versus the reverse i think we are we re quite pleased but once again we re not back to 100 in terms of volume we are getting there we believe we re on the path but look i think we are we still feel that we ll come out of this as a more efficient company operator and continue to get back to the path that we had communicated that we will we ll come out of the year at a run rate very similar adjusted ebitda margin range as we were prior to the pandemic we ve done a couple of acquisitions since then so have to model that in but we don t want to go out and make a bold declarative statement at this point given that there s a couple of variables out there that could still impact business going forward todd brooks c l king associates analyst thats fair enough continued success across the third quarter james f leddy chief financial officer thank you todd operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of todays

10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 craig a lampo senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much good afternoon everyone this is craig lampo amphenol s cfo and i m here together with adam norwitt our ceo we would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2021 conference call our second quarter 2021 results were released this morning i will provide some financial commentary and then adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends and then we ll take some questions as a reminder during the call we may refer to certain non gaap financial measures and may make certain forward looking statements so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information in addition all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted the company closed the second quarter with record sales of 2 654 billion and gaap and adjusted diluted eps of 0 59 and 0 61 respectively sales were up 34 in u s dollars 30 in local currencies and 22 organically compared to the second quarter of 2020 sequentially sales were up 12 in u s dollars and in local currencies and 7 organically orders for the quarter were a record 3 120 billion which was up 58 compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 14 sequentially resulting in a very strong book to bill ratio of 1 18 1 breaking down sales into our two segments the interconnect segment which comprised 96 of our sales was up 34 in u s dollars and 30 in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year our cable segment which comprised 4 of our sales was up 27 in u s dollars and 24 in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes gaap and adjusted operating income were 476 million and 532 million respectively in the second quarter of 2021 gaap operating income includes 55 million of transactions severance restructuring and certain other noncash costs related to the mts acquisition and the company also incurred 34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding mts senior notes that in accordance with gaap was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter and therefore had no impact on the second quarter earnings excluding these acquisition related costs adjusted operating margin was 20 which increased by a strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially the year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the covid 19 pandemic partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year s quarter the sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels partially offset by the impact of mts sensors business which is currently operating below the company s average operating margin from a segment standpoint in the interconnect segment margins were 22 in the second quarter of 2021 which increased from 20 in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially in the cable segment margins were 6 1 which decreased from 9 4 in the second quarter of 2020 and 8 8 in the first quarter these lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions given the dynamic market environment we are very proud of the company s performance our team s ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company s entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture the company s gaap effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17 5 which compared to 20 7 in the second quarter of 2020 on an adjusted basis this effective tax rate was 24 5 in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020 gaap diluted eps was 0 59 an increase of 40 compared to 0 42 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted eps was a record 0 61 an increase of 53 compared to 0 40 in the second quarter of 2020 the company continues to be an excellent generator of cash operating cash flow was 411 million in the second quarter or 109 of adjusted net income and net of capital spending our free cash flow was 307 million or 81 of adjusted net income from a working capital standpoint inventory days days sales outstanding and payable days were 85 71 and 60 days respectively all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range during the quarter the company repurchased 2 5 million shares of common stock for approximately 167 million at an average price of approximately 67 at the end of the quarter total debt was 5 2 billion and net debt was 4 billion total liquidity at the end of the quarter was 2 3 billion which included cash and short term investments on hand of 1 2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities second quarter 2021 gaap ebitda was 597 million and our net leverage ratio was 1 6 times on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the sale of mts test and simulation business net leverage at june 30 2021 would have been 1 3 times as previously discussed due to the pending sale of the mts test and simulation business that business is being reported as a discontinued operation and therefore its expected results are excluded from our q3 guidance in addition in conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business the company will incur certain additional cash tax related and other acquisition related costs in the third quarter which will not be included in income from continuing operations and therefore are not included in our guidance i will now turn the call over to adam who will provide some financial some commentary on current market trends r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer well thank you very much craig and i d like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the call today and i hope that you your family friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far as craig mentioned i m going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter i ll then get into a discussion of the trends and our trends and progress across our served markets i ll make some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter and then of course we ll have time for questions at the end our results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share craig already mentioned our sales grew a very strong 34 in u s dollars and 30 in local currencies reaching a new record of 2 654 billion on an organic basis our sales increased by 22 with growth driven in particular by the automotive military industrial and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company s acquisition program we re very pleased to have booked record orders in the quarter of 3 120 billion and that represented a very strong book to bill of 1 18 1 despite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures we were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20 in the quarter this was a 200 basis point increase from last year s levels and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially adjusted diluted eps grew a very significant 53 from prior year to another new record of 0 61 and just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution and finally the company generated operating and free cash flow of 411 million and 307 million respectively in the second quarter i just can t emphasize enough how proud i am of our organization around the world these results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we have continued to perform well amid what is a very dynamic and challenging environment very pleased that in the quarter we closed on the acquisition of unlimited services unlimited is based in oconto wisconsin but also with operations in mexico and has annual sales of approximately 50 million this is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market primarily with a particular focus on heavy vehicles the addition of unlimited broadens our already strong position in value add interconnect products that are integrated into a wide array of industrial applications as we welcome this outstanding new team to amphenol i remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company in fact our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company now turning to our served markets i just would comment once again how pleased we are that the company s broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create real value for us we believe that ultimately this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while also giving us broad exposure to leading technologies and the innovations of those technologies wherever they may arise across the broad scope of the electronics industry now turning to the military market the military market represented 11 of our sales in the quarter and as expected sales grew a strong 45 from the covid impacted prior year second quarter and were up 30 organically and this was really driven by broad strength across virtually all segments of the military market on a sequential basis sales increased by 12 also very strong as we look into the third quarter we remain we expect sales to remain at these current elevated levels and we continue to be very excited by the strength of our position in the military market and that position is really based upon our industry leading breadth of high technology interconnect and now sensor products together with our support of essentially all major military programs this gives us great confidence for our long term performance in this important area the commercial air market represented 2 of our sales in the quarter sales grew by 7 versus prior year really with the benefit of the contributions of our recent acquisitions on an organic basis sales were down by about 14 as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience declines in demand for new aircraft production sequentially however our sales did increase by better than expected 19 and that s really from the benefit of the mts acquisition as well as some organic progress as we look ahead we expect a slight seasonal moderation in sales in the third quarter which we would typically see in commercial air and regardless of the ongoing difficult environment our team working in this commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company s strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems that are integrated into those planes as personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic we look forward to jet manufacturers beginning to expand their production levels the industrial market represented 27 of our sales in the quarter and our performance in the second quarter in industrial was really much stronger than expected with sales increasing by 54 in u s dollars and 28 organically this growth was broad based across most areas of the worldwide industrial market and was driven in particular by organic strength in the transportation battery and heavy electric vehicle marine and energy generation segments together with the contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the past year on a sequential basis sales increased by a very strong 26 from the first quarter really with the benefit of acquisitions as well as strong organic performance looking into the third quarter we expect sales to remain at these elevated levels despite what would typically be a seasonally lower quarter i can t say enough how proud i am of our team working in the industrial market and we ve had a long term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions and that strategy has positioned us strongly with industrial customers around the world who are accelerating their adoption of electronics the acquisition of unlimited services further bolsters our leading value add capabilities in this important market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come the automotive market represented 20 of our sales in the quarter and i can just say that sales were higher than our expectations growing a very strong 134 in u s dollars and 117 organically as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market in particular we once again drove very strong growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles this quarter which confirms again for us our global team s long term efforts at designing in high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next generation platforms despite an increase in production disruptions among our automotive customers due to the widely reported global supply chain issues we were able to achieve a small sequential increase in our sales which was a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter no doubt about it though there continues to be a range of widely reported supply chain challenges that are arising within the automotive industry and this is impacting overall demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world accordingly as we look toward the third quarter we do expect a modest sequential decline in our sales i remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market they continue to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year s reduced production levels while expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is still facing we look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future turning to the mobile devices market that market represented 10 of our sales in the quarter our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4 in u s dollars and 6 organically as declines in handsets and laptops more than offset growth in wearables i would just remind you that our last year s second quarter did include a significant sequential recovery and really a catch up from the covid impacted first quarter of 2020 which made the comparison versus prior year a little more challenging sequentially our sales fell by 6 from the first quarter which was modestly better than our expectations looking to the third quarter we now expect an approximately 25 increase in sales from these second quarter levels as we benefit from the seasonally typical higher demand in the mobile device market as customers launch a range of new products while mobile devices remains the most volatile of amphenol s end markets our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in the second half of 2021 and beyond our leading array of antennas interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices thereby positioning us well for the long term in this exciting market the mobile networks market represented 5 of our sales in the quarter sales were flat to prior year and down 4 organically as sales to both oems and wireless service providers moderated on a sequential basis however our sales increased by 5 compared to the first quarter which was in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter and as we look toward the third quarter we expect a further increase in sales as mobile networks customers ramp up their investments in next generation networks our team around the world continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts at expanding our position in such next generation networks and the equipment that populates them around the world and as customers ramp up these investments of such advanced systems we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers the information technology and data communications market increased by 21 in the second quarter sales in the second quarter rose by 5 in u s dollars and 3 organically from the very significant levels in last year s second quarter our strength this quarter was driven in particular by robust sales to web service providers which was partially offset by some weakness in sales to networking equipment oems sequentially our sales grew a very strong 20 from the first quarter which significantly outperformed our original expectations looking now into the third quarter we expect sales to increase modestly from these very high levels we remain very encouraged by the company s outstanding position in the global it datacom market our oem and web service provider customers around the world continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power in turn our team is singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in it datacom with industry leading high speed power and fiber optic interconnect products and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come turning finally to the broadband market this market represented 4 of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 12 from prior year and were flat organically as we benefited from our recent acquisition of cablecon on a sequential basis sales increased by 7 from the first quarter which was a bit lower than we had anticipated coming into the quarter for the third quarter we expect sales to moderate from current levels as operators digest the really high levels of spending that they have exhibited over the recent quarters and regardless of this more muted outlook we continue to look forward to supporting our broadband service operator customers around the world all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high speed data applications to homes and businesses now turning to our outlook and i would just note that given the current dynamic market environment and of course assuming no new material disruptions from the covid 19 pandemic as well as constant exchange rates in the third quarter we expect sales in the range of 2 640 billion to 2 700 billion and adjusted diluted eps in the range of 0 60 to 0 62 this would represent sales growth of 14 to 16 and adjusted diluted eps growth of 9 to 13 compared to the third quarter of last year i remain confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability i had to say that our entire organization remains committed to delivering long term and sustainable value all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world and most importantly i d like to take this opportunity to once again thank the entire global amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter and with that operator we d be very happy to take any questions that there may be questions and answers operator thank you our first question is from wamsi mohan of bank of america sir your line is now open wamsi mohan bank of america analyst yes thank you adam can you talk about what you re seeing as far as inventory levels go particularly in the channel in industrial where you expected low teens growth quarter on quarter you grew almost double that if you could give us some sense of where things stand that would be great thank you r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer thank you very much wamsi i mean we ve talked about this in the past that we don t have necessarily perfect visibility into the inventory in particular of our oem and service provider customers but as far as the channel is concerned we have not seen any real changes in the inventory levels in fact it appears that for the vast majority of our distributors in particular with respect to the industrial market they want to ship it out as soon as we can get it to them there s clearly a very significant end demand across really many segments of the industrial market and i mentioned earlier that we saw growth across virtually every segment of the industrial market and whether that was in marine applications in industrial batteries and electrification of industrial vehicles and transportation heavy equipment factory automation i mean we saw even growth in areas like oil and gas where we haven t seen so much growth in the past instrumentation where we ve continued to see very robust performance over a long time period so i wouldn t say that across the industrial market we ve seen necessarily any worrisome inventory trends i think that more broadly across the whole company again maybe the only area where you hear talk of inventory issues acutely is that there s not a lot of inventory of cars on lots right now and so i don t know what that means through the whole chain but for sure dealer inventories of vehicles are extremely low by any measure and i think there s a lot of supply chain issues that are going on around the automotive industry that i m sure others will ask about and many have spoken about and reported about but by and large we see inventory as relatively healthy operator thank you now our next question is from amit daryanani of evercore sir your line is now open amit daryanani evercore analyst perfect thanks a lot and good afternoon i guess my question is around the supply chain dynamics as well and i d love to understand adam how is this a how is this playing out for amphenol from operations from a p l basis what s the impact on your revenue and margin that you may have from the supply chain issues and then beyond the operational challenges i d love to understand does this create an opportunity for you over time to win new customers to have new share gain and if so where are those which segments are those opportunities bigger r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer yes well thank you very much amit look i mean the current supply chain environment is certainly not for the faint of heart and i think our agility as an organization that unique entrepreneurship of what we call amphenolians around the world in many ways is an ideal approach to deal with a supply chain environment that is so broadly disrupted and where new things pop up every day and so could we have shift a little bit more in certain cases i m sure we probably could have did it cost us money in many cases i m sure it did to put a number on that it s not easy for us to do but i can tell you that it s more than 0 and i think for sure the cost of the supply chain whether that s freight and logistics whether that s the cost of commodities the availability of certain things a lot of stuff went on over the course of this quarter there was floods in germany there were challenges with various countries there were some covid related things that were happening in particular in places like southeast asia so our general managers all 125 of them each of them had to deal with a unique set of challenges and they had to tailor make their approach to exactly what they were facing it wasn t that we had to sort of process all of this in the sort of corporate wayback machine and then issue a bunch of edicts to say here s what we should do it was really dealt with on an individual case by case basis in the moment and that kind of moment by moment management is a real premium in a time like this and as it relates to your second question or the second part of your question for sure if we are satisfying the needs of our customers better than our competitors are doing in a time when they need us the most when they have robust demand from their customers when they re facing a much broader array of supply chain challenges because fortunate for us we don t buy a ton of semiconductors and we buy a little bit here and there but we have a lot of customers who are facing really existential kind of shortages in certain semiconductors and when we can help them for example they re redesigning a system to change a chip that they can t get supportive they re redesigning that and all of a sudden that redesign requires them to completely redesign an interconnect system our team does it in one case we did this in five days a customer came to us said they had to totally change the design of their system otherwise they wouldn t have a chip for a year they redesigned it our team went completely redesigned the system five days later sent them samples and they came to us with big orders thereafter so those are the kind of situations that are popping up more and more and i think long term customers don t forget if you were there for them when they needed you the most operator thank you now our next question is from jim suva of citigroup investment research sir your line is now open jim suva citigroup investment research analyst thank you and congratulations to you and your team for all the hard work during the challenging times i wanted to ask a question kind of on raw material and input costs and of course we ve seen them all kind of skyrocket does that mean your salespeople need to be more active or change terms or do you have like indexing into your contracts when raw materials go up a lot i assume some of your contracts are very long term in nature or do you hedge it out with some financial instruments i m just kind of curious because it s pretty unprecedented that copper steel aluminum resins and caustic have recently been moving a lot thank you so much r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer well thank you so much jim and no doubt about it i mean there are certain dynamics which one could call unprecedented and i think amid that unprecedented inflationary environment on certain commodities we were able to deliver exactly 20 operating adjusted operating margins here in the quarter which i think is a testament to the hard work of our team around the world each of whom is facing a different set of challenges but no doubt about it if you re a general manager in amphenol we don t tie their hands and say you re only in charge of this or you re only in charge of that they have every lever to pull in order to ultimately meet their obligations to reach their performance objectives and so that means when all of your input prices have gone up you re going to figure a way out of that and sometimes when they go up very quickly that makes it hard and no doubt about it we ve seen relatively quick increases in a lot of different input costs and again not just commodities but also the cost of freight and other logistics and that sometimes there can be a little bit of a delay if that comes in so fast but by and large our interactions with customers the sort of contracts or programs that we have with them generally they re not indexed and as you know we generally don t hedge either and the reason we don t hedge is because then you re kind of detached from the reality of the moment when you want to have discussions with customers and those discussions with customers for sure are ongoing because when you have such significant increases in the input costs we re going to do everything in our power to offset those costs with our own management redesigning the products changing suppliers pitting our suppliers against each other reducing overhead reducing every aspect but sometimes there is only the option to pass that price that cost increase on to your customer we do that very thoughtfully every market is a little bit different how that works but our customers know that we don t do that lightly we don t take that initiative lightly but ultimately you sometimes do have to pass the price on and i can tell you our sales teams around the world together with our operating teams they re working hand in hand to make sure that we ve done everything possible before we go into a customer and ask for them to share in the pain of these increases but when you have such severe and sudden increases ultimately then pricing does become very important and i think our team is working that it s hard work there s no doubt about it but i think our team is making really good progress in that front and again it s very market dependent it s very region dependent but there s no one i would want more than a general manager who knows her business front to back to be the one who sits in front of a customer and decide is this now the right moment to ask that customer to share in the challenges that we are facing operator thank you now our next question is from mark delaney from goldman sachs sir your line is now open mark delaney goldman sachs analyst yes good afternoon and thanks for taking the question i was hoping to talk about mts and perhaps you can share some of your early impressions of the company and what opportunities you may be seeing to not only sell the mts sensors on a stand alone basis but combine it into full solutions or some of your other product lines and on a related note with mts craig i think you said the margins are still below corporate average maybe talk about when you see that getting back in line with the amphenol average thank you r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer well thanks so much mark i ll let craig talk about the margins in a second but i can just tell you our early impressions of the company are very very positive i mean we said and i think i mentioned last quarter that mts the sensors business is run by a team that we know well and in particular the person leading that organization is just a phenomenal phenomenal leader who has an extraordinary organization underneath him and the fact the way that they have embraced being part of amphenol is just truly rewarding for all of us in the company we ve known them for a long time this was not a new acquaintance that we made through this process but rather we ve known them all the way back to when they were part of a family owned company that ultimately mts acquired our customers have received this extremely well we have become more important to customers across the markets whether that be industrial military commercial air and automotive i continue to be just amazed by the uniqueness and the depth of the technology that we acquired in this business force vibration sensors pressure sensors position just a variety of products that really operate at the harshest of environments and with the highest of performance in terms of being able to sell more complete solutions i can tell you that there s already early activities real collaborative activities ongoing across the company with people within our interconnect businesses working together getting to know the mts sensors organization creating the sort of fiber of the relationships that ultimately can lead long term to really collaborative success in the various markets that we serve so all early returns for mts including their absolute performance which is coming out a little bit better than we had thought in the quarter all early returns are favorable and i ll let craig maybe comment specifically on the margin craig a lampo senior vice president and chief financial officer yes mark no thanks for the question on the margin as you mentioned i did i have mentioned in the past that they re mid teens profitability when we acquired them as adam mentioned we re just really happy with the progress they ve made in kind of all aspects honestly of the business from a profitability perspective we always say that profit ultimately is really just the byproduct of the value that you bring to kind of your customers and there s no doubt that this company brings a lot of value to all their customers and we believe that there is plenty of opportunity throughout the business to be able to increase that profitability in the business i would tell you that in the even in the second quarter i d say we have seen green shoots i guess of progress in that area the time it will take ultimately to get them to the company average or beyond is certainly time will be we told in the future here on that and we re not necessarily going to try to estimate that at this time because every acquisition is different and the tasks that need to happen take differentiating amount of time but i would tell you that the second quarter here the first quarter that we ve had them as part of amphenol we ve certainly seen some progress in that area and certainly areas of opportunity in the future and we re i would say that we re even more optimistic and we were optimistic early on that they will be able to ultimately get to that target that we have for them to be at the company average and and hopefully beyond in the future operator thank you now our next question is from william stein of truist securities elliott smith truist securities analyst hi this is elliott smith on for will i wanted to ask about the mobile devices end market i know it can be quite volatile quarter to quarter but can you speak to what you are seeing now and potentially over the next several quarters in terms of the end market content trajectory and potential growth r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer thanks very much elliott i think you correctly termed that it is a very volatile market on a quarter to quarter basis and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks our year over year the year over year performance of the market was significantly impacted by the strength that we had a year ago in the second quarter which was really a catch up from the significant covid impacts that we saw in the first quarter of 2020 this is not a market i like to get out ahead of my skis on in terms of several quarters out and giving a prognosis but what i can say is that our position in the mobile market is an extremely strong position we continue to have a unique ability to react quickly to customers when they need us the most and that includes sometimes when our competitors aren t able to support the customers in particular when they re launching new products our guidance for the third quarter being up about 25 or so on a quarter to quarter basis is a strong outlook and i think not inconsistent if you look over a long time period with the kind of second quarter to third quarter trajectory what it will be in the quarters thereafter again i m not going to get ahead of my skis in giving a prognosis on mobile devices over the long term but the content opportunity as you say there s no reason to think that the content opportunity with these devices as they become more complicated as they have different feature sets as they support different types of communication standards in them those have usually been in the past strong drivers of content in mobile devices and we have no reason to believe that that would change in the future operator thank you now our next question is from joe giordano from cowen sir your line is now open joe giordano cowen analyst can you guys hear me r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer yes hi joe joe giordano cowen analyst hi good afternoon guys just curious on it datacom i mean you guys came in so much stronger than your initial view last quarter just curious was that how would you categorize that from like market dynamics just the overall spending in the industry was significantly better were you guys picking up specific share anywhere how would you categorize that outperformance relative to your initial view r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer joe i guess it s a combination of sort of all of the above our team continues to do a phenomenal job in it datacom in particular a phenomenal job enabling web service providers who is spending and you can call them web service providers like i do you can call them cloud providers whatever and the fact is these service providers who are making meaningful and very meaningful investments in high speed data processing in order to enable the explosion of traffic that all of them are seeing and our team has just done an amazing job of reacting to that increase in demand and we did that over the course of last year when it was even more critical and we talked about this several times last year that our growth in it datacom over the course of 2020 i think growing close to 50 for example sequentially in the second quarter and reacting to the literal explosion of data traffic resulting from all the video meetings and remote work and remote school and all of that we made a lot of good friends in that market by stepping up and really enabling our customers when they needed us the most at the same time if anything we ve seen an acceleration in new product development as our customers look to really push the limits of the bandwidth of their systems and that involves new interconnect solutions that ultimately can enable that high speed it involves new power solutions that can help the efficiency i mean there are so many dynamics that are going on across it datacom all of which converge on the need for higher performance interconnect products and whether that s web service providers and video over the internet whether that s even like cryptocurrency and the processor power that s being used in support of the crypto market i mean these are all things that are just driving extraordinary demand for high speed and high efficiency high speed interconnect and high efficiency power interconnect and i can just tell you our team working in both of those areas has done a bang up job to react to this to scale our capacity quickly in the face of really unexpected levels of demand and this quarter was another example of that we certainly did not expect a 20 sequential growth i think we came into the quarter thinking kind of mid single digits and that requires you to perform on that it requires you to have enough people in machines and automation and tooling and factory floor space and ready source of materials and i think our team just did a great job of reacting in the moment here operator thank you now our next question is from chris snyder of ubs sir your line is now open chris snyder ubs analyst thank you so industrial and auto have seen a pretty massive inflection in end market out growth over the last year or so it sounds like there s not been much or any supply chain tailwinds here so is this outgrowth inflection is it driven by share gains or just an acceleration in the electronics revolution so to speak and if so would we expect a structurally higher level of end market outgrowth relative to what we re seeing in the years leading up to covid r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer yes i mean look i don t know how it s going to look in the future but for sure over the course of the last year and we shouldn t forget q2 of last year was almost the nuclear winter for the automotive industry but over the last year our team working in industrial working in automotive has clearly done an outstanding job of supporting customers when they needed us the most and in certain cases doing that because some competitors could not rise to the occasion so i think that there has been for us some outperformance relative to the industry i think as well we clearly have seen an acceleration of the adoption of electronics across the automotive industry across the many many segments of the industrial market there is kind of electronification of everything if you will and it s not just evs and it s not just batteries for those evs we were really seeing so many examples of traditionally mechanical fuel based hydraulic converting to an electronic control electronic functionality and each time that happens that s a new inflection point whereby if we can step in with the right types of interconnect products the right types of sensors leading edge products if we can do that in a timely fashion we can have it available for the customers when they need it when they re seeing also an increase in their end demand that positions us very well and so i think all of the factors that you mentioned have all come together in a very positive fashion to ultimately lead to us having the growth that we realized this quarter as well as the positive outlook that we see in the third quarter and i would hope also beyond now what does that mean for the long term typically the adoption of electronics is a one way ratchet it s not that people adopt a new electronic system and then one day go back to a mechanical system that s not really how the evolution of electronics operates and so i think long term it gives me some encouragement to see that there has been an acceleration and that kind of step function adoption of electronics you would hope would continue to create opportunities for the long term operator thank you now our next question is from david kelley from jefferies sir your line is now open david kelley jefferies analyst hi good morning adam and craig i always ask the automotive question but the organic growth really stands out so you referenced electrification as a driver we re seeing ev auto sales really start to inflect and actually reach some scale now is there any way to quantify the contribution for you and then even taking a step back just more broadly in auto just curious if you re seeing any customers start to build some inventories you referenced the low dealer inventory level so with some planning for the medium term just curious if you re seeing that in the market r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer yes i mean look i think the organic growth was pretty special david so i don t blame you for asking another automotive question again i always say you could teach the master class here on automotive but yes 117 organic growth albeit to a quarter that was a pretty rough quarter a year ago but still it was really a very very special performance and our automotive team is very proud and justifiably proud of what they were able to achieve and relative to the contribution of ev i can tell you that if you can imagine it the growth of ev was substantially higher than the growth that i just mentioned of that 117 and without giving a specific amount of the total of our ev business it s bigger than it used to be and it s meaningful it s a meaningful business it clearly is an area of success for the company and it s one that we look forward to realizing the benefits from for many years to come relative to inventory i would actually say that what we ve seen more of in the automotive market than stockpiling of inventory is we ve seen customers not wanting to take our product because they all of a sudden can t get the appropriate semiconductor to finish the vehicle and so we ve seen more what i would call push outs of deliveries as opposed to customers just throwing a bunch of stuff in their warehouses now could there be some buildup of component inventory in certain places there could be and we may not see it perfectly but what we have seen for sure and that went through the course of the quarter is customers saying well we re going to have to shut down our factory for a couple of weeks and thus we don t need your stuff right now and we ve had to react quickly to that and that s actually meant that for us we ended up with maybe a little bit more of our own finished goods a little bit more of our own work in progress than we would have liked in the course of the quarter and still with that we were able to achieve that 117 organic growth so i don t know that that s there s a big buildup there could be pockets of it but the more obvious thing that we saw over the quarter were these pushouts from customers who couldn t get matching components to make the car operator thank you next question is from joseph spak from rbc capital markets sir your line is now open joseph spak rbc capital markets analyst thank you i too i m going to follow up on automotive sorry so it doesn t sound like you think inventory is a big issue it did sound like you maybe think you took a little bit of share and obviously ev is helping and i know even when we compare to global production your geographic exposure probably helped you a little bit because the larger recovery in north america and europe i guess what i m the other factor i m wondering about is is there a material content per vehicle difference between let s call it high value vehicles like a full size truck and a lower value vehicle because that can obviously also help and as we start thinking about next year maybe some of the volume recovery is more in those lower volume vehicles r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer yes well joe again no problem to get another auto question i should say that you and david could probably co teach the master class together but look one maybe thing i would mention you alluded to regional in automotive and actually we saw really strong performance across all of the regions where we operate and i would tell you actually that our business now regionally is more balanced than ever before is roughly equal size between asia and europe and just a tick lower in north america so and that s quite a transformation if you think about it over a decade when at one point our business was kind of 2 3 in europe and maybe 1 5 in north america and the rest in asia so we ve made really great progress in asia and i would also say that in asia we ve made great progress also in the electrification in evs where our team has just done a fabulous job relative to your question do luxury cars have more content for example then a lower end car i think the answer to that is absolutely yes that s always been the case i think that will always be the case but one of the differences that we have seen and that s not just the difference of this year or last year but maybe over the last kind of half a decade or so is we have seen that more and more automakers are equipping their lower end cars with a greater degree of electronic functionality than they did in the past the traditional approach for automakers was to just stuff their high end cars with every possible feature to test out electronics in those cars to put the newest thing there first and then maybe it would trickle down to the low end more fleet type cars or maybe it wouldn t but i tell you you get any car of any size now and it s going to have features in it that you never would have imagined before even in the smallest kind of fiat 500 or something like that you re going to see just a real array of electronics functionality so for sure 100 000 car is always going to have more content than the 30 000 car but i don t know that the intensity of electronics in that 100 000 is so many multiples more than it is on that maybe 30 000 car and in the past that would have been quite a different intensity of the electronic value in the car so what does that mean for the long term are companies selling more high value trucks and luxury cars today and maybe they ll sell more low value cars in the future i doubt i don t have a good read on but i think there s electronics opportunities across all of these types of cars operator thank you now our next question is from samik chatterjee from jpmorgan sir your line is now open samik chatterjee jpmorgan analyst hi thank you and good afternoon adam craig i guess i have a more quick one just trying to get a better handle on the difference between orders and your revenue guide for the next quarter i mean when i look at the difference now it s about 400 million last quarter i think when you guided the difference was about 300 million so just kind of wondering is that more of a supply concern in securing supply or are you getting orders with longer lead times from your customers just kind of getting trying to get a better handle of what you re trying to bake in there and if it s conservative at all and then i think in conjunction with that i think one thing that i wanted to understand is broadly across your businesses if you just kind of feeling that the supply constraints are getting tougher or are they getting easier to navigate at this point thank you r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer thanks samik well first i guess maybe we have a little bit different numbers in automotive than what you mentioned i think our automotive business at 20 of sales it works out to more than 0 5 billion in the quarter and with the guidance that i ve given it wouldn t be so dissimilar in the third quarter so i m not sure the numbers that you referred to relative to supply constraints are they getting better worse staying the same i don t know i guess it feels about the same i wouldn t say that it feels that much worse and there are a few things that maybe do feel a little bit worse like freight the cost of freight is not that great so the price of a container from asia to the u s and it s not that that s a huge impact on us but once in a while you do that or your customer does that and those have gotten quite a bit more expensive over the recent times even just the availability of that there s also been a few sort of funky things that have happened like there were some floods in germany which were really tragic and we feel for the people of germany that suffered through these just sudden catastrophic floods and there s a germany has a pretty decent size electronic supply chain of vendors and various things like that and we ve seen a disruption or two there i talked about the covid related restrictions that are happening a little bit in southeast asia so i don t know that i would say it s getting easier that s for sure operator thank you next question is from luke junk from baird sir your line is now open luke junk baird analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my question i had a big picture question this afternoon and it s about the competitive landscape in your auto business as we move into what s increasingly an ev world you ve made if we look over last 10 20 years great inroads growing in auto in what has been a combustion rule of course where there are a lot of incumbent players in a world where there are no true incumbent with respect to ev powertrains how does that change the competitive landscape for amphenol both in terms of your view of the opportunity set and ultimately how aggressively you pursue that business r adam norwitt president and chief executive officer well i mean the last part of your question i ll answer first which is i think we ve pursued this business very aggressively over a long time period we shouldn t forget that the whole concept of a high voltage system in a car is not new in fact our teams have been working on development of specific automotive capable high voltage interconnect systems for i don t know the whole time i ve been ceo and i ve been ceo for nearly 13 years now so i think that s not a new development i don t think evs are a new thing hybrids are a new thing but they re growing and i think they re reaching i don t know if you want to call it an inflection point someone mentioned that term earlier but for sure the adoption of these vehicles is accelerating on a global basis even if they still represent a relatively modest proportion of the overall vehicle market i mean the vast majority of cars sold today are still combustion engine cars but to your point we have i think in evs a proposition maybe that we didn t have in traditional automotive which is that we ve been making high voltage connectors for a very very long time i mean if you think about the legacy of amphenol over the nearly nine decades that our company has been in business we were early on a leader in the innovation and development of power interconnect that s used in military aerospace industrial applications and that came with unique proprietary technologies in particular around the efficient and safe transmission of high voltage power across an interconnect system that requires a very unique contact technology that we have developed over many many years and so early on and when i say early on this is a dozen years ago or more when we were really working early on in these hybrid electric vehicles we were already repackaging our high voltage interconnect technologies from the military and industrial into more of an automotive type interconnect interface and otherwise and so that gave us a very strong position so it s not new to us to be making high voltage products and to the extent that there are more traditional incumbents who are pure automotive companies who may not have had that rich legacy of high power high voltage interconnect we could on occasion have an advantage now granted they have an advantage with the breadth that they work in that market so it s not that this is kind of a clear path to world domination in the ev market i mean we have a lot of competition and we respect them a great deal but if anything i think our outperformance in automotive over many years and in particular over the recent years there has been a not insignificant component of that which has been us realizing the benefits of our long term position in high voltage products operator excuse me participants thank you for holding and sorry about the technical issue we now have mr craig lampo on line craig a lampo senior vice president and chief financial officer yes hello operator do we have any more questions please operator thank you for that mr lampo as of now we don t have any questions on queue i will turn it back over to amphenol for any closing remarks r adam norwitt

today are in us dollars unless otherwise indicated with that i turn the call over to harley harley finkelstein president thanks katie and good morning shopify s momentum continued in our second quarter as strong commerce trends prevailed and more merchants joined and succeeded on our platform in fact gmv reached its highest level ever as physical stores in more regions reopen their doors in the early days of the post pandemic recovery and as buyers continue to value the convenience that online tools bring to shopping case in point in places that have begun to reopen like the uk gmv grew faster than our overall gmv in the quarter year over year indicating that online and in store commerce are no longer mutually exclusive and while we did start to see a shift in some consumer spend back to services and recreation toward the end of the quarter which we expected all regions remain at gmv levels above pre covid levels this may be why shopify remains the go to platform for entrepreneurs around the world to launch and to grow their businesses as they sell directly to their customers merchants using shopify are exceptionally well prepared to make commerce happen on every surface area that it needs to whether it s online in store or through your favorite apps our brick and mortar merchants illustrated this as they adapted to the accelerated shift to digital commerce in 2020 and are now navigating the early stages of returning to in store selling retail point of sale gmv is nearly back to pre covid levels as a percentage of overall gmv even on these higher gmv levels as physical stores reopen and merchants are better equipped with our upgraded hardware and software more locations adopted point of sale pro in our second quarter for its modern omnichannel features like buy online pick up in store which was adopted by 63 of brick and mortar merchants in english speaking geographies at the end of june this is up from just 2 in february last year social commerce is another way that merchants are expanding their presence and succeeding in fact in q2 year over year gmv growth from facebook and google channels were several times that of the online store with consumers spending more time than ever on apps we continue to expand key partnerships we deepened our partnership with google in q2 making it easier for our merchants to sell on google through a simplified onboarding process and extending our accelerated checkout shop pay to all us merchants selling on google whether they use shopify or not buyers love using shop pay to check out the speed and ease of making a purchase strengthens the relationship between merchants and their buyers which is why we are bringing shop pay to more services shop pay is available now to us merchants on facebook and will be available to shopify and non shopify merchants selling on facebook and google in the us later this year we re seeing early traction for shop pay on facebook and instagram with more buyers opting in and a larger share of gmv through these services since we announced the integration in february we remain on track to add shopify payments as the processor for all shopify merchant transactions on facebook properties by year end as global retail e commerce sales are expected to continue shifting to mobile devices mobile shopping from shopify merchants has to keep getting easier and more fun if they re to compete our online shopping assistant shop is built for easy shopping on mobile with buyer friendly features like order tracking and shop pay starting in q2 merchants can manage how they show up in shop by customizing their store profile in the app they can also track the impact of shop on their business from a new analytics dashboard while driving repeat purchases from customers through automated marketing tools shop now supports in app purchases allowing customers to add to cart and check out with shop pay within the app in q2 we also introduced new filters for discovery on shop for local businesses lgbtq owned businesses and indigenous owned businesses at the end of q2 shop had more than 118 million registered users including both buyers that have opted into shop pay as well as users of the app of which approximately 23 million were monthly active users at the end of june shop pay had facilitated nearly 30 billion in cumulative gmv since its launch in 2017 the increasing complexity that comes with selling everywhere makes shopify and our suite of solutions even more valuable as a result merchants are making greater use of our merchant solutions shopify capital is a great example we funded more merchants than ever this past quarter and directed more capital to them than ever a record 363 million this is 137 more funding than in last year s second quarter and represents record growth for us in capital bringing us to over 2 3 billion in cumulative capital funded since we launched it in 2016 not only does shopify capital help fuel our merchants growth our data tells us that merchants that accept capital stay with shopify longer as they succeed on the platform and take more of shopify s other solutions namely shopify shipping apps themes and domains and maybe most importantly extending capital when their business needs it reinforces the trusted relationship that we have with our merchants one that goes beyond what they have with their bank or any other vendor when we talk about shopify s flywheel this is exactly what we mean shopify shipping and shopify fulfillment network complete the cart to door experience for our merchants buyers in q2 label volume for shopify shipping increased quarter over quarter and we focused on transitioning merchants who are a good fit from shopify shipping to shopify fulfillment network to benefit from our full service fulfillment offering merchants and their buyers are also making use of our newer merchant solutions in june we made our buy now pay later product shop pay installments available to all eligible merchants in the us with the product automatically enabled for new merchants signing up for shopify payments and simple self serve onboarding available to existing merchants while early gmv transacting through shop pay installments more than tripled in q2 over the prior quarter as more buyers are using our product to check out we are pretty excited about the potential here over the long term and more merchants are signing on to shopify balance which is in early access until later this year shopify plus had another great quarter as large brands continue to turn to shopify plus to help make the complex simple in q2 more merchants on standard plans upgraded to shopify plus and more international brands joined shopify plus to grow their businesses the list of brands that launched in shopify plus recently is stellar global entertainment platform netflix luxury fashion designer diane von furstenberg world renowned winery robert mondavi people footwear from well known shoe company aldo global fashion brand and a huge personal favorite of mine james perse indie and vintage clothing retailer modcloth famous coffee brands stumptown coffee and peet s coffee children s clothing brand justice and more cpg brands from nestle and mccormick shopify is leveraging the entire ecosystem to create a global retail operating system for the future of commerce more than 22 000 viewers tuned in to this year s virtually held developer focused partner conference shopify unite where we announced major upgrades to our platform on which we are building the internet s commerce infrastructure these include online store 2 0 a flexible and customizable storefront so our merchants can build their stores quickly without touching code while giving max code access to developers allowing them to extend and customize both the storefront and the checkout powerful new apis and developer tooling that gives our partners and merchants more creative control without sacrificing speed or scalability a faster and more powerful checkout designed to give each individual shop the ability to handle as much sales volume as we serve across all of shopify at the peak of black friday cyber monday in 2020 and a scalable payments platform enabling partners to build third party payment gateways as apps we also announced a 0 rev share for app and theme store developers on their first 1 million of revenue annually starting in q3 2021 making it even more attractive for tech talent to want to build the future of commerce with shopify our teams at shopify have been heads down innovating over the past year to bring the platform updates announced at shopify unite to life their incredible work has formed an even stronger commerce infrastructure for developers to build on we look forward to seeing the hard problems they will help us solve for our merchants as we double down on our efforts to make shopify the best place to build our partner ecosystem continues to grow in q2 the number of partners sending business to us continued to expand as over 46 000 partners referred at least one merchant on shopify over the past 12 months up 53 year over year as the post pandemic future emerges it is clear that retail has changed forever shopify is making sure those changes are for the better entrepreneurship remains strong and opportunities to thrive in a modern retail era with the right tools are boundless amy shapero chief financial officer thanks harley merchant success combined with sustained e commerce tailwinds and strong execution by shopify contributed to a fantastic second quarter revenue in our second quarter was up 57 year over year to 1 1 billion marking the first time shopify exceeded 1 billion in a single quarter this was driven by strong performance from both our subscription solutions and merchant solutions segments subscription solutions revenue increased 70 over the same period last year to 334 2 million largely due to strong growth in monthly recurring revenue mrr growth accelerated to 67 year over year to 95 1 million as more merchants join the platform and the number of retail locations using pos pro increased remember mrr in the second quarter of last year was impacted by the 90 day free trial on standard plans offered until may 31 and that we experienced a double cohort effect in our third quarter last year as users from the 90 day free trial and 14 day free trial converted into paying merchants in that quarter compared with q1 mrr added in q2 was more normalized as economies reopen shopify plus contributed 25 2 million or 26 of mrr compared with 29 in q2 of 2020 when standard merchant mrr was impacted by the extended free trial i just mentioned while shopify plus mrr grew significantly this past quarter non plus mrr grew faster benefiting from a significantly higher number of merchants on standard plans joining the platform in 2020 and new incremental revenue from our shopify pos pro subscription offering over the same period last year merchant solutions revenue grew 52 over q2 2020 to 785 2 million this growth was driven primarily by gmv expansion which was up 40 year over year to a record 42 2 billion the strong growth in merchant sales combined with increased gmv penetration of shopify payments merchant adoption of shopify capital and shipping and partner related revenue compared with the same period last year drove revenue from these solutions higher 20 3 billion of gmv was processed on shopify payments in q2 up 51 versus the same quarter last year shopify payments penetration of gmv was 48 versus 45 in q2 2020 this increase was driven by gmv penetration gains through online and retail pos channels while shopify plus and international merchants expanded their share of gpv year over year merchant solutions revenue also benefited from the recognition of revenue in q2 associated with noncash consideration or warrants we received from our strategic partnerships with the firm and global e relating to performance obligations with respect to our shop pay installments and cross border commerce offerings respectively the warrants associated with these partnerships were valued at the start of the respective commercial contracts are deferred and then recognized into revenue ratably over the expected life of the contracts while there are other revenue components to these products the noncash consideration component from those commercial agreements added approximately three percentage points to our year on year merchant solutions revenue growth adjusted gross profit dollars grew 64 over last year s second quarter to 627 million and outpaced revenue growth primarily due to the larger mix of subscription solutions gross profit relative to last year s mix which was suppressed by the extended free trial the combined strength in revenue improved margin profile and lower overall opex spend as a percent of revenue contributed to strong adjusted operating earnings in q2 compared to the same period last year adjusted operating income was 236 8 million in the second quarter compared with adjusted operating income of 113 7 million in the second quarter of 2020 as our revenue growth outpaced growth in spend adjusted net income for the quarter was 284 6 million or 2 24 per diluted share compared with adjusted net income of 129 4 million or 1 05 per diluted share in last year s second quarter adjusted net income in q2 2021 excludes a 778 million unrealized net gain on our equity investments including global e which we wrote up to its fair value upon and subsequent to the company s ipo finally our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was 7 76 billion on june 30 compared with 6 39 billion at year end our healthy balance sheet gives us optionality that we believe increases our competitive advantage to retain this financial flexibility we filed yesterday to increase the registered room on our base shelf prospectus with so many merchants now building their businesses on shopify our job is to make entrepreneurship easier and help our merchants succeed this is reflected in our three key areas of investment in 2021 shopify fulfillment network shop and international expansion first we re heads down building the foundation of shopify fulfillment network so that our merchants can access simple fast and affordable fulfillment in q2 we introduced features that help merchants manage and organize the products fulfilled by our network via the merchant admin and improved shipping speed and accuracy we also added the ability for merchants to manage preferences like staff notifications our focus remains on building a product that offers merchants a delightful experience and optimizes our network of nodes and partners 6 river systems which had another strong quarter continued to deploy its fulfillment technology into our partner nodes and customer warehouses increasing the efficiency of their fulfillment operations our second key area of investment is shop as harley outlined we continue to invest in developing new features that add value to our merchants and give buyers a great mobile shopping experience our third key area of investment is international expansion we introduced new retail pos hardware that is integrated with shopify payments in the uk and ireland in q1 and in australia in may this is helpful to gross payments volume as pos pro locations and pos gmv trend upward and more importantly helpful to merchants who are benefiting from our leading pos capabilities we plan to expand our integrated pos offering to additional regions in the coming months as we expand our commercial efforts into regions we are localizing our support efforts alongside them that merchants are able to reach a human who can help them navigate an issue or leave them to the best next steps is an important differentiator for us and when our support team is armed with data superpowers and speaking our merchants language merchants everywhere can go farther faster and a quick note on our equity holdings in companies like global e affirm and others we remained active in q2 pursuing partnerships that position us to work with innovative teams that can help us solve hard problems for our merchants and to continue building the future of commerce turning to our outlook our outlook for the remainder of 2021 is consistent with our assumptions in february we ve seen an improvement in the overall economic environment through the first half of this year consumer spending beginning to rotate back to services in offline retail and e commerce growing at a more normalized pace relative to 2020 in view of these factors and shopify s performance year to date we continue to expect to grow revenue rapidly in 2021 but at a lower rate than in 2020 for the full year 2021 we continue to expect the following subscription solutions revenue growth to be driven by more merchants around the world joining the platform in a number lower than the record in 2020 but higher than any year prior to 2020 the growth rates of subscription solutions and merchant solutions revenues to be more similar to each other than in the recent past as we do not expect the surge in gmv that drove merchant solutions in 2020 to repeat and merchant solutions revenue growth to be driven by continued gmv growth from existing merchants new merchants joining the platform and expanded adoption of shopify s growing menu of merchant solutions including established offerings such as shopify payments shopify shipping and shopify capital both geographically and as merchants grow into them while newer solutions such as shopify fulfillment network and 6 river systems contribute nascent but incremental revenue in their early stages we expect that the first quarter will likely still contribute the smallest share of full year revenue and the fourth quarter the largest and that the revenue spread will be more evenly distributed across the four quarters than it has been historically we continue to expect rapid growth in gross profit dollars in 2021 and plan to continue reinvesting back into our business as aggressively as we can with the year over year growth in operating expenses accelerating in q3 and again in q4 hiring momentum picked up in our second quarter as we nearly doubled the number of new hires joining shopify quarter over quarter bringing on more engineers and commercial talent to support our growth initiatives in addition to increasing our commercial talent we expect to ramp up our go to market programs and events in the second half of 2021 as regions reopen finally we expect stock based compensation and related payroll taxes to be 425 million and amortization of acquired intangibles to be 21 million for 2021 due to the sustained momentum of digital commerce trends in the first half of 2021 combined with the us stimulus distributed in march and april this year shopify generated higher than anticipated revenue while incurring lower than planned opex spend as a percent of revenue in the first half of 2021 as a result we now expect full year 2021 adjusted operating income to be above the level we achieved in 2020 in closing shopify is investing in the future of commerce and we re taking a multipronged approach leveraging technology and talent by building the commerce infrastructure of the internet innovating new and improved products and expanding our relationships with a diverse community of partners we are creating a global retail operating system that will help our merchants succeed in the years ahead and make commerce better for everyone i ll now turn the call back to katie katie keita director investor relations thanks amy before we open the call up for questions i ll remind you to limit yourself to a single question that way more people will get a chance to ask a question on the call this morning ariel can you take the first question please questions answers operator our first question comes from craig maurer of autonomous research please go ahead craig maurer autonomous research analyst yes hi thanks for taking the questions so two questions one around payments regarding the shop pay announcement you guys had during the quarter around making the shop pay button available on non shopify platform to non shopify platform merchants is there an opportunity to take the shop pay button to a full stack processing solution and connecting with stripe on the back end to be a full stack paypal competitor and secondly we heard that shopify is now powering a large global brand in brazil as that large global brand pulled you into brazil and i was wondering what growth opportunities are for shopify going forward in that region thanks harley finkelstein president it s harley i ll take that question on the international side i mean as amy discussed in her remarks as well international remains an important part of our business and our growth story in fact merchants from outside north america grew as a percentage of our total merchant mix in q2 year over year and year over year gmv growth in the rest of world actually outpaced north america in q2 2021 so we re seeing more international merchants that are joining and are succeeding on shopify and obviously we re stepping up our growth marketing our sales and our support efforts in places like brazil and all over the world so it isn t necessarily any particular focus on brazil per se but there are merchants around the world who want are looking for a retail operating system and shopify certainly is a favorite of theirs and we re able to help them sell in the way that they want in terms of sort of the shop pay question look i mean the ability we think shop pay is the best way to check out on the internet it s fast it s secure merchants love it because it helps with conversion rates consumers love it because it allows them to check out really really quickly so making that available on more surfaces whether it s on facebook or it s on google or instagram to shopify merchants and also to non shopify merchants we just think that s the right thing to advance commerce tobi lütke this is tobi i think your question is specifically about how how we can take this beyond the shopify platform i think the reason why shop pay has been so successful is that it s highly bespoke to particular to the shopify platform like we can build in based on assumptions that we can make about the merchants and their capabilities because they are like because of the vertical integration we have no like we i think if we go beyond the ramp of a platform for its customers then we would have to lose a lot of the differentiation there so there s no that would be an adjacency for the product and we have no such plans craig maurer autonomous research analyst ok thank you so much operator our next question comes from thomas forte of d a davidson please go ahead thomas forte d a davidson analyst great thanks for taking my question so i want to know what the financial implications are of not collecting a commission on the first 1 million of revenue for developers on shopify and lowering your take rate after the first 1 million to 15 from 20 amy shapero chief financial officer yes the change in the app store and theme revenue models that was announced at unite are not material to shopify s results in the back half of this year or for the full year and i want to emphasize that while it s not material for us it is material for our developer partners and we are committed to our developers and believe this is the right long term benefit for our merchants and our partners to help them be more innovative and creative on behalf of our merchants and to keep more of the dollars in their pockets and so any short term loss of revenue in the back half is immaterial to us and well worth the long term benefits thomas forte d a davidson analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from ken wong of guggenheim securities please go ahead ken wong guggenheim partners analyst great thank you for taking my question this one s for tobi or harley just over the past months the company has introduced search and shop app conversion of ads in the partner app store and we ve seen theoretical headlines like an audience network out there how are you thinking about advertising as a product category and what areas do you think makes sense for shopify to potentially monetize on those products tobi lütke yes there s no one like approach i think what you re hearing about is a lot of very early experimentation the nature of advertising is like it s very hard to conduct a test that no one sees because i don t think that would lead to any useful data so there s a bit of learning in public going on there and we obviously look backwards on value our merchants obviously want to deepen their relationship with their existing buyer base shop is specifically really good in which nature we bridging that gap is currently what we are trying to discover and we are taking advantage of some opportunities again companies are journeys products are journeys sometimes you don t quite know where it leads certainly when i started i thought that we would be building fulfillment warehouses or do loans to a degree and that bonds us to the degree that we re doing now so again i think you ll see a very early representation of early attempts there and we really have no line of sight on what that does to revenue and this is certainly not why we are trying any of those things we are figuring out what the right mix of products is for a new merchant who is trying to build a business and reach for independence and if advertising from us however in some means is part of that we will hopefully know this over the next years katie keita director investor relations great thank you ken operator our next question comes from siti panigrahi of mizuho please go ahead siti panigrahi mizuho securities analyst thanks for taking my question it s impressive to see this record gmv i know you guys don t disclose much sense but do you see the trends in gmv per merchant trend this year and also especially in july what are you seeing and what s your expectation on that trend for the remaining of the year amy shapero chief financial officer yes the productivity of our merchants has remained strong on the platform as harley said in our opening remarks the 42 billion of gmv on the platform was a record and so gmv per merchant remains strong year over year and it s really the combination of what harley talked about pos our physical retail gmv has had four consecutive quarters of acceleration it s now back to the percentage mix pre covid on much higher gmv levels so we re seeing strong productivity there and with respect to online gmv we do believe that it has reset at a higher level and it s now just growing at a more normalized level and so we use the uk as an example of one of the economies that reopened first and our uk gmv grew faster than our average suggesting that when we equip merchants with multichannel they do better in a very fluid commerce environment we also saw social gmv increase substantially it s still small as a percentage of our mix but the growth quarter over quarter and year over year was significant and so these are all things with the multichannel approach that we expect will help continue to keep gmv per merchant strong siti panigrahi mizuho securities analyst thank you katie keita director investor relations thanks siti operator our next question comes from trevor young of barclays please go ahead trevor young barclays analyst great thanks for taking the question can you talk a little bit about the impact either qualitatively or quantitatively that merchants are seeing from their ability to use facebook and instagram ad targeting just in light of idfa we re hearing a lot of noise around this and it would just be helpful to hear how it s impacting your merchants and by extension of your gmv growth and then how you re adapting to enable that targeted advertising harley finkelstein president so i think we mentioned this on previous earnings calls but just in the near term we do think it will reduce the efficacy of some ads but i think it further will incentivize merchants to look for new ways and multiple ways to connect with buyers on top of ads getting increasingly expensive so longer term we expect merchants will benefit from further embedding commerce itself into surface areas across the internet and in person whether that s retargeting or it s apps like shop that give more control to the buyer who s actually opted in merchants on shopify have always been resilient whether it s through the pandemic or through different technological changes and we think they ll continue to be resilient and find ways to connect with buyers katie keita director investor relations thanks trevor trevor young barclays analyst that s really helpful and just operator our next question comes from matthew pfau of william blair please go ahead matthew pfau william blair company analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question just wanted to ask a question on the impressive point of sale uptake that you re seeing do you think that this is more tied to economies reopening and physical stores reopening or is it more driven by some of the product enhancements that you ve made around point of sale harley finkelstein president so i think a couple of things so in terms of retail point of sale gmv we are seeing that it is nearly back to pre covid levels as a percentage of overall gmv which again as amy mentioned on the last question is a much higher gmv so as physical stores reopen and merchants are better equipped with our upgraded hardware and software they re going to sell more we did do we did roll out also an all new shopify point of sale with new hardware and integrated payments in places in new geographies like places like australia and we re making great progress in places like uk and ireland as well so we re trying to enable merchants in these regions to seamlessly bridge their online business and their offline commerce and to amy s point earlier that they should not be mutually exclusive we also saw that 63 of our brick and mortar merchants in english speaking geographies are now using some form of local in store curbside pickup and delivery solutions that s compared to like 2 at the end of february 2020 so that s part of what we re going to see as reopenings continue to happen but also as retail has been reset through covid is that it will be retail everywhere and shopify is a platform that powers retail everywhere whether it s online or offline tobi lütke i m going to just add that there s another tech there too that just the point of sale product is now very very good it was previously it s most differentiated feature was just that it both attached and writes to the same real time database as an online store which was very valuable and so on right but like we really took that product seriously i think we re on rewrite no at this point since we started just because there s just a lot of learning and our initial vision of point of sale were absolutely oriented with what the point of sale industry has been doing previously like better implementation i think than of the existing patterns i think one effect you re seeing in a lot of spaces is that sort of second third fourth wave of software ends up being more digitally native like let s actually use exactly what like the power of software power of internet power of touch devices in the use case to enable exactly what they can bring instead of just making a touch version of a or a text based point of sale system i m very very happy with our point of sale it s really really ready to be adopted on the platform and i think that is an additional accelerant there too operator our next question comes from colin sebastian of baird please go ahead colin sebastian baird analyst thanks and good morning everybody i wonder if you could expand a bit on plans for shopify plus maybe where you re focused in terms of product road map to drive more merchant adoption and how much of that is geared toward the enterprise tier versus the mid market thank you harley finkelstein president thanks for the question so i mentioned in my prepared remarks but q2 was a great quarter for plus more merchants on standard plans upgraded to shopify plus we also saw more international brands joining plus to grow their business in terms of upgrades versus net new we re seeing both on the upgrade side with adding more than 700 000 merchants in 2020 that really does feed the pipeline for upgrades and obviously cac in that case is incredibly favorable on the net new and on the competitive front it s important to remember the size of our base relative to others we add more merchants in a quarter than some of the other enterprise platforms have in total and so the shopify brand affiliation the shopify plus brand affiliation keeps getting stronger it s now easier to make changes quickly which is something that a lot of merchants want even the largest of merchants and also the total cost of ownership is still lower relative to most others in terms of the features and functionality we continue to add more functionality we announced a number of new apis and new ways that you can actually get into the code base of shopify and be able to customize it to do exactly what you want that came out at shopify unite so generally shopify plus is really becoming a favorite for the mid market but also for some very large merchants i ve been working on my favorite t shirt retailer james perse for about six years to migrate over to shopify plus and now it was finally the right time for them to do it so we think that shopify plus is really well positioned to keep not only having more homegrown stories migrate from our basic plan but also migrations from other enterprise platforms in the future katie keita director investor relations thanks colin operator our next question comes from samad samana of jefferies please go ahead samad samana jefferies analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question so maybe just on the cross border side of the business i was wondering if you could maybe share anything around cross border volumes going to shopify merchants and how we should think about the cross border opportunity in the installed base especially with that global e partnership harley finkelstein president i mean i think commerce in 2021 is cross border that s how it operates in the early days of shopify you started to sell in your own backyard in your own country in your own region that s not the case and so whether it s with partnerships with global e or it s more functionality to do currency conversion things of that nature we think that in order for us to be the platform of choice for the most important merchants and brands in the world they by default need to sell internationally and we ve been working on international whether it was things like activating new partnerships with new agencies new developers in different countries to make sure that our product is well localized or it s new languages or its new payment pushing shopify payments into more geographies we re a global company and our merchants are also global companies and so the way for us to maintain our position the leadership position of being the retail operating system for the best brands is to make sure they can sell wherever they want katie keita director investor relations thanks samad operator our next question comes from josh beck of keybanc please go ahead josh beck keybanc capital markets analyst thanks for taking the question i wanted to triangulate on a couple of the data points you shared so the social channels seem to have been very strong it sounds like there was multiples levels types of growth and then point of sale also rebounded close to pre covid level so i m just curious if you play out both of those trends say three to five years do you see the social channel starting to approach maybe the contribution to your business within point of sale just curious if you re maybe revisiting that equation on the other side of covid here amy shapero chief financial officer yes listen i think social channels are becoming increasingly important part of the way commerce is happening and will happen the rank order of our gmv mix continues to be the online store offline pos as second and then all social channels and marketplaces third and the social channels and marketplaces today represent a small percentage of the mix but growing very rapidly so it will take some time before it becomes a significant part of our gmv mix but having said that i mean i think that s the beauty of shopify and the multichannel aspect is we can be anywhere commerce moves to in the future to be flexible on behalf of our merchants in order to provide additional ways to access buyers and so i view it as a positive that we have multi channels and every merchant is going to use those channels in a slightly different way that benefits their business the best and so our aim over time will be to offer multiple channels that you see today and new ones that are created over time katie keita director investor relations thank you josh operator our next question comes from paul treiber of rbc capital markets please go ahead paul treiber rbc capital markets analyst thanks very much and good morning just a follow up question on international just with regards to your international strategy what priority are you putting on securing additional partnerships or building out your partnerships with local marketplaces in channels and in a bigger picture to what degree can you scale and decentralize your support for more marketplaces and channels harley finkelstein president so whether it s a place like europe western europe for example places like germany and france or it s other geographies around the world in apac part of making sure that we have a global retail operating system is to make sure that we not only have local partnerships in terms of app partners theme partners that are building software on top of shopify that actually is relevant and valuable for merchants in that geography but it s also making sure that the surfaces that consumers in those geographies want to buy on are integrated into shopify so the partnership strategy around international has always been a part of what we said we were going to do just building software and translating is not sufficient we also need to make sure that it s properly localized in some geographies there are marketplaces that rakuten for example we re integrated with in japan would not be relevant as a marketplace in another geography in latin america so that localization actually is really important and the good news is that because we do have demand from merchants in all of these geographies it s becoming easier for us to develop these relationships with both app developers theme developers but also these marketplace partners katie keita director investor relations thanks paul operator our next question comes from darren aftahi of roth capital partners please go ahead darren aftahi roth capital partners analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question you brought on a lot of merchants as covid kind of hit last second quarter in that ramp i m just kind of curious as we kind of anniversary that what the sort of sense of retention is among those new merchants that were brought on amy shapero chief financial officer yes the retention of the merchants that have been brought on over the past year plus through covid has actually been very strong especially the cohorts that came on at the height of covid especially into q3 as the 90 day free trial converted they were those cohorts were more established businesses rushing to get online as the mix was as we ve moved through covid the mix has now shifted back more toward pre covid levels with a mix of established businesses and entrepreneurs coming to us but the retention rates have been stronger than pre covid levels over the last several quarters katie keita director investor relations thank you darren operator our next question comes from ygal arounian of wedbush securities please go ahead ygal arounian wedbush securities analyst thanks good morning everyone i want to ask about online store 2 0 and the impact of having customizable storefronts how much of a pain point was that for merchants that this was a big focus for you guys is it do you see it more of a contributor to shopify plus or overall maybe on the conversion from the base tiers to shopify plus can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations on how that can drive merchant growth and retention tobi lütke yes the growth of around i m not so such but there was a lot of things rolled into the same thing i wouldn t put it in terms of that it made anything new possible like the inventory are launched it launched of a template language which allowed for the kind of people who can design html and acs and these kinds of things to really build any kind of store this is where the great variety comes from and like the reason why shopify store you might use basically it s very hard to tell that it s a shopify store behind what you re currently on so that was always there the thing that shifted with the online store 2 0 is how much of that is possible to do without reaching into code so it s really a step function in how many people can engage in this branding customization and dialing in the online store just so to tell the story that you want to tell and your brand wants to tell there s now a more like a better mix between what the designers and the theme designers and the theme ecosystem can do another app ecosystem can do and how they all deliver their extensions to shopify and then people can pick and choose how they would like to shop put it all together and then most importantly make this all happen very fast so one aspect before that was a challenge is that this very open nature of shopify like this is why we gave people a lot of rope and some managed to hang on to it there was very big performance issues that came from certain apps for instance this is all a little bit more managed now it allows us to monitor this it allows us to have conversations with the app ecosystem about the performance impact of their particular solutions and the new themes that we launched are just extremely fast in the world of commerce it s quickly loading sites really really leads to better conversion it s a little bit weird to talk about it but like i liken it like if you go in an actual physical store in a boutique let s say and the floors are squeaky or like it s just like there is these subtle human things about that just kind of makes the experience in there not good like slow load times of app on the internet so they matter if you re trying to build a relationship with this new business that you ve discovered so online store 2 0 is basically like there s underneath there was 20 30 different projects around edge hosting and new vms and whatnot the entries out of it is just it s now really really easy to just show up in what we think is best possible way for the millions of businesses that are on shopify so i hope that answers the question katie keita director investor relations thanks ygal operator our next question comes from chris merwin of goldman sachs please go ahead chris merwin goldman sachs analyst ok thanks so much for taking my question i just wanted to ask about the adoption of payments among shopify plus customers i think historically that s run a little bit below what you ve seen with core and just curious how the 3p payment gateways might be helping to this end amy shapero chief financial officer the shopify payments adoption for plus and gpv penetration has continued to increase over time as we ve added more value on top of shopify payments including the accelerated checkout with shop pay as well as multicurrency and other things so it is it continues to be a major contributor to the reason why our gpv numbers and penetration have been increasing over time and it s increasing in mix year over year so that should give you some view it s growing nicely katie keita director investor relations thank you chris operator our next question comes from brian peterson of raymond james please go ahead brian peterson raymond james analyst hi thanks for taking the question i don t know if this is for tobi or harley but you announced some big partnership agreements this quarter i m curious what is the north star for us to think about in terms of partner or build or buy as you guys have scaled just curious to get an update on that harley finkelstein president well in terms of how we make a decision on what to build who to partner with and kind of what to buy look we want to be the most important piece of software that our merchants use we are that centralized operating system i think some of the partnerships you re referring to are companies like google and facebook for example again going back to what we said at the beginning of the call commerce is now happening absolutely everywhere and we want to make sure that the merchants that use shopify can sell absolutely everywhere and the town squares of modern day are social media and are on the internet and are offline as well and they re everywhere and so it s important that wherever consumers could be potentially looking to purchase that shopify merchants show up there and from a merchant perspective that it all neatly feeds back into a centralized back office where they can run their business so whether it s google search or it s on instagram or it s on all the other channel integrations we have that is really important now again over time you are going to see more of these surfaces show up where commerce is happening and it s our responsibility to make sure that we re integrated there to make sure that merchants can access those customers and of course as more of those services come to life that increased the complexity of commerce and running a business a modern day business and that also increased the value that i think that shopify provides to our customers in terms of the methodology i mean look we want to provide what most merchants need most of the time we want to do that at a world class level and there are sometimes where it s faster and better and more effective for us to partner with another technology company we ve developed a really good relationship i think in the market for being a company that builds incredible software and particularly have been really good partners but there are other times where we just need to build it ourselves because it s just mission critical and we think that we can actually deliver the best product on the planet katie keita director investor relations thanks brian operator our next question comes from keith weiss of morgan stanley please go ahead keith weiss morgan stanley analyst excellent thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong quarter and really the almost awe inspiring kind of expansion of functionality you guys have been able to push into the platform over time it s been really impressive to watch i wanted to talk about kind of one of those expansion areas shopify fulfillment network and just kind of get an update on kind of where we are in terms of opening the aperture are you guys getting more comfortable with kind of program and where are we in terms of the timeline of getting more merchants in there because what we do hear in terms of feedback from merchants that are using it is very positive it sounds like there s really good feedback on what you guys have put together so far harley finkelstein president i ll start that off so i mean i think sfn continued we re continuing to build the foundation for sfn we have been introducing features to help merchants manage product fulfilled on our network we re also improving shipping speed we re improving accuracy and we re adding things and managing new preference things like staff notifications i think there were three things that were added in q2 in particular to sfn which i think have added a lot of value one is improved inventory management now merchants can hide products and variants that are no longer being sold or fulfilled with sfn and so that enables merchants to keep product and variant skus organized the second thing was we improved shipping accuracy and speed we introduced new tools that validate things like shipping addresses and reduces errors and the third piece is capabilities to manage merchant preferences i mentioned staff notifications but these things all in aggregate all create real value we also are have a better sense now of who the sfn target customers are again we are still in this product market phase and so we know that self shippers that are fulfilling between 10 and 10 000 orders a day durable goods with pick pack and ship needs and where brand experience is front and center and they want their brand to look good when the consumer receives it that is really where we re spending our time right now the volumes in q2 were similar to q1 and we continued to add more merchants to sfn but again this is still a really important project for us i think we re still in that product market phase product market fit phase and over time you ll continue to see more of these functionalities come out and more merchants adopt it but it s important we get this right katie keita director investor relations thank you kieth operator our next question comes from brent bracelin of piper sandler please go ahead brent bracelin piper sandler analyst good morning question here for harley on the online versus offline commerce opportunity vast majority of shopify gmv is driven by powering online commerce but you talked about kind of pos pro being very robust four quarters of accelerating offline retail gmv and clearly there s a blurring of the lines between kind of the digital experience that customers want online versus offline i guess my question to you what is shopify doing to capture and enable more offline commerce specifically is it going to be tied to the pos pro product are there new products you can do to capture more offline commerce any thoughts there around just the opportunity and how big offline commerce can be given historically the focus has been on powering online harley finkelstein president yes remember that historically most businesses were created offline and then moved online that s no longer the case anymore and so by shopify being the place where more entrepreneurs get started every 28 seconds a new entrepreneur gets their first sale on shopify businesses are being started online and by making sure that we are that retail operating system that you re talking about when they do decide to move offline if a product is great and as tobi mentioned earlier our point of sale product is great and we ve spent a lot of time and a lot of money and effort focusing on making sure that that product is best in class and so the fact that they start with shopify that s where their inventory is that s where they spend their time when they go to work in the morning they open up their laptop where they start is the shopify admin it makes it a lot easier for us to be their point of sale partner when they decide to transition in terms of the legacy point of sale market we are also starting to see more legacy merchants that have started offline begin to use shopify point of sale as well they re using it because the product is really good but also because every business today and frankly for the next 100 years is going to be omnichannel talking about omnichannel going forward will be like talking about a colored television every business by default will be omnichannel and shopify is the platform that enables that so i think the opportunity for point of sale is there again back to tobi s comment about the point of sale hardware and software and the pro that we ve put out in the last little while it s the best we think that s out there right now it ll continue to get better we ll continue to add more functionality to it but we think physical retail is a really great opportunity and to amy s point it s our second largest channel and that will continue to grow katie keita director investor relations thank you brent and thanks everybody for dialing in this morning operator duration 59 minutes call participants katie keita director investor

business momentum accelerated in the second quarter of 2021 we had strong revenue and adjusted ebitda growth in both segments over q2 2020 and q2 2019 our second quarter performance reflects the resiliency and sustainability of our business model as a result of our strong operating trends and year to date performance we are again raising our full year 2021 guidance our clinical teams remain focused on the patient experience it s their commitment to our patients that truly drive the results of our business and i thank them for the outstanding work they do in our inpatient rehabilitation business revenue increased 21 5 discharges were up 18 7 and adjusted ebitda increased 40 9 we have successfully positioned encompass health inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as the trusted choice for patients providers and payers as the trusted national leader in rehabilitative care we have developed and continuously enhanced clinical programs and protocols that have proven to be highly effective in treating patients requiring care in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital we continue to improve care through advanced technology and innovative treatments that maximize recovery for our patients and prevent costly readmissions to acute care hospitals let me give you examples of these post acute solutions first we completed the rollout of our readmission prevention model in october 2020 while it s too early to draw any conclusions regarding the complete rollout i ll remind you that our pilot program for this model resulted in a 280 basis point decrease in readmission rates we expect to see similar results from the complete rollout second we began piloting our fall prevention program in eleven of our hospitals in may throughout this pilot we are focused on determining the effectiveness of the model and our existing fall prevention precautions identifying additional fall mitigation practices and making refinements to the model based on our learnings we expect to begin enterprisewide rollout of this model in the fourth quarter of this year or early in the first quarter of 2022 in addition we began piloting cerner s virtual patient observer platform in may in two of our hospitals this platform is a remote patient monitoring system that allows a trained technician to monitor multiple patient rooms from a central monitoring station we believe it can improve patient safety by reducing patient falls and lowering cost by reducing adverse events third our expertise in treating stroke patients continues to contribute to our growth in may of this year we announced an extension through 2024 of our strategic sponsorship with the american stroke association for its national together to end stroke campaign a primary goal of the campaign which is also an essential part of encompass health s long standing mission is to transition more patients back to their communities with greater functional recovery develop evidence based tools to inspire hope in stroke community and reduce stroke mortality across the u s during both 2019 and 2020 our rehabilitation hospitals served more than 34 000 stroke patients that number is expected to grow to over 36 000 in 2021 the strength of our value proposition to payers is also evident via our continued success with medicare advantage plans approximately 50 of new medicare beneficiaries in our markets are choosing to enroll in medicare advantage plans over traditional medicare compared to the second quarter of 2019 our same store medicare advantage discharges increased 41 3 we will continue to focus on capturing the growth in this payer we also continue to benefit from new store growth and have a robust development pipeline intact during the second quarter of 2021 we added 41 beds to existing hospitals and opened two new inpatient rehabilitation hospitals one in north tampa florida and the other in cumming georgia that brings our openings in 2021 to three new hospitals and we expect to open an additional five in the back half of the year specifically we plan to open hospitals in waco texas greenville south carolina shreveport louisiana and pensacola florida during the third quarter in addition we expect to open 12 new hospitals in 2022 and we already have nine hospitals slated to open in 2023 last week we announced our first hospital scheduled to open in 2024 that represents over 1 300 new beds from 2021 through 2024 and that s before we add 100 to 150 beds to existing hospitals in each of those years turning now to our home health and hospice business revenue increased 14 6 total admissions increased 14 7 total starts of care were up 10 9 and adjusted ebitda increased 311 3 operationally we continue to execute against a solid backdrop that includes aging demographics and the fact that 75 of patients seeking care would prefer to receive it in the comfort of their home we remain focused on the overall quality of our payer mix which prioritizes those payers that recognize our value proposition value based contracts are a growing focus for us and an increasing portion of our medicare advantage admissions are being tied to a value based payment model as payers emphasize reimbursement models driven by value we believe they will continue to seek out leading clinical outcomes and cost efficient services we re also collaborating with two home care organizations that provide personal care to support a snf at home program in order to meet a growing need for these services in our markets early results from these efforts are encouraging and we have more potential providers in the queue additionally we ve rolled out a virtual visit platform with a national payers capitative program the virtual platform app allows patients to participate in a secure video call via a personal device such as a smartphone tablet or computer with their physician nurse care manager or other medical staff we continue to assess the effectiveness of these interventions and identify opportunities to drive better outcomes through their appropriate use we are also pleased with the progress we re making in regard to our care planning approach associated with the use of metalogics care module our visits per episode were 17 1 in 2019 and 16 4 in 2020 for the second quarter of 2021 visits per episode were 15 6 and throughout this period when visits per episode have been declining we ve continued to enjoy industry leading low hospitalization rates with no degradation in our quality we believe the measured approach we are taking to care planning and adoption of metalogics is the best approach for our patients and our company our teams are also focused on the integration of the assets of frontier home health and hospice which added nine home health and 11 hospice locations to our portfolio in june i also want to express my excitement about the appointment of barb jacobsmeyer as ceo and crissy carlisle as cfo to our home health and hospice business barb is a proven leader with extensive healthcare operating experience we are confident she is the right person to lead this business going forward crissy s extensive financial expertise and familiarity with our business make her ideally suited to take on the cfo role i ve worked closely with both barb and crissy for many years and know they will do an excellent job next in regards to regulatory updates on june 28 cms released its notice of proposed rule making for home health agencies for calendar year 2022 the proposed rule includes a 1 7 net rate update and includes a proposal to expand cmmi s home health value based purchasing demonstration nationwide from its current 9 state footprint cms also provided its preliminary analysis of the first year of pdgm as we look ahead to the remainder of the year we ve increased our full year 2021 guidance based on results to date and strong operating trends our full year 2021 guidance now includes the following consolidated net operating revenues of 5 1 billion to 5 25 billion consolidated adjusted ebitda of 1 05 billion to 1 07 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 4 32 to 4 47 before i turn it over to doug i want to touch on the strategic alternative review of our home health and hospice segment as we mentioned in our earnings release based on the analysis of alternatives to date our board of directors believes a full or partial separation of the home health and hospice business will enhance the long term success and value of the business the final form is still to be determined as we continue to pursue a separation transaction by either public or private meetings many of the key preparatory actions required for separation have been completed including but not limited to audited carve out financial statements for the home health and hospice business a confidential submission of a draft registration statement on form s 1 with the sec and certain required regulatory filings while no assurance can be provided we expect to announce a transaction in the second half of 2021 as we continue to pursue a transaction we cannot comment further at this time with that i ll turn it over to doug doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark and good morning everyone as mark stated we re very pleased with the strong performance in both of our business segments as compared to 2020 second quarter consolidated net operating revenues grew 19 9 consolidated adjusted ebitda increased 71 9 and adjusted eps increased 277 4 we also generated significant growth over q2 2019 with consolidated adjusted ebitda of 10 6 irf adjusted ebitda of 8 6 and home health and hospice adjusted ebitda of 25 9 we continued to generate high levels of free cash flow with adjusted free cash flow increasing 28 9 year over year for the first six months of 2021 and we exited the second quarter with our net leverage ratio down to 3 1 times in our inpatient rehabilitation segment revenue increased 21 5 and adjusted ebitda increased 40 9 the revenue increase was driven by both volume and pricing total discharges increased 18 7 in q2 including same store growth of 16 9 compared to q2 2019 same store volumes increased 1 6 our average daily census improved sequentially from q1 as volumes continued to recover elective procedures are steadily returning we treated approximately 5 000 orthopedic and lower extremity joint replacement patients in the second quarter of 2021 that s approximately 1 400 more than we treated in the second quarter of 2020 and approximately 650 fewer than we treated in the second quarter of 2019 we believe elective surgeries for our patients elderly patients with complex medical conditions will continue to improve in the back half of the year growth in revenue per discharge of 1 8 primarily resulted from an increase in reimbursement rates the suspension of sequestration improvements in discharge destination and prior period cost report adjustments partially offset by the timing of discharges between quarters while patient acuity remained above pre covid levels with our average case mix index at 1 43 in q2 2021 as compared to 1 44 in q2 2020 and 1 38 in q2 2019 we continue to expect acuity to moderate in the back half of the year as elective procedures accelerate the rollout of the vaccine and on site covid testing capabilities continue to help us lower our patient s average length of stay our average length of stay decreased from 13 2 days in the first quarter of 2021 to 12 7 days in the second quarter growth in adjusted ebitda in the quarter primarily resulted from improved revenue and labor productivity employees per occupied bed in q2 2021 was 3 31 as compared to 3 45 in the prior year quarter in addition please recall that swb in q2 2020 included approximately 29 million of additional paid time off awarded to frontline employees we did see a tick up in salaries and wages per fte year over year due to employee furloughs during q2 2020 and the ramp up of new stores in 2021 medical supply costs are moderating but they continue to be higher than pre covid levels in our home health and hospice segment revenue increased 14 6 and adjusted ebitda increased 311 3 to 61 7 million the revenue increase was driven by both volume and pricing total home health admissions increased 14 7 year over year compared to q2 2019 total admissions increased 10 we are experiencing staffing challenges in certain markets primarily around nursing despite these challenges we remain focused on the growth opportunities in the back half of the year our non medicare admissions are at an all time high elective procedures have returned to historic levels and we have been adding new referral sources at a pace of approximately 3 000 per quarter the 1 6 increase in revenue per episode resulted from an increase in reimbursement rates as the timing of completed episodes offset the benefit of the suspension of sequestration within our hospice service line total admissions increased 3 4 primarily due to the acquisition of frontier in june of this year same store admissions decreased 1 9 due in part to lower occupancies at skilled nursing and senior living facilities cost of services continues to benefit from effective productivity management home health cost per visit decreased 1 per visit compared to q1 2021 and visits per episode decreased from 15 8 in q1 2021 to 15 6 in q2 as we head into the back half of the year we will anniversary the compensation structure changes we made in may 2020 cost per visit may increase sequentially as we address staffing challenges in certain markets and we will seek further reductions in visits per episode as we continue to refine our care planning approach and the use of metalogics our continued strong free cash flow and well balanced capital structure support the investments we are making in our growth during the second quarter we funded our development activities including the 99 million acquisition of frontier we also redeemed 200 million of our 5 125 senior notes due 2023 drawing minimally on our revolving credit facility i want to make just one comment on guidance before i conclude based primarily on the pacing of our de novo start up costs and the impact on pricing from the 2021 irf rule we expect the year over year improvement in revenue and ebitda to be greater in q3 than in q4 and with that we ll open the lines for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of stephen fischbeck with bank of america stephen fischbeck bank of america analyst hey so i have questions first question being on labor costs i guess it seems like you re seeing some pressure there it looks like your guidance assumes both a little bit higher wage and a little bit higher benefit costs and it seems like it s back end loaded should we expect that number to be even higher i guess as we think about 2022 and you mentioned that you have these labor issues geographically but you don t expect it to be a headwind to growth we ve seen some other companies talk about potentially impacting growth i guess why aren t you concerned about that mark j tarr president and chief executive officer kevin i ll make a couple of comments and then perhaps doug and barb want to pitch in as well i think what we saw in the second quarter was a continuation of trends that we saw developing in the first quarter where certainly the nursing market in both of our segments had a developing pressure it s if you think about nursing there s been a lot of pressure on nursing levels for a number of years but it certainly exacerbated in 2020 and as it came out from covid i will say it continues to be a market by market driven issue with some markets certainly have a higher degree than others it seems to be primarily limited to nursing we ve seen more pressure in home health than we have with the hospitals the hospitals have had to go back in and make a number of market adjustments to some of their support staff and housekeeping and dietary with regards to nursing and home health that certainly had been an early priority for barb jacobsmeyer in her new role and i m going to ask her to comment on just on some of the details there barbara jacobsmeyer chief executive officer of home health and hospice sure so i think first on the part of the staffing it is certainly market by market i think the good news though is that we achieved our highest total nursing hires in quarter two since we had back in 2019 so we do feel good about where we re headed as it relates to rn and lpn hires based on that we do have dashboards that show us where we re having staffing challenges versus where we are sufficiently staffed and so it s really about that walking and tackling and knowing where we have the staffing challenges and focus on talent acquisition in those markets and then the markets where we do have the amount of staff we need then we re focused with the sales force and making sure that we have the right number of sales team members so that we can continue to increase those referral sources and the referrals that are coming from our current sources so it s both things we think that we re going to continue to see the growth as we focus on the talent acquisition but we re already focused on the markets that have good staffing in place doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer kevin it s doug we do not feel like it serves as any kind of limitation on growth in the second quarter in the irf segment nor do we anticipate it will serve to limit growth for the balance of the year as a specific example we re not having any great degree of difficulty staffing our de novos as we bring those online it has been a limitation in certain of our home health locations on a year to date basis we do believe that we re taking appropriate steps to address that and we don t anticipate it to be a limitation on growth moving forward stephen fischbeck bank of america analyst that s helpful and i guess you made the comment back half of the year seasonality and i guess the timing of de novos and the headwind that creates can you just remind us i guess for the year what the total de novo start up losses are expected to be this year and maybe with more de novos opening next year how should we think about that kind of drag year over year into next year doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we ve stated that we anticipated that the total start up and ramp up costs associated with the de novos this year would be an impact of somewhere between 15 million and 20 million on ebitda that range remains appropriate we think that the quarters that are we know that the quarters that are going to be most significantly impacted are q2 and q3 and q3 is the heaviest of them all as we go into as we start thinking about 2022 and obviously we haven t put any guidance out there around it i think as a proxy you can kind of use the same aggregate costs that we re seeing this year divided by the number of de novos and recognize that we ve now announced 12 locations that will open up in 2022 that s a proxy some of it is really going to depend on the specific opening dates right the earlier in the year they open the more there s an opportunity for a new location to be generating at least breakeven ebitda by the back end of the year but we ll provide more color on that as we move into the first quarter of next year operator your next question doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer i was going to say partially offsetting the ramp up costs next year will be that we ll start to see a positive contribution from the eight that were opened up this year as we move into the back half of 2022 operator your next question comes from the line of brian tanquilut with jefferies brian tanquilut jefferies analyst good morning everyone hey doug thanks for all those comments i guess i ll just go back first to the labor questions right and maybe this is for both of you and barb so as we think about the rn and lpn mix is that an opportunity that you re seeing and then maybe drilling further down into kind of like staffing metrics so in the markets where you re saying that there are challenges is it more of a turnover issue or is it just in terms of adding new clinicians to drive and fuel the growth going forward barbara jacobsmeyer chief executive officer of home health and hospice yes i would say it s a combination of both of those we ve always had the focus on retention we re going to continue that focus but it also is the focus on finding the hires the recruitment that s why we ve added some flexibility around part time and prn in addition to our full time positions i think what nurses are looking for today is a lot more flexibility as there s still some questions on what things look like in the future with school so and i think that s also why we re seeing some success in our recruitment is because we are offering increased flexibility mark j tarr president and chief executive officer brian i will say that we ve added and this goes for both segments have added resources around talent acquisition people whose sole job is recruitment and we re starting to see a return on that investment that we first started heavily in the second half of 2020 for the hospitals particularly those new de novos and then barb has addressed that issue with home health brian tanquilut jefferies analyst no that s awesome and then i guess mark since i have you you ve already announced nine openings for 2023 year to date and obviously we re kind of like halfway through the year so just wondering are you seeing more opportunities pop up more than what you probably would have expected when you gave your long term guidance ranges for de novo openings because it seems like it has accelerated with all the announcements just in the past few weeks mark j tarr president and chief executive officer brian we re certainly very positive about the pipeline we have we ve talked about the florida markets that was an area that that was a state that we had a long term legacy of hospitals there we have 12 hospitals we knew all along that if the con in that state were ever to be abolished that we knew exactly what markets we want to move in as well as what markets we want to add beds to existing hospitals so the state of florida has been a big opportunity for us and then we ve been very pleasantly surprised and as we have moved into either new states or certain markets and states where we didn t have such a density of facilities and so yes we re very positive on the long term outlook and demographic tailwind that continues to drive the need for our services doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer and brian just to add to that in those long term targets for the irf segment we had anticipated that we would add between six and ten de novos per year over that five year period and obviously based on the numbers you just cited with twelve coming on board next year nine already identified for 2023 we re running at or above the top end of that range and feel good about our ability to do so for the next four to five years at a minimum operator your next question comes from the line of a j rice with credit suisse a j rice credit suisse analyst hey how are you guys maybe just two quick things here one you ve got in your slide deck that you think you d face an admissions headwind versus 2019 on in the home health business because of the snf and senior housing depressed occupancy you ve picked up all these additional referral sources do you think you re getting those patients in another way or do you think that 3 200 admission headwind is still out there to be had as incremental to the current baseline and then also in your slide deck you have a payer mix shift it looks like in the irf business where medicare fee for service was up pretty significantly but medicare advantage was down i just wondered have you drilled is that just the pandemic or is there anything to account for about a 400 500 basis point swing in payer mix between those two sources mark j tarr president and chief executive officer yes a j i m going to let barb address the first question involving home health barbara jacobsmeyer chief executive officer of home health and hospice yes so on home health you re right we ve increased the referral sources over the last several quarters to about 3 000 new referral sources per quarter i think it s a little bit of a blend on what that s helping us from a recovery and new growth so for example when you saw that our electives are actually back up pre covid levels some of that is about increasing the number of referral sources that are direct orthopedic physicians and so we ve been able to market directly to them so that as they re doing some of these surgeries in particularly ambulatory surgery centers that has helped increase those types of referrals but we re also seeing new referral sources that are helping with some of the other diagnoses mixes so i think it s a combination but certainly increasing that number of referral sources is helping us with that headwind of the snf and senior living mark j tarr president and chief executive officer and a j longer term we do think that the snf and senior living volumes will come back it s just that they have been slower to respond post pandemic than other referral sources doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer yes our anecdotal evidence tells they re still running on average about 15 below their pre pandemic occupancy levels a j rice credit suisse analyst right right doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer a j this is doug on the medicare advantage side there s no doubt that the pandemic has caused some fluctuations in our payer mix and those fluctuations are more pronounced in q2 than any other quarter a because we were at kind of the height of the impact of the pandemic in q2 and then also it was for q2 last year that the pre authorization requirements by virtually all of the ma plans were waived and then those were reimplemented in july of last year but just to give you some sense and context around the numbers recall that in q2 of last year our ma discharges in the irf segment were up 66 in q2 of this year on a same store basis they re down 13 2 but were still up 5 6 on a year to date basis and perhaps as importantly if you compare year to date 2021 to 2019 we re up 41 3 with regard to sustainability and where we see the payer mix going what we can say is that if you look at ma as a portion of our patient mix in q2 2021 it was 15 3 in the same quarter last year it was 20 1 if you go all the way back to q2 of 2019 it was 11 so it s still elevated over that level in the last eight quarters on a blended basis it s about 14 5 so we do expect that now that we ve kind of moved past the second quarter we ll continue to see ma growth in the back half of the year and i would expect it to be probably modestly higher than what we see in fee for service so that would suggest that from that current level of about 15 in the payer mix we re probably going to continue to hover pretty close to that area but maybe inching up just a bit operator your next question comes from the line of matt larew with william blair matt larew william blair analyst hey good morning just curious you ve obviously commented on elective procedures returning and just more broadly bonds returning just curious how things have looked in july with the delta variant obviously moving out i presume at this point your staff s more vaccinated you have ppe in place patient care algorithms around vaccines are a bit more established obviously than they were in recent surges but just curious what you ve seen in terms of any changes in the momentum that you picked up during q2 mark j tarr president and chief executive officer matt we re not seeing any changes in the momentum that we ve picked up but we ll certainly in the marketplaces we re seeing evidence that there s an increase in the covid patient population in the acute care hospitals we ve had less than a handful of our own hospitals or agencies that have seen an increase in the covid patients being treated what we have seen is an uptick in a number of our own staff that may be in quarantine at this point due to either exposure outside of work or during the workplace but as you noted we have a great amount of confidence in our teams they re well prepared with ppe the protocols that they put in place last year and have been working from since then all of our hospitals have the abbott rapid testing equipment in house that allows us to test individuals within 15 minutes so we re prepared for what lies ahead but at this point we ve not seen any direct impact on our business doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer and matt i would add to that recall that for the types of patients that we re treating in the irf setting elective procedures are only elective in the short term ultimately what they are is deferred procedures that need to be done and when you combine that with the fact that look at the average age of the patient that we re treating and the focus of the vaccination programs on prioritizing the senior population we don t expect that we re going to see the progress that we re making in elective surgeries recede matt larew william blair analyst yes that s great context there doug on the hospice side can you maybe help us understand what you re seeing on the ground obviously there were some adc issues earlier near the work industrywide but in terms of the negative admit growth year over year was that isolated to certain geographies is that also related to staffing maybe it would be helpful to get an update there barbara jacobsmeyer chief executive officer of home health and hospice yes so mainly it was due to the again the lower occupancies that we re seeing in the snf and senior living facilities but there were some key markets where we had some staffing challenges and again those were also mostly nursing we are seeing those agencies get hired up as far as their nursing staff so i would say that the other piece has been the length of stay we saw kind of a decrease in the length of stay as it impacted with covid patients but we re kind of seeing that come back normal return more to a normal pre covid length of stay and pre covid diagnosis mix operator your next question comes from the line of frank morgan with rbc frank morgan rbc analyst hello how is it going i guess i ll stay on that last question and the last commentary going back to hospice i think you said that length of stay in hospice was reaching sort of pre pandemic levels just curious about any in terms of the momentum across the months of the quarter in terms of admissions you may not want to give specific numbers but could you just describe what the movement was across the months of the second quarter and really kind of how you ve exited the quarter in terms of admission trends in the hospice business and also in the home healthcare business barbara jacobsmeyer chief executive officer of home health and hospice i don t have this actually only the specific trends as it was month by month mark j tarr president and chief executive officer you ve got to be careful about that particularly in the second quarter as well because of the holidays and the summer season generally speaking we don t see any of the limitations within hospice or home health as being more permanent issues frank morgan rbc analyst got you and i think when you talked about labor you mentioned some specific regions and i think that was in the hospice business any particular regions that you could call out and any explanations that might be market specific barbara jacobsmeyer chief executive officer of home health and hospice no i actually would say that that changes we ve had some really nice increase in our hires over the second quarter so i think what i would potentially call out today is it s already changing so i don t know that there s anything in particular that we have major concerns over doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer but frank that would also bode the same for the hospitals it s really no trends to see in terms of geography it is really a market by market phenomenon operator your next question comes from the line of pito chickering with deutsche bank pito chickering deutsche bank analyst hey guys thank you for taking my question here i know you guys don t want to talk about the strategic review but let me see if i can ask some questions that you are able to answer can you walk us through the process of the confidential s 1 filing is that why you made the public announcements of barb and crissy as ceo and cfo in order to meet the s 1 and can we take crissy s announcement on june 28 as a rough proxy when the s 1 was submitted and finally if you decided to do the spin now that you filed the s 1 how fast can you do so patrick darby executive vice president general counsel and corporate secretary yes peter that s pito that s detail that we re not in position to provide at this point pito chickering deutsche bank analyst couldn t you just provide the simple answer of you filed the s 1 if that was a route you decided to go how fast could that be transacted mark j tarr president and chief executive officer that s completely within our control operator your next question comes from the line of john ransom with raymond james john ransom raymond james analyst yes i m going to try to answer ask the question you re going to actually answer so just on value based care that means a lot of things if we look at the irf business for example approximately what percentage of your cases are now in a value based arrangement and what does that look like is it fee for service with a kicker are you taking two sided bps are you contracting downstream and then is this my impression is this is all developing a lot slower than we might have thought five years ago but is there any reason to think that it won t continue just to kind of inch along or do you think we might be at a point where this might pick up a little bit of momentum and if so is that a good guy bad guy or kind of a neutral pick up mark j tarr president and chief executive officer so virtually everything that we re doing with regard to value based care contracts is in the home health segment and it s within the ma book of business you re correct that it s a relatively small but it is a growing portion of our business i think the reason that it s in home health versus on the irf side is because of the complexity associated with it and it s just something that the ma companies are not set up to tackle on the irf side yet even though we ve expressed the willingness to try to address that i think it s definitely versus the expectations we had around that just recently as three or five years ago i think it s definitely developing more slowly than we would have anticipated we do think it s going to continue to move forward but we don t see any kind of catalyst for it to be a sudden jump we think it s going to be kind of slow and steady and we ll continue to be a participant in those models where they make economic sense for us and we ll continue to refine our learning through that participation doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer john we do think it will work in our favor just based upon our quality that we have we think we have a lot of value to provide as part of our value proposition in both of our segments clearly as we work with our trade associations as you noted this has gone at a snail s pace and we ll see what the new administration wants to do relative to the use of cmmi and moving forward with programs either voluntary or mandated but yes it has moved at a very slow pace up to this point mark j tarr president and chief executive officer specifically when you look at home health and get into the m a book of business one of the things we ve struggled with before is that the ma plans have historically not differentiated between providers based on the quality and therefore they just got to do the lowest common denominator from a rate perspective we believe that our quality shines through and so if we can get into arrangements that have a stipend that is based at least in part on the quality of care we think that inures to our benefit john ransom raymond james analyst and just as a quick follow up i mean one of your competitors bought a business that s seeking to bypass hospital admissions altogether for about 150 drgs and they like this three day intensive home care model with a post acute follow up what s your i m sure you ve got a look at that business and you talked about snf at home but if you look out two or three or four years do you think we re going to have models that sort of obviate the need for both the snf in a hospital and just kind of go kind of start and begin at the home with some tech enabled care capabilities mark j tarr president and chief executive officer well we certainly think from a snf at home setting there have been a number of different types of diagnostic backgrounds that historically have gone physical nursing facilities that given the advancements of home health a number of those could be done in the home setting that s what we re that s what we are preparing to meet the demand for i think hospital home has a long way to go certainly the patients that are in our hospitals are nondiscretionary they need a high intensity of care and it would be hard to imagine that that could be provided in a home setting in a more efficient manner than what we re providing for in the hospital doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer if you try to push that kind of acuity into the home you lose all of the benefits of scale you have to go to essentially one on one staffing in the home as opposed to being able to run at the kind of ratios and kind of epob for instance that we do in our hospitals operator your next question comes from the line of matthew borsch with bmo capital markets ben bmo capital markets analyst good morning you actually have ben filling in for matt appreciate for taking my question so when assessing the results for inpatient rehab we ve seen some nice growth in discharges in ebitda as well as the de novo opportunities that you previously mentioned my question is around growth expectations and what do you think the irf business will benefit in a sustained manner beyond the pandemic and some of the patient utilization shifts mark j tarr president and chief executive officer so obviously we remain very bullish about the growth there evidenced the amount of capital we re deploying toward both the de novos and the capacity expansions on the bed side as we said for quite a few years the demographics are definitely in our favor the age cohort that we address through our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals is the fastest growing cohort of the u s population at a multiple of the overall population growth and that s expected to continue for the foreseeable future in addition to that the supply of licensed irf beds in the u s has simply not kept up with the increasing demand in the aging of the population and we don t see the risk of any kind of technological obsolescence as high as well so we remain very optimistic about the irf space we ve also said even though the dialogue around moving toward some kind of site neutral post acute inpatient setting has really kind of died down over the last several years if ultimately we begin to head in that direction we believe that investing in the irf space is an even better bet and that is because you re going to continue to have a need for post acute inpatient services it may address the spectrum of what is currently provided from an ltac to an irf to a snf and if you had to have a single box that from a physical standpoint and a staffing standpoint had to flex to be able to address that broader acuity you would want to do it with your starting point being an irf versus an ltac or a snf and when you move to that kind of model if in fact it ever gets here the total addressable market for our services will have been expanded exponentially doug coltharp executive vice president and chief financial officer matt we think last year was an opportunity for us to show the level of quality that we can provide for our patients to have a high acuity and covid certainly exposed certain areas of post acute that could not handle a higher acuity patient others proved themselves such as the irf sector and we think that encompass health came through in very strong fashion and we think some of that reputational impact that we ve had that

cincinnati oh ammoland com the battle for bump stock rolls on as attorneys for gun owners of america files a supplemental brief to the sixth circuit court of appeals in gun owners of america v garland in a statement erich pratt senior vice president of goa and gof said we re pleased to continue the battle against the atf s unconstitutional ban on bump stocks as shown by their proposed rules on homemade and braced firearms this rogue lawless agency seeks to chip away at the rights of law abiding gun owners and this is why it is vitally important that their actions including their ban of bump stocks do not go unchecked goa and gof will continue to hold the atf accountable for its repeated assaults upon the second amendment rights of gun owners the gun owners of america initially argued the case in front of a panel of judges on december 11 2019 from the panel s questioning of the government most legal experts expected a positive outcome for gun rights a few months later in may a three judge panel from the tenth circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of the government in aposhian v barr on september 10 2020 the tenth circuit granted a rehearing en banc en banc means the entire bench will hear the case the prior ruling of the panel is vacated meaning it is like it never happened the declaration of the tenth circuit worried some pro gun advocates since circuit courts do not like to give contradictory rulings but on june 25 2021 the sixth circuit handed down a decision by a 2 1 margin that stated bump stocks are not a machine gun the sixth circuit ordered the district court to grant an injunction against the bump stock ban the federal government asked for an en banc hearing the sixth circuit granted the government its request thus vacating the panel s pro gun decision because an en banc hearing is basically a do over attorneys for gun owners of america lead by robert olson had to file a new brief in the case stating why that the plaintiffs believe that the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf didn t have a right to ban bump stocks the government is claiming that it has chevron deference when it comes to the definition of a machine gun chevron deference stems from chevron u s a inc v natural resources defense council in that case the supreme court of the united states scotus ruled that if a statute is ambiguous then deference is given to the regulatory agency olson makes the case that chevron does not apply because the statute is not ambiguous goa argues that the statue does not have any gray areas the definition of a machine is clear with a single function of the trigger the gun fires multiple rounds a bump stock doesn t work in a similar way the trigger needs to be pulled for each round to fire a bump stock uses the recoil of the rifle to speed up firing the same effect can be accomplished by using a rubber band or belt loop the original panel concluded that chevron does not apply because this is a criminal statute in the ruling the majority wrote no deference is owed to an agency s interpretation of a criminal statute olson agrees with the panel and goa has case law on its side in the united states v apel the supreme court wrote we have never held that the government s reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference also in abramski v the united states scotus wrote criminal laws are for courts not for the government to construe atf s position is not relevant at all and a court has an obligation to correct error the supplemental brief argues that a president s political objectives do not receive chevron deference it can t be argued that president trump wasn t the catalyst for the change to the definition of a machine gun in 2018 he stated that bump stocks should be a machine and ordered the atf to write out the device but trump did not have the expertise to make the claim that bump stocks were machines and didn t have the power to order the atf to write out the product deference is given to agencies because they are assumed to have expertise in highly technical areas of the law the firearms and ammunition technology division fatd of the atf first reviewed bump stocks in 2008 and determined that the device was not a machine gun for the next nine years the atf held firm in its opinion that bump stocks were not machine guns and repeatedly issued opinion letters on the subject it wasn t until the president order the agency to redefine a machine gun that bump stocks were banned the government claims that bump stocks are machine guns because it allows continuous firing initiated by a single action by the shooter this definition is different than a single function of the trigger the decision to make bump stocks a machine gun was one of the president s policy goals goa makes the case that chevron deference cannot be used for a policy goal case law seems to be on their side in utility air regulatory group v epa scotus ruled that an agency may not rewrit unambiguous statutory terms to suit bureaucratic policy goals olson points out that congress did not delegate to atf the authority to define or redefine the term machinegun this fact is important because the courts have ruled that only congress has the power to write new federal criminal law in the united states v davis scotus wrote that nly the people s elected representatives in congress have the power to write new federal criminal laws goa says that even if the statute were ambiguous then it is unconstitutionally vague the gun rights groups argue that the rule of lenity applies here ambiguities in criminal statutes have always been interpreted against the government in this case the government is arguing that ambiguities should be ruled in favor of it which would break new ground in case law all this might not matter because the government seems to have waived chevron deference by not raising it in district court in help alert w ky inc v tva the court ruled the federal government waived any reliance on chevron deference by failing to raise it to the district court on the same day the panel handed down its decision in favor of goa scotus declined to consider chevron deference in hollyfrontier cheyenne ref llc v renewable fuels ass n because the government did not ask for deference earlier therefore waived deference the final point olson makes is that deference here will only further embolden atf s lawless actions many consider the atf to be out of control the atf is trying to use deference to shut down the unfinished firearm frames and pistol stabilizing brace markets many do not believe that the agency has the power to do so because they would be making de facto laws if goa is successful in the bump stock case then it could throw a monkey wrench into the atf s future plans there is no timeline for a final decision in the bump stock case but the bump stock war is far from over both sides are expected to appeal a negative outcome to the supreme court about john crump john is an nra instructor and a constitutional activist john has written about firearms interviewed people of all walks of life and on the constitution john lives in

recently the ceo of black rock larry fink made headlines by predicting that climate policies could lead to a large inflation shock 1 this is of first order importance for all central banks in particular in light of the ecbs new strategy focus on climate risks will a secular increase in the price of carbon and carbon equivalents put upward pressure on the price level how large is this effect likely to be how much does this effect depend on the reaction of monetary policy should central banks take such risks into account in their strategies modelling studies on the effect of carbon taxation point to sizeable effects on inflation based on the assumption that higher energy prices are largely passed on to consumers and the central bank follows a taylor rule for instance mckibbin et al 2014 consider a us 15 carbon tax implemented in the us and find that it causes a rise in inflation of 0 8 during the first year of the policy in practice the effect of a carbon tax on inflation will depend on many factors including the tax rate coverage and incidence as well as the fiscal and monetary policy responses in a new study konradt and weder di mauro 2021 we use the experience of three decades of carbon taxation in canada and europe to explore the effect empirically we find that carbon taxes do not have to be inflationary and may even be deflationary our evidence suggests that the increase in energy prices was more than offset by a fall in the prices of services and other non tradables our results are consistent across canadian provinces and european countries and survive various robustness checks at least in case of british columbia a contraction in household incomes and expenditures in particular among the richer households could explain the deflationary effect our findings a deflationary effects our analysis builds on two separate empirical methods the synthetic control method abadie et al 2010 and local projections jordà 2005 to identify the effects on the consumer price index cpi and its components on the intensive margin as well as the extensive margin following metcalf and stock 2020 we consider a 40 carbon tax implementation that remains flat over time and accrues on 30 of total ghg emissions we estimate dynamic impulse responses based on three provincial carbon taxes in canada and 15 national carbon taxes in europe respectively figure 1 plots the cumulative impulse response assuming a parallel trends assumption for the canadian panel a and european sample panel b including country or province and year fixed effects the shaded grey bounds denote 95 confidence bands the impulse response of cpi in canadian provinces following a carbon tax implementation is economically sizeable and statistically significant five years removed cpi falls by a total of 6 points following the enactment of a 40 tax on 30 of ghg emissions for european countries we estimate a contemporaneous negative response of about 0 5 index points which is statistically significant at the 5 confidence level in the following years the impulse response trends upwards after five years the estimates point to a small negative cumulative effect on cpi which is however not statistically significant figure 1 cumulative impulse responses of cpi a canada b europe note this figure shows the cumulative impulse response of cpi to a 40 carbon tax with 30 emission coverage estimated for canada panel a and europe panel b respectively shaded grey bounds show 95 confidence bands next we check whether relative final prices for energy versus other goods changed in response to the tax enactments as intended on this front carbon taxes seem to have worked in most cases energy prices rose in the period after carbon taxes were implemented compared to a synthetic control group at the same time prices of other components of the cpi basket mostly non tradables fell again this result holds for both canadian and european jurisdictions our main finding that carbon taxes do not lead to an inflationary response is remarkably robust for europe it holds for early as well as late carbon tax adopters although the deflationary effect is smaller for the latter group moreover the result is robust for countries with high carbon taxes the finding also overwhelmingly holds across jurisdictions that manage their own monetary policy and those that do not provinces in canada or countries in the euro area finally deflationary effects also dominate regardless of whether or not countries are recycling carbon tax revenues we cannot fully control for other factors driving our results most of the carbon taxes in our sample were implemented during the great moderation or secular stagnation decades however these forces would apply equally to the non carbon tax jurisdictions which are in our control group the same is true for the various financial crisis in the last three decades b falling household income and expenditure in british columbia mostly among the rich finally we turn to the macroeconomic and distributional effects of the carbon taxes in canada in order to understand what is driving our muted price responses one hypothesis is that carbon taxes put downward pressure on wages consistent with yamazaki 2017 and aggregate income lower real income could lead households to cut expenditure and consume fewer goods and services at the margin akin to a negative demand shock we also explore heterogeneous effects on households across the income distribution with the experience of the yellow vest movement in france in mind our suspicion was that the carbon tax may have been regressive reducing the incomes and expenditures of the poorest the most our results suggest that following the carbon tax introduction real household income and consumption expenditure fell in british columbia compared to the rest of canada along the lines of prior studies e g metcalf 2019 we find no negative effect of the carbon tax on gdp we illustrate the effect graphically in figure 2 by comparing households of different income in british columbia to a plausible counterfactual synthetic control panel a highlights the fall in household income on average dark solid line and across income groups coloured lines in british columbia after the introduction of the tax after five years the cumulative difference of average real household income in british columbia is 10 percentage points below that of the counterfactual economy the same pattern holds for household expenditures panel b and is most pronounced for high income households red line by contrast the lowest income group increased expenditures following the taxation potentially related to the progressive redistribution scheme in british columbia in addition to the income channel we find some support that the tax through permanently higher energy prices put downward pressure on the net present value of real estate and energy intensive durable goods both the price of shelter and passenger vehicles fell in british columbia after the enactment of the tax figure 2 income and expenditure synthetic control gap a income b consumption expenditure note this figure shows the synthetic control gap for household income panel a and household consumption expenditure panel b all series are in real terms and were smoothed using a symmetric moving average solid dark line is the total response coloured lines correspond to the 5 different income quintiles q1 bottom q5 top conclusions no angst our initial intuition was in line with that of larry finks we expected to find a positive effect of carbon taxes on inflation and mostly wondered about its size our findings instead point the other way in both canada and europe the evidence suggests that introducing carbon taxes had deflationary rather than inflationary effects we explored several possible avenues to explain these findings the most promising candidate explanation is that the carbon taxes may have reduced household income and expenditures thus depressing non energy prices even though our analysis provides no support for an inflationary effect deflation is equally undesirable and central banks still have to pay close attention to carbon pricing and taxation moreover the absent reaction of monetary policy in most jurisdictions that introduced carbon taxes might have contributed to the deflationary outcome in the first place no doubt further research will be needed to draw the broader implications of carbon price shocks for optimal monetary policy responses references abadie a a diamond and j

specializing in the acquisition financing and development of convenience automotive and other single tenant retail real estate as of june 30 2021 the company owned 951 properties and leased 54 properties from third party landlords in 35 states across the united states and washington d c non gaap financial measures in addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the company also focuses on funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo to measure its performance ffo and affo are generally considered by analysts and investors to be appropriate supplemental non gaap measures of the performance of reits ffo and affo are not in accordance with or a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap in addition ffo and affo are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles neither ffo nor affo represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for gaap net earnings or as a measure of liquidity these measures should only be used to evaluate the company s performance in conjunction with corresponding gaap measures ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as gaap net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains or losses on dispositions of real estate impairment charges and the cumulative effect of accounting changes the company s definition of affo is defined as ffo less i certain revenue recognition adjustments defined below ii non cash changes in environmental estimates iii non cash environmental accretion expense iv environmental litigation accruals v insurance reimbursements vi legal settlements and judgments vii acquisition costs expensed and viii other unusual items that are not reflective of the company s core operating performance other reits may use definitions of ffo and or affo that are different than the company s and accordingly may not be comparable the company believes that ffo and affo are helpful to analysts and investors in measuring the company s performance because both ffo and affo exclude various items included in gaap net earnings that do not relate to or are not indicative of the company s core operating performance specifically ffo excludes various items such as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains or losses on dispositions of real estate and impairment charges however gaap net earnings and ffo typically include certain other items that the company excludes from affo including the impact of revenue recognition adjustments comprised of deferred rental revenue straight line rental revenue the net amortization of above market and below market leases adjustments recorded for the recognition of rental income from direct financing leases and the amortization of deferred lease incentives collectively revenue recognition adjustments that do not impact the company s recurring cash flow and which are not indicative of its core operating performance deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with the company s tenants in accordance with gaap the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases is recognized on a straight line basis rather than when payment is contractually due the present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in place leases income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease terms using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties the amortization of deferred lease incentives represents the company s funding commitment in certain leases which deferred expense is recognized on a straight line basis as a reduction of rental revenue gaap net earnings and ffo also include non cash and or unusual items such as changes in environmental estimates environmental accretion expense non cash allowance for credit losses on notes and mortgages receivable and direct finance leases environmental litigation accruals insurance reimbursements legal settlements and judgments property acquisition costs expensed and loss on extinguishment of debt that do not impact the company s recurring cash flow and which are not indicative of the company s core operating performance the company pays particular attention to affo which the company believes provides a more accurate depiction of the company s core operating performance than either gaap earnings or ffo by providing affo the company believes that it is presenting useful information that assists analysts and investors to better assess its core operating performance further the company believes that affo is useful in comparing the sustainability of its core operating performance with the sustainability of the core operating performance of other real estate companies for a tabular reconciliation of ffo and affo to gaap net earnings see the table captioned reconciliation of net earnings to funds from operations

quarter of 2020 net income for the second quarter of 2021 was 3 1 million or 0 41 per diluted share up significantly from earnings of 1 6 million or 0 22 per diluted share in the year earlier quarter dr subodh kulkarni president and chief executive officer said cyberoptics second quarter sales which exceeded our guidance for this period were driven by strong double digit sales growth from each of our product lines our industry leading 3d multi reflection suppression mrs based sensing and inspection products and semiconductor sensors are enabling cyberoptics to take optimum advantage of the robust capital spending environment in our targeted electronics and semiconductor markets we believe this market strength will continue into the foreseeable future making us optimistic about our performance in coming quarters sales of 3d and 2d sensors increased 50 year over year to 7 1 million in the second quarter of 2021 sales of 3d mrs sensors rose 46 year over year to 4 3 million driven

wafersense semiconductor sensors increased 53 year over year to a record 5 5 million in the second quarter of 2021 demand for these yield and process improvement sensors is being generated in part by the construction of new semiconductor fabs sales of wafersense products are forecasted to post strong year over year growth in the third quarter of 2021 sales of inspection and metrology systems rose 64 in the second quarter of 2021 to 12 6 million within this product category second quarter sales of sq3000 multi function inspection systems increased 35 year over year to 6 3 million second quarter

sales of 25 0 to 28 0 million for the third quarter of 2021 ending september 30 compared to 20 8 million in the third quarter of 2020 its anticipated that there will be no revenue from mx memory module systems in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to normal quarterly variability in the sales of these products for this reason sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 are expected to be lower on a sequential quarterly basis however strong year over year sales growth is anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by the company s record backlog and the robust capital spending environment

eps surprise while 86 have reported a positive revenue surprise the good news for oil and gas investors the long suffering sector is on course for a repeat of a stellar first quarter by posting blowout earnings again in large part due to an increase in oil and gas prices three quarters of energy companies that have reported earnings have exceeded expectations while half have managed to surpass revenue expectations even better the energy sector s expected revenue growth of 92 1 is a high watermark for the entire u s market the energy sector is expected to report earnings of 13 9 billion for q2 2021 compared to a loss of 10 6 billion in q2 2020 thanks to vast improvements in commodity prices especially crude which averaged 66 17 bbl in q2 2021 compared to 28 bbl in q2 2020 and

numbers but will also focus on three major themes dividend distributions energy transition and climate risk analysts at morgan stanley have noted that energy major share prices are becoming increasingly anchored by their dividend distributions unfortunately big oil s dividend expectations remain rather static despite substantial increases to free cash flow forecasts the bank has said ms says energy investors are only valuing the cash flow paid to them and are giving little credit to cash flow retained within companies for expansion purposes it s a sentiment that has been supported by clark williams derry energy finance analyst at ieefa a non profit organization and kathy hipple a finance professor at bard college in new york williams derry has warned that there s a tremendous degree of investor skepticism regarding the business models of oil and gas firms thanks to the deepening climate crisis and the urgent need to pivot away from fossil fuels indeed williams derry says the market kind of likes it when oil companies shrink and aren t going all out on new production but instead use the extra cash generated from improved commodity prices to pay down debt and reward investors meanwhile hipple has argued that oil and gas companies can no longer afford to brush off the ongoing climate crisis from flooding in europe and china to extreme heat in the pacific northwest

concerns about its ability to switch swiftly to renewable energy despite improving cash flows with low carbon assets set to contribute only 10 15 of estimated earnings by 2030 it is far too early for

with our customers to provide customized power management solutions at the rig site that result in improved environmental and economic outcomes within the constructs of a smaller industry going forward reducing our operating cost structure remains a high priority for the company and steps have been underway to make this happen recent actions will result in an estimated annualized savings of

performance for presenting trends in the company s core businesses this measure is used by the company to facilitate period to period comparisons in operating performance of the company s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods the company believes that segment operating income loss is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers additionally it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons however segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss a performance measure determined in accordance with gaap as

by louis golino special to coinweek in the weeks since the first part of this piece u s mint products for the second half of 2021 winners and losers was published some of the predictions made there have already been proven to be correct the air force silver medal whose sale was delayed from june 22 to july 13 and whose mintage was limited to 10 000 did not sell out instantly as was expected but it did become currently unavailable after about two weeks it is now bringing about 200 on ebay with some sales below issue price and some others well above keep in mind that after fees shipping and taxes sellers are barely making a profit at these levels but that shouldn t matter to those who bought the piece for the art and to support our military proof silver eagles the 2021 w american silver eagle proof coin the first silver proof of the type 2 or reverse of 2021 silver eagle whose release was delayed from july 1 to 20 did sell out instantly some collectors were not able to place an order before the piece became unavailable after 18 minutes and are as usual writing about their ordeal in blog posts and letters to editors but it is important to remember that a major reason the coin sold out so fast besides the high demand for silver and for the new design is that as i noted in part one of this article the coin could be purchased through the enrollment program and 10 of the product limit was available to bulk purchase dealers the mint had to cut off enrollment orders about a month before the release due to high demand but that gave buyers who acted in time including those who read this column the opportunity to purchase the coin without any hassles moreover the three per household order limit did not apply to enrollments also keep in mind the coin may be offered in another product later since it was sold only with a product and not a mintage limit total sales of 384 532 coins were just reported which includes bulk dealer sales of 2 142 40 coin lots plus 298 852 individual coins apparently the bulk orders are considered a separate product as for the aftermarket raw coins are bringing around 150 each while proof 70s are selling for 200 and more for special labels a healthy premium over the 73 issue price and major retail dealers contacted their regular customers with offers to purchase the coin for 125 each in one case i know of and a little less in another i expect those prices to soften a bit as more coins come onto the market in the coming weeks so those looking to sell probably want to do that soon it appears that recent efforts by the mint to improve their retail site and go after bots had at least some positive impact most collectors i know were able to get orders in that day which was certainly not the case in several other recent instances the remaining products to be offered from august through the end of the year include primarily the new silver dollars the american liberty gold coin the american palladium eagle and some others silver dollars on august 3 the united states mint will offer the 2021 d and 2021 s morgan silver dollars to be sold with household limits of three per coin and a product limit of 175 000 although they do not have a stated mintage limit the mint said on may 4 that it does not plan to offer them in another product like a set later this year and stressed how stretched it is in securing sufficient planchets for these coins in addition to the 2021 silver eagles of both types and other coins buyers should be prepared for an instant sellout likely within 10 minutes or less and should do whatever has worked for them before hopefully the mint s recent improvements and the lowering of the order limit will enable more collectors to secure coins on august 10 the final silver dollars for the year the 2021 p morgan and 2021 peace dollars will be offered with the same limits unless changed before then expect more of the same as for the aftermarket as my colleague chris bulfinch recently noted at the moment the only market for the coins offered in april the 2021 cc and 2021 o privy mark silver dollars is on ebay and dealers are waiting to assess the market as we get close to the october shipment of these coins i concur with his view that prices will likely rise after buyers see them in hand and after dealer promotions start the fact that the prices these coins have been selling for on ebay have been so consistent for months rather than dipping like most hot issues do after a period is also a good sign examples graded ms70 already presold for as much as 1 000 apiece in some cases will also help support the market for these coins which will probably not cool off much until next year bullion sales overall i expect the morgan and peace dollars and the new type 2 silver eagles to be the hottest issues of 2021 as for the bullion versions of the new eagles we finally have sales data from the mint which shows that only 13 106 500 type 1 silver eagles were sold 5 144 000 type 2 coins have been sold to date type 1 numbers should not change but type 2 will increase over the course of 2021 as for american gold eagles type 1 numbers are 426 500 1 ounce 31 000 ½ oz 56 000 ¼ oz and 150 000 1 10th oz coins while sales to date of type 2 coins are 201 500 25 000 30 000 and 90 000 respectively of note is that the half ounce and tenth ounce type 1 gold coins have mintages that are low for their types compared to prior years in particular the tenth ounce bullion of this type is the lowest for that size of the series and the half ounce is tied for the third lowest with 1990 both coins are difficult to locate now and premiums for those in stock are higher than for type 2 with the 2021 type 1 tenth bringing 100 or more over spot per coin someday that might seem like a bargain if it continues to remain the lowest for that size and or gold goes up substantially in addition so far the number of fractional size gold type 2 coins on the market which will increase later is quite small especially with the demand for the new design which helps explain the high premiums on them at the moment other than the tight physical market and high demand for bullion first and last sale last week the mint announced an unusual upcoming sale starting august 9 to its network of authorized bullion dealers of the final 200 000 type 1 silver eagles struck and the first 200 000 type 2 silver coins plus the final 15 000 type 1 gold 1 ounce eagles and first 15 000 type 2 of that size that will be sold through retail bullion dealers undoubtedly many of those coins will be sold graded at considerable premiums while this is something other world mints have done often in conjunction with grading companies that note first of 500 coins struck and similar notations it will be a first for the u s mint and an even more unusual move is the mint s plan to offer through a public auction four coin sets of type 1 and type 2 examples of the silver eagle and 1 ounce gold eagle that were personally struck by mint director david j ryder that will be limited to 500 four coin sets american liberty after the sale of proof gold eagles this week and then the 2021 s proof silver eagle and special eagle sets in august on august 17 the coast guard 2 5 ounce silver medal will be offered if limited to 10 000 like the air force medal it should sell out but probably not immediately then comes the first new design in the american liberty program since the 2019 coin that resembles to a degree the 10 indian gold coin of saint gaudens because of the rays emanating from liberty s head this program has from its start in 2015 been conceived to showcase new and moderns ways of depicting liberty initially many thought that meant only lady liberties of different racial and ethnic backgrounds and despite plenty of naysaying from the blogosphere those coins have mostly proved quite popular with the price of gold and premiums on 1 ounce gold coins being the main limitation on sales but after david ryder became the mint s director he signaled an interest in moving away from the allegorical representation of liberty as a female as has been the practice since the mint s founding and which is rooted in the ancient greek and roman personification of ideals like liberty as deities for 2021 the mint is launching the most unusual modern image of liberty it has ever used a mustang horse bucking off a western style saddle designed to symbolize the american colonies breaking free from british rule although the design was met with some consternation and even criticism when first proposed and then reviewed by the design committees now that we see what the design translated into a coin looks like from mint photos reactions appear to be more positive if the mint issued another smaller version i would expect it to sell well as did the 2018 tenth ounce version of the 2017 american liberty 100 gold coin whose sales were about 9 000 higher than that of the larger coin but with gold at 1 800 or so and the mint s premiums the highest ever at almost 1 000 a coin the 2017 is still being sold at 2 765 it is hard to see a sell out or much aftermarket potential no product or mintage limits have been announced but something much lower than the 100 000 used in 2017 and 2019 would be a good idea half that would likely be sufficient even accounting for the historically positive reception to western and animal themes on our coins in addition to issuing perhaps another tenth ounce version of the 2021 coin a silver medal would be especially popular in the larger 2 5 ounce format like the last liberty silver medal was in 2019 as were the 1 ounce 2017 and 2015 silver medals but neither 2021 product has been announced to date and perhaps one or both will appear next year american palladium eagle the fifth release of the american palladium eagle program comes on september 2 which like the 2018 coin will be a proof issue no details on product or mintage limits have yet been announced it is unclear how a second proof meets the requirements of the enabling legislation that created this program which says each year s coin is supposed to have a different finish than the prior coins unless it is something different such as an enhanced proof sales have been declining for this series mostly because the price of palladium the best performing commodity of the past five years has shot up to about 2 700 an ounce today and reached 3 000 last year with the mint s premiums the 2019 and 2020 coins which have respectively reverse proof and uncirculated burnished finishes are still available from the mint and priced at 3 350 each most buyers who can afford to spend that kind of money on coins are likely to be buying high grade and better date 20 saint gaudens pieces or rare coins from the 18th and 19th centuries the conditions that pushed palladium to its lofty current level which are mainly a supply deficit and increased demand for catalytic converters in cars may change over time as more electric vehicles enter the market making it somewhat risky to buy the eagle version at current levels and that explains the sales trends the 2019 coin was initially priced at just under 2 000 and has to date sold 18 228 units compared to about 15 000 each in 2017 and 2018 because more coins were available and the finish is distinctive but sales really slowed as the coin got to 3 000 and more and are not likely to ever reach the max of 30 000 it is likely the mint produced 20 000 coins initially by the time the 2020 issue was launched spot palladium and the premium had pushed the price of the coin to the 3 000 range and sales to date have reached 9 314 of a max of 10 000 the mint seems to have correctly gauged demand for this one other than the latest american innovation dollars and the 2021 mint set the remaining highlights for the year are the 2021 limited edition silver proof set which will include the 2021 silver half dollar two quarters and dime and either the 2021 w or 2021 s american silver eagle proof coin some years it is the west point and some years the san francisco coin and on september 17 the george herbert walker bush coin and chronicles set i expect the coin and chronicles set to be a strong seller and probably an early sell out former president g h w bush remains broadly popular with the american public as the statesmen who guided the country out of the cold war and these sets have done well in the past plus it s been five years since the last ones for presidents ford and reagan were released these sets are well presented and packaged with the 1 coin for the respective president a silver version of their inaugural medal and other items like postage stamps along with informative
