as the biden administration scrambles to try to contain inflation or at least make a public relations show of it precious metals investors are wondering how much longer gold and silver prices will remain contained metals markets got a bit of a lift this week through thursday but have pulled back a bit here today as of this friday recording gold is flat for the week now to trade at 1 860 per ounce and silver is down 20 cents or 0 9 this week to trade at 22 12 an ounce turning to the platinum group metals platinum is this week s standout performer with a robust 7 7 advance to come in at 1 039 and finally palladium prices are down 1 9 to trade at 2 039 per ounce while precious metals are showing some signs of emerging strength here they remain depressed compared to other raw materials gasoline prices for example are setting record after record across the country on thursday the national average hit 4 72 a gallon in california it s now over 6 00 consumers who are frustrated with skyrocketing costs for fuel food and other essentials are giving president joe biden poor marks for his handling of the economy the white house is desperately trying to revive biden s tanking poll numbers ahead of the mid term elections and to do that the president needs to appear to be tackling the inflation problem on tuesday biden convened a rare one on one meeting with the chairman of the federal reserve biden insisted he respects the fed s so called independence but he was clearly leaning on chairman jerome powell to do more to combat rising prices powell is in a tough spot he oversaw a massive central bank stimulus intervention to help accommodate the biden administration s spending agenda now he s being asked to withdraw some of that stimulus without crashing financial markets in the process the administration now acts surprised that all the spending and borrowing it pushed forward helped create an inflation problem last year while treasury secretary janet yellen was promoting biden s build back better agenda she testified before congress that the trillions in new spending wouldn t contribute to inflation now she is being forced by inflation realities to backtrack yellen went on cnn this week and admitted that she got it wrong very wrong financial market commentator while president biden passes the buck on inflation secretary yellen issues a mea culpa treasury secretary janet yellen i was wrong then about umm the path that inflation umm would take as i mentioned there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and umm supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that i didn t at the time didn t fully understand perhaps yellen should have listened to former treasury secretary larry summers a democrat who served under bill clinton summers panned the build back better agenda and warned that excessive fiscal stimulus would create the very inflation problem that we are now seeing play out of course nobody has a crystal ball when it comes to the economy and markets while some trends are largely predictable others aren t black swan events such as pandemics wars terrorist attacks and flash crashes can devastate an investment portfolio that is highly concentrated in a particular asset class that s why broad diversification is key to navigating uncertain times if there is one investment theme that is close to 100 certain to play out it is that the u s dollars in which all investments are denominated will continue to depreciate it is the nature of fiat currency regimes that they produce inflation that is their very purpose politicians and central bankers don t want to be constrained by the strict limitations imposed by a hard money system that is why they sneer at the suggestion that gold and silver could still function as money in a modern economy gold is antiquated they say but in reality the fiat monetary regime is based on obsolete ideas that should have been relegated to the dustbin of history after the fall of the soviet union the central planning mindset holds that purported experts need to be put in positions of power to do things like fix interest rates and intervene whenever markets or the economy get off track but as we ve seen the central planners at the treasury department and federal reserve can t even accurately predict the outcomes of their own actions public confidence in government and the federal reserve is plummeting when it comes to their handling of the economy that is one reason why demand for physical precious metals is growing the u s mint continues to struggle to keep up with buying volumes for its american eagle gold and silver coins last month the mint sold 147 000 ounces of gold eagles that was its biggest may tally since 2010 overall gold bullion sales are running four times higher than recent historical averages silver buying meanwhile is running a bit cooler lagging spot price performance this spring seems to have discouraged some investors from stepping into the market but bargain hunters are finding silver to be especially attractive at these levels nobody knows how much longer the silver market will remain capped prices could blow through overhead resistance at any time though when they do silver holders will be rewarded for their patience and perseverance in other news tennessee governor bill lee just signed legislation officially making the volunteer state the 42nd in the nation to remove sales taxes from constitutional sound money this victory is directly attributable to efforts by money metals exchange and hundreds if not thousands of our tennessee customers the grassroots pressure made the difference in getting sales tax repeal bill passed according to house and senate members who commented repeatedly about the groundswell of support they witnessed tennessee investors savers and small businesses can now acquire gold silver platinum and palladium bullion and coins without being slapped with taxes as high as 10 depending on the purchaser s specific location money metals and its sound money project chalked up two other wins this year virginia and alabama building on big wins last year with the elimination of precious metals sales taxes in ohio and arkansas including tennessee 42 u s states now fully or partially exempt gold and silver from the sales taxes that leaves 8 just states and the district of columbia as the jurisdictions that still harshly penalize citizens seeking to protect their savings against the serial devaluation of the federal reserve note
jody grant chairman emeritus of texas capital bank and chairman of the woodall rodgers park foundation and his wife sheila a community volunteer and park foundation board member are credited by many with jump starting dallas s downtown deck park in this interview the couple talk about the challenges and triumphs they ve experienced along the way q before we delve into the park itself can you give me a sense of your personal partnership jody grant there s some things that if she tells you she ll have to kill you we re both in our first marriage we met in college i graduated from college in 1960 from southern methodist university as an undergrad then i got an mba from the university of texas you can go online and find this out sheila grant can t about me jg actually she was strolling across the campus in a stroller we moved to dallas in 1990 after living in fort worth for 15 years before that q the deck park has been in the planning stages for years how did you two get involved jg in 2004 i was on the board of the chamber of commerce one day i got a call from tom leppert then the chamber president who said would you head up our efforts as it relates to downtown and i said sure be happy to because i was interested in urban spaces it became apparent to sheila and me that this area was not going to be complete unless this park was promoted and brought forward the ditch the moat between uptown and downtown was just such a barrier i was officing in the texas capital bank building and i looked down on this area and nobody ever walked from uptown to downtown because it was noisy and environmentally unfriendly those cars created wind of their own and it was like you were in a wind tunnel so women just wouldn t do it the real estate council also thought this park was a good idea and adopted the concept as a philanthropic target of theirs i found out about that and through connections i called john zogg and linda owen linda was then president of trec so we met and i told them what i wanted to do they had allocated 1 million to this but the 1 million wasn t enough to get started so i said that sheila and i would bring in another 1 million and texas capital bank would bring another 1 million to make 3 million that was the money that was needed to do the feasibility study sg i will say that my vision was somewhat different having been involved in the arts world forever i felt like with the fact that the whole arts district was going to come together as a unit that it was then time to have this park as the village square covering that moat also i grew up here and after traveling all over the world i felt like dallas has never been defined by traditions with this park this whole area will be the blimp shot of dallas and we can now have traditions that people will be able to take their children and their grandchildren to that will help define dallas also growing up here i felt like we had a lack of green space in dallas the major cities all over the world have a signature park which we did not have here jg i look at things probably from more of an economic development point of view but i agree with everything sheila said downtown dallas was just destroyed in the 1980s as a result of the recession dallas has had a challenge ever since what do you do to bring back downtown dallas it takes a lot of different projects coming together at the same time sg i think also that having traveled so much again we had seen many parks where there were free concerts and events and we wanted to have that in our city to where the symphony which i have been very close to could perform here for free as could the opera the theater center nothing will be charged for in this park except for food in the restaurant or the kiosk or whatever that has been our goal from day one q what was your main motivation jody jg i like things and projects that have an impact when we lived in fort worth i 30 went through downtown fort worth and the highway department was going to expand i 30 from four lanes to 10 lanes and it was going to encroach on the historic buildings as well as the water gardens i try to think out of the box so i wrote a half page op ed piece for the star telegram it suggested that what the highway department was going to do was a tragedy and that there was an opportunity to move that highway 1 000 yards to a half mile to the south where there was a natural transportation corridor and re create the southern end of downtown fort worth that simple op ed piece became a movement and we ended up hiring all kinds of professionals and we blocked the highway expansion it took 22 23 years that was me looking at a situation and saying something needs to be done and that s kind of the way i looked at this as well as a team with linda and others our first job was to get the city to buy into this in late 2004 i called then mayor laura miller and got an appointment with her in my opinion others might disagree she had lost cowboys stadium to arlington and there was a lot of noise about that i think she looked upon as a great victory for her so she bought into it hook line and sinker before i knew it at her state of the city address in february 2005 she pre announced this whole effort all of a sudden the genie was out of the bottle and that was fine getting laura and the city staff to get this project to where it is has been critical q it was pretty complicated wasn t it jg it was the first thing i did was form a 501 c 3 and got a local law firm to volunteer their time and effort linda owen john zogg and i were the organizing founders of the 501 c 3 and were the trustees while this was going on i recruited a board of private citizens to be an advisory board a diversified who s who of dallas including ross perot jr ray hunt harlan crow albert black i needed that to show a groundswell of support for this so that we could get into the bond election of 2006 fortunately laura was behind this so we worked through 2005 and were included in the 2006 bond election for 20 million sg i was amazed at what he was able to accomplish when you tell jody he can t do something he decides definitely that he can for example i said well i don t think you can go down there to austin and get money and i hope we haven t just dropped our 1 million down the drain we were told in the beginning this can t happen it won t happen it s just impossible q who told you that sg just about everybody with reason actually because dallas has not embraced green space like say chicago or new york have jg laura said okay we ll put you in the bond election but you ve got to raise 10 million in private money and i need evidence of that so while we were beginning to think about this i was out recruiting that board and also trying to find private money i got to 7 million but we were running out of time so i went to one of our leading citizens and explained the problem and he said tell her you ve got 10 million and if i have to i ll write a check so that was what happened we got in the bond election and that was our first public money for the state monies we hired a lobbyist david cain using other connections that we had in austin also we were able to find two tranches of 10 million each in the state transportation enhancement program sg i would say lt gov david dewhurst was very instrumental in helping us too david is a great visionary and saw the difference the project could make to dallas q so things were moving along well jg yes but then a major issue we ran into that nobody had anticipated was the recession that began in 2007 2008 money was really hard to raise during that period of time the stock market went into the tank the foundations that we had relied upon for money put the brakes on it was just a very very difficult period sg but then you had the brilliant idea of going after the federal stimulus money i think that was genius on jody s part to even think about it jg when program was being unveiled we figured this money is going someplace and texas should get its fair share because we ve got a shovel ready project so i called the team together and we brainstormed around a conference table and came up with about 7 million or 8 million worth of easily justifiable federal funds that we thought we could apply for then we got with a fellow named tom shelton with carter burgess who was really good about sourcing public money and we eventually got 16 7 million which saved the day for us during a very critical time q how did you go about money raising on the private side jg we just got on our hands and knees and begged the private money was always the challenge sg we also have kept this a very lean mean machine here we ve never had more than three or four people working here in this office and we ve never had a professional development person we wanted to make sure that every dollar that our donors gave us was spent on building this park and not on a huge staff that meant that jody and i did fundraising and in addition we both served on basically every single committee we rarely go to bed before 1 a m jody has threatened to smash my blackberry because he would like to go to bed a little earlier jg we also decided to go on field trips to millenium park in chicago and to bryant park in new york city in chicago importantly as it relates to fundraising john bryant who d been the ceo of sarah lee spent a lot of time with us he said look you ve got to go ask for big gifts you cannot nickel and dime this thing you can t sell bricks and sell this park those field trips were real eye openers we saw in millenium a park that had such tremendous quality in it it just was magnificent then we went to bryant park and saw something different it s a quality park as well but it s more about programming and the activities that happen in the park thanks to dan biederman so this began to shape our vision of what we thought this park should be sg at the art institute of chicago they quadrupled their attendance once millenium park opened that really intrigued me to think that maybe this park would help the other arts groups in the arts district jg it also was important to get the owners of the real estate around here to buy into this project and to support it so a lot of the early private money came from the various owners of the real estate out of texas capital bank we had 4 million alone i m proud of the fact that those people who had a stake in downtown put their money where their mouth was that was critically important to getting others to support the project q how many private donors did you have jg i think it was around 50 including people who ve given as little as 1 000 the communities foundation of texas also stepped up with a 5 million grant from the w w caruth foundation that happened in 2007 right at the onset of the recession that was huge this project would not have moved forward without that sg charles wyly was chairman of the foundation and jody was the incoming chairman and charles was very much behind this project he thought it would be very helpful to the wyly theater and the winspear opera house that helped to get the 5 million which was a little bit extraordinary jg right now we have a total of 108 million the woodall rodgers park foundation will be responsible for the park s operation from now for the next 50 years and for four 10 year periods after that should we choose to renew it so while the building of the park has been a public private partnership the operation of it will be truly a private endeavor we still have about 7 million in features that if we are able to get them named we will raise that much additional money that would put us at about 115 million our goal is 110 million so far we ve sold some trees at 25 000 each you get a plaque for that for continuing operations we will have an operating budget of about 2 5 million to 3 million a year our challenge will be to run the park on a break even basis q how are you going to do that sg the template is the biederman plan from bryant park he gets sponsors for various things in the park and then he gets that source of revenue from a restaurant and he has never had to go out and raise any money at all revenue just comes in q but all the park activities will be free so you need corporate support jg not corporate donations but business sponsorships or it could be individuals we ll be going to somebody like an at t for example and asking them if they will sponsor x event in the park chase bank will be the lead sponsor for our opening in addition to their naming of the chase promenade a 3 million gift q how much money do you expect the restaurant to generate each year jg i would hope it might cover as much as 20 percent of our budget that s total for food and beverage services in the park including catering the food service concept has two components one is a nice restaurant with both indoor and outdoor dining the other is a kiosk which will be more fast food hamburgers salads breakfasts the restaurant will open after the park does we anticipate in the june july timeframe of 2013 building this restaurant on top of the bridge has been very complex so what we thought was a perfect plan turned out not to be so perfect the devil s very much in the details q you ve been very hands on throughout the process it seems sg yes i went to talk with joe volpe at the metropolitan opera for instance i went early on to doug adams who was then heading the dallas symphony i talked to the american film institute about how to do our film when we were working on the performance pavilion i went to rachel moore at american ballet theater and said we need to visit with the architect because he really needs to understand what it s going to take to have a ballet company in that pavilion and that resonated with the architect initially he had poles in the middle of the pavilion for example so the dancers would have knocked themselves out the musicians wouldn t have had any place to sit but it was going to be a gorgeous piece of art so i decided to take rachel we walked in and the architect was dressed all in black had his arms crossed and it was very tense but by the time we left three hours later the poles were gone and rachel had done her magic it was wanting the very best and having access to those people that i think really made a difference q what will you do once the park opens sg i m looking forward to getting back to my world of ballet and involvement in the other arts that i ve had to sort of put aside at the same time this is our child and there are donors who are expecting a lot out of this park because they believed in what we were telling them we were going to do so we will have a long going participation it just won t be as intense jg sheila s point is a good one many of these gifts are to be paid out over a period of time the normal payout is five years a few are a little longer so i have a responsibility to stay around and make sure that the money is spent as it was intended q won t you feel a little let down after the opening jg i m going to breathe a huge sigh of relief voila i can go on vacation sg it will be a huge sigh of relief we ve done it we ve accomplished it the excitement of then having an operating park is going to be our dream come true seven years of a dream

in this series we bust the jargon and explain a popular investing term or theme here it s discount rate something to do with the sales no and confusingly the term has two distinct different meanings the first of these is the interest rate that the federal reserve the us central bank known as the fed charges banks for loans when they need a back up source of funding right direction the system has its critics and it is not a crystal ball more of a guide the aim is to make an informed decision the second meaning is an element in an analysis designed to show the viability of an investment it is used by firms considering whether to launch a takeover of another company or deciding whether to commit capital to a project in such instances discount rate is sometimes called the hurdle rate tell me more about the fed s rate the loans advanced by the fed to banks are usually made overnight but this period the window can be extended in times of emergencies such as during the global financial crisis of 2008 09 such was the requirement for these funds that in october 2008 just after the fall of lehman brothers discount rate borrowing reached 404billion against the monthly average of 0 7billion in the period since 1959 why has the us discount rate been rising at present the discount rate is 1 per cent a year ago it was 0 25 per cent the rate which is set by the fed s board of governors is one of the mechanisms the central bank uses to control the money supply and thus inflation a priority at present jerome powell the fed chairman told the american people inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing we re moving expeditiously to bring it back down what about the second meaning the discount rate is used in dcf discounted cash flow analysis dcf calculated in a complex formula is a way of working out whether an investment is worth its current cost by analysing its future revenues the calculation uses a discount rate which is the return that you wish to achieve it helps you determine the maximum that you are willing to pay today for a return at some time in the future taking account of the risks involved many stock market analysts rely on dcf attempting to work out what future cash flows will be when scrutinising the accounts of companies to establish whether their shares are worth buying today is this a reliable way of choosing an investment the system has its critics it is not a crystal ball more of a guide the aim is to make an informed decision if you can make an investment at a cost below the sum of the discounted cash flows the investment may be undervalued with the potential for a handsome payback if the cost is higher than those cash flows the investment could be overvalued of course there is no guarantee

tesla ceo elon musk has ordered a pause in hiring in all tesla factories worldwide as he also planned to cut about 10 of salaried staff a message sent to executives on thursday laid out his concerns his super bad feeling about the economy the dire outlook came two days after the billionaire told staff to return to the workplace or leave and adds to a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders about the risks of recession tesla shares fell 9 in u s trade on friday after the reuters report the tech heavy nasdaq ixic was down about 2 in another email to employees on friday musk said tesla will be reducing salaried headcount by 10 as it has become overstaffed in many areas but hourly headcount will increase he said note this does not apply to anyone actually building cars battery packs or installing solar musk wrote in the email seen by reuters almost 100 000 people were employed at tesla and its subsidiaries at the end of 2021 its annual sec filing showed it did not break down numbers of salaried and hourly workers the texas based company was not immediately available for comment musk has warned in recent weeks about the risks of recession but his email ordering a hiring freeze and staff cuts was the most direct and high profile message of its kind from the head of an automaker with others describing sky high demand read more elon musk has a uniquely informed insight into the global economy we believe that a message from him would carry high credibility adam jonas an analyst morgan stanley said in a report so far demand for tesla cars and other electric vehicles ev has remained strong and many traditional indicators of a downturn including increasing dealer inventories and incentives in the united states have not materialised but tesla has struggled to restart production at its shanghai factory after covid 19 lockdowns forced costly outages
beijing china in what is being hailed a breakthrough for the country s national security nuclear authorities in china have announced that their researchers have discovered rich uranium deposits deep below the earth according to scientists involved in the project large industrial grade deposits were found at depths previously thought impossible to reach increasing china s estimated total uranium reserve to more than two million tons this week the china national nuclear corporation stated this world leading project is a major breakthrough for our country with its nuclear power supply increasing faster than any country in the world with seven or eight new reactors being built each year china s demand for uranium has been increasing however as most of china s uranium mines are small in scale and offer poor ore quality more than 70 percent of its supply comes from countries including kazakhstan canada and australia this reliance on foreign sources is considered by beijing to be a security risk li ziying director of the beijing research institute of uranium geology said the discoveries challenged mainstream theories on uranium deposit formations as it is generally believed that the deposits can only be found in shallow and geophysically stable areas however some of the largest uranium deposits recently discovered in southern china are located at depths of more than 1 500 meters below the surface according to chinese nuclear authorities li and his colleagues discovered that uranium could rise straight from the earth s mantle and become trapped in small hotspots several thousand meters below ground during massive tectonic collisions in an interview with science and technology daily li said the difficulty was that there is usually only a small hint on the surface of deep uranium deposits stating locating it is as challenging as finding a compact disc over an area of 10 000 sq km meanwhile a beijing based researcher studying nuclear fuel who asked to remain anonymous said the discovery will not fully eliminate china s dependence on imported uranium because of the numerous cost and engineering challenges of extracting the deposits but in the long term it will likely have a profound impact on china s position in the global market li added

washington u s employers added 390 000 jobs in may extending a streak of solid hiring that has bolstered an economy under pressure from high inflation and rising interest rates last month s gain reflects a resilient job market that has so far shrugged off concerns that the economy will weaken in the coming months as the federal reserve steadily raises interest rates to fight inflation the unemployment rate remained a low 3 6 in may just above a half century low the labor department said friday the job growth in may was high enough to keep the fed on track to pursue what s likely to be the fastest series of rate hikes in more than 30 years stock market futures fell friday after the government released the jobs report reflecting that concern businesses in many industries remain desperate to hire because their customers have kept spending freely despite intensifying concerns about high inflation americans finances have been buoyed by rising pay and an unusually large pile of savings that were accumulated during the pandemic particularly by higher income households workers in general are enjoying nearly unprecedented bargaining power the number of people who are quitting jobs typically for better positions at higher pay has been at or near a record high for six months in may friday s jobs report showed more americans came off the sidelines of the workforce and found jobs a sign that rising wages and plentiful opportunities are encouraging people to look for work rising prices might also have led some to take jobs the number of people ages 55 or over who are working rose last month suggesting that some older americans are unretiring after leaving their jobs or being laid off during the pandemic and its aftermath average hourly wages rose 10 cents in may to 31 95 the government said a solid gain but not enough to keep up with inflation compared with 12 months earlier hourly pay climbed 5 2 down from a 5 5 year over year gain in april and the second straight drop more moderate pay raises could ease inflationary pressures in the economy and help sustain growth nearly every large industry added workers in may one major exception was retail which shed nearly 61 000 positions some large retailers including walmart and target have reported disappointing sales and earnings last month walmart said it had over hired and then reduced its head count through attrition construction companies added 36 000 jobs a hopeful sign for americans who have bought new homes that aren t yet built because of labor and parts shortages shipping and warehousing companies still struggling to keep up with growing online commerce added 47 000 jobs restaurants hotels and entertainment venues hired 84 000 the strength of the job market is itself contributing to inflationary pressures with wages rising across the economy companies are passing on at least some of their increased labor costs to their customers in the form of higher prices the costs of food gas rent and other items which fall disproportionately on lower income households are accelerating at nearly the fastest pace in 40 years inflation had begun surging last year as spiking demand for cars furniture electronic equipment and other physical goods collided with overwhelmed supply chains and parts shortages more recently prices for such services as airline tickets hotel rooms and restaurant meals have jumped as americans have shifted more of their spending to those areas to try to cool spending and slow inflation the fed last month raised its short term rate by a half point its biggest hike since 2000 to a range of 0 75 to 1 two additional half point rate increases are expected this month and in july and some fed officials have suggested in recent speeches that if inflation doesn t show signs of slowing they could implement yet another half point increase in september the fed s moves have already sharply elevated mortgage rates and contributed to drops in sales of new and existing homes the rate hikes have also magnified borrowing costs for businesses which may respond by reducing their investment in new buildings and equipment slowing growth in the process
most new yorkers don t think much of staten island in fact they don t think about it at all and when they do it s about how different it is with under half a million people it s the smallest borough and the whitest unlike the rest of the city staten island voted for president donald trump twice and it doesn t have a subway staten island in the nineteenth century from boomtown to forgotten borough by new york city councilman joseph borelli arcadia when it became part of new york city in 1898 it encountered issues that remain intractable to this day former borough president james s oddo writes in a foreword to joseph borelli s staten island in the nineteenth century from boomtown to forgotten borough we share little in common with the rest of what was then known as the city of greater new york oddo observes it is likely that we never will representing the island s south shore on the new york city council borelli s not a disinterested party and he remains unconvinced this union was or is a good idea there can be no doubt that being a part of new york city has had its benefits borelli writes yet perhaps it is time to ask the question again what price has been paid for this privilege borelli s book begins as the 18th century was closing with a population of 3 838 in 1790 a growing staten island rushed to provide services a poorhouse was built in 1803 to shelter the impoverished public schools were opened and a courthouse was erected twelve dollars were spent on wooden stocks to publicly shame petty criminals a view of the quarantine station from upper new york bay painted and engraved in 1833 courtesy of the library of congress many residents prospered daniel tompkins rose to the top serving as a new york supreme court judge and governor before becoming james monroe s vice president a wealthy developer he loaned the government 1 4 million to help finance the war of 1812 a staunch abolitionist he railed against unjust and cruel bondage and as governor he signed a bill emancipating every enslaved new yorker other residents chose staten island to escape politics after aaron burr fatally wounded alexander hamilton in a duel he was tried acquitted for treason and endured a ruinous divorce hamilton s son represented burr s ex wife the former veep died at the port richmond hotel shunned in 1836 he breathed his last in the presence of and his eyes were closed by a passing stranger noted a journalist general and 11 time president of mexico antonio lópez de santa anna also sought refuge in richmond county life had gone disastrously for him after his triumph at the alamo and in 1865 the embattled military man fled his country ending up in staten island reportedly he disembarked with barrels of chicle an extract of the sapodilla tree he thought it might prove a cheap substitute for rubber general antonio lópez de santa anna president of the republic of mexico lived on staten island in 1847 and 1865 courtesy of the library of congress attempts to refine the raw material failed as did the general s efforts to recruit an army to restore him to power he slunk home leaving the chicle behind however his business partner amateur inventor thomas adams took another look at it and decided the stuff might make a new kind of candy and so chewing gum was invented in staten island or so claimed the chiclets company perhaps the island s greatest success was cornelius vanderbilt born in 1794 he dropped out of school at 11 to work his father s ferryboat he eventually bought his own small boat taking passengers to manhattan for 18 cents by the end of his first year vanderbilt had made 1 000 and by the time he was 23 he had built a steamboat empire when he died in 1877 vanderbilt had not only amassed a gilded age fortune of over 100 million but set a record for the single largest charitable contribution in u s history 1 million to build the tennessee university which bears his name daniel d tompkins courtesy of the library of congress but there were also troubled times on staten island most springing from residents resentments in 1799 the state legislature used eminent domain to seize 30 acres on the island s north shore where it built a quarantine hospital for contagious travelers entering new york harbor it was borelli notes only the first time the powerful city government and the legislature would place unwanted albeit necessary facilities in the county other institutions including a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients followed outraging everyone reported the new york herald from the wealthy gentleman who occupy summer villas on the island to the humblest oysterman who works for his dollar a day finally in 1858 a mob of 400 staten islanders ordered patients out of their beds and burned the quarantine hospital to the ground an engraving published in harper s weekly depicting the violent raid on the quarantine station on sept 1 1858 courtesy of the library of congress the state sued staten island for damages but the point had been made the next medical facilities were established on floating barges and on two artificial islands but there was racial unrest on the island too true staten island was home to many liberal abolitionists one of them robert gould shaw would go on to lead and die with the union s famous glory battalion yet when the civil war draft began a week s worth of race riots erupted starting in manhattan before spreading to staten island by the time they had been quelled in july of 1863 a black neighborhood in stapleton had been destroyed and countless residents beaten shot or even lynched as it had with the quarantine riot the state held staten island taxpayers liable for the damages meanwhile as the century drew to a close manhattan power brokers worried the city s population stood at 1 5 million but chicago had reached 1 1 million and philadelphia was close behind new york city an 1894 pamphlet argued needed to permanently cement its status as america s largest city or relinquish its role as arbiter of business music society politics the drama everything manhattan had already annexed the bronx brooklyn which by then had absorbed much of queens and boasted a population of well over 1 million was the next obvious prize yet as afraid as new york may have been of chicago borelli writes industrialists feared that the inefficiencies of the port system was rendering it less desirable than new orleans boston baltimore and philadelphia to truly grow new york city didn t just need brooklyn s population it needed staten island s coastline first manhattan s government had to get the voters of brooklyn and staten island to sign on it wasn t easy brooklyn a major city in its own right was reluctant to relinquish its independence staten islanders were deeply suspicious of manhattan politicians yet when the referendum was held it passed proponents celebrated predicting better city services and lower taxes flash forward to 2022 despite decades of promises no rail link to the other boroughs has been built the island s fresh kills landfill the massive dump opened supposedly on a temporary basis in 1948 only closed in 2001 and was redeveloped as a park none of these slights have gone unnoticed in 1993 two thirds of residents voted to secede although the referendum was largely symbolic borelli though hasn t given up on the idea oysters were a staple of new yorkers diets often sold from stands like the one depicted in this drawing of fulton market in 1870 tottenville flourished as their popularity grew courtesy of the new york public

i nothing illustrates better the difference between the value of the american dollar and that of the inflated currency of the central european countries than the experience of a traveler in a second class vienna restaurant this man consumed an almost luxurious dinner and offered a twenty dollar gold coin to the head waiter called ober when he timidly presented his bill for three hundred kronen the waiter looked at the treasure with bewilderment and did not seem to know how much he ought to give in change he excused himself and went to the telephone to ask the proprietor the waiter was heard to say here is a gentleman sir who wants to pay with a twenty dollar gold piece how much am i to give for it having received the landlord s instructions the ober returned and said seriously i am to give you as much change sir as you desire this is perhaps the nearest approach to the truth so far as foreign exchange east of france and switzerland is concerned such a condition in conjunction with the business depression which has produced it leads of course to speculation business men professional men and even working men are valuta that is exchange mad and gambling is their main occupation the ambitious concentrate entirely upon foreign currencies and the american dollar is their goal but the american dollar is beyond the reach of most of these speculators in vienna a one dollar bill

and financial geniuses have been pondering over remedial measures these three years but yet conditions are getting steadily worse a two days rally in the exchange market is followed by a three weeks continuous slump and there is no way of stopping it just as there does not seem to be a way of stopping the presses in the stricken countries from printing the almost valueless paper money for the

the purchasing power of the money seem also to be impossible a living wage has to be figured in millions in russia and in hundreds of thousands in austria poland hungary and other central european countries and the depreciation of the currencies always greatly exceeds the tardy adjustment of wages of course this brings about frequent labor troubles just now for instance the polish mark has increased in value almost 500 per cent and as a consequence there are widespread labor troubles for the goods that are exported from poland are paid for in foreign currency and the amount of polish marks that can be bought in exchange for the foreign currency has been greatly reduced the employers are in consequence compelled to reduce wages which of course means strikes and disorders among the stricken countries there are some that actually lose money on the printing of their paper currency the cost of printing a one krone bill for instance considerably exceeds its purchasing value the same may be said of the russian ruble for that reason the russian government is now printing ruble notes in denominations of ten thousand rubles and soon these notes will be the smallest denomination circulating among the merchants at least however even in the folds of tragedy there always lurks some relieving humor and so it happens that there are many funny aspects even of this sad aftermath of the greatest human catastrophe on record some people make it a hobby to collect such queer and puzzling stories which circulate among the victims of and the speculators in exchange these stories seem to upset all accepted laws of economics and of finance those that tell of erstwhile millionaires princes and magnates going begging and formerly poor peasants weighing out bills by the pound or using paper money to stuff their straw ticks with are too common to relate the peasant who is paid 100 kronen polish marks or rubles for an apple and has 200 healthy apple trees and who is not willing or perhaps not able to count up to one hundred will naturally resort to weighing in order to balance accounts the erstwhile millionaire who finds that a suit of clothes costs him one tenth of his fortune will certainly get into the poorhouse in a very short time if he indulges himself too frequently such are the natural consequences of inflation and of the turning topsyturvy of everything we understand by the word value it is quite a common occurrence for owners of old issues of stock to find themselves multi millionaires by the advance of stock values following the depreciation of currency take for instance a share that was issued at a par of 100 seven years ago the 100 of those times is worth in vienna for instance 2000 times one hundred that is 200 000 five shares which cost the owner five hundred kronen a few years ago make him a multi millionaire to day but there are stocks issued by some great banks that have not advanced more than 400 per cent and indeed it may be said generally that the cases are very rare where the stock quotations have kept pace with the money fluctuations in the opposite direction nowadays a battered derby hat is worth as much as a share of the best bank stocks of financial institutions are not regarded as assets to be stored away as a source of income stocks to day are in fact only media for gambling in the years before the war the rentier that is the man who has retired from business and is living on the dividends of his shares was a citizen of standing par excellence in france these people still retain their status though to a lesser degree than before the war in central europe the type has entirely disappeared thousands of peasants following a time honored custom buried their silver coins against a rainy day these silver coins naturally retained their formal value but the hoarding was done on such an extensive scale that as early as 1918 all silver coins had disappeared from circulation in germany austria hungary yugoslavia rumania and poland to day a peasant who buried one hundred five kronen pieces is a millionaire he can exchange the five hundred kronen in silver for one million kronen in paper money in austria hungary alone there had been in circulation something like 200 000 000 kronen worth of silver money before the war it would take austria the enormous sum of 200 000 000 000 kronen to buy up her half of this hoarded silver currency it is not an uncommon occurrence for a man who leaves london with five hundred pounds sterling on a pleasuretrip to the continent and stops for several weeks in five different capitals living in luxury and spending money lavishly to return to london with more pounds sterling than he had when he started a newspaper man has actually gone through this experience he spent hundreds of thousands of kronen marks francs and leis and mind you did no business did not speculate and did no work all he did was to change his money five or six times the rest was done by the exchange fluctuations the fact of being a millionaire in those countries does not mean anything such a million is a million in figures but not in value and when such a million is converted into a sound currency the shrinkage is fabulous but the purchasing power of the depreciated currencies of central europe has not gone down quite in proportion with the decrease of their exchange value one million austrian kronen which were worth before the war almost 200 000 are worth to day not quite 120 but their purchasing value in austria is considerably more than that but of course to day when nobody knows what his kronen will be worth to morrow people are far less careful with their money than they used to be in times when their money had an unchanging cash value and when it commanded the power of an established and firm standard the only currency that commands respect is the highexchange currency such as the american english swiss and scandinavian among these the dollar tops all the rest the dollar is supreme all over europe but most particularly in central and eastern europe it is strange to find that the larger the denomination of the dollar bill the greater the value of each of its units a hundred dollar bill for instance is worth 110 worth of currency that is it is worth as much as 110 single one dollar bills it is impossible to fathom the mystery of this predilection for the one hundred dollar bill it is most surprising to hear the question in answer to an application for the exchange of 150 what denominations of the dollar when the questioner is asked what difference it makes the answer is that one hundreddollar bills will fetch ten per cent more than the same amount in a small denomination from that time on the traveler who had this experience was always most obliging in changing twenty fifty and one hundred dollar bills to smaller denominations when americans made the request to that effect as said before to be a millionaire means nothing in those countries somebody would mention for instance a friend of his just casually calling attention to the glorious fact of his being a millionaire the inevitable question would follow in dollars to be a millionaire in good currency is the only thing that commands respect there are two hundred million people in central and eastern europe who talk think and dream of nothing else than high exchange currency a dollar bill is a fortune how are they to get dollar bills thousands of people have taken up a novel occupation in munich vienna warsaw and budapest the possession of a new york or a chicago telephone directory constitutes a valuable business asset there are so many thousands of addresses in it all americans every one of them the owner of a certain number of dollar bills having nothing to offer in exchange for the dollar the only expedient left is to beg for it thousands of men are offering american addresses at five dollars in united states currency per thousand also texts of most ingenious begging letters the begging letters usually pretend to come from a poor sick woman mother of five children whose husband was killed in the war or from a sixteen year old beautiful girl photo inclosed who begs for just one dollar to save her aged mother and younger sisters from starvation adding with tearful entreaty that unless she gets the dollar she will have no other choice than to sell her honor to the first comer now if this story does not touch you to the extent of a dollar nothing will the writer however is not a sixteen year old girl but a fifty year old swindler frequently of some prison experience who in this way receives donations from abroad to the tune of fifty or a hundred dollars a month and lives in great luxury for such an amount is a princely income in that part of the world others have other means of getting hold of dollars returning immigrants receive special attention from the dollar hunters but in these cases it is not begging but an exchange manipulation that is the means to the end however in order to protect their returning nationals most of the governments have state officials meet every incoming steamer and these take their countrymen under their wings and get their dollars from them for the benefit of the government which serene body is just as anxious to get hold of the american dollar as any of its greedy citizens the governments need the foreign high exchange to keep their foreign representatives going a committee that is to go abroad on some mission would have to carry bales of money to cover expenses if there was no high exchange available governments have a special money press running to turn out the paper that will exchange the dollars of the returning immigrants one or more millions for every thousand dollars in some cases 10 000 one thousand kronen bills for ten onehundred dollar bills imagine the roll ten thousand big bills three times the size of a dollar bill ten pockets will not hold it ii a newspaper man traveling from switzerland to austria had a very amusing experience furnishing an excellent illustration of topsy turvydom in the foreign exchanges perhaps the story is best told in his own words i took the express to vienna in zürich it was lunch time i entered the dining car and had a table d hôte lunch on swiss territory in payment i tendered a ten franc note of swiss money i received two francs in change the dinner costing me eight francs in the course of the afternoon we crossed the swiss frontier into austrian territory dinner time came again i went to the dining car and i had a tabled hôte dinner this time in austria it was substantially the same meal i had had at noon in switzerland and was served by the same caterer the obliging waiter the same who waited on me in switzerland only six hours before gave me his reckoning in austrian currency and accepting the two swiss francs that i tendered in payment gave me 1700 austrian kronen in change the dinner cost 500 kronen the two swiss francs were worth 2200 kronen that day for the change that the waiter gave me from my two swiss francs i hired a room in a good vienna hotel at 700 kronen a day and on the remaining thousand kronen i lived a whole day in good style in short in switzerland they charge eight francs for a table d hôte dinner these eight francs are worth about a dollar and a half in american currency these eight francs are sufficient in vienna to pay a traveler s hotel bill and all his meals for four days a hungarian gentleman had a very profitable experience with swiss francs he forgot to declare some cigars for duty this happened in july 1916 when a swiss franc was worth one hungarian crown an argument arose between the homeward bound hungarian traveler and the swiss customs officer a blow followed and the consequence was that the swiss gendarme arrested the traveler the judge ruled that the prisoner was to deposit one thousand francs with the court and could then continue his trip the fine was to be deducted from that sum and the rest of the money was to reach him through the swiss consulate in budapest it was four years before the hungarian got his money in 1916 the thousand francs were equal to a thousand hungarian kronen from these a fine of twenty five francs was to be deducted had the hungarian received his money in 1916 the amount would have been simply 975 hungarian kronen but in 1920 when the 975 francs finally reached him he received 260 000 hungarian kronen the blow that he gave the swiss customs officer netted him over a quarter of a million the constant depreciation of currency seems to have a deteriorating influence upon morality newspapers are full of political scandals public corruption and the misdoings of bank swindlers defalcators and petty thieves the respect for property is diminishing in proportion to its higher money value and the amounts in which dishonesty deals are counted in millions it is not worth while to steal less the former monetary unit has no value the absolute worthlessness of it is clearly demonstrated by the munich brewery which named its bottled beer kronen bier using a one krone note as a label on its bottles for it would cost more to have labels printed than to buy one krone notes it has been pointed out before that the purchasing value of the austrian krone is far below its cost of printing everywhere is chaos anarchy and topsy turvydom take the case of the three german brothers of whom hans lichtig a prominent manufacturer of copper utensils is the eldest jacob a stock exchange broker the second and adolph the youngest adolph was the black sheep of the family a waster who never did a day s work in his life it happened in 1916 that the three brothers inherited from an uncle in holland 100 000 dutch guilders each the two elder and respectable brothers decided that adolph was not to be trusted with his 100 000 guilders and they got a court order declaring him a minor and restraining the executors from paying over his legacy to him adolph s money was deposited in a dutch bank at the hague until such time as his brothers should declare him able to manage his own affairs thus it happened that adolph was living on a pittance doled out to him by his two elder brothers who being good patriots invested their 100 000 guilders in war loans in 1920 they discovered that their war bonds were worth next to nothing the value of the copperutensil factory was also considerably reduced on account of the labor troubles and the business depression the second brother did not do any better but adolph still had his 100 000 guilders now worth six million german marks though originally they represented only about 200 000 marks adolph became the support and the idol of the family money being worth next to nothing the governments in central europe are devising other means of obtaining revenue the first step in this direction was taken by the hungarian government which takes land taxes from landlords owning more than a thousand acres these taxes are paid in kind that is a certain percentage of the land is expropriated by the government and sold to the peasants the maximum acreage that may be owned by one man is 1000 acres the object of the confiscation is not only to provide revenue for the state but also to reduce all holdings to that maximum nor does the confiscation extend to the whole acreage exceeding the maximum at one time rather it is distributed over a number of years until the holdings have been reduced to the allowable maximum the incomes of these big landlords are enormous for the prices of agricultural products exceed all limits thousands being paid for a bushel of grain taking the value of land at 40 000 kronen an acre the taxes would amount to about a hundred acres a year in cases where estates larger than a thousand acres are involved the big landowners most of whom belong to the nobility and clergy are vehemently opposed to this property tax but the landless peasantry is only too eager to get a share of the soil that still remains of crippled hungary as the magyars are fond of calling their disintegrated country which has been parceled up into four parts leaving to the hungarians only one third of their former country in moscow berlin vienna budapest and in fact in every large city in central and eastern europe there are besides the official stock exchange money exchanges on almost every corner coffeehouses saloons or ordinary inns where business men gather are recognized miniature exchanges which often dictate the quotations to the great national exchanges of the capitals there are in a place of this kind two hundred to three hundred men they are veritable curb markets dealing in everything but chiefly in foreign exchanges an austrian clerk at the end of his tether discovered by chance two hundred coupons of an english soap manufacturer advertising his products in the english language the clerk took these coupons to one of these coffeehouse exchanges and offered them to one of the brokers as berengarian currency what are they quoted at asked the broker twenty kronen the lotu answered the clerk giving to the imaginary berengarian currency the fanciful name lotu done said the broker and paid the clerk 20 kronen for each coupon the next day the clerk s conscience began to trouble him so he returned to the coffeehouse and said to the broker look here sir i am very sorry but i can t accept your money for those things i sold you yesterday here is your money back no no my dear fellow i sold them at twenty eight and now you could not buy them for less than 40 kronen a lotu if you wait a day or two they might drop back to 20 again the shifting of values and the greatly unsettled conditions in trade and finance have as may be seen totally upset all moral laws to cheat the state to rob the treasury has become a praiseworthy deed to transact crooked business is not looked upon as unfair nor is it at all unusual in central europe at least mail robberies tampering with valuable packages are matters of everyday occurrence and indeed are part of the routine a new york foreign exchange banker authorized by the hungarian government to exchange old hungarian paper currency against the newly issued bills states that every package of such newly issued bills that comes to him by mail sealed wrapped in several layers of linen has been tampered with thus from one package three million kronen of paper money was extracted en route from another only nine one hundredkronen notes were missing each worth about twelve cents how they managed to open these packages is difficult to say it was quite a mystery said the banker why this particular thief stole only nine bills out of that package containing fifteen million kronen i presume when he saw they were hungarian notes he did n t think it worth while to take any more of them iii the salaried classes and the wageearners of central europe are hardest hit by these conditions no salary can really be high enough to afford them a bare living indeed not even mere semi starvation every wage earner or salaried worker has to speculate barter or steal in order to make both ends meet the condition of judges teachers military officers postal clerks letter carriers and all other civil servants who receive salaries is a desperate one indeed a college professor in the central european states receives a salary that is barely equivalent to ten dollars a month and in many cases to as little as three dollars a month a postal clerk in vienna receiving a monthly salary of 5000 kronen gets in fact an equivalent of only about 55 cents in united states currency the letter carriers are in the same plight and they deserve great credit for not robbing all the american mail they deliver it must indeed require a heroic effort not to succumb to the temptation of getting at the contents of american letters most of which contain dollar bills but not only unimportant people have to put up with hardships great officeholders are hard put also the hungarian regent with all his prerogatives of a king receives only three million kronen a year equivalent to 3000 on which he has to keep up a court not less pretentious than that of the former emperor charles a cabinet minister earns something like 200 a year and a prime minister has to live on but little more than that the salary of a member of parliament varies between ten and fifty dollars a year judges of the high court mend their own shoes and those of their children most of them eat a square meal only when they are invited to some rich man s table their clothes are ragged for their yearly salary would not buy them a suit of clothes and these judges have to sit in litigations involving millions does it not seem likely that a starving and ragged judge like this could be tempted by money yet corruption of the courts does not exist in germany austria and hungary not a shadow of suspicion has been known to attach to them the conclusion from all these facts is plain the central european nations are near bankruptcy their industrial life whatever there is of it is unhealthy and insecure trading and manufacturing are impaired by the political and customs barriers of the newly formed small states a decent living is out of the question for the masses there is every inducement for graft corruption and other forms of dishonesty to which many must turn their wits for a living which is in fact semi starvation conditions get increasingly worse and this winter will probably see them at their worst and there seems to be no remedy for them what will be the end

this satellite image from planet labs pbc shows construction of china s type 003 aircraft carrier at the jiangnan shipyard northeast of shanghai on may 8 planet labs pbc via ap bangkok china s most advanced aircraft carrier to date appears to be nearing completion satellite photos analyzed by the associated press showed friday as experts suggested the vessel could be launched soon the newly developed type 003 carrier has been under construction at the jiangnan shipyard northeast of shanghai since 2018 satellite images taken by planet labs pbc on may 31 suggest work on the vessel is close to done the launch has been long anticipated and constitutes what the center for strategic and international studies think tank called a seminal moment in china s ongoing modernization efforts and a symbol of the country s growing military might csis noted in a report that china often pairs military milestones with existing holidays and anniversaries it suggested that the vessel could be launched as soon as friday to coincide with the national dragon boat festival as well as the 157th anniversary of the founding of the jiangnan shipyard in the satellite images the carrier s deck can be clearly seen in an image taken tuesday through wispy clouds equipment behind the carrier appears to have been removed a step toward flooding the entire drydock and floating the vessel pictures earlier this month showed work ongoing cloud cover blocked planet labs satellites from capturing images of the shipyard from wednesday to friday china s ministry of national defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment though no launch was announced the state run global times newspaper on tuesday ran a story quoting reports that it could be launched soon it added that the chinese navy in april had released a promotional video on the country s carrier program in which it implied that the country s third aircraft carrier will be officially revealed soon though the u s department of defense estimates that the carrier won t be fully operational until 2024 first needing to undergo extensive sea trials the carrier is china s most advanced yet as with its space program china has proceeded extremely cautiously in the development of aircraft carriers seeking to apply only technologies that have been tested and perfected its development is part of a broader modernization of china s military as it seeks to extend its influence in the region china already has the largest navy in the world in terms of numbers of ships but not near the capabilities of the u s navy among other assets the u s navy remains the world s leader in aircraft carriers with its forces able to muster 11 nuclear powered vessels the navy also has nine amphibious assault ships which can carry helicopters and vertical takeoff fighter jets as well the expected launch of the new chinese carrier comes as the u s has been increasing its focus on the region including the south china sea the vast maritime region has been tense because six governments claim all or part of the strategically vital waterway through which an estimated 5 trillion in global trade travels each year and which holds rich but fast declining fishing stocks and significant undersea oil and gas deposits china has been far and away the most aggressive in asserting its claim to virtually the entire waterway its island features and resources the u s navy has sailed warships past chinese held humanmade islands in the sea which are equipped with airstrips and other military facilities china insists its territory extends to those islands while the navy says it conducts the missions there to ensure the free flow of international trade once mainly a coastal force china s navy has in recent years expanded its presence into the indian ocean the western pacific and beyond setting up its first overseas base over the last decade in the african horn nation of djibouti where the u s japan and others also maintain a military presence the carrier is china s second domestically developed carrier following a type 002 ship that is currently undergoing sea trials its other carrier is a modified former soviet ship bought as a hulk from ukraine and refurbished over several years as an experimental platform that nevertheless packs considerable combat capability with an airwing of chinese built fighters developed from the russian su 33 in addition to being the largest of its three carriers the new type 003 class is fitted with a catapult launch system that will enable it to support additional fighter aircraft fixed wing early warning aircraft and more rapid flight operations and thus extend the reach and effectiveness of its carrier based strike aircraft the u s defense department said in its annual report to congress on china s military in november in particular the prc s people s republic of china s aircraft carriers and planned follow on carriers once operational will extend air defense coverage beyond the range of coastal and shipboard missile systems and will enable task group operations at increasingly longer ranges the defense department said adding that the chinese navy s emerging requirement for sea based land attack systems will also enhance the prc s ability to project power china s existing carriers weigh in at about half the size of the u s nimitz class flattops and displace about 100 000 tons fully loaded experts from the washington based csis which has been monitoring the construction for years said in an analysis thursday of different satellite images by maxar technologies also taken tuesday that a smaller vessel had been moved out of the carrier s way and that water now partially fills some of the dry dock but they said more work still needed to be done before the vessel could leave the dock the staircases that workers use to access the carrier as well as the support structures and other equipment that skirt the ship will need to be removed csis said the caisson which segments the dry dock and allows work to proceed simultaneously on multiple vessels will also be opened to allow water to fill the entire dry dock the wall street journal first published the maxar images of the vessel from the csis analysis
in this series we bust the jargon and explain a popular investing term or theme here it s discount rate something to do with the sales no and confusingly the term has two distinct different meanings the first of these is the interest rate that the federal reserve the us central bank known as the fed charges banks for loans when they need a back up source of funding right direction the system has its critics and it is not a crystal ball more of a guide the aim is to make an informed decision the second meaning is an element in an analysis designed to show the viability of an investment it is used by firms considering whether to launch a takeover of another company or deciding whether to commit capital to a project in such instances discount rate is sometimes called the hurdle rate tell me more about the fed s rate the loans advanced by the fed to banks are usually made overnight but this period the window can be extended in times of emergencies such as during the global financial crisis of 2008 09 such was the requirement for these funds that in october 2008 just after the fall of lehman brothers discount rate borrowing reached 404billion against the monthly average of 0 7billion in the period since 1959 why has the us discount rate been rising at present the discount rate is 1 per cent a year ago it was 0 25 per cent the rate which is set by the fed s board of governors is one of the mechanisms the central bank uses to control the money supply and thus inflation a priority at present jerome powell the fed chairman told the american people inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing we re moving expeditiously to bring it back down what about the second meaning the discount rate is used in dcf discounted cash flow analysis dcf calculated in a complex formula is a way of working out whether an investment is worth its current cost by analysing its future revenues the calculation uses a discount rate which is the return that you wish to achieve it helps you determine the maximum that you are willing to pay today for a return at some time in the future taking account of the risks involved many stock market analysts rely on dcf attempting to work out what future cash flows will be when scrutinising the accounts of companies to establish whether their shares are worth buying today is this a reliable way of choosing an investment the system has its critics it is not a crystal ball more of a guide the aim is to make an informed decision if you can make an investment at a cost below the sum of the discounted cash flows the investment may be undervalued with the potential for a handsome payback if the cost is higher than those cash flows the investment could be overvalued of course there is no guarantee

the 90 minute collection of interviews and commentary on gender identity is well produced amusing and frustrating because of what it is missing what is a woman a film from matt walsh and the conservative daily wire website was released this week the 90 minute collection of interviews and commentary on gender identity is well produced amusing and frustrating it s a decent basic introduction to the gender identity wars for those new to the battlefield the experts responses to walsh s calm measured and objective questioning also provide an invaluable chapter in the handbook called how to give enough rope the organizing question what is a woman and the apparent inability of highly educated people to answer it is offered as a gateway into the more general controversy walsh does a great service in exposing the incoherence of gender advocates and activists in an easy to digest form and they are truly incoherent from walsh s interview with dr michelle forcier of brown university forcier telling that family based on that little penis that your child is absolutely 100 male identified not matter what occurs in their life that s not correct walsh have you ever met a 4 year old who believes in santa claus would you say that this is someone who maybe has a tenous grasp of realty forcier they have an appropriate 4 year old hand on the reality that s very real for them walsh agreed santa claus is real for them but santa claus is not actually real forcier but santa claus does deliver their christmas presents walsh well yeah but he s not real though forcier to that child they are walsh but i see a child who believes in santa claus but say this is a boy and he says i m a girl this is someone who can t distingue between fantasy and realty so how could you take that as a reality forcier i would say that as a pediatrician and as a parent i would say how wonderful my 4 year old and their imagination is aside from the microscope on the gender affirming professionals walsh touches on a few recent controversies the wi spa incident in california the confrontation between a trans identifying male and a collectibles store owner whom walsh interviews sports and the conflict in loudon county virginia over sexual assault and school restrooms again it s good for what it is and valuable for exposing what these trans activists really have to say unfiltered aside from the specific gender issues the most illuminating aspect to me of what is a woman is the apparent industrial level acrylic bubble in which these activists and advocates live walsh asks simple commonsense questions questions that organically flow from these proponents beliefs and assertions questions that any reasonable person would ask after hearing the statement a woman can have a penis and they are all to a person dumfounded they don t seem able to process that someone would actually question their dogmas and they are not at all as someone once said on another subject prepared to give a reason for their hope it is illustrative of the dynamics of that world but also a warning for any of us tempted to simply expound rather than to engage explain and think matters through what is a woman falls short however and it falls short on the gender critical side the experts on whom walsh calls deborah soh carl trueman jordan peterson and others are helpful but one would never know from this piece that there is a substantive body of gender critical work that work is mostly from british and american women such as helen joyce kathleen stock abigail shrier and kara dansky many of whom who have suffered professionally for their work which has had this movement under the microscope for years now something else is missing it is perhaps not fair to critique a work on what it is not but in this case the door is open precisely because what is a woman intends to open that door to a wider consideration of the gender identity movement and that s what is really missing gender the roots of this current climate lie in the movement to separate biological sex from the constructed presentation of gender a constructed presentation of what exactly is fuzzy since it seems to get more complicated and convoluted by the week but in essence transitioning is about making your external presentation and engagement with the world match that of the biological sex you are not the exploration of a distinction between sex and gender is mentioned by a few of walsh s experts but he gives it short shrift and he completely neglects the intellectual heavyweights behind the notion foucault de beauvoir and judith butler for example all of whom are far more important than those he highlights kinsey or even the butcher money but even if plunging into these philosophical weeds would have been beyond the scope of this piece the film still falls short walsh establishes that the gender woo crowd cannot or does not want to answer the question what is a woman but then fails to drill down into the more potent questions for his topic namely what is this woman identity that certain males want desperately to perform as claim and be treated as by society and the law and that certain females want desperately to opt out of and why the responses would undoubtedly be varied and personal ranging from past trauma to present fetish to serious mental dysphoric illness but one need only look at images of bruce caitlyn jenner with his breast implants on the cover of vanity fair and the dour but we are assured euphoric ellen elliot page with her ab implants on the current cover of esquire to see clearly that to answer this question one cannot avoid matters not just of sex but of gender of how males and females present and are expected to present and perform as males and females in the 21st century west the gender movement walsh ably takes on in what is a woman is about a lot of things it s about money and profit as female to male scott newgent says in the program it s about intellectual incoherence and the victory of relativism and personal feeling as trueman and peterson point out it s about the separation of sex from procreation and the resultant collapse into recreation pleasure and performance as well i have said many times but like it or not and whether or not that is a part of your worldview the trans moment is also about gender misogyny gender roles stereotypes and caricatures it s about the appeal of these elements to broken untethered confused souls what is a woman is an important question to ask so good for matt walsh but why do you want to be seen as one or why do you want to stop are even more important which is why to be honest the first few minutes of what is a woman threw me off it begins with walsh interiorly musing on the question at hand while watching a birthday party apparently for a set of brother and sister twins the boys are dressed in tones of blue and the girls in pink the boy opens his gifts of a bb gun and trucks the girl hers a tea set and dolls blue and pink trucks and dolls while walsh s interior monologue is all wow women are so crazy mysterious amiright my dudes and then we get to the end of the documentary when walsh asks his wife standing in the kitchen the question of the hours she gives the right answer an adult human female and then finishes the sentence with who needs help opening this and hands matt a pickle jar look walsh has done good if basic work here his children s book johnny the walrus is well done and even better for the tears of outrage it s caused but this weird framing of what is a woman works against a coherent thorough presentation of the issue it even seems to support the common trans trope of i didn t like girly things so i must not be a real girl so please cut off my healthy breasts or my little boy likes mermaids and sparkly things get us the puberty blockers stat what is a woman centers reality truth nature and by implication natural law but don t let that opening montage which i hoped was ironic but apparently was not or walsh s neglect of the role of gender performance or expectations in the trans dynamic give you a mistaken impression walsh is catholic so it is fair for me to suggest that even in its most traditional catholic expression natural law does not envision pink blue and jar opening skills embedded in the natural order and in fact offers the antidote to a movement that in a bizarre way seems to do just that hard to believe well just ask her related at cwr what is a woman reveals the deeper problems with transgenderism june 4

bragar eagel squire p c a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against abbvie inc abbvie or the company nyse abbv in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired abbvie securities between april 30 2021 and august 31 2021 both dates inclusive the class period investors have until june 6 2022 to apply to the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit click here to participate in the action abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages if you purchased or otherwise acquired abbvie shares and suffered a loss are a long term stockholder have information would like to learn more about these claims or

washington ap u s employers added 390 000 jobs in may extending a streak of solid hiring that has bolstered an economy under pressure from high inflation and rising interest rates last month s gain reflects a resilient job market that has so far shrugged off concerns that the economy will weaken in the coming months as the federal reserve steadily raises interest rates to fight inflation the unemployment rate remained 3 6 just above a half century low the labor department said friday the job growth in may though healthy was the lowest monthly gain in a year but it was high enough to keep the fed on track to pursue what s likely to be the fastest series of rate hikes in more than 30 years stock market indexes fell friday after the government released the jobs report reflecting that concern businesses in many industries remain desperate to hire because their customers have kept spending freely despite intensifying concerns about high inflation americans finances have been buoyed by rising pay and an unusually large pile of savings that were accumulated during the pandemic particularly by higher income households given all the talk we ve heard about recession and economic headwinds it was very reassuring to see a solid jobs number said mark vitner senior economist at wells fargo one encouraging sign vitner said was that hiring was broad based across most of the economy when the economy loses momentum he said hiring tends to occur in just a few sectors and that s not what we re seeing today nearly every large industry added workers in may one major exception was retail which shed nearly 61 000 positions some large retailers including walmart and target have reported disappointing sales and earnings last month walmart said it had over hired and then reduced its head count through attrition construction companies added 36 000 jobs a hopeful sign for americans who have bought new homes that aren t yet built because of labor and parts shortages shipping and warehousing companies still struggling to keep up with growing online commerce added 47 000 jobs restaurants hotels and entertainment venues hired 84 000 last month friday s report showed more americans came off the sidelines of the workforce and found jobs a sign that rising wages and plentiful opportunities are encouraging people to look for work still the proportion of people who either have a job or are looking for one remains below pre pandemic levels rising prices might also have led some to take jobs the number of people ages 55 or over who are working rose last month suggesting that some older americans are unretiring after leaving their jobs or being laid off during the pandemic and its aftermath average hourly wages rose 10 cents in may to 31 95 the government said a solid gain but not enough to keep up with inflation compared with 12 months earlier hourly pay climbed 5 2 down from a 5 5 year over year gain in april and the second straight drop still more moderate pay raises could ease inflationary pressures in the economy and help sustain growth workers in general are enjoying nearly unprecedented bargaining power the number of people who are quitting jobs typically for better positions at higher pay has been at or near a record high for six months layoffs are at their lowest level on records dating back 20 years yet there are signs that some companies facing rising costs for parts and labor are starting to think twice about demands for higher pay one such executive is jackie bondanza ceo of hounds town a chain of doggie daycares with 30 locations in 14 states bondanza said people are applying for jobs at the company s headquarters in ronkonkoma new york who don t necessarily have relevant experience yet are demanding high salaries people are coming in demanding 30 more she said we can t afford to overpay for somebody even so bondanza plans to keep hiring to support the company s expansion hounds town which expects to open 50 new franchised outlets in the next 18 months is seeking to fill three jobs including a training director and a marketing director the company now has 17 employees at its corporate office up from five a year ago inflation she said has yet to discourage most customers from seeking the company s services which include daily care for dogs and boarding we are seeing more dogs in our facilities than some of our stores know what to do with bondanza said tom gimbel chief executive of the lasalle network a staffing firm in chicago said his client companies are still eager to hire and to offer solid pay to new employees but they re also being choosier about job applicants as a result after making clear to companies in the aftermath of the pandemic that they would have to pay more he said his firm is now starting to warn job seekers that they may not secure the huge raises they re seeking given the higher costs many companies are struggling with we re now getting to a more normalized healthy place gimbel said a report friday by reuters said that tesla s chief executive elon musk was considering laying off 10 of the company s workers causing its shares to tumble musk also expressed concern about the economy in an email to executives in which he said to pause all hiring worldwide by contrast on thursday ford motor co said it planned to add 6 200 jobs in three states over the next several years as part of its expansion of electric vehicle production nationally the strength of the nation s job market is contributing to inflationary pressures with wages continuing to rise across the economy companies are passing on at least some of their increased labor costs to their customers in the form of higher prices the costs of food gas rent and other items which fall disproportionately on lower income households are accelerating at nearly the fastest pace in 40 years inflation had begun surging last year as spiking demand for cars furniture electronic equipment and other physical goods collided with overwhelmed supply chains and parts shortages more recently prices for such services as airline tickets hotel rooms and restaurant meals have jumped as americans have shifted more of their spending to those areas to try to cool spending and slow inflation the fed last month raised its short term rate by a half point its biggest hike since 2000 to a range of 0 75 to 1 two additional half point rate increases are expected this month and in july and some fed officials have suggested in recent speeches that if inflation doesn t show signs of slowing they could implement yet another half point increase in september the fed s moves have already sharply elevated mortgage rates and contributed to drops in sales of new and existing homes the rate hikes have also magnified

washington united states the food and drug administration voiced concern friday about myocarditis being potentially linked to the novavax covid 19 vaccine just as experts are to weigh its use in the united states the novavax vaccine is already authorized in other countries particularly in europe in the united states an independent committee convened at the request of the fda is to meet tuesday to evaluate data from the clinical trials of novavax and give its recommendation in advance of that the agency published a lengthy document on friday analyzing these results as it had done for the three other vaccines already authorized in the country shortly afterwards novavax stock dropped 20 percent on the new york stock exchange novavax s vaccine was found to be 90 percent effective against symptomatic cases of the disease in trials conducted before the appearance of the omicron variant according to the fda but six cases of myocarditis an inflammation of the heart muscle were detected in the group that received the vaccine against one case in the placebo group the agency pointed out five cases occurred within two weeks of vaccination identification of multiple potential vaccine associated cases out of 40 000 clinical trial participants raises concern that if causally associated the risk of myocarditis following the novavax shot could be higher than reported on other vaccines such as pfizer or moderna the fda said a small risk of myocarditis had in fact been identified after pfizer or moderna vaccinations which are based on messenger rna particularly in young men and adolescent boys but the fda noted that during clinical trials of these vaccines no cases had yet been detected and the agency appeared concerned that the risk is higher with novavax the company issued a statement in response to the fda report on friday saying we believe there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship adding that it was normal to see natural background events of myocarditis in any sufficiently large database

gear obsessed editors choose every product we review we may earn commission if you buy from a link why trust us the strategic national stockpile was established in 1999 by president bill clinton and contains a stash of medicines and equipment to be deployed in the case of a public health emergency natural disaster or terrorist attack or terrorist attack contained within the stockpile are more than 1 000 categories of items as well as portable medical stations and containers of nerve agent antidotes antidotes in the last two decades the stockpile has been used to care for victims of hurricanes the september 11 attacks on the world trade center and influenzas outbreaks last week as the number of confirmed monkeypox cases around the world continued to climb the center for disease control cdc and health officials urged the public to remain calm the disease they said could be prevented with the smallpox vaccine and the united states happens to have 100 million doses of that stashed away in the strategic national stockpile sns but what and where exactly is the sns science explains the world around us we ll help you make sense of it all with full access to pop mech pro by its own definition the sns contains the supplies medicines and devices for lifesaving care that could be deployed in the event of a public health emergency natural disaster or terrorist attack but the sns isn t just one massive storeroom of medical supplies its contents are actually split between twelve secret locations around the country designed to look like a generic commercial warehouse each facility according to the washington post is roughly the size of two super walmarts as tall as five stories high and guarded 24 hours a day by armed personnel but while the whereabouts of these warehouses is a well kept secret their history contents and use are not here s what we know about the sns a brief history of the strategic national stockpile it turns out the nation s repository of medicine and medical supplies owes its existence to a novel in 1998 president bill clinton read a thriller about a bioterrorist attack on new york city the book prompted clinton to call a meeting with top level scientists and cabinet members to discuss just how prepared the country would be if such an attack took place in real life by the end of the year 51 million dollars had been set aside for the cdc to create the equivalent of national emergency first aid kit in a later interview clinton said his inspiration wasn t purely literary citing the first world trade center bombing the oklahoma city bombing and a sarin gas attack on a tokyo subway as the impetus to strengthen america s emergency response capabilities today the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response a division of the department of health and human services manages the sns at the helm is former air force physician robert kadlec what s actually inside the strategic national stockpile in addition to personal protective equipment like masks gloves and gowns the sns contains other things you d expect such as pharmaceuticals fully charged ventilators and of course vaccines but the sns also manages a stock of specialized items ready to deploy during a humanitarian crisis u s air national guard staff sgt steven tucker for instance the sns contains federal medical stations or everything a local government would need to turn a building into a fully equipped medical center with enough beds drugs and equipment to care for 50 to 250 patients for up to three days additionally the sns maintains chempacks or containers of nerve agent antidotes placed in secure locations in local jurisdictions around the country to allow rapid response to a chemical incident these medicines according to the sns can treat the symptoms of exposure even when the chemical agent is unknown because these types of drugs would be needed immediately the sns actually stores 1 960 containers of chempacks in 1 340 locations around the country many stored in hospitals or fire stations more than 90 percent of the u s population lives within one hour of a chempack location related story how russia could use chemical weapons in ukraine the sns also keeps 12 hour push packages about 50 tons of materials to be used in the early hours of a crisis within 12 hours of a request the u s marshals service can deliver these packages by unmarked airplane or truck which contain antibiotics vaccines syringes and oxygen tubing among other triage equipment when have we tapped the strategic national stockpile gene shaw alex wong in the last decade the sns has been used to respond to a number of small scale emergencies and in 14 major crises including 12 hurricanes in 2001 staff at the strategic national stockpile deployed medicine and supplies to new york city within seven hours of the attack on the world trade center during the h1n1 swine flu outbreak the sns shipped a quarter of its influenza antiviral medicine to 62 locations in one week most recently the sns played a vital role in responding to the coronavirus pandemic shipping more than 27 533 tons of cargo around the country including mixing kits to support 1 32 billion doses of the covid 19 vaccine it has also supplied medical supplies and equipment to public health teams serving unaccompanied minors at the u s mexico border how is the strategic national stockpile maintained just like a home medicine cabinet the sns must be restocked and inventoried on a continual basis to keep track of and replace expired drugs and medical equipment the sns partners with the u s food and drug administration fda for regular stability testing to determine if products are still suitable for use this generally allows the sns to extend the expiration date on products by up to 24 months the group of agencies that decide what goes in the sns include the cdc the fda the national institutes for health as well as the departments of defense veterans affairs homeland security and agriculture

beijing china in what is being hailed a breakthrough for the country s national security nuclear authorities in china have announced that their researchers have discovered rich uranium deposits deep below the earth according to scientists involved in the project large industrial grade deposits were found at depths previously thought impossible to reach increasing china s estimated total uranium reserve to more than two million tons this week the china national nuclear corporation stated this world leading project is a major breakthrough for our country with its nuclear power supply increasing faster than any country in the world with seven or eight new reactors being built each year china s demand for uranium has been increasing however as most of china s uranium mines are small in scale and offer poor ore quality more than 70 percent of its supply comes from countries including kazakhstan canada and australia this reliance on foreign sources is considered by beijing to be a security risk li ziying director of the beijing research institute of uranium geology said the discoveries challenged mainstream theories on uranium deposit formations as it is generally believed that the deposits can only be found in shallow and geophysically stable areas however some of the largest uranium deposits recently discovered in southern china are located at depths of more than 1 500 meters below the surface according to chinese nuclear authorities li and his colleagues discovered that uranium could rise straight from the earth s mantle and become trapped in small hotspots several thousand meters below ground during massive tectonic collisions in an interview with science and technology daily li said the difficulty was that there is usually only a small hint on the surface of deep uranium deposits stating locating it is as challenging as finding a compact disc over an area of 10 000 sq km meanwhile a beijing based researcher studying nuclear fuel who asked to remain anonymous said the discovery will not fully eliminate china s dependence on imported uranium because of the numerous cost and engineering challenges of extracting the deposits but in the long term it will likely have a profound impact on china s position in the global market li added

islamabad ousted prime minister imran khan is jeopardising pakistan s attempts to fix its economy as he rallies his supporters and workers to march to islamabad and causes disruption an article published in the economist said thursday the publication said that ritualised displays of street power in which political parties rally their supporters and lead them towards the capital are a favourite tactic for anyone trying to rattle the government it added that in the current situation no one is keener on rallying supporters to islamabad than imran khan and since being ousted from office through a no confidence vote in april he has refused to sit at home and is adamant about marching to the capital imran khan blames a united states backed conspiracy that led to his ouster he also maintains that the incumbent imported government has worked hand in glove with foreign powers however when he came to the capital on may 26 he called the sit in off and gave the government a six day ultimatum for calling early elections which has expired the government claims there weren t enough people in his march therefore he cancelled it but imran khan has persistently claimed that he called off the march to prevent bloodshed there has been much speculation about why the march was dispersed he says he wanted to prevent bloodshed his opponents say he was disappointed with the size of the turnout pti insiders claim that the march was halted after he was given assurances that elections at present scheduled for late 2023 when the current parliament s term ends would be brought forward to this year he blames his inauspicious exit on a conspiracy between the opposition and america which he claims was keen to see the back of him because he refused to pander to america s foreign policy demands america says this is nonsense mr khan s supporters have lapped it up anyway over the past few weeks huge crowds have rallied to him demanding new elections to kick out the imported government mr khan s latest deadline came and went he has not called a new march some observers suspect that he may need time to rally his supporters after the anticlimactic ending to his last push on the capital his allies think he is unlikely to return to islamabad imminently given the scenario it is hard to see why prime minister shehbaz sharif the younger brother of three time premier nawaz sharif would agree to call early elections his government less than two months old has taken tentative steps towards repairing relations with the west but it has not yet devised a strategy to tackle the economic crisis it inherited in part that is because mr khan s protests have kept it distracted the article read shehbaz also failed to seize the political initiative as last month he went to london to seek advice from nawaz who has been there since 2019 the move caused speculations that the decisions were being taken abroad coming back to the economic issues pakistan s foreign reserves according to the publication are at their lowest level since 2019 and the international monetary fund imf programme is also stalled in part it is because of imran khan as his government had originally agreed to cut power and petrol prices but later they decreased it the country is running deficits on both its budget and its current account it needs some 37bn worth of financing for the fiscal year beginning in june reckons the finance minister the article read however in its bid to revive the imf programme the incumbent government massively raised the price of petroleum boosting hopes of getting the loan the currency and the stock market rallied slightly in response to the move a bail out will also unlock credit from allies such as china and saudi arabia which are unwilling to extend more help without assurances that the imf will release the bail out money and to obtain the bail out money the government is likely to take unpopular decisions as indicated by finance minister miftah ismail that the government will introduce reforms before the budget but there s still an issue the imf is unlikely to take seriously a government that may not be in power for more than a few weeks particularly given the risk that mr khan might return to power despite early elections not appearing to be possible according to the publication imran khan does not seem to be giving up hope but in the country s interest it needs stability to progress the country s finances are in wretched shape the pandemic and the fallout from the war in ukraine have battered an economy already reeling from decades of mismanagement and a focus on debt driven infrastructure projects that generated no returns inflation hit 13 8 in may driven largely by the price of food and transport the rupee has lost 8 of its value against the dollar since early april foreign reserves had dwindled to 10bn by may 20th enough to cover imports for only about six weeks the reserves are at their lowest level since 2019 when pakistan last sought help from the imf only half the 6bn bailout agreed at the time has been disbursed mr khan then prime minister originally agreed to cut subsidies and reform the economy but reduced fuel prices instead the country is running deficits on both its budget and its current account it needs some 37bn worth of financing for the fiscal year beginning in june reckons the finance minister even so mr khan does not appear to be giving up hope he is petitioning the supreme court to guarantee safe passage for potential follow up marches the coming spate of painful economic moves will supply him with plenty of excuses to paint the government as american stooges and enemies of the people the appointment of a new army chief due in november will add yet

matt o brien and michael balsamo the associated press taser developer axon said this week it is working to build drones armed with the electric stunning weapons that could fly in schools and help prevent the next uvalde sandy hook or columbine but its own technology advisers quickly panned the idea as a dangerous fantasy the publicly traded company which sells tasers and police body cameras floated the idea of a new police drone product last year to its artificial intelligence ethics board a group of well respected experts in technology policing and privacy some of them expressed reservations about weaponizing drones in over policed communities of color but they were not expecting axon s thursday announcement that it wants to send those taser equipped drones into classrooms to prevent mass shootings by immobilizing an intruding gunman in an interview with the associated press axon founder and ceo rick smith said he felt compelled to make the idea public after the mass shooting at an uvalde texas elementary school saying he was catastrophically disappointed in the response by police who didn t move in to kill the suspect for more than an hour but he stressed friday that no product had been launched and any potential launch would be down the road the idea he felt needed to be shared now because of the public conversation about effective ways for police to safely confront attackers and how schools can increase safety this is an idea that should get into the public s consciousness while our minds are open to it and i felt if i wait another six months the world is going to change and people are going to forget this pain and we re going to see a shift in sentiments where people are going to focus a lot more on what could go wrong rather than the pain of this problem we need to solve he said axon s stock price rose with the news but the announcement angered members of the ethics board some of whom are now likely to quit in protest this particular idea is crackpot said barry friedman a new york university law professor who sits on the axon ai ethics board drones can t fly through closed doors the physical properties of the universe still hold so unless you have a drone in every single classroom in america which seems insane the idea just isn t going to work friedman said it was a dangerous and fantastical idea that went far beyond the proposal for a taser equipped police drone that board members some of them former or current police officials had been debating in recent months we begged the company not to do it friedman said of the company s announcement it was unnecessary and shameful the product idea had been kicked around at axon since at least 2019 and the company has been working to try to figure out whether a drone with a taser was even a feasible idea over the last year the company created computer generated art renderings to mock up a product design and conducted an internal test to see if taser darts which transmit an immobilizing electric jolt could be fired from a flying drone smith said he added that he had discussed the possibility of developing such a product with the ethics board board members who spoke with the associated press said they were taken aback by the school drone proposal which they got notice of only earlier this week and cobbled together a unanimous statement of concern that described axon s decision as deeply regrettable the company tweeted out the board s dissent shortly after its own statement thursday announcement i wouldn t be surprised if there were resignations said another ethics board member ryan calo a law professor at the university of washington i think everyone on the board has to make a choice about whether they want to stay involved friedman and calo both described this week s process as a sharp turnaround from the respectful relationship that axon executives have had with the board in recent years on controversial topics such as face recognition which axon decided against using in its body cameras and automated license plate readers sometimes the company takes our advice and sometimes it doesn t friedman said what s important is that happens after thoughtful discussion and coordination that was thrown out the window here smith said the company is still in the very early phases of product development and would continue to consult the ethics board along with law enforcement officials community leaders and school officials he acknowledged that the company might later determine that the idea isn t feasible and abandon it but he took issue with the idea that he had ignored the concerns from the ethics board which is meant to provide guidance and share feedback ultimately the decision still falls to smith as the company s chief executive i have not ignored what they have said people can have debates and disagree smith said i think there is one thing the world can see our board is not a whitewash i hope they don t resign he added i hope that they are somewhat proud maybe after this that we re having this public debate on friday in an ask me anything chat on the online forum reddit smith acknowledged that drones in schools can sound nuts but went on to answer detailed questions about them they could travel through school vents he said and perch on doors and walls near ceilings it could be a good thing if a gunman tried to shoot one down because it would distract from trying to kill people we re doing this because we care smith said we re a business so ultimately we have to find a financial model that works but at the end of the day we ve been successful because our mission drives our business and we solve problems we care about he added smith told a reddit user that axon was absolutely not trying to capitalize on recent

repercussions for first high school education s business operations and financial prospects specifically the first high school education class action lawsuit alleges that the ipo s registration statement made inaccurate statements of material fact because defendants failed to disclose the following adverse facts that existed at the time of the ipo i that the new rules regulations and policies to be implemented by the chinese government following the two sessions parliamentary meetings were far more severe than represented to investors and posed a material adverse threat to first high school education and its business ii that contemplated chinese regulations and rules regarding private education were leading to a slowdown of government approval to open new educational facilities which would have a negative effect on first high school education s enrollment and growth and iii that as a result the registration statement s representations regarding first high school education s historical financial and operational metrics and purported market opportunities did not accurately reflect the actual business operations and financial results and trajectory of first high

the then city commissioner of permits and inspections who issued an emergency order to demolish the great northern grain elevator didn t understand the building s engineering mistakenly concluding that a large hole on the north wall endangered the entire structure a preservationist said in state supreme court paul mcdonnell the chairman of the campaign for greater buffalo history architecture which is trying to stop the demolition said james comerford based his condemnation order on dec 17 on several misunderstandings of how the building was constructed common council calls for alternatives to great northern demolition it is important that all options must be considered before making a decision that can never be undone the resolution said comerford before reaching his decision failed to consult original architectural drawings of the great northern on file in his office or review the grain elevator s local landmark application or a federal study from 1990 available online mcdonnell said the brick cladding that covers the steel bins inside is basically a brick curtain wall mcdonnell said everything else in the structure including the cupola on top which is hung so no steel touches the brick is supported by the steel frame this was a failure of the commissioner looking at the structural documents and seeing how it was actually built i do not think he had enough information to make that conclusion and some of the information he cites is erroneous appellate court orders new hearing on great northern demolition request an appellate court ruled friday that a state supreme court justice erred in refusing to consider a preservation group s evidence at a hearing to determine whether the city of buffalo legally granted an emergency permit to demolish the great northern grain elevator the campaign for greater buffalo was given the chance to present expert testimony after an appellate court on april 29 sided with the preservation organization and reversed justice emilio colaiacovo s jan 5 decision allowing the demolition to proceed at his hearing earlier this year colaiacovo did not allow expert testimony from the preservation organization mcdonnell was the lone witness before colaiacovo on thursday and he was cross examined friday mcdonnell said the commissioner lacked a rational determination for issuing the emergency demolition order the legal issue at hand in whether the demolition can go forward attorneys representing adm repeatedly raised concerns in cross examination about uncertainties associated with the building s condition stressing that comerford was responding to the information known at the time when he issued the order the commissioner cited safety and public welfare concerns after considering drone imagery an engineering report and consultations with city housing inspectors and the fire commissioner mcdonnell a former senior architect and director of facilities with buffalo public schools said he called comerford two days after a dec 11 windstorm damaged the structure to offer his help but never got a call back gwen howard who succeeded mcdonnell as chair of the city s preservation board said comerford informed her he had reviewed materials and wanted to give her a heads up that he was leaning toward issuing the demolition order she said he didn t seek her advice receivership called a promising tool for saving derelict historic properties the receivership is a great idea for a city like buffalo where our housing stock is so old and there is so much worth preserving housing court judge patrick m carney said i stressed that i felt that was not a prudent decision or necessary said howard also a certified new york state building inspector mcdonnell refuted other claims by comerford some cited in reports commissioned by archer daniels midland that comerford said he had read before reaching his decision there was no significant bowing movement or cracking in the walls mcdonnell said mcdonnell also pushed back against claims that the mortar had seriously eroded we do not have any evidence any testing or any reason to know that the walls have lost any type of mortar adhesion inside he said great northern grain elevator damaged by buffalo windstorm the city of buffalo landmark was built in 1897 and operated for nearly a century saturday s windstorm tore a hole in the northern wall but the grain elevator is not in danger of collapse mcdonnell said the structure was not a fire hazard noting the brick wall was fireproof and there haven t been active operations in decades william renaldo the city s fire commissioner and the lone witness for the city and adm over the two days of the hearing said he thought the building should be demolished because of grave concerns he had after meeting with comerford and reviewing drone footage renaldo said he was concerned that if the whole structure collapsed it could threaten firefighting capacities on ganson street and endanger the edward cotter fireboat and other ships passing by he also said he didn t know if there were combustibles or industrial waste inside that could pose a hazard to firefighters if they entered the structure mcdonnell and howard said comerford was mistaken in saying the great northern was unsafe in part due to the lack of control joints both said control joints aren t appropriate for the building and weren t used when the great northern was built in 1897 mcdonnell also said reports commissioned by adm that comerford consulted lacked documentation construction drawings and photography typically found in such documents or evidence of any tests conducted during the the three decades the company has sought to demolish the great northern the great northern is the last brick enclosed steel structure elevator left in north america it is also the first grain elevator in the world along with the electric elevator to harness electricity from niagara falls preservationists say demolishing the great northern would be among the most significant architectural losses in buffalo in decades
image a co working space in san francisco employers have responded to hot competition in the job market by raising pay credit jim wilson the new york times job growth slowed a bit in may in normal times that might be a troubling sign prompting fears that the economy is losing steam or worse headed into a recession but these are not normal times with nearly twice as many open jobs as available workers and inflation running at its fastest pace in four decades many economists and policymakers say a slowdown is just what the economy needs right now but a cooling economy carries its own risks despite inflation the recovery from the pandemic recession has been among the strongest on record with unemployment falling rapidly and incomes rebounding fastest for those at the bottom if the recovery slows too much it could undo much of that progress that delicate balance makes interpreting monthly jobs reports trickier than usual because the number that usually gets the most attention the 390 000 jobs added in may doesn t reveal whether the mismatch between supply and demand is easing to answer that question many economists are watching the labor force participation rate the share of the population either working or looking for work that figure ticked up in may to 62 3 percent as the labor force grew by 330 000 people that in conjunction with slightly slower job growth is an encouraging sign that the labor market is coming back into balance as demand cools and supply improves economists are also closely watching wage growth which many say needs to slow in order to bring inflation under control average hourly earnings rose 0 3 percent in may and are up 5 2 percent over the past year the pace of wage growth has slowed a bit in recent months although it remains simultaneously slower than inflation and faster than many economists consider sustainable that s something that we re used to saying pretty unequivocally is good but in this case it just raises the risk that the economy is overheating further said adam ozimek chief economist of the economic innovation group a washington research organization for workers a cooling labor market could feel like a step backward at least in the short term wage growth will be slower job opportunities will be fewer workers will have less leverage to demand flexible schedules or other perks but the biden administration argues that a cooling economy is a necessary transition that will be better for workers in the longer run where we are going to is a period of more stable growth more resilient growth that should look different than that historically fast recovery brian deese a top economic adviser to mr biden said in an interview the administration s goal he added is a more sustainable recovery that generates more economic opportunities and more economic security for middle class families than the prepandemic economy did
beijing china in what is being hailed a breakthrough for the country s national security nuclear authorities in china have announced that their researchers have discovered rich uranium deposits deep below the earth according to scientists involved in the project large industrial grade deposits were found at depths previously thought impossible to reach increasing china s estimated total uranium reserve to more than two million tons this week the china national nuclear corporation stated this world leading project is a major breakthrough for our country with its nuclear power supply increasing faster than any country in the world with seven or eight new reactors being built each year china s demand for uranium has been increasing however as most of china s uranium mines are small in scale and offer poor ore quality more than 70 percent of its supply comes from countries including kazakhstan canada and australia this reliance on foreign sources is considered by beijing to be a security risk li ziying director of the beijing research institute of uranium geology said the discoveries challenged mainstream theories on uranium deposit formations as it is generally believed that the deposits can only be found in shallow and geophysically stable areas however some of the largest uranium deposits recently discovered in southern china are located at depths of more than 1 500 meters below the surface according to chinese nuclear authorities li and his colleagues discovered that uranium could rise straight from the earth s mantle and become trapped in small hotspots several thousand meters below ground during massive tectonic collisions in an interview with science and technology daily li said the difficulty was that there is usually only a small hint on the surface of deep uranium deposits stating locating it is as challenging as finding a compact disc over an area of 10 000 sq km meanwhile a beijing based researcher studying nuclear fuel who asked to remain anonymous said the discovery will not fully eliminate china s dependence on imported uranium because of the numerous cost and engineering challenges of extracting the deposits but in the long term it will likely have a profound impact on china s position in the global market li added

the two shark species coexisted for many years likely sharing the same prey st petersburg fla when you think of the largest predator to exist in the blue waters you might go to a great white shark or an orca whale but do you remember hearing about a megalodon as one of the largest predators to ever live why are they not around swimming in the oceans anymore well great white sharks might have something to do with it a new study shows the two shark species coexisted for many years likely sharing the same prey cnn explains researchers were able to see the role great white sharks played in the extinction of megalodons by analyzing dietary signatures in the teeth of 13 different extinct shark species and 20 modern sharks the media outlet says they did this to understand where exactly they fit in the food chain the megalodon co existed with the great white shark during the time frame called the early pliocene and our zinc data suggest that they seem to have indeed occupied the same position in the food chain co author of the study and paleobiologist kenshu shimada of depaul university in chicago said now how exactly does zinc data bring the researchers to a conclusion the zinc content in the teeth of the sharks indicates the megalodon may have been out competed when it comes to prey reuters explains the team of researchers reportedly assessed the ratio of two forms of the mineral zinc in the outer part layer of shark teeth the ratio helped them find answers to the sharks diets and their position on the marine food chain and what they found basically shows bigger isn t always better megalodons which appeared around 15 million years ago went extinct after only 1 7 million years of great white sharks existence there have been multiple hypotheses as to why megalodon went extinct traditional hypotheses have attributed this to climate change and the decline in food sources shimada explained however a recently proposed hypothesis contends that megalodon lost the competition with the newly evolved great white shark our new study appears to support this proposition he added it is also entirely possible that a combination of multiple factors may have been at play and no researchers don t believe great white sharks ate their larger friends we know everyone was questioning it
beijing china in what is being hailed a breakthrough for the country s national security nuclear authorities in china have announced that their researchers have discovered rich uranium deposits deep below the earth according to scientists involved in the project large industrial grade deposits were found at depths previously thought impossible to reach increasing china s estimated total uranium reserve to more than two million tons this week the china national nuclear corporation stated this world leading project is a major breakthrough for our country with its nuclear power supply increasing faster than any country in the world with seven or eight new reactors being built each year china s demand for uranium has been increasing however as most of china s uranium mines are small in scale and offer poor ore quality more than 70 percent of its supply comes from countries including kazakhstan canada and australia this reliance on foreign sources is considered by beijing to be a security risk li ziying director of the beijing research institute of uranium geology said the discoveries challenged mainstream theories on uranium deposit formations as it is generally believed that the deposits can only be found in shallow and geophysically stable areas however some of the largest uranium deposits recently discovered in southern china are located at depths of more than 1 500 meters below the surface according to chinese nuclear authorities li and his colleagues discovered that uranium could rise straight from the earth s mantle and become trapped in small hotspots several thousand meters below ground during massive tectonic collisions in an interview with science and technology daily li said the difficulty was that there is usually only a small hint on the surface of deep uranium deposits stating locating it is as challenging as finding a compact disc over an area of 10 000 sq km meanwhile a beijing based researcher studying nuclear fuel who asked to remain anonymous said the discovery will not fully eliminate china s dependence on imported uranium because of the numerous cost and engineering challenges of extracting the deposits but in the long term it will likely have a profound impact on china s position in the global market li added

martín mosquera jacobinlat could you summarize some essential points from your book the debt system a history of sovereign debts and their repudiation éric toussaint the debt system was first published in french in 2017 then came out in greek and spanish in 2018 english and italian in 2019 and arabic and polish in 2020 in the book i hope i have managed to show the fundamental role of indebtedness as a means of subordinating states karl marx makes several comments on the topic adopting a particularly strong expression in capital national debts i e the alienation of the state whether despotic constitutional or republican marked with its stamp the capitalistic era national debts i e the alienation of the state source karl marx capital in the same passage on capital marx makes another remark which remains as pertinent as ever hence as a necessary consequence the modern doctrine that a nation becomes the richer the more deeply it is in debt public credit becomes the credo of capital and with the rise of national debt making want of faith in the national debt takes the place of blasphemy against the holy ghost which may not be forgiven want of faith in the national debt takes the place of blasphemy against the holy ghost which may not be forgiven source karl marx capital in her 1913 book entitled capitalist accumulation rosa luxemburg further develops marx s contribution regarding public debt analysing the role of public debt at the time when latin american countries achieved independence she also analyses the role of public debt in egypt during the second half of the 19th century which led to egypt s colonization by great britain beginning in 1882 the fundamental role of indebtedness as a means of subordinating states what i think i have brought to the analysis based on the study of the latin american independences contemporary with greek independence is that the way they become indebted signifies that they are immediately subordinated as newly independent countries to the imperialist centres especially great britain in other words latin america liberated itself from the spanish empire as did greece from the ottoman only to fall under the control of the british government and also of the french government as the french were very active with their capital investments both in latin america and on the shores of the mediterranean on greece turkey and tunisia for example i also show the connection between indebtedness and the signature of free trade agreements from the earliest years of latin american independence this is important as those two instruments of domination are still in place to this day of course there are other forms of domination via investments via the exploitation of workers from the peripheral countries by national and transnational capital but indebtedness is the most significant following the logic of free trade agreements and unequal exchange first analysed by marx this is the primary theme of my book the debt system martín mosquera jacobinlat many left wing analysts see the question of debt from the perspective of a north south centre periphery contradiction what is your opinion on that the second thesisof my book shows that the contradictions inherent in the debt question should not be seen merely in terms of a conflict between the countries of the south fighting for their independence and the imperialist centres local ruling classes have played a key role since the 1810s and the1820s at the decisive moment of independence struggles and just afterwards and i am referring to the ruling classes not the capitalist class because the ruling classes were not yet composed entirely of modern capitalists far from it among the local ruling classes there were the traditional land owning class the rich merchant sector and the sector of mine owners these three sectors eventually made up the modern bourgeoisie by the end of the 19th and early 20th century those traditionally dominant classes at the beginning of independences and the modern bourgeoisie that ensued then became fundamental actors in the indebtedness process through the pressure they brought to bear as much in favour of internal indebtedness as of external the local ruling classes organized over the last two centuries capital flight it continues to this day take for instance what happened in argentina in 2018 former president mauricio macri asked the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries for a loan of over 50 billion dollars a very large portion of the sum disbursed by the imf went abroad again thanks to the actions of argentine capitalists this is how it works the state borrows money in foreign currency which is captured by the ruling classes who send a good deal of it to safe places such as the united states the capitalists use the dollars placed in the north to buy public sovereign debt sovereign debt government debts or debts guaranteed by the government bonds thus procuring state guaranteed revenue for themselves this is how it works the state borrows money in foreign currency which is captured by the ruling classes who send a good deal of it to safe places such as the united states the capitalists use the dollars placed in the north to buy public sovereign debt bonds thus procuring state guaranteed revenue for themselves this explains why in argentina ecuador venezuela colombia or mexico there has never been a bourgeoisie which fought against repaying the debt one case where the debt was denounced within a context of major popular struggle and regime change was that of benito juárez of mexico the first time in 1861 and again in 1867 a third debt repudiation suspension also took place in mexico during the 1910 1920 revolution when the debt incurred by the dictator huerta in 1913 one of those responsible for assassinating president madero who had brought porfirio diaz s dictatorship to an end was repudiated by president venustiano carranza this also happened in costa rica during the democratic revolution against the dictatorship of tinoco in 1919 i analyse these important events in detail in the debt system repudiations or prolonged suspensions of payment of debt took place in times of popular uprisings and or major disagreements between different sectors of the dominant classes we therefore need to understand the very important role of local ruling classes and more recently local big capital which looks extremely favourably upon indebtedness i mention this because there is a section of the left who oversimplify matters presenting the debt problem solely in terms of nation empire contradiction without seeing that generally the capitalist class is in favour of a recourse to public debt both internal and foreign martín mosquera jacobinlat it is generally claimed in the mainstream media and by the creditors of the north that it is the over indebtedness of the south that gives rise to the debt crises your book provides a different explanation does it not my third thesis deals with the fact that usually debt crises are generated by periods of ebb and flow of capital from the imperial centres thus the debt crises in latin america like those of peripheral european countries or peripheries like egypt tunisia or asian countries have been triggered by the financial crises in the imperialist centres debt crises are usually generated by periods of ebb and flow of capital from the imperial centres this is also related to the long waves of simultaneous expansion and depression inherent in capitalist development to borrow a concept developed by the marxist economist ernest mandel there is a difference here between my analysis and rosa luxemburg s of the baring crisis in argentina in 1890 rosa influenced by the information that was available to her believed that argentina had somehow triggered the crisis whereas in fact the problem emanated from london the main global finance centre at the time and the financial crisis in england periods of frenzied lending to recycle abundant capital are followed by financial crises and a halt in capital flow and repatriation making it impossible to refinance the debt and thus leading to payment defaults suspension of payments and so forth periods of frenzied lending to recycle abundant capital are followed by financial crises and a halt in capital flow and repatriation making it impossible to refinance the debt and thus leading to payment defaults suspension of payment and so forth it is important to learn the lessons of the past as they enable us to imagine new scenarios for the future in the event of the central banks of the north significantly raising interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation causing renewed repatriation of capital to the united states or europe many peripheral countries could find themselves faced with huge problems of refinancing and enter another debt crisis cycle with suspension of payments at present we have an explosion of public and private debts which has not yet led to a generalized payment crisis but that could happen in the months or years ahead according to whether there is once more a financial crisis in the north or central banks increase interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rates in imperialist centres sri lanka which has systematically applied neoliberal policies since the 1980s and made many agreements with the imf entered into suspension of payments in april 2022 it is the first time since its independence in 1948 that the country has defaulted totally and it is the first asian country to do so in the last 20 years in the case of sri lanka it is a succession of external shocks in particular the enormous price hike for foods and fuels all of which it imports that make it impossible to continue debt repayments those two external shocks have both been caused by the impact of the russo ukrainian war on economies of the north and on the global economy in general for its part pakistan is reaching a very difficult situation regarding its debt martín mosquera jacobinlat it is widely believed both in the south and the north that suspension or repudiation of debt payments automatically entails cessation of funding and would lead to economic catastrophe for the population of the country concerned in your book you show that this is untrue the fourth thesis developed in the debt system is that debt repudiation does not lead to economic and social catastrophe and contrary to a common claim countries which have had recourse to debt repudiation have not been excluded from sources of external funding for long portugal which repudiated its debt in 1837 mainly owed to french creditors was able to carry on issuing public debt bonds on the financial markets throughout the 19th century the same was true of the united states where debts were repudiated on four occasions during the 19th century in 1837 1865 during the 1870s and in 1898 it was also the case for mexico in 1867 mexico after its first repudiation of 1861 repudiated the debt contracted with french bankers during the french occupation of 1862 1867 by the regime of maximilian of austria despite the repudiation mexico was immediately granted loans by the united states since after the civil war that ravaged the country from 1861 until 1865 the us government needed markets and clients consequently london competing with paris and the united states also granted loans to mexico and fifteen years later france signed new treaties with mexico in other words after repudiating its debt mexico was in no way excluded from foreign funding let us take the case of soviet russia which repudiated the tsarist debt in february 1918 it was not cut off from foreign funding for long either at a conference held in genoa in1922 on the debt that was being demanded of russia the soviet delegation reiterated its repudiation declaring in essence we could change our position if you the governments of the creditor countries would guarantee the investments for the reconstruction of soviet russia if you would grant us a very big reduction in the amount you are asking for in that case we could resume payments in 30 years in 1952 during the conference which lasted a month the governments of the major powers refused this proposition however later in the years that followed they all began to grant fresh loans to the ussr which emerged victorious from the situation the conclusion is obvious not only can a government suspend payments but it can also repudiate a debt and nevertheless find capitalists or governments ready to grant it loans as is clearly demonstrated by the impressive cases of mexico and soviet russia martín mosquera jacobinlat most of the jurists who defend the capitalist system and big institutions like the world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates and the imf claim that the notion of odious debt odious debt according to the doctrine for a debt to be odious it must meet two conditions 1 it must have been contracted against the interests of the nation or against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state 2 creditors cannot prove they they were unaware of how the borrowed money would be used we must underline that according to the doctrine of odious debt the nature of the borrowing regime or government does not signify since what matters is what the debt is used for if a democratic government gets into debt against the interests of its population the contracted debt can be called odious if it also meets the second condition consequently contrary to a misleading version of the doctrine odious debt is not only about dictatorial regimes see éric toussaint the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm the father of the odious debt doctrine alexander nahum sack clearly says that odious debts can be contracted by any regular government sack considers that a debt that is regularly incurred by a regular government can be branded as odious if the two above mentioned conditions are met he adds once these two points are established the burden of proof that the funds were used for the general or special needs of the state and were not of an odious character would be upon the creditors sack defines a regular government as follows by a regular government is to be understood the supreme power that effectively exists within the limits of a given territory whether that government be monarchical absolute or limited or republican whether it functions by the grace of god or the will of the people whether it express the will of the people or not of all the people or only of some whether it be legally established or not etc none of that is relevant to the problem we are concerned with so clearly for sack all regular governments whether despotic or democratic in one guise or another can incur odious debts is without solid legal foundation what would you say to them the fifth thesis presented in the debt system shows the topicality of the doctrine of odious debt that was elaborated in the 1920s on the basis of the numerous legal disputes over sovereign debt that came up between the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 20th century across the world the doctrine of odious debt elaborated by the jurist alexander sack on the basis of a century and a half of legal disputes over sovereign debt consists of asserting that the principle of continuity of state obligations is not applicable in cases of odious debts and a change of government if a debt is odious it is null and void and should not be repaid according to the legal doctrine of odious debt as theorized by alexander sack a debt is odious when two essential conditions are met the absence of benefits for the population the debt was contracted not inn the interests of the people and the state but against their interests and or in the personal interests of the leaders or people close to power the debt was contracted not inn the interests of the people and the state but against their interests and or in the personal interests of the leaders or people close to power the collusion of the lenders the creditors knew or were in a position to have known that the money lent would not benefit the population according to the doctrine whether the regime is of a despotic or a democratic nature is not considered relevant in the book the debt system i demonstrate that this doctrine is still current indeed the united states government invoked it in 2003 to convince the major powers to cancel 80 of iraqi debt deemed odious despite creditors opposition to this doctrine in one way or another it has inspired many total or partial cancellations of debt during the second half of the 20th and the early 21st century a series of examples are cited in the debt system the repudiation of debts by revolutionary china in 1949 1952 indonesia s repudiation of debts to the netherlands in 1956 the repudiation of debts by cuba in 1959 1960 the repudiation of colonial debts by algeria in 1962 iran s repudiation in1979 of debts contracted by the shah to buy weapons the repudiation by the three baltic republics of debts inherited from the ussr in 1991 the cancellation of namibia s debt to south africa by nelson mandela s government in 1994 the cancellation of timor leste s colonial debt in 1999 2000 the cancellation of 80 of iraqi debt in 2004 the repudiation by paraguay of debts owed to swiss banks in 2005 norway s cancellation in 2006 of its loans to five countries ecuador peru sierra leone egypt and jamaica relating to a sales contract for fishing boats in 2006 the cancellation in 2009 of part of ecuador s debt identified as illegitimate by the audit commission in 2007 2008 to sum up in the book the debt system i show that since the 19th century from latin america to china through haiti greece tunisia egypt and several other countries public debt has been used as a weapon of domination and plundering in the final analysis it is the combination of indebtedness and free trade that has underpinned the subordination of entire economies since the 19th century local ruling classes have consorted with the big foreign financial powers in subjecting their countries and their people to a mechanism of permanent transfer of the wealth produced locally towards the lenders whether they be nationals or foreigners crises erupt first of all in the most powerful capitalist countries or result from their unilateral decisions that by a rebound effect trigger wide reaching crises in the indebted peripheral countries it is not excessive public spending that pushes indebtedness to unsustainable levels but rather the conditions imposed by local and foreign creditors on numerous occasions throughout history following mass popular mobilization and or regime crises there have repeatedly been instances of debt cancellation and repudiation there is no reason why that should not happen again especially since more and more countries are faced with quite considerable increases of public debt and that once again payment difficulties are starting to mount translated by
