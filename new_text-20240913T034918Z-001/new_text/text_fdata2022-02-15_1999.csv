the latest debate on wall street is on whether the federal reserve will be aggressive or cautious when raising interest rates last week the u s annual inflation rate surged to a market defying 40 year high of 7 5 percent in january prices were up across the board from food to energy to shelter the reading ignited discussions on how the u s central bank would respond at the next federal open market committee policy meeting in march would fed chair jerome powell and the rate setting committee vote for a 25 or 50 basis point rate increase st louis fed bank president james bullard ignited controversy in recent days for telling bloomberg on feb 11 that he would like to see 100 basis points in the bag by july 1 he reiterated this position in an interview with cnbc on feb 14 arguing that the fed s credibility is on the line based on how it responds to the inflationary shock since bullard s hawkish comments financial markets have started pricing in seven rate hikes this year most investors are now anticipating a 50 basis point move in march according to the cme group fedwatch tool but several of bullard s colleagues disagree with a half percentage point increase next month st louis fed president james bullard speaks about the u s economy during an interview in new york on feb 26 2015 lucas jackson reuters while supporting a faster pace of rate hikes and winding down the more than 8 trillion balance sheet cleveland fed bank president loretta mester stated on feb 9 that it s vital to approach interest rates on a meeting by meeting basis each meeting is going to be in play mester told a virtual event hosted by the european economics and financial centre we re going to assess conditions we re going to assess how the economy s evolving we re going to be looking at the risks and we re going to be removing accommodation san francisco fed president mary daly and richmond fed president thomas barkin have made it clear they re opposed to a half point hike since inflation is way beyond the fed s conventional 2 percent target rate we need month over month readings to trend around at 0 18 percent james knightley chief international economist at ing said in a note none of the major components are close to this knightley said as such the risk of a 50bp move is on the rise for march we will have to wait to see how the individual members are seeing things but after a strong jobs number last week the case for taking some steam out of the economy is getting stronger ing anticipates five rate increases this year with inflation remaining in the 3 to 4 percent range ahead of the midterm elections in november raising rates may not be the only cure for inflation says ipek ozkardeskaya the senior analyst at swissquote bank the fed cannot do miracles by hiking the rates faster as inflation doesn t necessarily come from the demand side one of the biggest drivers of higher consumer prices has been the supply chain crisis she wrote in a research note and if rising the rates doesn t bring inflation down it could cause recession ozkardeskaya added therefore the fed s got to find the right balance to be patient and to tighten gradually over the past month there has been growing talk about stagflation or even a recession with more market analysts discussing the heightened possibility amid aggressive tightening engineering a soft landing for the economy is never easy deutsche bank analysts stated it is especially difficult with inflation well above target and accelerating at a time when the unemployment rate is already at the fed s view of maximum employment an increasingly pessimistic consumer and a more forceful inflation fighting central bank raises recession risks in 2023 and 2024 the financial institution said the u s financial markets have been on the decline this year mainly in response to the growing prospects of the central bank ending the pandemic era of cheap money year to date the nasdaq composite index has slumped about 12 percent the dow jones industrial average has lost roughly 5 percent while the s p 500 has shed about 8 percent investors have been pouring into conventional safe haven assets such as the u s dollar bonds and gold the u s dollar index dxy which gauges the greenback against a basket of currencies has risen more than 1 percent over the past month bringing the measurement into positive territory on the year a stronger buck is generally bad for dollar denominated commodities because it makes it more expensive for foreign investors to purchase a gloved hand stacks bars of gold into a pyramid leonhard foeger reuters u s treasurys have been popping this year with the benchmark 10 year yield flirting with the crucial 2 percent threshold the one year bill has topped 1 percent while the 30 year bond is eyeing 2 8 percent gold has been perhaps the most surprising to many analysts typically a rising rate environment is bearish for the yellow metal because it increases the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion markets are pricing in several rate hikes over the next 10 months but even at 50 basis points the fed talk seems to be behind the curve says kevin rich a consultant to the perth mint despite these anticipated hikes it still leaves us in a negative rate environment which is bad for consumer purchasing power but good for gold prices rich told the epoch times there is still plenty of uncertainty ahead because investors need to witness the number and frequency of these rate hikes so a single 25 basis point move is neither bullish nor bearish for the precious metal until we see a more consistent trend in data on labor gdp and rates we expect to see gold prices stay strong relative to that uncertainty he added experts assert that the fed s quantitative tightening campaign along with geopolitical tensions in eastern europe is spooking the markets whether investors will maintain their buy the dip mentality in this unclear equities arena or not remains to be seen until then traders will be keeping an eye on opportunities while also seeking shelter in safe haven assets

maine lobstermen hauled in about 725 million worth of lobster in 2021 shattering the previous record of 541 million set in 2016 despite the record breaking value the pounds of lobster landed represented the third lowest annual haul in the past decade a huge price spike per pound is what pushed the value over the top lobster harvesters landed about 108 million pounds in 2021 according to data released by the maine department of marine resources the record set in 2016 is about 132 million pounds the 97 million pounds landed in 2020 was the lowest since 2010 the average price per pound of 6 71 in 2021 was almost 2 higher than ever before and drove up the value of the catch substantially according to jeff putnam a lobsterman out of chebeague island it also drove up the effort advertisement with the high boat price we all just went harder we fished more he said the price was fair the landings were solid and the weather was cooperative in 2020 with the industry s traditional markets shuttered and the boat price relatively unstable lobstermen reportedly decreased their effort putnam said he s optimistic that demand and price will remain high in 2022 but after the yo yoing of the past two years he knows anything can happen according to the department of marine resources the 75 percent jump from last year s 412 million haul is the largest year over year increase the state has ever seen the extraordinary value earned last year by maine lobster harvesters is a clear reflection of strong consumer confidence in the maine lobster brand and the products and people it represents marine resources commissioner patrick keliher said in a statement one for the books advertisement the 108 million pounds landed in 2021 was lower than during most of the past several years but according to keliher 2021 continued a 12 year run of close to or more than 100 million pounds landed last year was one for the books and should be celebrated keliher said but he noted that the industry is facing a number of challenges with new regulations to protect endangered north atlantic right whales it s important that fishermen remain engaged in management discussions that will strive to make this stock resilient for future generations he said the numbers suggest something of a rebound for the maine lobster industry helped along by inflation after the pandemic resulted in a lower catch and lower value in 2020 than in the years before the pandemic s forced closure of traditional markets hit the industry hard and canceled flights and economic shutdowns across the world tanked the international lobster market as well dealers and the maine lobster marketing collaborative quickly pivoted targeting grocery stores and the home consumer it was incredibly successful advertisement according to marianne lacroix executive director of the maine lobster marketing collaborative consumer awareness and interest in buying seafood for home preparation increased considerably in 2020 but then in 2021 restaurants cruise ships and hotels opened back up and international exports resumed it created a lot of demand in a lot of different sectors lacroix said plus with the vaccines readily available and some sense of normalcy returning people were willing to pay more for celebratory foods she said so they naturally turned to lobster annie tselikis executive director of the maine lobster dealers association said this treat yourself mentality created an insatiable demand for products typically live lobsters drive most of the demand for the dealers and processors advertisement however with the ongoing labor crisis many restaurants and businesses that normally would handle live lobsters instead moved to value added products such as frozen lobster lobster tails minced lobster meat and more tselikis said demand for these value added products increased dramatically she said storms on the horizon maine lobster industry members celebrated the record breaking harvest value on monday but said a good financial year will not ward off any of their upcoming challenges fishermen say new rules from the federal government designed to protect right whales could wipe out the fishery over the next 10 years other threats such as losing lobstering bottom to windmill projects and aquaculture leases also are on the horizon lacroix said advertisement it s coming from all sides so it s nice to have a little good news she said patrice mccarron executive director of the maine lobstermen s association said the industry needs to double down on efforts to make sure the news stays good while last year s harvest broke records the challenges facing the fishery are unprecedented mccarron said in a statement lobstermen continue to face escalating operational costs due to inflation and supply chain issues even as they cope with the federal government s burdensome 10 year whale plan that threatens to wipe out the entire industry the high price of lobster is a good thing for now she said but as inflation puts a squeeze on consumers wallets it runs the risk of becoming too expensive these products are very expensive and consumers don t like paying a lot for food tselikis said noting that lobster is one of the most expensive proteins on the market it will be interesting to see what happens moving forward putnam the chebeague island lobsterman is counting on them staying high advertisement i think that the price we re seeing has to be sustained given the expenses we re seeing on our end he said citing rising fuel labor and bait costs we re all at a point where we re dependent on these higher prices it s exciting to have a good year financially but we have to be aware there are regulations that greatly threaten our industry as a whole he said in a statement gov janet mills pledged to keep fighting for what she called a vital maine heritage industry the maine lobster industry remains a cornerstone of our state s coastal economy and identity because of the uncompromising commitment to quality that follows every lobster from trap to table she said other fisheries landings data will be reported in march send questions comments to the editors previous next

monday the index opened down 36 points but swiftly rebounded to ultimately close up 26 last night the s p500 fell 0 3 and our futures are showing down 0 9 this morning i noted yesterday that a volatile macro overlay for the market during reporting season is unfortunate as it distorts assessments of individual company performances but it also works the other way defiant strength in the asx200 yesterday was as much about positive earnings results as it was about oil and gold a geopolitically driven jump in oil prices on friday night had our energy sector up 3 4 yesterday and utilities up 1 9 beach energy bpt also provided a strong result on the day and topped the index with a 9 4 gain the following four top five positions were filled by gold miners with 7 8 gains yet the materials sector fell 0 4 on a weaker iron ore price and lithium battery stocks going off the boil battery tech company novonix nvx topped the index losers with a 10 8 fall while miners liontown

you can always rely on a jb hi fi jbh result it rose 5 4 but weak responses followed results from boral bld and aurizon holdings azj while investment platform praemium pps was hammered 13 9 it was another poor session for healthcare 1 7 as csl csl struggles with us plasma collections the other interesting sector move to note was technology it fell 0 3 with the nasdaq down 2 8 on friday night amongst several earnings reports due today that of australia s biggest company will be the one in the spotlight we have oil prices up again overnight and gold up again while iron ore has slipped slightly and base metals were mixed as to why the futures are down more emphatically than wall street this morning is unclear russian about it was a down up down up session on wall street last night as the market responded to every little snippet of the constantly developing ukraine russia story at different times we had the russian foreign minister suggesting diplomatic talks will continue german chancellor sargent sholz shuttling between kyiv and moscow the ukrainian president announcing russia will invade on wednesday which turned out to be an ironic snipe at western scare mongers and the us closing its embassy in kyiv and moving it west to near the polish border destroying all communications hardware before departure so what s going to happen that s the problem everyone has an opinion but nobody other than perhaps putin knows and even he may not be certain meanwhile the flight to safety was again apparent in gold and the us dollar but the us ten year yield climbed up once more by 4 basis points to 1 99 the dow recovered from dropping more than 430 points early to close down 171 while the nasdaq this time outperformed the rest in closing flat despite higher yields the vix volatility index has in the last few sessions traded above 30 on the day before slipping under by the close 28 last night the 30 level is considered that beyond which it s best left only to the day traders everyone else stay out one interesting move in the s p last night was that of the energy sector wti rose another 1 8 but the energy sector fell 2 2 to be the worst performer on the day it is suggested that while higher oil prices are clearly a positive for energy companies when you get towards us 100 bbl you are facing demand destruction and a possible economic downturn all we know for now is that putin will either invade tomorrow or next week or after the olympics so as to not upset his mate xi or not it could just all be a big try on or not commodities spot metals minerals energy

thousand oaks calif feb 14 2022 prnewswire amgen nasdaq amgn today announced the presentation of efficacy and safety data from the codebreak 100 phase 1 2 trial in patients with kras g12c mutated advanced pancreatic cancer who received lumakras sotorasib the data will be presented at the monthly american society of clinical oncology asco plenary series on feb 15 2022 data show encouraging and clinically meaningful anticancer activity and a positive benefit risk profile based on these exciting data we are expanding codebreak 100 to enroll more patients with pancreatic and other tumor types to better understand the efficacy and safety of lumakras in tumors outside of non small cell lung and colorectal cancers said david m reese m d executive vice president of research and development at amgen codebreak is the largest and broadest global clinical trial program to date with one of the most robust centrally reviewed datasets as we learn more from the extensive data that we collect we ll continue to invest in the program by expanding cohorts and exploring new combinations so that we can help as many patients as possible lumakras demonstrated a centrally confirmed objective response rate orr of 21 and disease control rate dcr of 84 across 38 heavily pre treated advanced pancreatic cancer patients nearly 80 of patients received lumakras as a third line or later therapy eight of the 38 patients achieved a confirmed partial response pr performed by a blinded independent central review bicr two of the eight patients with pr have ongoing responses median duration of response was 5 7 months with a median follow up of 16 8 months as of the data cutoff date of nov 1 2021 the results also show a median progression free survival pfs of 4 months and a median overall survival os of almost 7 months no new safety signals were identified with this study of patients with advanced pancreatic cancers treatment related adverse events traes of any grade occurred in 16 42 patients with diarrhea 5 and fatigue 5 as the most common grade 3 traes no traes were fatal or resulted in treatment discontinuation after decades of research current treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer provide limited survival benefit illustrating the critical need for novel safe and effective treatment options said john strickler m d associate professor of medicine duke university school of medicine and gastrointestinal oncologist in the largest dataset evaluating the efficacy and safety of a krasg12c inhibitor in heavily pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer sotorasib achieved a centrally confirmed response rate of 21 and a disease control rate of 84 this is clinically meaningful for patients because there is not an established standard therapy for these patients once they get to a third line of treatment cancer of the pancreas is a highly lethal malignancy it is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in both men and women in the u s with a 5 year survival rate of approximately 10 1 there is a high unmet need for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that has progressed after first line treatment where fda approved second line therapy has provided survival of about six months and a response rate of 16 2 after progression on first and second line chemotherapy there are no therapies with a demonstrated survival benefit 2 3 despite advances in

meanwhile the opec 10 are stuggling to hit their agreed upon quotas with even saudi arabia falling behind its target production levels in january while some analysts have started calling for a significant pullback in oil prices there are plenty of reasons to believe prices will continue to rise inflation has hit a four decade high in the u s and traders are looking to oil and commodities as a safe havens due to their ability to hold value after a torrid run oil has barely managed to squeak out a second week of gains in a volatile session as risk off sentiment spreads in broader markets predictably the bears have started coming out of the woods with citigroup recently predicting an oil price crash to 65 this year but luckily for the oil bulls there s no shortage of positive catalysts in this market stewart glickman energy equity analyst at cfra research in new york says traders are now seeking refuge in commodities including oil as a hedge against inflation when you have an inflationary period that s generally good for commodities as a physical commodity oil tends to hold its value better oil and gold are now seen as safer havens while other assets are being inflated out glickman has told bloomberg economic data showed that u s inflation surged to a four decade high of 7 5 prompting federal reserve bank of st louis president james bullard to advocate for a supersized rate hike while equities declined on the day oil is viewed as a safer bet amid rising cost pressures french president macron recently said he has received assurances from vladimir putin that there would be no escalation of russian pressure on ukraine while diplomats from iran and world powers have reconvened in vienna to seek a deal reviving the 2015 nuclear accord but while geopolitical optimism has prompted some profit taking oanda analyst edward moya says the price weakness likely will be short lived as the oil market remains in a supply deficit in the first five weeks of the year the u s normally builds several million barrels of inventory ahead of the summer driving season this year inventories have fallen by almost a million barrels a day according to data by the department of energy in a break from recent history there doesn t appear to be a strong supply response to rising prices and declining inventories when chevron nyse cvx reported q4 results two weeks ago the company guided the street to flay yoy production in 2022 exxon nyse xom did the same as did bp nyse bp and conocophillips nyse cop bakken producer whiting nyse wll announced they plan to increase capex 55 in 2022 and acquire assets to generate only 3 production growth driller nabors nyse nbr reported earnings tuesday and indicated they don t expect to add any rigs outside the us in q1 opec struggling to keep up opec has been setting a high bar for itself boosting production quotas by 400kb d each month since mid 2021 the group has consistently missed that target and there are signs that things are getting worse the opec 10 countries within opec excluding venezuela libya and iran were budgeted to increase production by 254kb d in january with the remainder of the 400kb d quota allocated to russia and others official results released on thursday indicate that opec 10 had increased production by only 135kb d and now sit a full 748kb d below self imposed quota levels angola saw production decrease with january volumes coming in more than 250kb d below quota while nigeria saw a boost in january volumes up 60kb d leading the country to underproduce by only 285kb d perhaps most interestingly saudi arabia s production fell 123kb d below its targeted amount in january outside of the core 10 libyan and venezuelan volumes fell while iranian volumes increased in total the three countries saw volumes fall 33kb d month on month meanwhile russian volumes for january increased 85kb d compared to the country s budgeted 100kb d increase while it s abundantly clear that opec is unable to hit production targets there s some debate on the us s ability to meet growing demand this week citi oil strategist ed morse advised clients to short the oil market while famed oil investor pierre andurand suggested inflation adjusted oil prices are relatively low by historical standards with the 2008 high of 147 b equating to 222 b today advertisement oil prices are still trading near seven year highs and the biden administration is feeling pressure to lower inflation the fastest way to do that would be to lower energy prices as mizuho s robert yawger has told marketwatch the biden administration says all options are on the table for managing energy prices spokesperson psaki said yesterday the white house is talking with oil producing countries about production increases and oil consuming countries about strategic reserves releases however neither tactic has been successful at lowering prices in recent months and it appears low supplies and high

when filing their federal income tax return people who choose to itemize their deductions as opposed to taking the standard deduction have the option to write off mortgage interest so people who pay more interest get a greater tax benefit the intent of this deduction is to effectively subsidize home ownership however this is bad government policy and the mortgage interest tax deduction should be abolished here s why it gives preferential treatment to some people at the expense of others people who buy a home get a tax benefit people who rent a home or apartment do not get any benefit it taxes the poor and gives to the rich only about 30 of tax filers itemize their deductions these tend to be richer people poorer middle class home owners who take the standard deduction get no benefit states do not have equal housing markets a small house in north dakota may cost 200 000 while the same sized house in california would cost 2 million since people who pay more interest get a greater tax benefit communities with cheap housing are subsidizing communities with expensive housing it decreases home ownership the popular argument is that subsidizing interest will make it more affordable and increase home ownership this has been debunked by economists the benefit of any taxes is already reflected in the price of the property sellers know buyers want the tax benefit so they charge a higher price in response it increases the risk of default by encouraging people to take more debt it is more likely that this debt can get out of hand if people s financial situation changes also if the value of the property decreases below the value of the debt it becomes feasible to abandon the debt and let the bank take the property back this happened a lot during the 2008 financial crisis and was its primary driving factor in conclusion the mortgage interest deduction makes our tax system more regressive it benefits the rich at the expense of the poor furthermore it distorts both housing and financial markets there is no justification for this deduction it should be abolished if we want a fair tax system that benefits everybody increase the standard deduction instead william smith lives in fargo this letter does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the forum s editorial board nor forum ownership
washington feb 14 2022 america needs more blood blood supplies which typically run at about a five day stock on hospital shelves have been reduced to less than a one day supply of certain blood types according to ashley henyan communications director for the american red cross that is also the case in the national capital region blood already has a limited 42 day shelf life and blood platelets last only five days regular donors would have to roll up their sleeves once every 56 days to give the red cross the reserve it is more accustomed to the shortages come as the red cross in a study funded by the food and drug administration examines the viability of changing existing donation rules to permit gay and bisexual men to donate blood without a long waiting period after their last sexual contacts with other men the blood shortage and looming expiration dates of the blood available on the shelves also poses additional difficulties to a medical system already experiencing severe challenges during the covid pandemic blood donations usually see a decrease in the summer months throughout the holiday season and during the winter months outside of these time periods donations typically increase we re just not seeing it bounce back henyan told capital news service so because it stayed at this low point for so many months in a row now that s what s making it a crisis henyan also pointed out that blood cannot be manufactured it cannot be produced and it cannot be stockpiled factors which make a steady supply of donors absolutely critical to resolving the shortage she also cited that there is currently less than a one day supply for maryland and the district of columbia it s kind of leading to this perfect storm where we re unable to collect as much but you need more said kate fry ceo of america s blood centers an organization that works alongside the red cross and helps distribute donated blood to regions where it needs to be fry also works to counteract misinformation about blood donation during the pandemic if you re vaccinated or unvaccinated you can still donate blood she said despite the blood shortages the fda still has policies in place barring men from donating blood until three months after their most recent sexual encounter with other men this three month period replaced a 12 month period in the spring of 2020 an attempt by the fda to allow more flexibility in blood donations during a shortage however the changed guidance isn t sufficient to solve the shortage problem or include sexually active gay and bisexual men in more frequent blood donations according to henyan i think it s unfortunate how many gay and bisexual men feel excluded not just are excluded but actually feel excluded from donating blood said christian morris a recruitment specialist with the whitman walker institute a washington based lgbtq research policy and advocacy organization founded in 1973 as an hiv clinic morris has recruited almost 300 participants with the whitman walker institute for what is being called the assessing donor variability and new concepts in eligibility or advance study the study hopes to provide evidence to repeal the current policy that discriminates against the participation of gay and bisexual men in donating blood according to morris instead donation policy could be changed to rely on a case by case risk assessment for each potential donor josh sorbe a 24 year old participant from washington found out about the advance study through twitter and decided to donate blood at the washington location because it was a way to give back during pride month in october sorbe told cns the whole process took three weeks and included a health history questionnaire and donating four vials of blood he said he hopes that the study will modernize fda guidance on donating blood a lot of data is rooted potentially in homophobia from the 20th century and this groundbreaking study really allows us to bring the discussion about blood eligibility donation requirements into 2022 sorbe said while the advance study is still ongoing morris said he is confident that the fda policy on gay and bisexual men donating blood will be updated within the next couple of years for sorbe updated guidance would be deeply satisfying the queer community is willing to step up when people need help and the fact that some of the most likely givers are still ruled out from archaic eligibility requirements is absurd to me he said so i m really hoping this allows us to have the conversation of who can donate blood it s super easy it s not hard to do and it s one of the best things you can do that can change someone s life

please rejoin the queue now i d like to introduce our chief executive officer emanuele lauro emanuele lauro chief executive officer thank you james and good morning and good afternoon to everyone thank you for your time today for the last six quarters product tanker rates have remained below our all in cash breakeven levels there is no sugarcoating it the weakness in the product tanker market and prolonged recovery has been frustrating i d like to thank our shareholders for their support and patience during the past year which unfortunately has been another covid year scorpio tankers finished 2021 with more cash on the balance sheet than in 2020 we continue to focus on what we can control in january 2022 we agreed to sell 14 vessels these sales increase liquidity they reduce overall debt and highlight both a significant increase in asset values as well as the discount our shares trade to these higher asset values themselves the decision to sell assets is consistent with our efforts to maintain a strong liquidity position and significant operating leverage in a challenging market our top priority remains the same position the company to create shareholder value in an improving market and for the next tanker cycle we feel the recovery is close and the next tanker cycle not far behind as far as demand is concerned oil demand increased by 19 million barrels a day since may 2020 and is expected to surpass pre covid levels this year at the same time refined product inventories are at historically low levels and drew 180 million barrels from january through november 2021 so the catalyst is simple supply and incremental oil demand with inventory draws is just not sustainable in the long term the timing is less simple to read but the inflection point is near in december product tanker rates reached their highest level since the start of covid while the spread of the omicron variant slowed the momentum there are several reasons to suggest it will return this year i would like to now turn the call to james doyle who has been recently promoted to the position of head of corporate development and investor relations he will now walk you through a brief presentation as he discussed in his opening remarks james congratulations please go ahead james doyle head of corporate development investor relations thank you emanuele good morning and afternoon everyone at the end of the fourth quarter we started to see a material improvement in rates specifically in december and it seemed as if the inflection point was finally here even with significant inventory draws rates pushed higher however by early january the rapid spread of the omicron variant had impacted our markets and rates began to slow recently our smaller vessels the handymax and mrs have shown more of an improvement because of the demand strengths we re seeing in the u s latin america africa and europe on the other hand the lr2s have been slower to recover and this is largely due to lower demand in asia and a reduction in arbitrage opportunities since q3 we have seen 19 lr2 switch from trading clean to dirty which is the equivalent of about 8 fleet reduction and creates a favorable supply demand setup as asian demand returns if there is any evidence of a demand recovery in refined products in 2021 it s the draws we saw in gasoline and distillate inventories from january through november we drew 181 million barrels of gasoline and distillate inventories are now at historically low levels and we feel the headwind is behind us while omicron delayed the first quarter recovery we are optimistic for 2022 so the question is how close are we well in 2021 ton mile demand exceeded pre covid levels which may seem surprising when you look at rates the driver behind the ton mile demand growth has been refinery closures over the last two years we ve seen a significant number of closures these are often older less efficient or poorly located refineries weak operating margins and maintenance capex to keep these refineries operating doesn t make sense for the first time in 30 years refinery closures outweighed new capacity in 2021 after the refinery closes in most cases the lost output needs to be replaced the most favorable example is australia which closed two of its four refineries last year and has since increased its product exports by 200 000 barrels a day in november to make up for this lost production on the volume side refined product exports were around one million barrels per day lower than pre covid levels however from a demand perspective when you account for the inventory draws that occurred last year it s about half that in other words without inventory draws we re only about 500 000 barrels a day below 2019 levels so will 2022 be the year refining product exports exceed pre covid levels we think so while jet fuel may take until 2022 2023 and 2024 to fully recover the increase in gasoline diesel and naphtha have offset lower jet fuel demand crude oil and refined product demand is expected to increase by 4 million barrels a day this year if 25 of this increased demand is exported seaborne exports of refined products will increase by 1 million barrels per day also this excludes the additional demand of around half a million barrels that were supplied with inventory draws last year timing is always challenging but we expect a sequential improvement in demand each quarter throughout the year inventories are at historically low levels and have declined as refinery utilization has increased so the ability to draw from inventories has reduced substantially thus given the low inventory levels to meet the increased demand this year we expect higher refinery runs and consequently product exports refined product exports and ton mile demand are expected to increase 6 and 7 this year one could argue by the end of the year it will be higher supply the product tanker order book is at a record low with 5 3 of the existing fleet on order today by looking at the low order book one might think that shipyards are desperate for orders but it s quite the opposite other shipping segments other shipping segments have done so well such as containers that the yards are fully booked we do expect more product tankers to be ordered but if ordered today these vessels would not be delivered until 2025 while the order book is at an all time low scrapping is at an all time high this is due to higher steel and scrap prices but also the age distribution of the fleet unlike other sectors product tankers were not built in mass until the early 2000s so scrapping has been minimal and basically everything that s been delivered hasn t left the fleet however this will start to change and we saw the start of this last year with 48 product tankers scrapped today there are 267 product tankers 20 years and older by 2025 excluding scrapping there will be 687 product tankers 20 years and older and this is not including the roughly thousand product tankers that will be 15 to 19 years old without additional newbuilding orders more than half the fleet will be 15 years and older by 2025 using modest scrapping assumptions product tanker net fleet growth is around 1 3 the next two years before going negative however if we use the scrap rate that reflects the age profile of the fleet supply growth is essentially zero for the next two years before going negative in 2025 financial highlights while everyone is focused on rates and liquidity there has been a substantial increase in asset values rising steel and labor costs as well as newbuilding orders from other segments of still unavailable yard capacity driving prices higher and delivery dates later since january 2021 five year old lr2s have increased 12 5 million per vessel if we apply this increase to scorpio tankers 42 lr2 vessels it would increase gross asset value alone of the lr2 fleet by 525 million it also means your ltv is decreasing in january we announced the sale of 14 vessels these sales increase our liquidity reduce our debt and crystallize the steep discount our shares trade relative to our net asset value after the completion of the sales the company will have over 460 million in pro forma liquidity as emanuele mentioned to maintain liquidity with rates below all in cash breakeven levels we have refinanced vessels as opposed to raising equity and also sold some if we look at the debt repayment schedule which excludes amortization for the 14 vessels that will be slow sold the company has two maturities in the next eight quarters the convertible bond which will be repaid in q2 and a credit facility that matures in q4 2022 in the past we ve seen different comments and figures around the debt that s due in a given period for the company so for clarity we use the credit facility that s due in q4 as an example which is the blue box and the repayment graph before this facility matures we arranged to refinance the vessel in the facility with the new lender thus when the facility matures in q4 we repay the 16 9 million debt balance and then drawdown on a new loan facility alternatively we could sell the vessel repay the debt and collect the proceeds this happens to be an lr2 so our current prices would generate significant liquidity if you look at the company s balance sheet over the last six quarters you will see a significant change however our view of the balance sheet is that after several challenging quarters ltv has decreased we have 600 million in pro forma liquidity which creates flexibility in the event of a longer market recovery we have refinanced essentially all of our upcoming maturities and have minimal capex we will repay 485 million of debt in the first half of this year from scheduled amortization debt associated with vessel sales and convertible bond maturity given these points in our positive outlook for the market we feel well positioned to wrap it up the company has the largest product tanker fleet in the world comprised entirely of eco vessels we have significant operating leverage a thousand dollars a day change in product tanker rates equates to 42 7 million in annual cash flow but we know rates don t usually move by a thousand dollars a day we have positioned the balance sheet to provide flexibility with increased liquidity and a plan to deliver our shares trade at a steep discount to our net asset value the market inflection point is close and the long term supply demand fundamentals suggest we could have an extended tanker cycle not far after with that i will turn it over to q a questions answers operator our first question comes from omar nokta with clarkson securities omar nokta clarksons platou securities analyst thank you hey guys good morning good afternoon james thanks for that i think a pretty good run through of things you know clearly liquidity has been a focus you know for the past year and a half or so and you managed really to continuously enhance your cash position with debt refinancing you know aside from sale leasebacks actual sales have not been something you d done in the past or recent past so just regarding the lr1 deal you know we ve gotten used to seeing when an owner sell ship in a tough earnings environment especially an unblocked fleet in an all cash deal they usually come out at a discount at sale price but your lr1 s got a pretty hefty premium i d say can you talk a little bit about how that transaction came about and what really compelled you to move forward with it robert bugbee president sure ok i think the easiest thing to do first understand is that as james pointed out prices have been moving up and moving up quite strongly so you know you ve got a quite a strong sale and purchase market to start with so you may have had the vessels sold at a surprisingly high price to the market and as james is inferring that you know we strongly believe even now that net asset values have been adjusted up high enough and that doesn t just apply to us that applies to other product tanking companies with modern fleets you know those who actually those less than 10 years 7 8 years old so the first thing is you had a market that was very strong it came about through a very competitive basis i mean we d indicated in a couple of quite large conference calls and in the press that we would be willing to sell vessels as part of the liquidity position that it s a win win for us because first of all it increases liquidity but second i mean it s a very rational thing for management to do when you when they think when you think your nav is trading above 30 and your stock is trading you know below 50 of net asset value and you believe that the fundamentals are very strong but you have an uncertain point to recovery you first get a sort of knock out you don t have to worry about liquidity anymore the second thing you get is an offensive position where you know we ve always said to the degree that you know that we re earning you know above our all in breakeven 17 a day and we re going to start looking to buying stock back as an alternative so in an offensive position the strengthening and putting cash on that balance sheet and getting the situation where when that market turns the next question that analysts and i m sure you yourself will ask is you ve now probably got too much liquidity what are you going to do with it comes at a much earlier point in the cycle we ve had previous experience of the benefits of that so that s really how it came about omar nokta clarksons platou securities analyst thanks robert good good good color there and i guess yeah just on the context of you know being offensive and having too much liquidity clearly now your pro forma cash position is you know well over 400 million which i think is the highest in many years you know the question obviously now is how do you feel now with that position ahead of a recovery and do you foresee future sales to maybe take advantage of that nav arbitrage robert bugbee president sure i mean among what we see especially you know as omicron seems to be you know going away you know even faster than some people hope and we re getting some analysis that actual tank actual headline demand for products and crude is much higher than people thought so we look at this in the glass half full way it s actually pretty incredible that you had you know apart from the united states really not much flying going on in the world you ve had a you know some form of restrictions going on in the last four or five weeks even in the freest covid countries and yet the demand for oil and its derivatives have been so very strong and you ve got as james pointed out multi year levels of inventory turned down so that really sets up a situation where you ve got this very long term great market and it s just a question of when that s going to happen i think to your second part we re really comfortable in the actual liquidity part we would not sell further vessels because we have deep liquidity but you know i think it still holds true that you know maybe we would sell you know some more vessels just simply again because once you have an nav over 30 into a rising market that you re able to establish over and over again with sales you know there s nothing wrong in actually you know let s say piling on the cash and the optionality especially one with a company with the amount of vessels that we have doesn t it just doesn t affect our operating level at all i mean we re not married to you know any particular omar nokta clarksons platou securities analyst understood thanks robert good color and those are my two questions i ll turn it over operator our next question comes from randy giveans with jefferies randy giveans jefferies analyst howdy gentlemen how s it going emanuele lauro chief executive officer hi randy robert bugbee president good thank you randy randy giveans jefferies analyst hey so first on your quarter to date rates you know much stronger than the negative rates that the headline markets are showing so with that should we expect the rest of the quarter to be below these levels as most of that strength was from maybe december let s call it or are the actual current rates much stronger than the headline rates that we re seeing robert bugbee president that s a great question the question we ask ourselves you see because it s all over the place i mean you ve got extreme volatility now randy giveans jefferies analyst yup robert bugbee president you have you know you actually had a lot of headway last week in the last week in mrs for example which we re starting to trade quite firmly in out of the u s you know side and west of suez it was actually starting to pick up a bunch of you know speed in the east you know we re actually even starting to pick up a couple of jet fuel cargoes we even load a big jet fuel cargo for the first time in many many weeks out of the ag on one of the big ships and it s literally you know you ve got this inventory situation you ve got you know a very turbulent market so you really don t know to be honest is the answer you know as to when the exact time this market is going to you know spin upward it s very tight so to work out whether or not the next 50 is going to be the same you know worse materially better than the last 50 is quite difficult i think that we can be confident that you know overall it s going to be our overall rates are going to be above you know let s say 10 you know that s going to add to adds to our let s say nav value anyway to the degree that the prices of vessels are not going to go down but we don t know is the absolute answer in this but you know it s just we see it as just time now these markets are tight as the winter has shown in those rates that we re showing the type so by saying we don t know i wouldn t take that as a negative position to the future randy giveans jefferies analyst yup no that s fair hard to prognosticate from here second question following the vessel sales which would certainly be accretive if you use those for share buybacks but your fleet still massive obviously a little bit of your operating exposure has been reduced so with that we look at charter in vessels to maybe increase that spot exposure or on the other hand our time charter rate is too high and you re actually maybe looking to charter out some tonnage to secure some cash flow robert bugbee president we re not looking at that route 100 randy giveans jefferies analyst ok robert bugbee president you know we are and i ll say it for the first time on this call today and even at the risk of being criticized we are very bullish extremely bullish you know supremely bullish whichever bullish you know you want to put we re there emanuele lauro chief executive officer el toro robert bugbee president i could say we re bullish 82 times over ok randy giveans jefferies analyst noted robert bugbee president right so no chartering out we are you know always looking for charter in opportunities so far you know we ve kind of been disappointed in that sense because rates add save and purchase rights the good quality ships are actually quite firm there is a you know it s clearly not only us that is bullish you have a very strong s p market and despite what you ve had even through all of omicron you ve had a pretty strong forward market certainly in contango to the spot market randy giveans jefferies analyst got it all right bold up noted james congrats on the promotion great role well deserved thanks again james doyle head of corporate development investor relations thank you randy operator our next question comes from jon chappell with evercore jon chappell evercore isi analyst thank you good morning hey james so you lay out a good you know profile of what s going on with the inventories i think robert said something important which was that the u s is basically the only country where you re seeing kind of normalized flying asia s been a big growth area for a long time now what are you seeing there as it relates to you know inventories versus oecd you know flying activity other modes of transportation is it possible that we re so focused on the western world coming out of the virus that asia can continue to be a drag and that s one of the reasons that the recovery continues to get pushed to the right james doyle head of corporate development investor relations no you know i think what s happened with asia is obviously over the summer the delta variant the omicron variant this winter they imposed a lot stricter travel restrictions and really everything is tied to personal mobility right on the consumption side here when you restrict that you know obviously demand goes down and asia though prior to omicron was actually starting to be quite strong again so i think for the current time you ve got obviously the impact of omicron you had winter new year you ve got the olympics so i do think asian demand is going to come back here i also think there s probably a difficult component to factor in with rising natural gas prices that have affected refineries differently which is leading to a lot of volatility but i think looking at the demand side on jet we re probably 1 5 million barrels away from where we were pre covid but on the water it s probably only say 200 000 barrels so i think we will see the return here i just it s hard the timing is hard jon chappell evercore isi analyst that s understood robert bugbee president i would add jon you know that you yourself i think have a really incredibly interesting graph the other day talking about the you know where it showed these real drawdowns that are going on the inventories and if you i think that s something while running i m highlighting you because you really did encapsulate it very well on this table that there really has been a lot of missing barrels in the demand for the tankers whether it s products or crude as a result of these inventory draws and that just can t go on forever if you simply went to stopping inventory draws forget about rebuilding multi decade lows you would expand even the asian demand very very quickly straightaway jon chappell evercore isi analyst yeah thanks for highlighting that i think the inventories are the most important thing to watch right now you can see it in the presentation james for my follow up you get the promotion you get the hard questions i think there s this view that you know an iranian sanctions lifting positive for crude maybe not a clear cut answer if it means anything for the product also i think there s been some you know a little bit of publicity that if there were a geopolitical event with russia and ukraine possibly good for tanker ton miles but of course that doesn t take into account a rising oil price might do any work that you ve done or thoughts on those two geopolitical events and what that could do to the timing of the recovery or the magnitude james doyle head of corporate development investor relations sure when it comes to iran the benefit would be increased condensate exports which would benefit the lrs you know it depends where sanctions would be but certain lr2 vessels will carry that cargo and actually there are south korean petrochemical plants designed to run that condensate as feedstock so i think it s somewhere around 300 000 to 400 000 barrels a day of exports for the lr2 fleet which would be beneficial when it comes to russia and the ukraine it s hard to say what will happen but what i can say is obviously russia is a large exporter of crude oil at 4 2 million barrels a day and refined product exports probably around 1 5 million barrels a day most of this is trading are going to europe and asia but obviously if there were a conflict we d have to factor those numbers into our analysis jon chappell evercore isi analyst got it thank you james thanks robert emanuele lauro chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from greg lewis with btig greg lewis btig analyst hey thank you thank you and good day everybody i guess my first question is around there was a lot of news and reports about refinery closures really ongoing throughout the pandemic whether it was in australia parts of europe a lot of refinery closures happened and that was expected to create you know dislocations ton miles is it possible or how should we think about just given the slow recovery you know in some of these parts of the world i guess what i m wondering is has the full benefit of these refinery closures been realized do we think across you know global product tanker seaborne ton mile demand james doyle head of corporate development investor relations not yet part of it yes but when you draw 181 million barrels of global gasoline and distillate inventories everything is a little bit muted and then you factor in that just overall demand is you know slightly below pre covid levels so i think we ve certainly seen it when we look at how much volumes gone to australia but when you start and we ve probably seen some of it with u s east coast imports after the closure of the canadian refinery but i think we ll really start to see the impact as demand kind of gets back to pre covid levels and it ll be essentially a multiplier to that greg lewis btig analyst ok great and then just one more for me around the congrats on the vessel sales previously announced you know one of the questions we always get is around the depth of the s p market and really i think i d be curious to hear beyond the actual buyers how competitive was that process and any way to quantify how much interest there were from the broader industry for the vessels that were eventually sold emanuele lauro chief executive officer i ll take that greg the competitive process was pretty vast in the sense that as robert alluded to just a few minutes ago on this call we were vocal about the fact that we were selling we re going to sell ships and this has created by itself a competitive process with all the interested parties coming in there were pockets of buyers interested in mrs lr2s one or two on the handys and more than we expected on the lr1s the reason we chose to do the transaction we did it s because it was a clean transaction with a natural buyer that has appetite for that specific fleet being a market leader in the lr1 segment which appreciated the design features of our lr1 fleet being modern eco wide beam and all of the features that they didn t have in their fleet themselves so when we started negotiating with hafnia it became apparent that it was a good fit for both companies and we enjoy a good relationship and a good working relationship with them and decided that that was going to be our main transaction fairly early in the process once we saw that we could have executed on that greg lewis btig analyst ok thank you emanuele have a great day everybody emanuele lauro chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from ken hoexter with bank of america ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning and good afternoon so it looks like on the selling of vessels you mentioned you get a few months runway of cash you get through some of the repayments rates here are starting off a bit weaker than i guess you would have expected emanuele you were more sanguine to start the call i know you re robert you re super uber bullish i ve been on these calls for years i don t think you ve never not been uber bullish so what is getting you that bullish here is it the setup of lower inventories it doesn t seem to have monetized for years right we ve been talking about james have been talking about the drawdown of inventories the setup of low fleet low order book so what needs to happen here in order to start seeing this to come to reality in terms of the rates and you know moving above cash cost and starting to not worry about the refinancing and debt paydown emanuele lauro chief executive officer i ll start and robert bugbee president go on emanuele emanuele lauro chief executive officer i was just saying that i think james mentioned this on a few minutes ago on this call i think that mobility is affecting demand product tanker demand and that is the main catalyst on which we will be seeing a recovery i agree with what james said a few minutes ago mobility is the one that we are the main catalyst we re waiting for having said that all the fundamentals and i think you would agree with us are pointing in the right direction so it s on the demand from things are looking ok on the supply from things are looking ok on the inventory side things are looking ok so all the fundamentals are there mobility needs to kick in for the market to reap robert bugbee president i think also ken i think we should remember that why let s say i m uber bullish is in your words i think that s a great word or a great phrase is that you know two years ago the beginning of you know 2021 the stock was over 40 rates were really moving strongly across every sector of the product market and what james is indicating is we re going to get a return to that demand level and in fact higher in terms of ton miles because we expect demand headline to be higher and we expect these refinery changes to increase the ton mile position but supply itself partly because of regulation partly because of a lack of order book and partly because of aging and scrapping it s more or less going to be the same not much different so therefore we kind of know where that market is going to what s going to happen at that point we know that in the dull market that we have with all the inventory draws against us all the demand headwinds that the rates are what they are that we put out today and we have seen what that market is likely to be and on top of that inflation and yard tightness at the moment and the lack of ability to order ships and the fact that yard prices have gone up since that period two years ago your actual asset values are higher than where they were two years ago too so that i think is a very strong reason to be uber bullish as you put it ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes it s just the setup right it always seems to be there we just need i guess you re right the mobility up robert bugbee president yes but i don t think anybody predicted the covid ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes robert bugbee president in january 2021 right ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst so just a minor thanks robert and emanuele a minor i guess some balance sheet question if i can brian accounts payable seem to be going up significantly accounts receivable i think it only minorly changed is there any change in is that seasonal is there there s something to be the highlight on the balance sheet brian lee chief financial officer it s timing differences ken nothing there i just hope you said our liquidity goes for a few months it goes up for more than a few months if you look at it at the lowest rates as a company we ever had of 10 100 in q3 of this of 2020 we look at those rates compared to our breakevens we get eight months of time if we look at it what we re currently doing we get almost 17 5 months so it s a little bit more than a few months i know that s just a phrase you threw out but i just want to make it clear to everybody on that ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok yeah no i was commenting from what you got brian lee chief financial officer it s the additional ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst i thought you guys had said when you did the vessel sales it put us out a couple months on cash flows i get your math now brian lee chief financial officer it s the right it s the additional liquidity on top of what we have now it goes up for quite a bit so ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks for the time guys brian lee chief financial officer thanks ken operator our next question comes from ben nolan with stifel benjamin nolan stifel financial corp analyst hey guys first congrats james it s quite a step up so nicely done also nicely done on the all of your presentation today the my first question goes back to you discussed the lr1 sale a little bit and it seemed opportunistic just confirming there was nothing structural about lr1s that you think ok well we prefer lr2s or mrs or something like that it was just that s where the best buy interest is is that fair robert bugbee president no no no no i think that there was in terms of valuation there was first of all there s buying across the board across all the site and this is universally across modern tanker modern product tanker the prices have moved upward i think what s so rational for us in the lr1s was that here we could do the job on the balance sheet and giving us the strategic freedom later hopefully to create some real value but at the same time the lr1s is the one grouping the one size range that we ourselves that don t have let s say leadership position you know we have a leadership position in the handy in mrs and the lr2s in the lr1s we had a good position but not a leadership position and the best dynamic for us overall not only was as emanuele pointing out where it was hafnia the best seller solid buyer it also became which he didn t explain the best alternative that alternative at even prices across other vessels because here you were able to we believe very much in consolidation we ve spoken about this before and we were able to place those vessels into the hands of the number one owner and operators of lr1s thereby consolidating as opposed to fragmenting that market and that market sits between even though it s a smaller market in mrs and lr2s it is important in that it sit in between mrs and lr2s so anything we can do to help strengthen that dynamic in the lr1 market will be beneficial to us mr and lr2 market benjamin nolan stifel financial corp analyst ok that s very clear thanks robert and then for my second question notice that you guys are continuing to add scrubbers especially on the mrs obviously the fuel spreads have widened back out i guess my question is you talked about shipyard tightness on the new builds obviously there are supply chain issues is there are you running into with the wider margins i would imagine there s other people also out there looking to install scrubbers at this point is there how hard is that to do is it challenging to get shipyard space for repairs and discover installations are hard to get the equipment itself any chance of delays or inflation in that respect robert bugbee president cameron cameron mackey chief operating officer analyst i can take that if you like robert as you know ben the yards that are in new construction and those that are in repair and retrofitting are fundamentally very different yards and so there s not a lot of overlap in that capacity with the tightness that we ve seen in containers and dry bulk there isn t a raft of inquiry coming from those sectors around retrofitting right now so there is capacity available and then when it comes to supply chain concerns or inflationary pressures they are modest at best there are always risks of course but right now given that the manufacturing of scrubbers is largely located in asia and china specifically the same place where the shipyards reside we don t ourselves see great risks in either the logistics or the inflationary pressure just now benjamin nolan stifel financial corp analyst all right thanks cam operator our next question comes from magnus fyhr with h c wainwright magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst yeah good morning just a question you know on the overall market i agree with your bullish view but is there something we re missing here what besides you know another omicron variant is there anything else that concerns you i mean oil prices have crept up to your as of late at seven year highs i mean could that eventually eat into refinery margins and user demand or is this something else we re missing robert bugbee president it could be there are lots of goods in this one you know even the ukraine russia situation i mean traditionally war has always been good for the tanker market in the short term but if that led to something wider and something extremely disruptive to you know tanker demand then that would be a negative but we don t know magnus the answer to that thing it is it could knock this demand scenario away because what we re basing it on as emanuele and james said is the is what we see all around us which is that when omicron passes people become more mobile and they want to get out there and spend their money and do things and travel to friends and spend time doing things again magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst all right thanks for that color and just on the near term outlook based on the graphs that you showed i mean the iea has demand picking up pretty nicely each quarter going forward is there any seasonal demand or the seasonality playing out different this year than other years robert bugbee president well it could do to the extent that you re going into it would appear at the moment unless something dramatic starts to happen very quickly and i mean very quickly you re going to go into increased jet fuel demand and increased gasoline demand off the side of the low inventory base so you may not have in a weird way that normally some form of weakening period as we go into the spring but that is likely to we would anticipate that likely to be muted in an environment where there s growing entries already into an increasing seasonal demand aspect plus omicron coming out aspect for jet fuel magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst ok and one area we haven t mentioned i mean the iea took their numbers out i mean they just did 15 years of demand numbers they partly said that petrochemical demand especially nafta demand is very strong is there anything in there that you know could surprise on the upside robert bugbee president yeah i mean look it s always good to have that s great that s encouraging that petrochemical demand is strong because on the margin in a weak market you don t want to have those chemical tankers coming into the product trade so it s great that the petrochemical demand is going up and getting stronger magnus fyhr h c wainwright and company analyst thank you robert robert bugbee president thanks operator our next question comes from liam burke with b riley liam burke b riley financial analyst thank you the operating cash flow for the fourth quarter brian was very strong in conjunction with the improvement of sequential step up in rates when you re looking to buy back shares are you anticipating be able to generate internal cash to the course of 22 or do you look to borrow to buy back the shares opportunistically brian lee chief financial officer i think the only statement that we ve made on said is you know that that would be considered strongly considered once we see the visibility of rates at 17 000 or above liam burke b riley financial analyst ok fair enough brian lee chief financial officer and we re not going we would give very little information to the market on buybacks or strategy etc etc in the same sense as we re going to give very little detailed information on navs because you know we ve been here that the management has been in another company another cycle going through that company had a huge buyback and we and it was very successful because the priority was to buy the shares as low as we could it was not to telegraph certain points at which we would buy or place restrictions on that buying or you know expectations on that buying liam burke b riley financial analyst true fair enough and james you were mentioning an aging fleet to your obvious competitive advantage with the with your vessels how does the percent of vessels over 15 years old that are not scrapped benefit you guys as well or is that just a neutral james doyle head of corporate development investor relations well you know certain customers of ours will have rules around 15 years right they won t take a ship older than that and it s not everybody and structurally the ships are fine i think they the older ships find themselves in tertiary markets it could be cabotage trade and you know other places or they one of the easiest things they can do is carry fuel oil and crude oil because there s no risk of contamination i think obviously the distribution of the fleet is massive right because nothing was really scrapped you know in what was delivered and so i think with a super low order book here as we kind of go forward this increase in scrapping will happen right these vessels moving over to dirty will increase and with the yards being backed up it s hard to materially change the supply at least through 2025 liam burke b riley financial analyst great thanks james operator that concludes today s question and answer session i d like to turn the call back to robert bugbee for closing remarks robert bugbee president thank you very much i think we ve covered everything that we ve covered that we need to cover and as emanuele says we appreciate everybody s support and patience as well and you know just trust that management looks forward as much as all of our shareholders out there to you know as earlier recovery in these rates as possible because that s really all that is required to set this company and the valuation on the stock and the ability for us to really create some value here in a much significantly stronger share price by the end of the year away it s just simply that opening up the mobility and the opening up of demand and thereby rates so thank you very much again operator duration 53 minutes call participants james doyle head of corporate development investor

or any additional potential acquisitions record quarterly revenue of 1 69 million a 65 increase compared to q1 fy 22 excluding the s5d acquisition and a 34 increase compared to q2 fy 21 which significantly benefitted from a delay in recognized revenue from q1 fy 21 to q2 fy 21 due to covid limitations during the quarter we completed a 15 million private placement comprised of common stock at approximately 43 premium to our ipo price and warrants priced at approximately 110 premium to our ipo price post the s5d acquisition between our combined revenues and with over 120 vr and ar software developers engineers and 3d artists and 5 issued patents we believe that we are one of the largest independent vr ar software and services companies post the recent s5d acquisition we currently have over 21 million of cash including 2mm in escrow for potential future s5d performance payments and a clean balance sheet with no material liabilities no converts or preferreds and a controlled and low cash burn relative to our current cash position glimpse s stated goal is to become a premier software and services company in the emerging vr ar industry with a global footprint we intend to accomplish this with continued strong organic growth across our diverse base of wholly owned subsidiary companies and with further accretive and well structed acquisitions organic growth we continued to gain traction with customers for our ar vr enterprise focused software and services a few recent examples in q2 fy 22 signed the largest contract in the company s history a 1 0 million master services agreement and statement of work with a leading global social media and metaverse company for ar software and services which are in the process of being delivered our subsidiary company immersive health group ihg entered into a 5 year vr software and services contract with boston medical center a large health system in new england to develop and implement vr experiences for practitioners to learn and practice decision making and problem solving skills for maternal health emergencies our subsidiary company s qreal s collaboration with bollè and m7 innovations on ar campaigns showcasing bollè s sunglasses goggles and helmets in try on and try out experiences was awarded the best use of technology by the modern retail awards 2021 in competition with tech leaders like google and snap the campaign saw commercial results that led to significant interactions with the 3d products as well as a strong increase in sales growth 18 million interactions with the 3d products on tilly s com during the first 30 days and a 313 6 increase in year over year sales this helps validate our belief that ar technologies will fundamentally change the retail environment and the way customers evaluate and ultimately purchase products acquisitions acquisitions in parallel to organic growth have been core to glimpse s strategy since our inception as we look to deepen and expand our subsidiary company base market access and technologies as previously reported in 1h fy 22 we acquired three companies auggd in the architecture engineering and construction aec space xr terra in the immersive technologies talent development segment and most recently sector 5 digital s5d a leading and award winning immersive technologies company with a first tier customer base including the likes of american airlines bae systems ecolab halliburton and textron systems among others all three acquisitions were well structured with relatively small upfront payments and with most of the purchase price consideration dependent on the achievement of significant revenue growth milestones over the next three years and primarily common stock payments based on glimpse s stock price at those times the s5d acquisition in particular significantly and immediately improves our business operating and financial scale while generating compelling go to market synergies across our diverse ecosystem it also approximately doubles glimpse s pre acquisition annual revenue metaverse the evolution of the metaverse continues to be a topic of wide discussion with many leading companies announcing metaverse initiatives glimpse s subsidiary companies provide the vr and ar software and service solutions that are enabling companies and organizations to make initial forays into the immersive world as the metaverse develops we believe that glimpse s subsidiary companies will be supplying the underlying immersive technologies and solutions picks and shovels that will facilitate an enterprise s ability to build their presence and commerce footprint in the metaverse non fungible tokens nfts will be an important part of transacting and value creation in the metaverse to that end we created a limited edition 3d collectible glimpse medal non fungible token which speaks to our advanced capabilities in our view the glimpse medal is one of the first fully metaverse ready nfts meaning that it can seamlessly and easily be used across all ar and vr platforms from ar on a mobile phone to a 2d website on a computer to a vr headset and brought into all existing and future nft based virtual worlds we plan to continue expanding our nft capabilities and offerings by integrating it with our wide array of vr and ar technologies across our diverse base of subsidiary companies into the emerging web3 ecosystem and related business applications executive and board expansion in q2 fy 22 we strengthened our executive team and board of directors as part of the s5d acquisition jeff meisner who in addition to continuing as s5d s general manager became glimpse s chief revenue officer and joined our board of directors jeff has extensive business development and sales experience in the immersive technology industry and he fills an important gap in our executive team we also added a new independent director ian charles who became the chair of our audit committee ian charles is a technology cfo with nearly 25 years of executive leadership experience in technology public markets mergers and acquisitions and multinational operations we expect to leverage ian s knowledge and experiences to solidify and expand glimpse s financial and operational infrastructure as we continue to scale our software and services businesses summary our expectation is for a strong 2h fy 22 january june 22 we believe that immersive technology vr and ar in conjunction with ai and blockchain technologies represent the next technology growth cycle one that will evolve and grow over many years to come while the immersive industry is nascent our revenue growth and first tier customer base demonstrate clear industry development and adoption with our unique diversified platform model growing industry position and well capitalized and clean balance sheet we believe that glimpse is well positioned to successfully scale while playing an enabling role in the development of the enterprise focused vr ar industries in general and the metaverse in particular q2 fy 22 and 1h fy 22 financial summary total revenue for the three months ended december 31 2021 was approximately 1 69

revenue costs of goods sold and utilization of lower cost glimpse turkey staff on a going forwarded basis we expect overall gross profit to decrease from this level as s5d s gross profit has

for the prior 2020 period a loss increase of 1 22 million or 60 this reflects a period over period increase in revenue and related gross profit offset by an increase in operating expenses and the

united states moved to close its embassy in ukraine amid heightened tensions over the thousands of russian troops that have been amassing on the border the s p 500 fell 0 4 after having been down as much as 1 2 shortly after the u s said it is closing its embassy in ukraine and moving all remaining staffers there to a city near the polish border the move comes as diplomatic efforts continued monday in a bid to head off what u s officials have warned could be an imminent russian attack on ukraine bond yields rose broadly as did energy futures and the price of gold the dow jones industrial average fell 0 5 and the nasdaq composite ended essentially flat after having been up 1 in the early going the three major stock indexes were coming off a weekly loss the market slide adds to losses from a late afternoon sell off on friday after the white house told americans to leave ukraine within 48 hours over concerns that russia could invade that country soon other governments including russia pulled diplomats and their citizens out of the country wall street is also trying to gauge how stocks and the broader economy will be affected from another source of uncertainty how far and how quickly the federal reserve will move to raise interest rates to quash surging inflation the market is really paying attention to geopolitical stuff right now whether it s stuff out of ukraine or in d c with respect to what the fed is going to do said willie delwiche investment strategist at all star charts the bigger story is inflation and rates the fed is catching up to inflation the bond market

rising inflation and looming interest rate hikes will impact investments and the economy inflation stands at a four decade high and the federal reserve is planning to raise interest rates to help cool inflation the central bank is expected to start raising its benchmark interest rate in march and wall street expects as many as seven rate hikes this year while fed policymakers agree the central bank should begin raising interest rates next month they differ on how quickly to do so on monday james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of st louis repeated his call for the fed to take the aggressive step of raising its benchmark short term rate by a full percentage point by july 1 esther george president of the kansas city fed expressed support for a more gradual approach and mary daly of the san francisco fed declined to commit herself to more than a modest rate hike next month their comments follow last week s report that inflation jumped 7 5 in january from a year ago the fastest increase in four decades prices also rose 0 6 from december to january the same as the previous month suggesting that price gains still aren t slowing as many economists and fed officials have hoped the fed typically responds to high inflation by making borrowing more expensive which slows spending and the pace of price increases last week s inflation report kind of woke fed officials up a little and really brought to mind that they re behind the curve here and by acting aggressively earlier they can maybe do less overall in terms tightening delwiche said investors also have their eye on the latest round of corporate earnings in part to get a better understanding of how companies are dealing with high inflation some of the more notable companies reporting earnings this week include airbnb

record 24 1 up from 22 7 for the comparable prior year period these results reflect the benefit of our scalable non asset based business model diversity of our service offerings and our ability to quickly respond to changing market dynamics and support our customers in this capacity constrained market in addition we delivered these record results while working through the challenges presented by our previous disclosed ransomware event that occurred on december 8th also note that these record results reflect only a one month contribution from navegate given the fact that we did not complete that transaction until november 30 with offices in mendota heights minnesota twin cities addison illinois chicago and shanghai china the navegate platform itself represents an exciting new opportunity for the radiant network and the end customers that we serve in addition to solidifying our presence in shanghai navegate also strengthens our international services offering particularly in the areas of customs brokerage ocean forwarding and drayage services and brings with it a proprietary technology platform to facilitate global trade management these new global trade management capabilities will be made available to the entire radiant network to provide our customers with purchase order and vendor management tools that unlock sku level visibility from the manufacturing floor in asia through final delivery here in the u s with both the enhanced service offerings and propriety global trade management technology we believe we will further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and be even better positioned to provide additional support for both current and prospective customers mr crain continued in addition to progress on the acquisition front we also continued to put capital to work in our stock buy back program and have now purchased 6 3 million in stock through the six months ended december 31 2021 as we have previously discussed we believe that our current share price does not accurately reflect radiant s intrinsic value or long term growth prospects and we expect to continue to deploy our capital through a combination of strategic acquisitions and our stock buy back it is worth pointing out that the record results we have delivered over each of these last several quarters have been fueled almost exclusively by organic growth looking forward we remain optimistic about our prospects and opportunities to continue to leverage our best in class technology robust north american footprint and extensive global network of service partners to continue to build on the great platform we have built here at radiant at the same time we have begun to thoughtfully re lever our balance sheet and through a combination of strategic acquisition and

ebitda margin unaudited as used in this report net revenues adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap net revenues adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are presented herein because they are important metrics used by management to evaluate and understand the performance of the ongoing operations of radiant s business for adjusted net income management uses a 24 5 tax rate to calculate the provision for income taxes to normalize radiant s tax rate to that of its competitors and to compare radiant s reporting periods with different effective tax rates in addition in arriving at adjusted net income the company adjusts for certain non cash charges and significant items that are not part of regular operating activities these adjustments include income taxes depreciation and amortization change in fair value of contingent consideration transition costs lease termination costs acquisition related costs litigation costs amortization of debt issuance costs change in fair value of interest rate swap contracts and gain on forgiveness of debt we commonly refer to the term net revenues when commenting about our company and the results of operations net revenues are a non gaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations and expenses attributed to the company s services we believe net revenues are a better measurement than are total revenues when analyzing and discussing the effectiveness of our business and is used as a portion of a key metric the company uses to discuss its progress ebitda is a non gaap measure of income and does not include the effects of interest taxes and the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization on long term assets companies have some discretion as to which elements of depreciation and amortization are excluded in the ebitda calculation we exclude all depreciation charges related to property technology and equipment and all amortization charges including amortization of leasehold improvements we then further adjust ebitda to exclude changes in fair value of contingent consideration expenses specifically attributable to acquisitions transition and lease termination costs foreign currency transaction gains and losses extraordinary items share based compensation expense litigation expenses unrelated to our core operations gain on forgiveness of debt and other non cash charges while management considers ebitda and adjusted ebitda useful in analyzing our results it is not intended to replace any presentation included in our consolidated financial statements we believe that these non gaap financial measures as presented represent a useful method of assessing the performance of our operating activities as they reflect our earnings trends without the impact of certain non cash charges and other non recurring charges these non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement the gaap financial information by providing additional insight regarding results of operations to allow a comparison to other companies many of whom use similar non gaap financial measures to supplement their gaap results however these non gaap financial measures will not be defined in the same manner by all companies and

guernsey uk accesswire february 14 2022 burford capital limited the leading global finance and asset management firm focused on law today releases an update on its 2021 business activity all figures in this disclosure are preliminary and unaudited definitions reconciliations and further related information are available in burford s 2021 interim report which is available on burford s website at www burfordcapital com shareholders 2021 business update new business group wide new commitments of 1 1 billion 2020 758 million o burford only new commitments of 607 million 2020 361 million group wide new deployments of 841 million 2020 595 million o burford only new deployments of 448 million 2020 252 million burford had a strong year for new business on a group wide basis burford made 1 1 billion in total new commitments and deployed a total 841 million in cash in 2021 those levels represent significant increases over the prior year 48 and 41 respectively and demonstrate that the strong recovery in new business activity in the first half of 2021 continued through the second half the strong growth in new commitments and deployments was driven by growth in our core capital provision direct business capital provision direct new commitments on a burford only basis amounted to 602 million 2020 335 million and exceeded the 2019 level of 530 million while burford only capital provision direct deployments essentially doubled to 447 million 2020 225 million also well ahead of the 269 million achieved in 2019 this record level of capital provision direct deployments from our balance sheet is particularly notable and represents assets capable of generating our highest potential returns and profits portfolio activity and returns group wide capital provision direct realizations of 336 million 2020 608 million o burford only capital provision direct realizations of 264 million 2020 337 million group wide capital provision direct realized gains of 152 million 2020 361 million o burford only capital provision direct realized gains of 128 million 2020 180 million case realizations in our capital provision direct business remained modest in the second half of 2021 due in part to continuing court delays caused by the pandemic impacting the pace and progression of matters in our portfolio capital provision direct realizations in our burford only portfolio were 264 million 2020 337 million 2019 228 million while the realized gains from those concluded assets amounted to 128 million 2020 180 million 2019 120 million given the unpredictability of the timing of case resolutions period to period volatility is a characteristic of our business it is important to note that we had very low losses in the year only 9 million in realized losses in 2021 representing less than 1 of average capital provision direct assets at cost 2020 20 million 2 our portfolio remains robust and resolutions are simply a matter of timing subject to the idiosyncrasies of our specific cases and the vagaries of the litigation process as a result our concluded case roic since inception remained largely steady at 93 at december 31 2021 june 30 2021 95 december 31 2020 92 on 1 9 billion of cumulative realizations while our concluded portfolio s irr was unchanged at 30 liquidity burford s liquidity position remained strong with over 300 million of burford only cash and marketable securities on hand at december 31 2021 june 30 2021 430 million december 31 2020 336 million financial results burford is in the process of preparing its 2021 financial statements including the fair value of the portfolio burford s 2021 financial statements are subject to audit and as a result any figures are preliminary and subject to adjustment we do not anticipate significant fair value adjustments in the second half of 2021 as slow case progress limited the incidence of the kind of case milestones that would cause a change in the fair value of the related legal finance assets given slow case progress in 2021 and the net loss reported for the first half of 2021 we expect to recognize a net loss of between 70 million and 80 million for 2021 christopher bogart burford capital s chief executive officer commented we are delighted with the strong performance of new business in 2021 to write more than 1 1 billion of new commitments during an ongoing pandemic is a significant achievement and positions the business well for future potential income we would have preferred cases to move through the judicial system faster than they have since the pandemic began but the slow pace we are experiencing is a timing issue not one affecting our view of the ultimate realizable value of the portfolio no client has discontinued a single matter due to these delays us gaap conversion and prior financial presentation as previously announced commencing with its annual report for the 2021 fiscal year burford will be preparing its financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year and comparative periods in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap as we noted in our interim reporting us gaap will result in a change to our historical approach to the consolidation of certain subsidiaries we previously disclosed that this change would result in an increase in both assets and liabilities the most notable change is expected to be with respect to the subsidiary colorado investments limited colorado that was created for the secondary sale of some of our entitlement in the petersen matter we have not historically consolidated that subsidiary in our ifrs reporting and thus we have historically shown on our balance sheet only the 61 25 of the petersen asset i e burford s entitlement pursuant to its funding agreement that we continue to own colorado will however be consolidated under us gaap once colorado is consolidated under us gaap we will report 100 of the value of the petersen asset as an asset on our balance sheet and the 38 75 sold to third parties will be reported as an offsetting liability this change in presentation will have no effect on our net assets similarly to the extent income from the petersen investment flows through our p l we will record 100 of the income on a consolidated basis and then record a 38 75 reduction to income as a third party interest again there is no effect on net income from these changes on our balance sheet this will result in an increase in our capital provision assets of 383 million and a corresponding addition of 383 million in third party interests in consolidated entities at both june 30 2021 and december 31 2021 resulting in no change in net assets as to prior periods the corresponding amounts would be 387 million at each of december 31 2019 and june 30 2020 386 million at december 31 2020 and 230 million at december 31 2018 on our income statement this will result in immaterial changes in 2020 and 2021 relating solely to case expenses incurred and no change in net income in 2019 capital provision income will increase by 58 million and we will show a corresponding reduction to income of 58 million for third party interests in consolidated entities with no change in net income and in 2018 capital provision income will increase by 98 million and we will show a corresponding reduction to income of 98 million for third party interests in consolidated entities with no change in net income at the time of the formation of colorado in 2017 we engaged an outside accounting advisor with respect to the accounting treatment of colorado under ifrs and concluded that colorado should not be consolidated but rather reported as an equity investment which is how it was reported on our financial statements for the ensuing years that were accompanied by unqualified opinions of our outside auditors however during the course of our work to convert our financial statements to us gaap the question of whether colorado should also have been consolidated under ifrs has been revisited this is an area of considerable accounting complexity and nuance following the issuance of ifrs 10 the consolidation standard in 2011 and situations like colorado often are not susceptible to bright line determinations especially since there is little accounting precedent for the treatment of litigation finance assets nevertheless and perhaps with the benefit of hindsight the conclusion has been reached that colorado should also have been consolidated under ifrs and that failure to do so was an accounting error in the application of ifrs 10 despite the extensive consideration of the issue at the time the impact on our ifrs financial statements will be the same as set out above for us gaap we will provide restated financial statements for this correction as well as the corrections related to the legal finance non cash accrual disclosed in our december 22 2021 press release and form 6 k report around the time of the release of our financial results for the 2021 fiscal year and in the interim our historical financial statements should not be relied upon to the extent inconsistent with this revised treatment despite it having no impact on net income or net assets and to the extent set forth in the december 22 2021 press release the audit committee of the company s board of directors has taken this action which has been discussed with the company s independent registered public accounting firm ernst young llp definitions and use of alternative performance measures as previously announced commencing with our annual report for the 2021 fiscal year we will report our financial results under us gaap us gaap requires us to present financial statements that consolidate some of the limited partner interests in funds we manage as well as assets held on our balance sheet where we have a partner or minority investor we therefore refer to various presentations of our financial results and funding configuration as consolidated refers to assets liabilities and activities that include those third party interests partially owned subsidiaries and special purpose vehicles that we are required to consolidate under us gaap accounting this presentation conforms to the presentation of burford on a consolidated basis in our financial statements the major entities where there is also a third party partner in or owner of those entities include the burford strategic value fund bof c colorado and several entities in which burford holds investments where there is also a third party partner in or owner of those entities burford only or similar terms including balance sheet refers to assets liabilities and activities that pertain only to burford on a proprietary basis excluding any third party interests and the portions of jointly owned entities owned by others group wide refers to burford and its managed funds taken together including those portions of the funds owned by third parties and including funds that are not consolidated into burford s consolidated financial statements in addition to the consolidated funds group wide includes the partners funds burford opportunity fund and burford alternative income fund and its predecessor we refer to our capital provision assets in two categories direct which includes all our legal finance assets including those generated by asset recovery and legal risk management activities that we have made directly i e not through participation in a fund from our balance sheet we also include direct not through a fund complex strategies assets in this category indirect which includes our balance sheet s participations in one of our funds we also use certain alternative performance measures apms which are not presented in accordance with us gaap to measure the performance of certain of our assets including return on invested capital roic means the absolute amount of realizations from a concluded asset divided by the amount of expenditure incurred in funding that asset expressed as a percentage figure roic is a measure of our ability to generate absolute returns on our assets in this release when we refer to our concluded case roic we are referring to the roic on concluded and partially concluded capital provision direct assets on burford s balance sheet since the inception of the company until the current date internal rate of return irr is a discount rate that makes the net present value of a series of cash flows equal to zero and is expressed as a percentage figure we compute irr on concluded including partially concluded legal finance assets by treating that entire portfolio or when noted a subset thereof as one undifferentiated pool of capital and measuring actual and if necessary estimated inflows and outflows from that pool allocating investment cost appropriately irrs do not include unrealized gains our business activities include legal finance which includes our traditional core litigation finance activities in which we provide capital against the future value of legal claims it also encompasses our asset recovery and legal risk management activities complex strategies encompasses our activities providing capital as a principal in legal related assets often securities debt and other financial assets where a significant portion of the expected return arises from the

the standard poor s 500 index fell 0 4 as investors weighed concern over russian forces massing on the border of ukraine stocks on wall street shed early gains and closed broadly lower monday as the u s moved to close its embassy in ukraine amid heightened tensions over the thousands of russian troops that have been massing on the border the standard poor s 500 index fell 0 4 after having been down as much as 1 2 shortly after the u s said it is closing its embassy in ukraine and moving all remaining staffers there to a city near the polish border the move comes as diplomatic efforts continued monday in a bid to head off what u s officials have warned could be an imminent russian attack on ukraine bond yields rose broadly as did energy futures and the price of gold the dow jones industrial average fell 0 5 and the nasdaq composite ended essentially flat after having been up 1 in the early going the three major stock indexes were coming off a weekly loss advertisement the market slide adds to losses from a late afternoon sell off on friday after the white house told americans to leave ukraine within 48 hours over concerns that russia could invade that country soon other governments including russia pulled diplomats and their citizens out of the country wall street is also trying to gauge how stocks and the broader economy will be affected by another source of uncertainty how far and how quickly the federal reserve will move to raise interest rates to quash surging inflation the market is really paying attention to geopolitical stuff right now whether it s stuff out of ukraine or in d c with respect to what the fed is going to do said willie delwiche an investment strategist at all star charts the bigger story is inflation and rates the fed is catching up to inflation the bond market is now taking the fed seriously and the question is what do u s stocks do in that environment the s p 500 fell 16 97 points to 4 401 67 nearly 80 of the stocks in the benchmark index fell financial healthcare and energy companies were among the biggest weights on the market citigroup fell 1 moderna slid 11 7 and exxon mobil dropped 1 5 the dow fell 171 89 points to 34 566 17 the blue chip index had been down 433 points by midafternoon the nasdaq slipped 0 24 point to 13 790 92 smaller company stocks which had been on pace for gains also fell the russell 2000 slid 9 36 points or 0 5 to 2 020 79 advertisement a potential escalation of the conflict between russia and ukraine also weighed heavily on european markets which fell sharply nations are still searching for a diplomatic solution to the situation and russia s top diplomat advised russian president vladimir putin to continue a dialogue with the u s and its allies the price of u s crude oil climbed 2 5 while natural gas prices jumped 6 4 russia is a major energy producer any military action that disrupts supplies could send shock waves through energy markets and global industry the price of gold traditionally a haven during geopolitical uncertainty rose 1 5 bond yields also rose the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 1 99 from 1 94 late friday the crisis in ukraine is yet another concern for investors as they try to figure out how rising inflation and looming interest rate hikes will affect investments and the economy inflation stands at a four decade high and the federal reserve is planning to raise interest rates to help cool it the central bank is expected to start raising its benchmark interest rate in march and wall street expects as many as seven rate hikes this year advertisement while fed policymakers agree the central bank should begin raising interest rates next month they differ on how quickly to do so on monday james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of st louis repeated his call for the fed to take the aggressive step of raising its benchmark short term rate by a full percentage point by july 1 esther george president of the kansas city fed expressed support for a more gradual approach and mary daly of the san francisco fed declined to commit to more than a modest rate hike next month their comments follow last week s report that inflation jumped 7 5 in january from a year earlier the fastest increase in four decades prices also rose 0 6 from december to january the same as in the previous month suggesting that price gains still aren t slowing as many economists and fed officials have hoped the fed typically responds to high inflation by making borrowing more expensive which slows spending and the pace of price increases last week s inflation report kind of woke fed officials up a little and really brought to mind that they re behind the curve here and by acting aggressively earlier they can maybe do less overall in terms tightening delwiche said investors also have their eyes on the latest round of corporate earnings reports in part to get a better understanding of how companies are dealing with high inflation some of the more notable companies reporting earnings this week include airbnb on tuesday doordash on wednesday and walmart on thursday investors will also get more updates on inflation and how that might be affecting spending the labor department will release its january report for prices at the wholesale level tuesday and the commerce department will release its january retail sales report wednesday

s candidate in the june 7 2018 by election for warwick north east mr dickinson won the seat against one bermuda alliance candidate justin mathias with 375 votes to 300 speaking on the night of the victory mr dickinson did not rule out a cabinet position but said i am here to serve and serve as best as i possibly can i will leave to the premier to decide what form that service takes sworn in as finance minister on november 1 2018 mr dickinson highlighted his top jobs the budget is next on the agenda he told the royal gazette i am looking at the economic substance issues around the european union which is topical and i m looking at the debt situation those are the three biggest priorities mr dickinson was also handed responsibility for the casino gambling industry later that month david burt the premier took over handling the bermuda casino gaming commission in june 2020 mr dickinson s public service before political life included a stint as chairman of the bermuda hospitals board

government with help from the private sector to provide millions in emergency cash to those put out of work by the pandemic mr dickinson s contacts and experience overseas came into play from early in his ministerial career as he led the refinancing of bermuda s debt in june 2020 mr dickinson returned to the capital markets to refinance more loans with longer term debt the restructure entailed buying back hundreds of millions worth of the government s bonds from investors and selling new debt dealing with the closure of the fairmont southampton hotel and negotiations with its owners gencom featured prominently in mr dickinson s work after the resort closed in october 2020 the resort owners were left with 11 million in redundancy payments to hundreds of laid off workers which mr dickinson had to authorise in november 2020 using the government s funds the move took flak from the opposition but mr dickinson framed it as a moral obligation on the government s part he said in the aftermath action was required and the government of bermuda decided that it was unacceptable to allow this situation to continue unaddressed he confirmed in february 2021 that gencom had repaid the public purse mr dickinson switched constituencies for the 2020 general election running in the seat formerly held by plp mp rolfe commissiong pembroke south east on october 1 he took 432 votes against 125 for gavin smith the free democratic movement contender a plp insider said at the time the party was determined for mr dickinson to keep his seat mr dickinson s resignation comes just ahead of the delivery on february 25 of the 2022 23 budget last december he warned of serious choices ahead for the country with more debt refinancing to come mr dickinson has also emphasised he would stick to a budget deficit target of 124 7 million with government reforms and a tight rein on capital spending

bloomberg meme stock mania might have been a case of traders banding together to take down hedge funds after all that s the contention of new research that challenges the securities and exchange commission s view that a so called short squeeze played little part in pushing gamestop corp into the stratosphere in january 2021 the regulator failed to examine relevant securities lending data and didn t study a long enough stretch of transactions a half a dozen academics from columbia university the university of notre dame and elsewhere asserted in a paper sent in recent weeks to sec chair gary gensler the claim puts a new twist on one of the most closely watched and debated periods in recent memory for the u s stock market when gamestop spiked more than 1 000 in less than a week and triggered giant losses at some hedge funds the reason was screamingly obvious to investors chronicling the hysteria on social media bulls attacked short sellers by snapping up shares and that fueled even crazier price gains because it forced the bears to join the buying frenzy to exit their short positions but an sec report released in october questioned that stance arguing shorts who closed out their bets only played a minor role in driving the rally although regulators said they couldn t determine exactly why gamestop jumped they speculated it was because traders were optimistic about the videogame retailer s prospects or thought they were triggering a short squeeze read more sec gamestop report debunks conspiracies backs gensler plan now the academics say conventional wisdom could have been right all along the sec s october analysis used incomplete data and flawed methods to reach erroneous conclusions regarding the events of january 2021 said joshua mitts lead author of the study and a columbia university law professor our findings suggest that the sec s response to gamestop and other meme stocks may be deeply misguided the sec also fell short according to the paper in examining the effects of a so called gamma squeeze which occurs when options dealers buy a rising stock to balance their exposure to contracts they have sold pushing shares even higher the sec focused on call contracts in its analysis while overlooking the effect of put contracts which can contribute to gamma squeezes the academics said what happened last year has been embraced by retail traders as a rare case of davids joining together en masse to stick it to wall street goliaths even some u s lawmakers welcomed the populist narrative arguing that the market has been tilted against the little guy for far too long yet mitts said the episode actually exposed the market s fragility to schemes that can cause share prices to trade at levels that have little connection to a company s earnings should prices normalize it can hurt the same types of investors who cheered gamestop s rocketship rise he said anti fraud and anti manipulation rules need to be overhauled for the social media era said mitts who has long petitioned the sec to toughen rules around short selling the sec should focus on the distortive effects of short squeezes and gamma squeezes on the market and the harms they cause ordinary investors an sec spokesman declined to comment on the academic study mitts said it wasn t funded by hedge funds or any other third party small fraction in its study the sec said shorts purchasing gamestop to close positions made up a small fraction of overall buy volume during the company s surge and the stock price remained elevated after the direct effects of covering short positions would have waned mitts and his coauthors described what they viewed as multiple flaws in the sec s analysis the regulator according to the paper didn t examine individual customer accounts or include data on all short sellers the academics argued the agency also didn t review short selling data before dec 24 2020 and thus didn t see that shorts had already mostly bailed on gamestop before the stock went especially haywire in january 2021 mitts paper highlights posters on reddit calling for a short squeeze in gamestop months in advance of the massive jump in price in october 2020 a reddit user named u stonksflyingup posted a short video on the wallstreetbets subreddit titled gme squeeze and the demise of melvin capital a hedge funds that garnered widespread attention for betting against gamestop reddit posts about melvin became more frequent with users promising to drive the price of gamestop to the moon melvin run by money manager gabe plotkin did suffer a massive blow months later losing about 53 in january 2021 that required it to take a cash infusion new rules the sec didn t offer specific policy recommendations tied to short squeezes in the agency s october report but the regulator did say it would examine what prompts brokers to restrict customer trading last week the agency said it will begin considering rules about how long it takes to settle stock trades the sec has said previously said it wants to reduce the time for transactions which now take two days to finalize mitts coauthors include robert battalio a finance professor at the university

although blackberry had periods of rapid share price growth last year if you re investing for retirement these two stocks offer much more potential one of the hottest canadian stocks over the last year has been blackberry tsx bb nyse bb especially after the significant rallies it has seen over the last 12 months however despite blackberry being a highly popular stock there are several companies that are much better to own and which you can plan to hold for years until retirement the key to finding businesses you can have confidence owning is to identify ones that have strong competitive advantages and can continue to grow and earn attractive cash flows for decades and although blackberry could eventually become that type of stock at the moment it faces many challenges in addition to significant competition so if you re looking to find high quality canadian growth stocks that you can own until retirement here are two of the best to consider over blackberry today a top canadian infrastructure company one of the best growth stocks in canada for long term investors has to be brookfield infrastructure partners tsx bip un nyse bip brookfield owns a massive portfolio of utility transportation midstream and data infrastructure assets in countries worldwide this portfolio of assets is not just unique it s also managed by a high quality team of professionals so there are several reasons to buy brookfield over blackberry stock today first off because it has many fixed costs but much of its revenue is tied to inflation brookfield can actually benefit from the current economic environment in addition while tech stocks like blackberry are falling out of favour brookfield is an excellent investment for this environment it s a top defensive stock due to all the essential services its assets provide but the way the fund is managed also makes it a top growth stock management is consistently recycling cash and finding new investments brookfield ideally looks for assets that are undervalued or underperforming but have potential it can then come in improve the operations which help to grow the valuation meaningfully these improved assets can then generate more income for the fund or if the price is right brookfield can decide to sell the assets and use the cash to invest in new opportunities this is why its stated investment objective is to grow investors capital by 15 over the long run it s an excellent stock for long term investors there may be a year or two of lower growth but in the long run it will grow your capital exceptionally well all while being highly reliable and defensive it has massively outperformed blackberry stock over the last year the last three years the last five years and the last 10 years and i d expect that to continue going forward so rather than speculate on blackberry stock today brookfield infrastructure partners seems like a no brainer investment a top canadian retail stock to buy instead of blackberry in addition to brookfield dollarama tsx dol is another excellent growth stock that also has several reasons why it s worth a buy today first off like brookfield it can also perform well in this economic environment while dollarama may see costs rise with inflation it will likely see sales volumes rise as more consumers look to offset inflation by shopping at dollar stores rather than more expensive big box competitors this is one of the reasons dollarama has grown so rapidly over the last decade in addition to excellent execution and merchandising internally consumer trends and habits have encouraged shoppers to shop around and save money on essential goods therefore having more cash to either save or spend on discretionary items this trend should only continue which is why there is such a bright future for dollarama after such a strong expansion across canada over the last 15 years though you could argue that the growth will eventually slow down however dollarama already looks to be addressing this by investing in dollar store chains outside of canada such as dollar city a latin american dollar store chain due to this strong execution by dollarama just like brookfield it has massively outperformed blackberry stock in all the same periods and as you can see by the 10 year chart above even with the massive spike blackberry s stock saw last year these two continue to outperform so if you re looking to buy a high quality growth stock you can own until retirement brookfield infrastructure and dollarama are two of the best

bitcoin prices may have been bearish recently but goldman sachs continues to see strong and record gains in the near future the world s most valuable cryptocurrency recently recorded almost 40 000 after touching a record high of almost 69 000 in november last year it has been one of its longest losing streaks still goldman sachs one of the world s biggest investment banks and financial services is optimistic that bitcoin could rise well over 100 000 in the next 5 years in another development swiss based seba bank s ceo predicted that bitcoin btc could rise to 75 000 in 2022 guido buehler predicts that institutional adoption can be the major driving factor behind this price rise goldman sachs predictions according to goldman sachs bitcoin is likely to gain market share due to the wider adoption of digital assets the prediction claims that it will be gold that will lose market share to this cryptocurrency gold has more or less shown a price stagnation of around 1800 per ounce the store of value market includes assets like bitcoin and gold currently the original cryptocurrency has a 20 share in this market the other assets include commodities and currencies whose prices are meant to hold up over the long term according to goldman sachs analyst zach pandl bitcoin could grab up to 50 of this market this is expected to push the digital coin s value by 17 18 per year for the next 5 years taking it to 100 000 and beyond an important reason bitcoin is expected to push gold out in terms of market share is that it has applications that extend beyond the scope of store of value the digital asset markets are much larger than bitcoin and there is a lot of room for it to grow into addressing the question of price volatility bitcoin and other major cryptos such as ethereum soalan binance dogecoin and shiba inu have been highly volatile in 2021 this makes cryptocurrencies more similar to stocks in their price movements than currencies despite this high level of volatility many fund managers have included bitcoin in their investment portfolios this includes names such as george soros paul tudor jones and stanley druckenmiller store of value market size the store of value market is currently valued at around 2 6 trillion the original cryptocurrency s float adjusted market cap is 700 billion this gives it a market share of 20 for goldman sachs it is important to place bitcoin s market cap in comparison with gold to put parameters on potential returns for returns even when the bitcoin blockchain is highly resource intensive its demand as an asset is not expected to fall goldman sachs relaunched its crypto and bitcoin trading platform crypto engine last year the firm had expanded its offerings in june 2021 to include futures and options for ether seba s predictions about bitcoin according to seba bank s ceo bitcoin is expected to touch 75 000 in 2022 institutional adoption is the biggest factor according to the bank that will drive the coin s price the bank has asset pools waiting for the right time to make their investment moves lack of essential regulation is a major factor keeping many investors from putting their capital in bitcoin and other cryptos with the btc value having recorded one of its biggest falls this is seen as a key moment for investors seeking a directional play retail vs institutional investors during the early part of 2021 retailer traders dominated the investment breakup for bitcoin many industry experts currently believe that the future growth of btc will also be led by the retail segment however if a bloomberg report is to be believed big investors have lined up almost 100 trillion in potential investment in crypto the big investors are essentially held back by the structural impediments once those obstructions are paved at different levels the market can be expected to receive a massive infusion of funds at the same time the retail market is still in its nascent development phase it has a long way to go leaving massive growth opportunities in crypto asset allocation as regulations become clearer in north america asia and europe in the near future bitcoin and other cryptos are expected to benefit from both institutional and retail investments interesting related article is cryptocurrency the future

c ities have often bounced back from crises from pandemics and earthquakes to floods and fires the world s urban powerhouses have emerged stronger when faced with adversity after the great fire of london destroyed most of the city in 1666 a raft of fire safety regulations were ushered in builders swapped timber for brick or stone walls were made thicker streets became wider when cholera tore through america in the 1850s new york and other cities introduced sewage systems and public parks as the disease spread to paris authorities there too introduced radical public health measures tree lined boulevards were built fountains were erected and slums were cleared listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element today s urban areas face a challenge of a different sort with the mass return to office work still uncertain the pandemic has sharpened debate about what the future holds for their commercial hubs key business districts such as manhattan the city of london tokyo s marunouchi and la défense in paris have borne the brunt of the office exodus before lockdowns the 21 largest business districts in the world housed 4 5m workers and around a fifth of the headquarters of fortune global 500 companies according to ey and the urban land institute when covid 19 emptied offices around the world most professional work shifted to home offices or kitchen tables as the pandemic stretches into a third year the fate of urban business districts remains unclear can they continue to attract investment and talent or will new work patterns jeopardise their commercial dominance on the face of it things could have been worse for the owners of gleaming city office towers unlike the retail and hospitality sectors office tenants have mostly continued to pay rent and analysts have retracted many of their worst projections leasing activity even picked up in cities like london towards the end of 2021 the reality however is far from rosy home working has hit demand for office space with vacancy rates rising faster in business districts than anywhere else globally unoccupied offices make up 12 of the total up from 8 before covid across london 18 of offices are vacant in new york the share is nearly 16 more than one in five offices in san francisco are empty in hong kong where downsizing has become common net effective rent which is adjusted for abatements or incentives dropped by more than 7 in 2021 after falling by more than 17 in 2020 rather than lowering rents landlords are offering more freebies than ever to retain tenants or attract new ones in manhattan cash gifts for tenants typically used for kitting out new office space have more than doubled since 2016 across america the average number of rent free months has risen to its highest since 2013 some property developers remain optimistic betting that demand for office space will eventually bounce back but with each new variant of covid 19 plans for a wide scale return to the office have been delayed and delayed again and changing patterns of attendance look set to reduce the overall demand for space financial markets reflect the darkening mood offices particularly in business districts are rapidly losing ground to better performing areas of property such as warehouses and apartments having traditionally formed the core of commercial property portfolios in america offices accounted for less than a fifth of transactions in 2021 globally investors spent more on apartments for the first time foreign investment into offices also fell below the pre pandemic average in countries such as america and australia in 2021 by contrast foreign investment in warehouses more than doubled in these markets valuations mirror the uncertainty too prices of buildings in business districts have taken a hit even as commercial property prices have boomed in other parts of cities in san francisco s financial district for example property prices have slumped by nearly a fifth since the end of 2019 according to the latest figures across the broader metropolitan area they have increased by more than 5 in manhattan they have fallen by around 8 since the start of the pandemic asian cities have fared better office prices across seoul for instance have risen by more than a third since the end of 2019 in singapore they are up by more than a tenth most investors take a long term view so capital allocated to offices will be locked in for years but sentiment is shifting away from cities with a large concentration of offices and towards smaller markets with a broader mix of buildings a survey of investors with assets under management of more than 50bn by cbre a property firm showed a preference in 2021 for markets like phoenix and denver over new york and chicago the biggest business hubs will no doubt continue to attract large sums london s offices are forecast to attract 60bn 81bn of overseas capital over the next few years according to knight frank but deserted office blocks in dense commercial districts will continue to cast an ominous shadow landlords insist concerns are overblown despite many buildings remaining stubbornly empty they maintain that demand for the best space is holding up true some prime properties still attract plenty of suitors tenants are increasingly swapping ageing office blocks for modern greener workplaces with better air filtration systems and higher quality amenities but these high end properties represent 20 or less of buildings in most cities they do however make up a disproportionate share of investment activity in new york just nine out of 69 office transactions accounted for 80 of the total amount invested in 2021 the gap between the best assets and the rest of the market will widen further refurbishments may rejuvenate some tired looking buildings for many older assets however inflation shortages of labour and materials in the construction industry and the high cost of upgrading buildings to meet tougher environmental standards will make it harder to justify the expense the consequences for business districts could be far reaching the mass departure of bankers lawyers and other professionals also hurts the cafes restaurants and other small businesses that serve them many were already struggling with supply chain disruptions labour shortages and rising costs lockdowns cost sydney s economy an estimated a 250m 178m a week and 40 000 jobs across new york city more than a third of small businesses closed during lockdowns before the pandemic the sector accounted for over half of private sector jobs in the city civic slide municipal finances too are exposed dormant offices mean shrinking tax revenues for cities which rely on them to fund public services empty offices also put pressure on transit systems reduced passenger numbers are projected to leave a 1 5bn hole in the finances of london s transport authority by 2024 new york s metropolitan transportation authority which runs the city s subway is forecasting a 1 4bn deficit in 2025 as federal aid is phased out business districts are taking defensive measures a common approach has been to make them more vibrant a trend that was already under way before the pandemic the city of london is proposing more all night cultural celebrations traffic free streets on weekends and at least 1 500 new apartments by 2030 while canary wharf has added bars restaurants and pleasure boats to draw in younger crowds singapore s urban redevelopment authority concedes it may need to rethink the mix of buildings in the downtown district in addition to planning more cycle paths and pedestrianised streets in america skyscrapers are opening their doors to the public offering new

menafn asia times ukraine prime minister volodymyr zelensky s remark february 14 that russia would attack his country on the 16th of february sent stock markets tumbling before a senior aide qualified the statement as a joke zelensky was a professional comedian before he became ukraine s leader the us stock market recouped some of its earlier losses and the nasdaq index closed unchanged a key political risk gauge the cost of us dollar denominnated insurance against default on russia s sovereign bonds spiked to 2 75 percentage points above the interbank rate early february 14 before settling back to 2 5 percentage points that s close to the high point during the peak of the covid 19 market panic in march 2020 with the difference that the credit default swap market reflected fear of sanctions against the russian federation rather than economic distress the oil price fell to the low 20 s in early 2020 but today traded around 95 a barrel russia s external finances are robust its current account surplus stands at 5 of gdp close to the highest among the world s big economies and its foreign exchange reserves have nearly doubled during the past five years to over 630 billion even under a worst case scenario a russian incursion into ukraine followed by punitive sanctions it is hard to envision a scenario in which russia would default on its foreign debt with 455 billion of foreign debt outstanding and an average interest rate of about 5 russia s sovereign debt service obligations are slightly over 20 billion a year it has thirty times that amount in reserves oil analysts are trying to work out the impact of russian sanctions on the oil market this is unclear china almost certainly would continue to buy oil from russia under any circumstances brent crude rose today to 96 a barrel but the oil price has risen steadily due to constrained supply conditions for the past several months irrespective of events in ukraine rising oil prices are a major worry for washington as well as europe and japan and any attempt to boycott russian oil which comprises about a tenth of world supply would lead to nasty economic consequences for the world economy it is hard to work out a scenario in which the russian sovereign would run short of money which makes the rush to buy insurance against russian default seem overdone russian equities are a different story in us dollar terms the russian market has fallen nearly 30 since late october even if the russian sovereign sails through a new round of sanctions the russian energy majors like gazprom lukoil and rosneft may run into trouble russian banks which comprise a large part of the russian index could be shut out of the dollar payments system even if they find workarounds through china s rmb payments mechanism their profitability will suffer severely russian stocks look cheap erus one of the russia country etfs trades at five times forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 7 but russian stocks always are cheap given the layers of political risk associated with them and it would take a great deal of courage to dip into this market at the moment

private equity funds pool capital for investment in privately held businesses increasingly pe funds are looking to global investment markets and foreign opportunities investors and fund managers generally share a number of common tax goals including minimizing phantom income that is profit allocations that do not have a corresponding cash distribution in keeping with this goal funds investing outside of the united states typically attempt to mitigate if not avoid u s anti deferral regimes historically the two most notable regimes in this respect are the subpart f rules applicable to u s shareholders of controlled foreign corporations cfcs and the passive foreign investment company pfic regime in addition the tax cuts jobs act introduced another commonly encountered anti deferral regime global intangible low taxed income gilti controlled foreign corporations cfcs a controlled foreign corporation cfc is a foreign corporation in which u s shareholders have sufficient ownership under the current tax law u s shareholders must in the aggregate own more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power or value of the foreign corporation s stock the ownership can be direct indirect or constructive u s shareholders a u s shareholder is a u s person who owns again directly indirectly or constructively 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of voting stock or the total value of all classes of stock entitled to vote in a foreign corporation of particular note for tax years ending on or before december 31 2017 section 958 b 4 turned off downward attribution that provision prevented a u s person from being treated as owning stock that owned by a non u s person the tax cuts jobs act of 2017 however repealed section 958 b 4 as a result for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2018 downward attribution applies to treat u s persons as owning the stock of non u s persons this change had the effect of causing many taxpayers to fall under the definition of u s shareholder which caused many foreign corporations to fall within the definition of a cfc even though they had not in prior years under the cfc rules a u s partnership is treated as a u s person even though subchapter k generally treats a partnership as a conduit that is not subject to an entity level tax thus a domestic partnership owning more than 50 of a foreign corporation will be treated as a u s shareholder of a cfc subpart f phantom income subpart f rules treat a u s shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation cfc as though it received its pro rata share of certain categories of the cfc s current earnings and profits e p that is a u s shareholder is required to include in current income its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income even if it is not distributed and received a fund investing outside the u s will generally seek to minimize its exposure to subpart f s cfc regime sponsors may employ a number of structures such as organizing a primary fund as a foreign partnership or an offshore alternative investment vehicle aiv as a separate funding vehicle pfics a foreign corporation falls under the definition of a passive foreign investment company pfic if it satisfies either the income test or the asset test income test 75 or more of the corporation s gross income for its tax year is passive income asset test at least 50 of the average percentage of assets held by the foreign corporation during the tax year are assets that produce passive income or that are held for the production of passive income pfic look thru rule for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic the foreign corporation is treated as if it directly held its proportionate share of the assets and directly received its proportionate share of the income of any corporation in which it owns at least 25 of the stock by value cfc overlap rule a 10 or more u s shareholder that includes in income its pro rata share of subpart f income for the stock of a cfc that is also a pfic is generally not subject to the pfic provisions for the same stock during the qualified portion of the shareholder s holding period of the stock in the pfic this exception however generally does not apply to option holders tax consequences for shareholders of a section 1291 fund unless a taxpayer makes an election otherwise a pfic defaults into the status of a section 1291 fund shareholders of a section 1291 fund are subject to a tax regime that imposes a tax on the receipt of an excess distribution and the recognition of gain on the sale or disposition of the stock of the section 1291 fund the entire amount of gain from the disposition of a section 1291 fund is treated as an excess distribution excess distributions an excess distribution is the portion of any distribution received from a section 1291 fund that is greater than 125 of the average distributions received by the shareholder with respect to such stock during the 3 preceding tax years or if shorter the portion of the shareholder s holding period before the current tax year the law provides an exception however with respect to distributions received or deemed received during the first tax year of the shareholder s holding period of the stock the excess distribution is generally determined on a per share basis and is allocated to each day in the shareholder s holding period of the stock the portion of the excess distribution that is allocated to the current tax year and the shareholder s tax years in its holding period prior to the foreign corporation qualifying as a pfic are taxed as ordinary income the portion allocated to the taxpayer s holding period during which the foreign corporation qualified as a pfic are subject to the separate punitive tax and interest charge provisions in section 1291 c qualified electing fund qef a pfic is a qef if a u s person who is a direct or indirect shareholder of the pfic makes a proper and timely election to treat the pfic as a qef the tax consequences for shareholders of a qef a shareholder of a qef is required to include i its pro rata share of the ordinary earnings of the qef in gross income as ordinary income annually and ii its pro rata share of the net capital gain of the qef as long term capital gain if the qef election is not made for the first year of the shareholder s holding period in the pfic the shareholder may be able to purge the pfic taint through an election to trigger a deemed sale or deemed dividend where appropriate in such case the pfic will become a pedigreed qef pursuant to treasury regulation section 1 1291 9 j 2 ii unpedigreed qefs a shareholder who receives a distribution from an unpedigreed qef will also be subject to the section 1291 rules mark to market election a u s

shareholder elects to mark the stock to market under section 1296 the shareholder either includes in income each year an amount equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of the pfic stock as of the close of the tax year over the shareholder s adjusted basis in such stock or is allowed a deduction equal to the lesser of the excess if any of the adjusted basis of the pfic stock over its

shareholders of controlled foreign corporations cfcs to include gilti in gross income each year the gilti inclusion pe funds that are structured as domestic partnerships and that own foreign portfolio company investments may see a degree of tax relief through the gilti regime in the form of lower effective tax rates though may be subject to phantom income without proper planning gilti working in tandem with subpart f closed substantial pre tcja anti deferral gaps and resulted in the inclusion of a large swath of offshore earnings in us taxable income on a current basis 10 us shareholders investors who are not corporations may however see detrimental tax impact though certain planning mechanisms may be available such as a section 962 election to realize foreign tax credits the gilti provisions under section 951a in effect approximate the intangible income of a cfc by assuming a 10 rate of return on the tangible assets of the cfc any income in excess of that normal return on assets is effectively treated as intangible income a u s shareholder s gilti inclusion is the excess of the u s shareholder s pro rata share of net cfc tested income over its net deemed tangible income return net dtir and tested income is gross income without regard to certain exceptions subpart f eci high tax income certain fogei certain related party dividend offshore parallel vehicles a parallel fund invests alongside that is in parallel to another master or main fund often the parallel fund may be formed offshore in another jurisdiction for instance a delaware based fund may operate a cayman islands based fund the parallel fund to accommodate non us investors by allowing them to avoid us reporting obligations domestic fund managers may choose to fund foreign portfolio company investments through an offshore alternative investment vehicle generally the domicile of the aiv will determine whether the foreign corporation is a cfc there is however often a potential risk that the service could view the fund rather than the aiv as the relevant shareholder for cfc characterization purposes a risk that is presented when as is often the case the funds returns are aggregated for purposes of determining whether the general partner has a right to a carry distribution hybrid entities use of hybrid entities provides another potential mechanism to mitigate exposure to the subpart f regime funds may utilize a combination of an interposed luxembourg or dutch holding company between the fund level and operating subsidiaries intercompany debt and earnings stripping arrangements to lower the overall effective tax rate structures such as this however require ensuring that no significant part of the holding company s offshore earnings are subject to tax on any u s shareholders under the cfc regime use of hybrid arrangements may allow the taxpayer to avoid recognizing payments made by the holding company s subsidiaries e g dividends and interest paid to the holding company for u s tax purposes thereby avoiding payments to holding company that would otherwise be characterized as subpart f income the subpart f rules were first enacted in 1962 as part of the revenue act of 1962 the 1962 act pub l 87 834 subpart f was specifically intended to curtail the use of low tax jurisdictions for indefinite deferral of u s tax on certain earnings that would otherwise be subject to u s federal income tax h r rep no 1447 at 57 1962 congress expressly sought to target taxpayers who had taken advantage of the multiplicity of foreign tax systems to avoid taxation by the united states on what could ordinarily be expected to be u s source income id at 58 before the 1962 act united states shareholders of cfcs were not subject to u s tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless and until earnings of the foreign corporations were distributed to the shareholders as a dividend s rep no 1881 at 78 1962 the subpart f regime eliminated deferral for certain earnings of cfcs subjecting those earnings to immediate u s taxation regardless of whether there was an actual distribution a u s shareholder s net cfc tested income is the aggregate pro rata share of tested income from each of its cfcs minus the aggregate pro rata share of tested loss from each of its cfcs but not less than zero net dtir is defined as 10 of the u s shareholders pro rata

menafn asia times ukraine prime minister volodymyr zelensky s remark february 14 that russia would attack his country on the 16th of february sent stock markets tumbling before a senior aide qualified the statement as a joke zelensky was a professional comedian before he became ukraine s leader the us stock market recouped some of its earlier losses and the nasdaq index closed unchanged a key political risk gauge the cost of us dollar denominnated insurance against default on russia s sovereign bonds spiked to 2 75 percentage points above the interbank rate early february 14 before settling back to 2 5 percentage points that s close to the high point during the peak of the covid 19 market panic in march 2020 with the difference that the credit default swap market reflected fear of sanctions against the russian federation rather than economic distress the oil price fell to the low 20 s in early 2020 but today traded around 95 a barrel russia s external finances are robust its current account surplus stands at 5 of gdp close to the highest among the world s big economies and its foreign exchange reserves have nearly doubled during the past five years to over 630 billion even under a worst case scenario a russian incursion into ukraine followed by punitive sanctions it is hard to envision a scenario in which russia would default on its foreign debt with 455 billion of foreign debt outstanding and an average interest rate of about 5 russia s sovereign debt service obligations are slightly over 20 billion a year it has thirty times that amount in reserves oil analysts are trying to work out the impact of russian sanctions on the oil market this is unclear china almost certainly would continue to buy oil from russia under any circumstances brent crude rose today to 96 a barrel but the oil price has risen steadily due to constrained supply conditions for the past several months irrespective of events in ukraine rising oil prices are a major worry for washington as well as europe and japan and any attempt to boycott russian oil which comprises about a tenth of world supply would lead to nasty economic consequences for the world economy it is hard to work out a scenario in which the russian sovereign would run short of money which makes the rush to buy insurance against russian default seem overdone russian equities are a different story in us dollar terms the russian market has fallen nearly 30 since late october even if the russian sovereign sails through a new round of sanctions the russian energy majors like gazprom lukoil and rosneft may run into trouble russian banks which comprise a large part of the russian index could be shut out of the dollar payments system even if they find workarounds through china s rmb payments mechanism their profitability will suffer severely russian stocks look cheap erus one of the russia country etfs trades at five times forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 7 but russian stocks always are cheap given the layers of political risk associated with them and it would take a great deal of courage to dip into this market at the moment

why it matters arm owner softbank has resorted to floating the company after failing to sell it to nvidia but those plans are coming up against a legal fight that started in 2020 it involves arm s chinese joint venture the financial times obtained documents indicating a legal challenge from the head of arm china which is jeopardizing the main british company s plans for an initial public offering ipo it s is the third such challenge in a nearly two year battle softbank is opting for an arm ipo after regulators blocked it from selling the company to nvidia for 40 billion last week however investors may have trouble valuing arm because it has been unable to oust the head of the chinese division in 2020 arm china s board voted almost unanimously to remove its head allen wu wu ignored the vote and maintained control of the company because he is its legal representative and possesses its official seal which chinese law requires to enact official documents wu also controls a key investment firm that gives him power over most of arm china s shareholders he s using one of those shareholder companies to launch his latest case against arm china which is ultimately stopping softbank from listing the primary arm division on new york s nasdaq exchange

menafn asia times ukraine prime minister volodymyr zelensky s remark february 14 that russia would attack his country on the 16th of february sent stock markets tumbling before a senior aide qualified the statement as a joke zelensky was a professional comedian before he became ukraine s leader the us stock market recouped some of its earlier losses and the nasdaq index closed unchanged a key political risk gauge the cost of us dollar denominnated insurance against default on russia s sovereign bonds spiked to 2 75 percentage points above the interbank rate early february 14 before settling back to 2 5 percentage points that s close to the high point during the peak of the covid 19 market panic in march 2020 with the difference that the credit default swap market reflected fear of sanctions against the russian federation rather than economic distress the oil price fell to the low 20 s in early 2020 but today traded around 95 a barrel russia s external finances are robust its current account surplus stands at 5 of gdp close to the highest among the world s big economies and its foreign exchange reserves have nearly doubled during the past five years to over 630 billion even under a worst case scenario a russian incursion into ukraine followed by punitive sanctions it is hard to envision a scenario in which russia would default on its foreign debt with 455 billion of foreign debt outstanding and an average interest rate of about 5 russia s sovereign debt service obligations are slightly over 20 billion a year it has thirty times that amount in reserves oil analysts are trying to work out the impact of russian sanctions on the oil market this is unclear china almost certainly would continue to buy oil from russia under any circumstances brent crude rose today to 96 a barrel but the oil price has risen steadily due to constrained supply conditions for the past several months irrespective of events in ukraine rising oil prices are a major worry for washington as well as europe and japan and any attempt to boycott russian oil which comprises about a tenth of world supply would lead to nasty economic consequences for the world economy it is hard to work out a scenario in which the russian sovereign would run short of money which makes the rush to buy insurance against russian default seem overdone russian equities are a different story in us dollar terms the russian market has fallen nearly 30 since late october even if the russian sovereign sails through a new round of sanctions the russian energy majors like gazprom lukoil and rosneft may run into trouble russian banks which comprise a large part of the russian index could be shut out of the dollar payments system even if they find workarounds through china s rmb payments mechanism their profitability will suffer severely russian stocks look cheap erus one of the russia country etfs trades at five times forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 7 but russian stocks always are cheap given the layers of political risk associated with them and it would take a great deal of courage to dip into this market at the moment

invasion in ukraine could disrupt life in america share copy link copy if russia invades ukraine global stock markets could be in for a rough ride much worse than most other geopolitical events of the past several decades a russian invasion of ukraine could further disrupt supplies of crude potentially leading prices that are already their highest in seven years and approaching 100 a barrel to even loftier levels related video above student exchange program discusses the impact of ukraine russia situation the conflict between russia and ukraine is likely to push crude oil prices above 100 a barrel sooner than earlier projected said naeem aslam chief market analyst with avatrade in a report monday the potential jump in oil prices depends on what sort of sanctions the united states of america and its allies are likely to impose on russia if it actually invades its neighbor a spike in energy prices could hurt consumers and also prompt the federal reserve and other central banks to move more quickly to raise interest rates to try and tamp down inflation that would probably be bad news for stocks as well capital economics analysts wrote in a report monday that a russian invasion of ukraine or severe ratcheting up of sanctions could add as much as 2 percentage points to inflation in developed markets particularly in europe given the inflationary backdrop and hawkish signals from central banks monetary policy could be tightened more aggressively as a result the capital economics analysts added market may ignore some scary headlines but not when oil s involvedthat s one of the main reasons the market probably wouldn t shrug off a conflict in ukraine even though it quickly dismissed many other skirmishes and terrorist attacks during the past century cfra research chief investment strategist sam stovall analyzed the market reaction to 24 military and terrorist events since world war ii stovall found that the s p 500 typically fell only about 1 on initial news of a military event or terror attack and just 5 5 over the length of a particular event and it only took on average 52 days for stocks to recover their losses the equity markets are more at risk from the fallout from the war on inflation than on a potential invasion of ukraine stovall wrote history reminds investors that surprise military and terrorist activities have traditionally been short lived and represented an attractive buying opportunity many of these events did not have a broader economic spillover such as the assassination of president kennedy the massacre of israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 the madrid bombing of 2004 london terrorist attack in 2005 and the boston marathon bombing in 2013 but another major military conflict on stovall s list did impact the oil market the 1990 war following the invasion of kuwait by saddam hussein s iraq and that led to a much greater market shock the s p 500 plunged nearly 17 during the start of the persian gulf war and it took more than half a year 189 days for the market to recoup its losses it seems likely that a drawn out conflict in ukraine would be more problematic to the global markets and economy much more like the kuwait invasion than one off terrorist events others worry about the fact that russia is not just a significant player in the energy market given that russia is a major oil and grain supplier and is a key producer of palladium used in catalytic converters fears of price rises are very real said fiona cincotta senior financial markets analyst at city index in a report monday the last thing that consumers or investors need is for more inflation pressure to push the costs of goods even higher

listen to this article listen to this article editor s note business content from the new york times will now be included with your subscription to finance commerce not a subscriber start your subscription here thirty minutes before the market opened on nov 3 gabriel grego an activist short seller unveiled a research report on cassava sciences a biotech firm that had become a meme stock rising over 700 by that point after spending months researching cassava which claimed to have developed a promising alzheimer s treatment grego said he had found serious problems with its clinical studies including possible forgery of data and cherry picking of patients a citizen petition to stop cassava s drug trials had been filed with the food and drug administration and he thought the stock would go to zero grego had already placed his short a bet that the stock would decline and a substantial portion of his capital was on the line but the day before trading volume had spiked and the stock had jumped 50 in intraday trading his short was in the red as he made his presentation the stock quickly fell about 10 but within hours it was back up to take a short position investors sell borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back at a lower price later if the price rises instead they would have to buy stock to cover what they borrowed grego scrambled to cover his position and by day s end he was out according to an email he sent to investors in his hedge fund quintessential capital management a day later cassava which is based in austin texas released a report in a scientific journal that seemingly exonerated the company the stock spiked another 50 but reversed shortly later after the journal indicated the report would most likely be retracted and cassava disclosed an investigation by the securities and exchange commission such a stomach churning roller coaster is not an unusual ride for activist short sellers who typically bulk up their position just before releasing their reports but cover a chunk after making them public investors who use this strategy argue that covering their position is a form of risk management since companies often immediately try to refute activist short sellers claims sending stock prices back up if we had not exited that position when we did i probably would ve had to shut down my fund now grego said we would have had career ending losses short sellers aren t loved nor well understood by the general public they became the target of angry retail investors during the gamestop trading frenzy early last year blamed for driving gamestop s stock into the ground before a short squeeze in which the pace of buying forces short sellers to buy stock to cover their positions catapulted it to the sky the fracas sparked investigations into gamestop short sellers trading but they have gone far beyond the wild events of january 2021 an investigation of short sellers by the sec and the department of justice first reported by bloomberg has ensnared at least 25 individuals and firms most of them activist short sellers who have received subpoenas and search warrants an individual familiar with the investigation said companies targeted by the activists have been pushing regulators to go after these short sellers for years but some in the financial industry say the far reaching inquiry is fueled by a mistaken belief that abuse by activist short sellers is widespread and distorting stock prices those beliefs have also led critics of activist short sellers to propose sec rules that they say would stem such abuses these include forcing the activists to hold their positions for at least 10 days or failing that to disclose when they cover their shorts some have petitioned the sec to change the rules so that rapidly closing a short position can be considered a form of market manipulation supporters of short sellers say that the research behind these proposals is misleading and that activists by uncovering fraud do more good than harm they argue that the proposed changes would hamstring if not destroy a business that provides a vital service in policing the markets a cooling off period the idea that short activists need to be reined in has largely been driven by joshua mitts an associate professor at columbia law school who also has a consultancy business he claimed in a 2018 research paper short and distort that activist stock sellers who wrote under pseudonyms were deceiving the market to make a quick buck and that the stocks they shorted bounced back a few days later mitts first mentioned the idea of a cooling off period in a 2019 paper and by the next year he and a former hedge fund short seller marc cohodes had proposed a 10 day holding period for all short activists once they made their research public if you re a short activist you scared investors into selling stock well you should have to ride the consequences with them mitts said in an interview noting that he has presented these ideas to the sec and on capitol hill on his resume mitts also says he has extensive experience supporting the justice department but he declined to say whether he is involved in the current investigation or to name any of his clients in opposing the proposed holding period jonathan macey a professor of corporate law at yale university said it was a rather blunt instrument that would punish the good short sellers in order to get rid of the bad short sellers mitts research has laid the groundwork for additional efforts aimed at reining in activist short sellers in 2020 a dozen business law professors signed an sec rule making petition co written by mitts among other measures it asked the sec to create a requirement to disclose closing a position that no longer reflects current holdings or trading intention activist short sellers say that could send the wrong signal which is that they have changed their view of the company distorting the shorts in his short and distort research which the rule making petition quoted mitts looked at 1 720 short attacks published on a popular finance website seeking alpha by authors using pseudonyms the targeted stocks initially slid he found but began to recover on the day after a negative report and for three more days the paper is making a very specific point that by using anonymity one can effectively manipulate the market mitts said his critics have said that the research didn t look at a representative sample of activist short sellers and that mitts consulting business is a conflict of interest carson block an activist short seller who founded muddy waters capital an investor research and hedge fund firm has been among the most vocal of these critics he calls the professor a corporate lobbyist masquerading as an academic mitts has done consulting work for companies targeted by short sellers including farmland partners and burford capital the latter of which muddy waters shorted mitts said block s characterization was false because he worked with a variety of clients the columbia professor s results have also been challenged by newer research which has found that stocks targeted by activist short sellers on average fare worse than the short term recoveries that mitts documented in his sample one analysis by frank partnoy a professor in the school of law at the university of california berkeley and peter molk a professor at the university of florida levin college of law shows that stocks targeted by activist short sellers decline in price significantly over time it also found that the reports often result in regulatory investigations settlements for plaintiffs in class action cases and changes in leadership and operations activists provide substantial benefits to society the professors argue what is manipulation for activist short sellers perhaps the most ominous part of the rule making petition is a request that the sec make the rapid covering of a short a possible form of market manipulation known as scalping historically scalping involved investment advisers who recommended stocks to clients and then quickly sold them short sellers have long been told by their lawyers that as long as their reports contain no material inaccuracies and are not based on inside information they have done nothing illegal in the disclosure accompanying their reports activist short sellers typically say they are short the stock but may cover at any time and they add that they are not offering investment advice john courtade a former senior sec enforcement litigator who now represents short sellers has designed some of these disclosures scalping has to involve deception of some sort he said just the fact that you re going to close your position has never been held to be deception if you look at the cases they involve situations like not disclosing that you have a position at all but mitts argues that whether the boilerplate disclosure is sufficient has not been tested by the courts for now the sec appears unlikely to move on mitts rule making petition though it may add some broad disclosure requirements of short sales as mandated by the dodd frank act which overhauled financial regulation after the 2008 financial crisis but it s an open question as to whether the justice department will try to set a precedent by prosecuting short sellers for market manipulation under the scalping theory or any other one not yet tested the debate has led grego to wonder whether society wants activist short selling if it does he said any proposed rule should be vetted for unintended consequences that maybe reduce or even make this activity impossible as for cassava after the company announced that the sec was investigating it grego reopened his short position and the stock has fallen 20 he said he had never doubted that his thesis was correct this article originally appeared in the new york times
cedar rapids flattening state income tax rates and exempting retirement income would either lead to growth in businesses and jobs and increase iowans wealth or simply make wealthy iowans wealthier according to speakers at a public hearing on a tax plan set to be debated later this week house republicans are proposing a four year gradual reduction in the personal income tax rate to 4 percent and eliminate taxes on retirement income their plan along with proposals from the senate gop and republican gov kim reynolds are under discussion at the capitol making some form of tax change likely this year similar to previous hearings on the plans speakers at the monday evening public hearing were divided between those who said a flatter tax rate would make iowa a more attractive place for businesses to locate and expand as well as a more attractive place for employees to live and work and those who said the plan largely benefits the wealthy while doing little to help lower income workers house file 2317 will drive real investment in iowa by allowing people to keep more of what they make drew klein of americans for prosperity told legislators when you put money back in the pockets of everyday iowans they invest in their futures he said and our future as a state is intrinsically tied to the investments that they make the bill merely is another attempt by republicans to give the wealthy and big businesses tax breaks while taking money away from our public schools public safety and health care services matt sinovic of progress iowa said with this tax proposal that gives millions to the wealthiest in our state and puts the hammer down on working families the legislature is doubling down on the policies that created gov reynolds workforce crisis sinovic said rather than make iowa s tax system fairer anne discher of common good iowa said this bill will make iowa s already unfair tax system even more unfair the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers pay about 10 percent to 12 percent of their incomes in state and local taxes the wealthiest taxpayers pay less than 8 percent she said personal income taxes she continued generate half the state s general fund that pays for education health and human services environmental protection and the justice system there s simply no way to make these kinds of permanent tax cuts without decimating our state budget discher said according to a legislative services agency analysis the bill would lower income tax collections by 5 8 billion from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2028 that would be partially offset with transfers of 829 million from the taxpayer relief fund for a net impact of 5 002 billion on state revenue over six years in recent years the annual state general fund budget has exceeded 8 billion a flat income tax rate isn t the only feature of the gop plan and jd davis of the iowa association of business and industry said provisions on employee stock ownership stand to benefit iowa workers his association represents 1 500 companies with 330 000 employees all of them taxpayers he said those provisions davis said will increase the number of companies with employees in ownership positions and is going to be very good at creating wealth in iowa and helping folks have a stake in the businesses they re working for davis and others praised the exemption on retirement income it will encourage older iowans to stay in the state and stay active in their communities and philanthropy however discher said the average savings to a retiree will be 610 a year no one is going to decide to stay in iowa or to leave iowa over 610 she said others called for relief from property taxes and the sales tax it may seem like a break for the poor marjena sloan of grinnell said in a written comment but then i hear about increasing sales taxes and property taxes so where is this wonderful savings pretty much another stealing from peter to cover for paul s tax cuts sloan said lois gorman of altoona said 27 percent of her social security income goes to pay property taxes on her 52 year old 960 square foot home however des moines area realtor john stark encouraged lawmakers to adopt the flat tax and exempt retirement income reducing the complexity and rates of iowa s income taxes will positively impact the citizens of our state minimize the appeal of moving out of iowa and attract new residents and businesses stark wrote the tax plan might well be the best thing that you all can do this session to help grow population and workforce in iowa said sharon presnall of the iowa bankers association she went on to ask legislators to consider tax equity for banks and credit unions which are exempted from state and federal income taxes the current income tax disparity is unsustainable for community banks presnall said comments 319 398 8375 james lynch thegazette com jd davis vice president of iowa association of business and industry matt sinovic executive director of progress iowa
