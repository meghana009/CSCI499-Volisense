apple chief executive officer tim cook acknowledged in an interview with bloomberg that the company was dealing with some softness and a slower economy but said he expects revenue to pick up again in the fourth quarter apple didn t provide specific guidance for the period continuing an approach it adopted at the beginning of the pandemic though it s faring better than some tech peers apple has grown more cautious as it confronts a sputtering economy the iphone maker is planning to slow hiring and spending for some teams in 2023 bloomberg reported earlier this month before releasing its results thursday apple s stock had fallen about 11 per cent this year slightly outperforming the s p 500 index apple struggled to get enough supply last quarter after china s covid 19 precautions shuttered some factories and hamstrung deliveries those problems have eased but aren t over china s tough stance against the virus has led to some production restrictions for supplier foxconn as recently as this week the manufacturer along with several others in the region was forced to operate within a closed loop system for seven days that means factory workers can t have contact with people outside of their plants for that period apple also had little in the way of new products to lure customers in recent months the company released an updated iphone se back in march and is expected to launch fresh iphones in september missing the quarter that just ended even so that product generated us40 7 billion last quarter beating estimates of about us39 billion advertisement qualcomm added to investors concerns about the smartphone market on wednesday when the chipmaker said consumers appetite for the devices had slowed but the company said demand was particularly weak for low end and mid tier phones running android rather than the iphone last quarter s sales from digital services like icloud applecare apple tv and apple music climbed 12 per cent to us19 6 billion during the period that made it apple s fastest growing category but the division came up shy of wall street predictions of about us19 7 billion apple s wearables home products and accessories the division that includes its smartwatch homepod airpods and beats headphones had sales of us8 08 billion last quarter wall street had called for about us8 8 billion apple generated us7 38 billion from the mac badly missing predictions of about us8 45 billion the company launched new macbook pro and macbook air models in july but those didn t contribute to the latest results because the quarter ended in june that means many consumers probably stopped buying the old versions of the products apple s two most popular macs hurting that category the cupertino california based company is planning a slew of new macs over the next several months including high end macbook pros an imac upgraded mac minis and a revamped mac pro bloomberg has reported the ipad which was a strong performer at the height of covid 19 lockdowns has been slipping back toward pre pandemic levels still it generated us7 22 billion last quarter above the us6 93 billion estimate the company last updated the ipad in march with a new ipad air model with an m1 chip and it s planning faster ipad pro models for later this year the ongoing covid 19 restrictions in china have sparked concerns about the effect on consumer spending in a sign that apple has had to get more aggressive in that market it s currently cutting the price of the iphone apple watch and airpods in china for a few days as part of a rare sale apple generated us14 6 billion from the country in the third quarter down from a year earlier but better than analysts had projected bloomberg

services shrank by 0 9 percent at an annualized rate in the april june quarter according to data from the commerce department thursday the drop came on the heels of last quarter s 1 6 percent decline xinhua liu jie by matthew rusling washington july 28 xinhua the u s economy shrank for the second consecutive quarter meeting the textbook definition of recession but the job market and other economic data remain healthy the u s gross domestic product gdp which refers to the value of all u s produced goods and services shrank by 0 9 percent at an annualized rate in the april june quarter according to data from the commerce department thursday the drop came on the heels of last quarter s 1 6 percent decline two back to back gdp decreases satisfy the technical definition of recession although economists said there are a number of other criteria to consider many sectors and companies are faring remarkably well and some economists said this must also be taken into consideration the gdp drop occurred amid a backdrop of surging inflation and the u s federal reserve s efforts so far unfruitful to control it with the biggest rate hikes in decades there are all too many indications that the fed s anti inflation moves are setting us up for a hard economic landing by year end desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua consumer sentiment is close to a record low as inflation erodes wages the housing market is crumbling due to a doubling of mortgage rates u s exporters are facing strong headwinds as a result of a strong dollar and economic troubles in spots worldwide said lachman a former international monetary fund official risks of a hard landing should be raising serious questions about whether the fed is slamming on the brakes too hard in a bid to contain rapidly rising inflation mike loewengart managing director of investment strategy for e trade said today s reading only adds fuel to the fire that we are in or entering a recession while it is certainly on the negative side of the estimates keep in mind that a 1 percent decrease is relatively small and supports the idea that any recessionary environment will be mild loewengart said as quoted by cnbc but on the flip side much of the economy is doing well at least at the moment the jobless rate stands near record lows of 3 6 percent and employers have added 2 7 million new jobs so far this year the non profit national bureau of economy research emphasizes that more than just gdp determines whether there s an economic downturn that includes unemployment and consumer spending both of which have remained strong over the past six months but if economists agree on one thing it s that the economy is in the midst of much uncertainty inflation stands at a 40 year high of 9 1 percent with the fed aggressively hiking interest rates while trying not to trigger a recession brookings institution senior fellow barry bosworth told xinhua this is not officially a recession it does meet a shorthand measure of two consecutive quarters of negative change but the evidence is not sufficiently widespread particularly employment change to meet the more formal criteria bosworth said certainly the risks of recession have increased but the future pattern of unemployment will be critical for the fed the issue is inflation in coming months they need concrete evidence that it is slowing the gdp release was very much in line with expectations bosworth said in another odd twist u s markets actually rose on the news on thursday after rallying the previous day the dow jones industrial average rose 1 03 percent after climbing the previous day the tech heavy nasdaq increased 1 08 percent in a two day winning streak investors on thursday continued to eye the week s

overview in the second quarter of 2022 global oil prices continued to rise with the west texas intermediate wti benchmark oil price averaging over us 108 bbl in addition western canadian select wcs and edmonton light msw benchmark differentials narrowed in comparison to the first quarter of 2022 cardinal remained unhedged on all commodities during the second quarter and was able to fully take advantage of the increased prices cardinal s successful first half of 2022 drilling program led to an 8 increase in production over the first quarter of 2022 with production averaging 22 280 boe d net operating expenses decreased quarter over quarter despite inflationary pressures impacting the industry the higher commodity prices combined with increased production elevated the company s adjusted funds flow by 48 over cardinal s previous record in the first quarter of 2022 to a new corporate record of 128 3 million or 0 82 per diluted share increased adjusted funds flow combined with our disciplined capital program enhanced our free cash flow during the quarter to 103 3 million more than doubling our first quarter free cash flow of 51 6 million the significant free cash flow allowed cardinal to accelerate our net debt reduction strategy reducing our net debt by 85 2 million in the second quarter of 2022 the company has reduced our net debt by 116 2 million in 2022 to 62 0 million at june 30 significantly lower debt levels have reduced bank fees and decreased our second quarter 2022 interest charges per boe by 54 as compared to the same period in 2021 cardinal achieved our phase one net debt target of 100 million in may and accelerated our shareholder returns by resuming our corporate dividend at 0 05 per common share in june and implementing an ncib since the implementation of the ncib the company has bought back 3 000 000 shares for cancellation at an average cost of 7 09 per share during the second quarter the company also purchased through its independent trust 1 7 million shares to be used for the potential settlement of restricted and performance awards the company s low decline crude oil focus has increased our second quarter 2022 netback per boe to 66 51 boe up 135 over the same period in 2021 while the adjusted funds flow per boe has increased to a record 63 31 boe the company has an estimated 1 4 billion of high quality tax pools at june 30 2022 to be applied against future income for tax purposes during the second quarter the company spent a total of 25 0 million on development capital expenditures which included the drilling of seven 6 3 net wells and completion of five 4 7 net wells two 1 6 net wells were completed in july in addition cardinal spent 8 1 million to construct new facilities and upgrade existing infrastructure across our asset base and continued with the enhanced oil recovery program eor with co2 injection at midale saskatchewan the company also continued with its well reactivation program spending 3 1 million on recompletions and workovers throughout its operating areas operations in the second quarter continued strong operational results confirm the quality of the company s existing asset base and development drilling inventory production in the quarter averaged 22 280 boe d which is approximately 1 900 boe d above our internal budget forecast as in the first quarter base decline continued to be lower than forecasted and was complemented with better than forecasted production from our 2021 2022 drill program cardinal has the lowest corporate base decline rate in our peer group at less than 10 annually successful waterflood and miscible co2 flood management along with ongoing optimization of wells and infrastructure within our legacy assets are the foundation of this low base decline cardinal will continue to focus on prudent management of its long life assets throughout the organization building on our first quarter drilling success cardinal s second quarter drilling program continued to exhibit positive results as follows two 2 0 net single leg ellerslie horizontal wells in the tide lake bantry areas which tested at rates exceeding budget forecast however are currently shut in awaiting infrastructure expansion expected to be completed in the third quarter two 2 0 net horizontal glauconitic channel wells in the tide lake bantry area one of which came on stream in may and continues to produce at approximately 300 bbls d of oil again exceeding our projections the second of these is shut in pending the same infrastructure project referenced above three 2 3 net horizontal wells were drilled at midale saskatchewan consisting of two new producers and one new water co2 injection well this injection well is to commence operations within a week while the two producers came on stream in july at initial combined net oil rates of approximately 300 bbl d well above expectations at tide lake in southern alberta based upon the continued success of our ellerslie multilateral development cardinal increased our prospective land position in the second quarter and is in the process of expanding the capacity of our infrastructure as the size and productivity of the ellerslie development continues to expand beyond our initial expectations environmental social and governance esg cardinal s strong corporate emissions performance has continued in 2022 with ongoing co2 sequestration in saskatchewan and implementation of various emissions reduction projects across alberta through our world class carbon capture and sequestration ccs eor operation at midale the company sequestered approximately 157 000 tonnes of co2 equivalent during the first six months of 2022 this amount of carbon sequestration far exceeds the emissions directly related to the company s operations to date the midale ccs eor project has sequestered over five million tonnes of co2 and has reduced oil production decline rates from this project to approximately 3 to 5 cardinal s safety record continues to be in the top tier of the industry as is our regulatory compliance approval level since 2020 cardinal has continued to actively participate in various government programs focused on site closure including abandonments decommissioning and reclamation to date cardinal has spent approximately 90 of the nearly 30 million in allocated funding in addition cardinal s 2022 asset retirement obligation aro budget has been increased to 19 million four times the required regulatory spend requirements demonstrating cardinal s commitment to reducing our environmental footprint increase to capital budget the board of directors has approved a 30 million increase to cardinal s 2022 capital budget cardinal has decided to increase its development capital budget this year to take advantage of opportunities and to account for inflationary pressures on our existing capital budget the increased capital budget will be used as follows 6 0 million to account for inflationary cost increases to our existing capital program 13 0 million to construct a new pipeline and related facility infrastructure to transport and process our oil and natural gas from the recent drilling success with our ellerslie oil wells in the tide lake area of southern alberta production in the area is currently curtailed due to lack of pipeline capacity in the area we anticipate this project will reduce area operating costs provide the ability to produce shut in volumes and allow cardinal to further develop the area efficiently 10 0 million to fund a five well ellerslie drilling program in tide lake cardinal was able to acquire an additional 11 25 sections of land which we believe are highly prospective to additional ellerslie oil wells a condition of acquiring the lands was that cardinal will drill five wells prior to year end 2022 we anticipate that all of these wells if successful will commence production through our new facilities prior to year end 1 0 million to participate in one 0 75 net non operated well with a third party in a clearwater development opportunity outlook as outlined in january of 2022 we have embarked on a plan to substantially de risk cardinal s business and directly reward our shareholders through debt reduction and direct payments to shareholders with dividends we have now paid our first re instated dividend payment of 0 05 common share on july 15th and reduced our net debt to 62 0 million as at june 30th on june 27 2022 we announced the implementation of an ncib as part of our shareholder return strategy as of july 28th cardinal has purchased for cancellation 3 000 000 common shares at an average cost of 7 09 per common share 2 of our outstanding shares in addition cardinal acquires common shares for potential settlement of employee share based compensation through open market share purchases with an independent trust in the second quarter of 2022 14 0 million of share purchases through the independent trust were completed cardinal currently has over 2 5 million common shares held in the trust for the potential settlement of future share based compensation the advantage to this program for cardinal s shareholders is that we currently do not issue any shares out of treasury for share based compensation reducing the dilutive impact we don t anticipate making any further purchases this year under this program there has been a tremendous amount of oil price volatility in the past few months and the company s goal is to balance a long term sustainable base dividend with opportunities to improve our business and provide shareholder returns with dividend increases and additional common share purchases under our ncib the company will continue to reduce our external risk factors with a strategy of being debt free by the end of 2022 we anticipate that our net debt will decrease to under 50 million in the third quarter at which time we outlined that we would revisit our overall shareholder return strategy with an increase to the dividend rate with the implementation of the ncib we expect to balance dividend increases with opportunities to utilize the ncib note regarding forward looking

digits in july compared with a 7 rise for the s p 500 u s trucking ceos expect to maintain pricing power even with volumes softening in the second half of 2022 as retailers manufacturers and consumers adjust to disruptions from covid lockdowns the russia ukraine war and inflation a recent survey of customers by saia a trucker for starbucks home depot and lowe s found the majority of companies are still working to figure out their next step and what the new normal is for their business according to ceo fritz holzgrefe get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters they were talking a lot about continuing to rebuild inventory positions straightening out their supply chains through the balance of the year even into the first part of next year holzgrefe told cnbc maybe things have slowed a bit but customers are still continuing to re sort their supply chain position to more effectively to achieve their goals in their respective businesses the supply chain is improving and past the worst according to derek leathers ceo of werner enterprise which moves freight for walmart and target but he warned headwinds for truckers will keep rates well above prepandemic levels for the rest of 2022 you ll see rates hold up for the remainder of the year our cost increases are real our customers understand that leathers said we re talking large scale successful winning brands like and many others that know the reliance on their carrier is a competitive advantage they want good quality transportation on time every time safely to do that they work with large well capitalized carriers trucking stocks have been some of the best performers in july while the s p 500 has gained more than 7 this month saia and arcbest are up over 20 while werner enterprises knight swift and jb hunt have increased over 10 earlier this year there were concerns about a freight recession because of falling rates in the so called spot market for trucking according to the most recent data from evercore isi those rates are down more than 11 year over year the spot market provides on demand freight transportation and pricing varies based on supply and demand spot trucking saw a boom at the height of the pandemic as companies adjusted to snarled supply chains and were willing to pay historic rates to transport goods during the e commerce boom however the majority of trucking is still done through contracts with carriers and their customers like large retailers the leading companies in the three major segments of trucking make the majority of revenue from contracts knight swift full truckload fedex less than truckload and jb hunt container shipping have reported double digit rate increases in their most recent earnings we believe the contract rates will hold up we believe contract rates are going to be at a place that is going to allow trucking companies to be remarkably profitable deustche bank transportation analyst amit mehrotra told cnbc he also expects demand to be slightly lower but stable for the rest of 2022 i think the inventory issues that major retailers like target are reporting is more of a reflection of changing buying patterns rather than a significant withdrawal of consumer spending mehrotra said the chief executive of one of the largest trucking brokerages in the united states is also watching consumer spending clearly the trucking market is different today than it was 12 months ago ch robinson ceo bob biesterfield told cnbc s squawk on the street on tuesday he added that retail housing and manufacturing are key drivers of trucking volumes manufacturing has held up the best of those three he added retail saw volume increase in the first quarter and a decline in a second biesterfield said the outcome of the west coast port labor negotiations is another big question mark for the trucking industry the contract between union workers and the ports that handle approximately 45 of u s imports expired july 1 but work has continued during ongoing negotiations the two sides announced a tentative agreement on health care benefits as they continue to work on a deal over compensation automation and other points there were stoppages slowdowns or disruptions during the last three negotiations in 2002 2008 and 2014 before a deal was reached according to the u s chamber of commerce holzgrefe the saia ceo said the threat of disruption is already leading to shifts in the supply chain what we ve seen is our customers other ports or have redirected other parts of the country holzgrefe said to the extent that the port of l a becomes a problem again we feel like we can adjust as our customers need to it ll just be more expensive to operate efficiently the l a long beach negotiations could be a disruptive moment said leathers the werner enterprise ceo there is pent up demand in china that still has to move if they come out of covid lockdown and that could create some congestion and some disruption there s still a yet to be seen effect on the consumer with ongoing impact of inflation

the economic downturn driven by inflation and rising interest rates has battered investment portfolios including those of state and local employee pension funds with markets down about 20 percent this year the overall funding level for government pension systems has fallen back to where it was more than a decade ago the result taxpayers will be asked to contribute more to make up for pension shortfalls an increasingly common outcome over the past 20 years in addition the number of pension systems with asset levels approaching a critical stage has increased and the length of time that troubled systems will take to dig themselves out of their mess has grown again in some states underfunded pensions have become constant sources of fiscal chaos as stock indices rocketed to new highs at the end of 2021 the average funding level of state and local pensions rose to about 85 percent higher than at any time since 2007 according to the consulting firm milliman total debt or unfunded liabilities dropped to about 850 billion the good news however was short lived the recent rapid decline in markets has now pushed funding levels back into the mid 70 percent range and debt has climbed back to 1 3 trillion milliman estimates some critics using more conservative accounting standards typical of the private sector argue that the real debt is much higher even before the market downturn only about 10 percent of state and local government pension systems were fully funded including the wisconsin and south dakota plans that portion has almost certainly decreased what s more troubling is the number of struggling plans that likely have fallen back to funding levels near or even below 50 percent a point at which the cost of a bailout becomes staggering according to milliman at least 21 major public pension systems holding the retirement funds of millions of government employees are now below 60 percent funded including the massive new jersey state funds and those of illinois the funds of both states have less than 40 percent of the money needed to meet future obligations those plans are especially at risk because public retirement systems rely on investment income to supply about 50 percent to 60 percent of the money that governments are promising to workers when a system is only about half funded however it can benefit only so much from a bullish stock market because much of the cash that it should have invested in markets simply doesn t exist this is why so many steeply underfunded pension plans made little progress in improving their funding levels even during the ten year bull market that ended in early 2020 they simply lacked the assets to take full advantage of a good market the public pension crisis which for some funds has lasted more than 20 years has thus become costly for taxpayers and those costs will keep growing in the past two decades local government contributions into employee pension systems have soared to 185 billion from only 38 billion in 2003 that s an annualized rate of increase of more than 8 percent far faster than state and local revenues have grown the staggering increases have helped put pressure on state and local budgets california s state budget boosted its pension contributions from a few hundred million dollars a year of taxpayer money in the early 2000s to 6 7 billion in 2007 by 2017 the state s taxpayers were forced to spend 12 billion a year on pensions after mediocre investment returns that sum blasted to 20 billion in 2018 a more than 18 fold increase over less than two decades illinois s annual pension contributions have now reached 9 billion on a 46 billion state budget and even that s not adequate to reduce the state s debt it s so called actuarially determined contribution that is the level at which deposits into its pension system would begin reducing the debt is a mind boggling 14 billion a year that s nearly a third of the state budget and a sum illinois obviously can t afford on top of that many taxpayers in the prairie state live in municipalities with similar burdens chicago s annual pension contribution is now more than 2 billion new jersey meantime has dedicated more than 1 billion of lottery proceeds that once went to education to its pension system and it needs to contribute another 6 billion out of its taxpayer funds to keep its pension system from collapsing even those numbers however aren t enough to offset the outflow of money every year from the system to retirees as a result new jersey s retirement funds must rely entirely on investment returns to get healthy it s an almost impossible task even in a good market year the returns the system generates are meager because it is so underfunded the strain of trying to finance pensions adequately and reduce retirement debt plagues many states a recent pew study found that even in the economic expansion that preceded the covid pandemic only about half of all states were putting enough money into their pensions annually to reduce their debts the rest either contributed just enough to stop their retirement systems from taking on more debt or in the case of places like new jersey connecticut illinois and texas put too little aside and consequently watched their obligations rise during a bull market part of the problem has been that retirement systems under pressure from critics have been forced to reduce the overly optimistic assumptions many used to justify costly government worker pensions a decade ago the typical public pension system projected that it would average 8 percent returns in the stock market today most pensions have cut that earnings expectation to 7 percent in the process putting more pressure on taxpayers to cover the shortfall but even 7 percent may be too generous the actuarial firm wilshire calculated several years ago that most public pensions averaged just 6 79 percent annually in the previous decade and few market observers expect much better in the coming years thanks to nearly 500 billion in federal stimulus money from president biden s american rescue plan states municipalities and school districts have had plenty of money to spend in this current budget cycle some governors like connecticut s ned lamont and new jersey s phil murphy have boasted that they used surplus dollars to contribute more to their states pensions but bailout plans for deeply indebted retirement systems require such contributions not just for one year but for many for dozens of plans with gaping holes in their balance sheets no quick solution exists especially as biden s stimulus dollars fade and with the latest market downturn the problems just got worse photo â microstockhub istock

truckers will keep rates well above prepandemic levels for the rest of 2022 you ll see rates hold up for the remainder of the year our cost increases are real our customers understand that leathers said we re talking large scale successful winning brands like and many others that know the reliance on their carrier is a competitive advantage they want good quality transportation on time every time safely to do that they work with large well capitalized carriers trucking stocks have been some of the best performers in july while the s p 500 has gained more than 7 this month saia and arcbest are up over 20 while werner enterprises knight swift and jb hunt have increased over 10 earlier this year there were concerns about a freight recession because of falling rates in the so called spot market for trucking according to the most recent data from evercore isi those rates are down more than 11 year over year the spot market provides on demand freight transportation and pricing varies based on supply and demand spot trucking saw a boom at the height of the pandemic as companies adjusted to snarled supply chains and were willing to pay historic rates to transport goods during the e commerce boom however the majority of trucking is still done through contracts with carriers and their customers like large retailers the leading companies in the three major segments of trucking make the majority of revenue from contracts knight swift full truckload fedex less than truckload and jb hunt container shipping have reported double digit rate increases in their most recent earnings we believe the contract rates will hold up we believe contract rates are going to be at a place that is going to allow trucking companies to be remarkably profitable deustche bank transportation analyst amit mehrotra told cnbc he also expects demand to be slightly lower but stable for the rest of 2022 i think the inventory issues that major retailers like target are reporting is more of a reflection of changing buying patterns rather than a significant withdrawal of consumer spending mehrotra said the chief executive of one of the largest trucking brokerages in the united states is also watching consumer spending clearly the trucking market is different today than it was 12 months ago ch robinson ceo bob biesterfield told cnbc s squawk on the street on tuesday he added that retail housing and manufacturing are key drivers of trucking volumes manufacturing has held up the best of those three he added retail saw volume increase in the first quarter and a decline in a second biesterfield said the outcome of the west coast port labor negotiations is another big question mark for the trucking industry the contract between union workers and the ports that handle approximately 45 of u s imports expired july 1 but work has continued during ongoing negotiations the two sides announced a tentative agreement on health care benefits as they continue to work on a deal over compensation automation and other points there were stoppages slowdowns or disruptions during the last three negotiations in 2002 2008 and 2014 before a deal was reached according to the u s chamber of commerce holzgrefe the saia ceo said the threat of disruption is already leading to shifts in the supply chain what we ve seen is our customers other ports or have redirected other parts of the country holzgrefe said to the extent that the port of l a becomes a problem again we feel like we can adjust as our customers need to it ll just be more expensive to operate efficiently the l a long beach negotiations could be a disruptive moment said leathers the werner enterprise ceo there is pent up demand in china that still has to move if they come out of covid lockdown and that could create some congestion and some disruption there s still a yet to be seen effect on the consumer with ongoing impact of inflation

services shrank by 0 9 percent at an annualized rate in the april june quarter according to data from the commerce department thursday the drop came on the heels of last quarter s 1 6 percent decline xinhua liu jie by matthew rusling washington july 28 xinhua the u s economy shrank for the second consecutive quarter meeting the textbook definition of recession but the job market and other economic data remain healthy the u s gross domestic product gdp which refers to the value of all u s produced goods and services shrank by 0 9 percent at an annualized rate in the april june quarter according to data from the commerce department thursday the drop came on the heels of last quarter s 1 6 percent decline two back to back gdp decreases satisfy the technical definition of recession although economists said there are a number of other criteria to consider many sectors and companies are faring remarkably well and some economists said this must also be taken into consideration the gdp drop occurred amid a backdrop of surging inflation and the u s federal reserve s efforts so far unfruitful to control it with the biggest rate hikes in decades there are all too many indications that the fed s anti inflation moves are setting us up for a hard economic landing by year end desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua consumer sentiment is close to a record low as inflation erodes wages the housing market is crumbling due to a doubling of mortgage rates u s exporters are facing strong headwinds as a result of a strong dollar and economic troubles in spots worldwide said lachman a former international monetary fund official risks of a hard landing should be raising serious questions about whether the fed is slamming on the brakes too hard in a bid to contain rapidly rising inflation mike loewengart managing director of investment strategy for e trade said today s reading only adds fuel to the fire that we are in or entering a recession while it is certainly on the negative side of the estimates keep in mind that a 1 percent decrease is relatively small and supports the idea that any recessionary environment will be mild loewengart said as quoted by cnbc but on the flip side much of the economy is doing well at least at the moment the jobless rate stands near record lows of 3 6 percent and employers have added 2 7 million new jobs so far this year the non profit national bureau of economy research emphasizes that more than just gdp determines whether there s an economic downturn that includes unemployment and consumer spending both of which have remained strong over the past six months but if economists agree on one thing it s that the economy is in the midst of much uncertainty inflation stands at a 40 year high of 9 1 percent with the fed aggressively hiking interest rates while trying not to trigger a recession brookings institution senior fellow barry bosworth told xinhua this is not officially a recession it does meet a shorthand measure of two consecutive quarters of negative change but the evidence is not sufficiently widespread particularly employment change to meet the more formal criteria bosworth said certainly the risks of recession have increased but the future pattern of unemployment will be critical for the fed the issue is inflation in coming months they need concrete evidence that it is slowing the gdp release was very much in line with expectations bosworth said in another odd twist u s markets actually rose on the news on thursday after rallying the previous day the dow jones

the u s economy shrank for two consecutive quarters this year increasing speculation that the country could be headed for a recession but does two straight quarters of economic decline mean we re in a recession absolutely not explained christopher thornberg an economist and founding partner of beacon economics this idea that a recession is two quarters of negative growth is completely made up no economist ever said that the commerce department reported thursday that the gross domestic product the broadest gauge of the economy dropped at a 0 9 annual pace from april through june that followed a 1 6 annual drop from january through march but even as the economy shrank over the first half of this year employers added 2 7 million jobs more than in most entire years before the pandemic struck and the unemployment rate has sunk to 3 6 near a half century low robust hiring and exceedingly low unemployment aren t consistent with a recession related recession fears rise after us economy shrinks for second straight quarter by definition a recession is a decline in economic activity usually caused by a loss of confidence on the part of businesses and consumers causing them to pull back on spending and hiring moody s analyst scott hoyt explained consumers are not pulling back and businesses are not pulling back what is a recession traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse in new york the united states june 16 2022 photo by michael nagle xinhua via getty images expand the national bureau of economic research a nonprofit nonpartisan committee decides when the u s is in a recession their definition of a recession involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months our view is that the last six months have not met that definition hoyt said we don t expect the committee to call this a recession but the nber typically doesn t declare a recession until well after one has begun sometimes for six 18 months so it s not real useful data in real time the committee considers trends in hiring as a key measure in determining recessions it also assesses many other data points including gauges of income employment inflation adjusted spending retail sales and factory output it puts heavy weight on jobs and a gauge of inflation adjusted income that excludes government support payments such as social security a recession is a substantial amount of time the economy is underperforming people can t find jobs factories can t find buyers those are signs we re in a recession thornberg said there s no indicator unemployment is down production is at an all time high level this is an economy that continues to operate at maximum level related nearly half of americans will take on debt this year despite higher borrowing costs survey the 1 6 gdo decline from january through march was mostly because of one off factors including a sharp jump in imports and a post holiday season drop in businesses inventories hoyt and other economists expect that when gdp is revised later this year the first quarter may even turn out to be positive the problem is that demand has been flopping all over the place thornberg said when demand is so violently moving around they just can t keep up with where demand is i m seeing it as a coordination problem not a demand problem the bottom line hoyt said is the economy is still growing the biggest misconception is that you can look at one indicator and say from that alone that you re in a recession hoyt said we re not of the view that this will be declared a recession why are people calling it a recession hoyt said the technical recession some people are referring to the two straight quarters of economic loss could come from other countries without a committee that decides when a recession is official recession talks could also be on the rise because many people now feel more financially burdened with wage gains trailing inflation for most people higher prices for such essentials as gas food and rent have eroded americans spending power the pain is being felt disproportionately by lower income and black and hispanic households many of whom are struggling to pay for higher cost essentials like food gas and rent compounding those pressures the federal reserve is jacking up interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s thereby magnifying borrowing costs for homes and cars and credit card purchases related fed hikes interest rate by 0 75 percentage points in bid to curb inflation this week walmart reported that higher gas and food costs have forced its shoppers to reduce their purchases of discretionary spending such as new clothing a clear sign that consumer spending a key driver of the economy is weakening the nation s largest retailer walmart reduced its profit outlook and said it will have to discount more items like furniture and electronics the fed s rate hikes have caused average mortgage rates to double from a year ago to 5 5 causing a sharp fall in home sales and construction it s going to be interesting because almost assuredly you ll start seeing popular pushback against fed policy thornberg said everybody s going to start screaming at the feds you re hurting the economy etc when again they need to stay the course if they back off it s going to extend the problem we have will the u s go into a recession anytime soon photo taken on june 22 2022 shows the u s federal reserve building in washington d c the united states photo by liu jie xinhua via getty images goldman sachs economists predict the fed s rapid rate hikes have raised the likelihood of recession in the next two years to nearly 50 and bank of america economists now forecast a mild recession later this year while deutsche bank expects a recession early next year thornberg said he too has concerns about the economy but they re not about our current craziness it s just that current craziness he said if everything else was fine i d say it s ok the buyers will stabilize and the suppliers will be able to get their efforts coordinated better that s not the issue the issue is that the economy is overstimulated the great recession is the aftermath of what happens when an economy overconsumes for a number of years thornberg continued we have excessive borrowing excessive buying with consumers we ll have to look at what you see is some rough roads ahead no doubt about it but not on the basis of these current coordination problems it s like we re going through some rapids in the stream of expansion we haven t really begun to unwind the disaster they created over the pandemic related us new home sales drop to lowest level in 2 years the clearest signal that a recession is under way economists say would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment in the past an increase in the unemployment rate of three tenths of a percentage point on average over the previous three months has meant that a recession will soon follow many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week which indicates whether layoffs are worsening weekly applications for jobless aid averaged over the past four weeks have risen for eight straight weeks to nearly 250 000 the highest level since last november while that is a potentially concerning sign it is still a low level historically if we were to suffer another shot we could easily go into one but currently there aren t a lot of imbalances in the economy that s one of the things that tends to be a precursor hoyt said businesses and financial institutions appear to be in good financial shape if there were to be a recession it would likely be a relatively mild one because we don t have a lot of imbalances to work out this story was reported from seattle the associated press contributed

earnings season is here with us once again with 21 of s p 500 companies having reported second quarter 2022 earnings according to factset data 68 of s p 500 companies have reported eps above wall street estimates while 65 have beat revenue expectations the energy sector is expected to be the best performer this earnings season thanks to high oil and gas prices massively improving the balance sheets of energy companies the sector is expected to post earnings growth of 265 3 y y far above the s p 500 s blended earnings growth rate of 4 8 at the sub industry level all five energy sub industries are reporting or are predicted to report a year over year increase in earnings of more than 20 with oil gas refining marketing 1 087 integrated oil gas 251 and oil gas exploration

growth rate of 10 9 the energy sector is also beating wall street s revenue expectations by the biggest margin 9 but here s the main kicker according to factset companies that derive more than half of their revenues in foreign markets are soundly outperforming those with minimal international exposure that s a great setup for the u s oil and gas industry because most american supermajors tick this box indeed oil and gas giants exxon mobil nyse xom and chevron nyse cvx are expected to be the largest contributors to earnings growth and revenue growth for s p 500 companies with more international revenue exposure exxon mobil generates 62 of revenues outside the u s while chevron generates 56 of revenues outside the country their contribution to earnings for this category of companies is so large that factset says if they were excluded the blended earnings growth rate for s p 500 companies that generate more than 50 of revenues outside the u s would fall to just 0 5 from 10 2 while the blended revenue growth rate for s p 500 companies that generate more than 50 of revenues outside the u s would fall to 9 1 from 14 6 earnings so far from the european giants in a preview of what is to

buffalo n y wkbw a new report thursday morning offers a less than optimistic view at the short term future of the economy overall the economy shrunk to 0 9 in the second quarter of the year this is the second straight quarter the nation has seen a negative economic growth this often signifies a recession but that has not officially been declared there are some factors that go into what triggers a recession and the impact this can have on people who are trying to make ends meet university at buffalo operations management and strategy clinical assistant professor scott ptak said you don t know that you re in a recession until you re in one there are two very different definitions of a recession that get used in the united states associated press one is the traditional definition which relies on gross domestic product or gdp economists would look for two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth ptak said the definition of that is problematic because it s always backward looking not only is one quarter in negative economic growth insufficient to qualify us for a recession but we wouldn t technically know according to the traditional definition until it has been two consecutive quarters of economic growth the second definition defined by the national bureau of economic research or nber is usually used for laymen terms it is a significant decline in activity that is spread across the economy lasting more than a few months the nber explained this in the case of the february 2020 peak in economic activity the committee concluded that the subsequent drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that even if it proved to be quite brief the downturn should be classified as a recession additionally the federal reserve on wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0 75 point interest rate increase taking its benchmark rate to a range of 2 25 2 5 this is something ptak said is an important factor ptak said interest rates are being raised in order to help stifle demand somewhat in other words to make it more costly for individuals or companies to borrow in order to do things like consume and invest so the days of 0 interest on car loans or 2 5 interest on your mortgages are now over at least for the current period so are we in a recession the answer is technically yes as of thursday morning ptak verified that for 7 news in a zoom interview with pheben kassahun this year s second quarter numbers which were released thursday morning showed gdp fell 0 9 according to the bureau of economic analysis ptak said so according to the us bureau of economic analysis we have in the first quarter a 1 6 decline then in quarter two we have 0 9 decline less of a decline but still a contraction in the economy some are calling it a technical recession because it will not be known for sure until the national bureau of economic research confirms this meanwhile financial experts explained that allowing credit debt to mount up during a recession is not ideal really get a full grasp on how much debt you have and how much you re paying in interest every month consumer of credit counseling service of buffalo inc president and ceo noelle carter said in the best situation start paying down that credit card debt so you re not wasting your income on interest charges carter said it is best to write out a budget of one s monthly expenses to determine what areas can cut down on things that have a little more wiggle room such as clothing or eating out whereas we can t control gas prices or the cost of food carter said while we are in a period where interest rates remain low on savings accounts carter suggests looking into investing in a certificate of deposit account that locks in your savings essentially for a certain period of time six months to a year or 18 months the longer you are committed to stay within the account the greater the return on the interest that you get carter said for more information on how to become financially smart call the consumer of credit counseling service of buffalo inc at 716 712 2060 or visit its website here

the u s economy shrank for two consecutive quarters this year increasing speculation that the country could be headed for a recession but does two straight quarters of economic decline mean we re in a recession absolutely not explained christopher thornberg an economist and founding partner of beacon economics this idea that a recession is two quarters of negative growth is completely made up no economist ever said that the commerce department reported thursday that the gross domestic product the broadest gauge of the economy dropped at a 0 9 annual pace from april through june that followed a 1 6 annual drop from january through march but even as the economy shrank over the first half of this year employers added 2 7 million jobs more than in most entire years before the pandemic struck and the unemployment rate has sunk to 3 6 near a half century low robust hiring and exceedingly low unemployment aren t consistent with a recession related recession fears rise after us economy

the u s is in a recession their definition of a recession involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months our view is that the last six months have not met that definition hoyt said we don t expect the committee to call this a recession but the nber typically doesn t declare a recession until well after one has begun sometimes for six 18 months so it s not real useful data in real time the committee considers trends in hiring as a key measure in determining recessions it also assesses many other data points including gauges of income employment inflation adjusted spending retail sales and factory output it puts heavy weight on jobs and a gauge of inflation adjusted income that excludes government support payments such as social security a recession is a substantial amount of time the economy is underperforming people can t find jobs factories can t find buyers those are signs we re in a recession thornberg said there s no indicator unemployment is down production is at an all time high level this is an economy that continues to operate at maximum level related nearly half of americans will take on debt this year despite higher borrowing costs survey the 1 6 gdo decline from january through march was mostly because of one off factors including a sharp jump in imports and a post holiday season drop in businesses inventories hoyt and other economists expect that when gdp is revised later this year the first quarter may even turn out to be positive the problem is that demand has been flopping all over the place thornberg said when demand is so violently moving around they just can t keep up with where demand is i m seeing it as a coordination problem not a demand problem the bottom line hoyt said is the economy is still growing the biggest misconception is that you can look at one indicator and say from that alone that you re in a recession hoyt said we re not of the view that this will be declared a recession why are people calling it a recession hoyt said the technical recession some people are referring to the two straight quarters of economic loss could come from other countries without a committee that decides when a recession is official recession talks could also be on the rise because many people now feel more financially burdened with wage gains trailing inflation for most people higher prices for such essentials as gas food and rent have eroded americans spending power the pain is being felt disproportionately by lower income and black and hispanic households many of whom are struggling to pay for higher cost essentials like food gas and rent compounding those pressures the federal reserve is jacking up interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s thereby magnifying borrowing costs for homes and cars and credit card purchases related fed hikes interest rate by 0 75 percentage points in bid to curb inflation this week walmart reported that higher gas and food costs have forced its shoppers to reduce their purchases of discretionary spending such as new clothing a clear sign that consumer spending a key driver of the economy is weakening the nation s largest retailer walmart reduced its profit outlook and said it will have to discount more items like furniture and electronics the fed s rate hikes have caused average mortgage rates to double from a year ago to 5 5 causing a sharp fall in home sales and construction it s going to be interesting because almost assuredly you ll start seeing popular pushback against fed policy thornberg said everybody s going to start screaming at the feds you re hurting the economy etc when again they need to stay the course if they back off it s going to extend the problem we have will the u s go into a recession anytime soon photo taken on june 22 2022 shows the u s federal reserve building in washington d c the united states photo by liu jie xinhua via getty images goldman sachs economists predict the fed s rapid rate hikes have raised the likelihood of recession in the next two years to nearly 50 and bank of america economists now forecast a mild recession later this year while deutsche bank expects a recession early next year thornberg said he too has concerns about the economy but they re not about our current craziness it s just that current craziness he said if everything else was fine i d say it s ok the buyers will stabilize and the suppliers will be able to get their efforts coordinated better that s not the issue the issue is that the economy is overstimulated the great recession is the aftermath of what happens when an economy overconsumes for a number of years thornberg continued we have excessive borrowing excessive buying with consumers we ll have to look at what you see is some rough roads ahead no doubt about it but not on the basis of these current coordination problems it s like we re going through some rapids in the stream of expansion we haven t really begun to unwind the disaster they created over the pandemic related us new home sales drop to lowest level in 2 years the clearest signal that a recession is under way economists say would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment in the past an increase in the unemployment rate of three tenths of a percentage point on average over the previous three months has meant that a recession will soon follow many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week which indicates whether layoffs are worsening weekly applications for jobless aid averaged over the past four weeks have risen for eight straight weeks to nearly 250 000 the highest level since last november while that is a potentially concerning sign it is still a low level historically if we were to suffer another shot we could easily go into one but currently there aren t a lot of imbalances in the economy that s one of the things that tends to be a precursor hoyt said businesses and financial institutions appear to be in good financial shape if there were to be a recession it would likely be a relatively mild one because we don t have a lot of imbalances to work out this story was reported from seattle the associated press contributed

travels between paris and tokyo aka the rudevc he is the managing partner of shizen capital formerly known as tachi ai ventures in japan you can read more on his blog at or follow him markbivens the japanese translation of this article is available here hurricane sandy hits massachusetts a public domain image photo by marilee caliendo fema via picryl i m a vc guy not a pe guy so when i start opining about private equity readers should grant my words a tepid reception yet i am observing a phenomenon here on the ground in japan that i thought might be relevant to share let s start with recapping the current macroeconomic backdrop a context upon which numerous experts both armchair and real have weighed in massive runaway inflation has taken root in most developed economies at last print cpi a core measure of inflation in the u s ticked up to 8 6 governments and particularly central banks whose core mandate is to keep inflation under control have found themselves behind the curve as a result the u s federal reserve bank followed not far behind by the european central bank and the bank of england have shifted to a steady diet of interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening sending asset prices plummeting with seemingly no asset class immune equities real estate crypto assets you name it the one glaring exception to all this within the g7 countries is japan in japan depending on how broad a basket you take cpi inflation has risen to only 2 5 and if stripping out food and energy from the calculation inflation in japan currently sits at a mere 0 3 20x lower than the comparable measure in the u s accordingly the bank of japan has maintained its policy of yield curve control effectively capping yields on 10 year government bonds to 25 basis points the impact of course of this stark disparity i e with other countries hiking rates and tightening while japan maintains low rates has manifested itself in a drastic jpy devaluation to a 20 year low as i ve written about before in light of the yen s tumble there has been some speculation in the markets that the boj will relent on its yield curve control policy in order to bolster its currency however consensus here in tokyo seems to be that as long as inflation in japan does not get out of hand it s unlikely that the boj would do anything else but stay the course furthermore boj governor kuroda san s final mandate ends next spring the likelihood of him implementing a radical policy shift in the final nine months of his mandate appears low so this brings me back to the topic of private equity when executed successfully private equity transactions can generate value creation in up to three different ways vcs like to joke that there are only three but i ll resist the temptation here operational efficiencies multiple expansion leverage operational efficiencies can result from restructuring divestment of underperforming assets unlocking cost savings bolt on acquisitions realignment of management incentives are among other expertise that pe firms can bring to a company once they take control multiple expansion means positioning a company to justify higher ev s and ev ebitda multiples enterprise value sales enterprise value ebitda respectively higher multiples can be attained via both internal actions such as enhanced strategic focus improved corporate governance and external factors such as investing in a sector which is growing or coming back into favor leverage means using a significant portion of debt to acquire the target company in the pe buyout a typical leveraged buyout of a company for say 100 million might entail 30 million of equity from the pe fund and 70 million of debt from lenders as you can imagine combining two or all three above factors can exponentially enhance the financial return profile of the investment let s say that the aforementioned 100 million company is valued at a multiple of 5x ebitda ebitda 100m 5 20m the transaction is financed with 30m from the pe fund and 70m in outside debt if the pe firm through operational efficiencies is able to increase ebitda from 20m to 30m and in parallel is able to justify that the company thanks to its improved strategic focus and sectorial growth justifies an ev ebitda multiple of 7 rather than 5 the enterprise value of the company becomes 210 million if the pe fund can find a buyer for the company at this price it will generate a return on its invested capital of 4 67x 210m 70m debt 30m when viewing japan through the lens of the above three factors for private equity value creation the market here looks pretty attractive without naming names it s no secret that many incumbent corporations carry underperforming business lines on their books and hence offer some opportunities ripe for restructuring which in turn could unlock operational efficiencies additionally japan s new esg compliance requirements are forcing some companies to restructure and in certain cases even carve out business units regarding the principle of multiple expansion ev ebitda multiples are moving in quite the opposite direction worldwide as rising rates depress asset prices yet i would submit that such forces of multiple compression run deeper in the u s and europe right now than what we are witnessing in japan however thanks to its low interest rate environment debt financing in japan remains a relative bargain compared to the rest of the world the opportunity to structure buyout transactions with inexpensive leverage is where japan really shines on these vectors for private equity value creation moreover the perception in japan of the business of private equity even of foreign funds has been gradually improving in the eyes of foreign pe funds the japanese market represents a reliable beacon of security and rule of law upon admittedly superficial analysis it stands to reason that japan should represent an appealing market for global pe funds in the current environment we re already witnessing some evidence of movement at the start of the latest annual shareholding meeting season a record 77 companies faced proposals from stock owners many of them foreign funds in march sweden s eqt acquired bering private equity asia with stated expansion plans for japan the potential imminent 20 billion buyout of toshiba would serve as a bellwether whether these data points portend a broader trend remains to be seen but if they do this could result in increased competition for japan s domestic pe firms unlike venture deals in which vc firms often invest collaboratively as syndicates private equity is more of a solo sport an informal survey suggests to me that they are not alarmed perhaps i m straying too far out of my lane here but because i enjoy these hypothetical thought experiments here s my unsolicited and probably unwelcome advice to japan s domestic pe firms build relationships upstream i e with venture capital funds in japan the market here still remains quite opaque to foreigners at the venture stage so you have an inherent competitive advantage by being on the ground granted not all venture companies grow into private equity targets but high growth firms in some sectors often do such as in enterprise saas or alternatively can serve as complementary targets for pe build up strategies building such relationships today will

are victoria s resellers gentrifying thrift stores photo by melody powers photo by melody powers at 9 a m the heavy metal doors start to open slowly the once joking men stop their conversations and start to pile into value village the door greeter sanitizes each of their hands before they sprint off in every direction the fluorescent lights beam down employees stand off to the sides and the aisles of clothes have been restocked with hidden gems waiting to be discovered julio martelino darts towards the men s sweater section he scans each rack like it s a competition because it is he spends a maximum of 30 seconds on each rack before heading on to the next picking up items as he goes he runs to the next aisle and does the same the metal screech of hangers dragging across the racks echoes throughout the building he passes his friends now competitors in the aisles they yell out to each other about their finds but do not stop to talk after 15 minutes of frantic activity the entire store starts to settle the employees come out from the sidelines martelino heads to the shoe section and finds his 16 year old friend jake holding a pair of ravenclaw doc martin rip offs jake makes a joke about how ugly the pair of shoes is as martelino displays his finds oliver coyle martelino s friend and business partner comes over the friends discuss their finds debating which to keep and which to put back they analyze every detail of the clothing the colour of the tags the cuffs of sweaters measurements and they google how much the items would cost on resale websites such as grailed and depop this race in value village is the everyday morning of a clothing reseller since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 thrift shopping has hit an all time high according to reporting by the globe and mail 36 2 million people shopped second hand for the first time that year compared to 16 4 million in previous years with this rise in second hand shopping there has also been an increase in people reselling clothes to make a profit on the side and people making full careers out of it while many see thrifting as a sustainable approach to fashion some advocates argue that thrifting and reselling are gentrifying thrift stores and taking clothes away from people in need growing up thrifting as a kid uvic student joelene brewer spent most sundays hitting garage sales with her father for brewer this was not only a fun sunday hobby for her and her family but also a necessity as it is for many other canadians who cannot afford everyday items growing up we always thrifted pretty much anything that could be second hand brewer says wearing a cropped ac dc shirt and a long yellow skirt both items thrifted raised in a family of five during the 2008 recession brewer and her family shopped at stores like value village for clothes they also scanned neighbourhoods for pieces of furniture on the side of the road that they could repair and repurpose brewer remembers being 12 and endlessly scanning the racks of value village looking for popular name brand clothes and trying to find the perfect outfit so she could avoid being outcast by her peers i remember feeling a little bit of shame and embarrassment being younger and thrift shopping she says i would be thrift shopping and i like i visibly don t have the money brewer recalls that she wished she could have shopped in malls and bought name brand clothing like her classmates but in 2018 she got a job at a popular thrift store in langley called talize and that s when her views on thrift stores started to shift the year that i started working at the thrift store i transferred schools to a fine arts school she says there were a lot of wealthy kids that went to this school and i remember feeling kind of shocked that i would see so many of these people repeatedly at the thrift store second hand reselling has also grown in popularity as apps like depop poshmark grailed and even instagram make it accessible to buy second hand clothing in the comfort of your own home even brewer admits to having sold a few vintage finds for a little extra cash i think a lot of people don t know that an item will get recycled if it s not sold brewer says i don t feel too guilty buying something second hand and reselling it if i know that it can be recycled and then no one gets to have it as reselling and thrift shopping have become popular arguments claiming that thrifting and reselling are gentrifying thrift stores are also rising leaving many people to question the ethics of second hand shopping and reselling objectively i think it s something we should all be moving towards in an environmental way says brewer i don t think that people moving towards thrifting alone is what made thrifting so expensive these stores know they can charge people more because there s more people buying eliciting hate comments vlogs called thrift hauls or come thrift with me videos where teenagers and young adults film themselves thrift shopping circulate throughout tiktok and other social media these kinds of videos can gain around 100 000 to even millions of views but arguments that flare in the comment sections aren t all favourable hate comments like god i hate people like you or you re one of those people are becoming common on popular thrifting vlogs and can gain thousands of likes these comments are emerging after online arguments claim that the rise of thrifting and resellers are gentrifying thrift stores and making it harder for lower income folks to find good clothes for cheap the other half of the argument is in favour of thrifting and resellers previously the martlet reported that fashion is responsible for nearly 20 per cent of global wastewater and 10 per cent of global carbon emissions the negative effects of the fast fashion industry have motivated people to turn to thrifting as a sustainable alternative these conflicting arguments raise the question is the rise of thrifting taking away from lower income individuals or is it a solution to the environmental devastation of fast fashion value village thrift store photo by melody powers value village thrift store photo by melody powers the history of thrifting thrift stores in america started in the late 19th century during the industrial revolution during this time there was an introduction of mass clothing production according to a 2018 article from time clothes started to get more affordable and more disposable triggering the creation of consignment stores as a way to recycle clothing that was tossed away in canada thrift stores started to gain popularity in the 1980s by the 90s thrift stores had started to open up in malls according to cbc but in 2020 the second hand market really started to boom with the market reaching a record high of 35 billion in 2021 it s expected to double reaching 82 billion by 2026 according to thredup s 2022 resale report other than the rise of tiktoks thrifting has become popular among millennial and gen z generations as a way to stop supporting the fast fashion industry fast fashion is known for its unethical treatment of workers with 170 million children estimated to be engaged in child labour the argument against the rise of thrifting and reselling comes down to the idea that people who are buying clothes at thrift store prices and reselling them to make a profit are reducing the already limited options for people who need them thrift stores were created to serve the lower income community but the popularity of thrifting is dramatically increasing foot traffic and potentially increasing the prices at thrift stores dr marlea clarke a uvic associate professor studying labour and environmental consequences of fast fashion says this isn t necessarily true have more clothes than they can sell clarke says so far the trend of and reselling them is not reducing the stock that second hand stores have to then sell according to a 2018 article from cbc only half of the donations to thrift stores such as the salvation army end up on the racks and only half of that is sold this means only 25 per cent of donated clothing is sold in thrift stores the rest of the clothes are either sold to different countries or sent to recycling warehouses where it s either made into rags or sent to landfills for gentrification of thrift stores i m not sure i m seeing it continues clarke it s extremely unlikely that now or in the next five years we re going to see rising prices in second hand thrift stores so much so that lower income folks won t be able to go into thrift stores and still buy clothes non profit thrift stores such as the salvation army aren t seeing a major difference since the rise of thrifting and reselling either i haven t noticed any change in the amount of clothing being sold the prices remain consistent throughout says lisa the manager at a local salvation army for local non profit organizations there are options for people who need to get the clothing they deserve and an endless supply of clothing to choose from according to their annual 2020 2021 impact report the salvation army provided just over 11 400 vouchers to people in need across canada free of charge we put out about 600 units every day of the week six days a week says lisa there s always an ample selection for every demographic and every income level that comes into the store there s always enough for everyone to go around another argument that people against resellers are making online comes down to the prices people are selling their thrift finds for a reseller can find a 5 or 10 shirt on the racks of thrift stores and depending on the shirt can resell it for 100 or even 200 in some rare instances vintage shirts can even sell for 6 000 as a vintage aladdin shirt did in 2020 if can buy old clothes from a vintage store and sell them online for a whole bunch more well that s them being entrepreneurs clarke says for some people paying hundreds to even a thousand dollars is worth it to gain another piece for their collection it s kind of that people pay so much money for certain clothes says martelino but that s with everything even some stamps can go for a lot or baseball cards that are really rare vintage shirts photo by melody powers inside the life of vintage resellers martelino sits down at a local coffee shop wearing a vintage 90s nike shirt a jacket he made from old recycled carhartt pants with a matching handmade carhartt tote bag martelino is a 26 year old uvic chemistry graduate and a vintage reseller in victoria for the past year martelino has dedicated his time to thrifting and reselling his instagram julios yard is ever growing gaining over a thousand followers within the span of a year his feed is filled with vintage sweaters and shirts he found at local thrift stores like value village and salvation army his tiktok is splattered with videos of thrift hauls some gaining over 300 000 views but martelino didn t always know he wanted to be a vintage reseller i was working at a thrift store towards the end of my degree at uvic says martelino i started reselling the clothes i was buying at the thrift store and i started making more money reselling the clothes than i did working in 2019 martelino graduated from uvic with plans of attending school for dentistry but in 2021 he had to make the decision to either continue school or quit everything and pursue a career in reselling at the end of the day i decided to do says martelino since pursuing a career in reselling martelino has made this his full time job making just enough to live off of it s really hit or miss right now though it s kind of stressful after only a year of reselling clothes martelino opened a consignment clothing store in downtown victoria with another popular reseller oliver coyle their store is called second degree vintage an inside joke to the owners as they were both uvic science graduates julio martelino and business partner oliver coyle at their store second degree vintage photo by melody powers julio martelino and business partner oliver coyle at their store second degree vintage photo by melody powers since growing his business martelino has seen the online arguments against resellers like him i m just trying to survive martelino says i m not rich by any means i could probably make around the poverty line just from reselling we re particular in what we pick we only take certain things there s still so much more for other people to take the future of second hand back at value village another thrifting day is about to begin a group of men stand around outside of the building half an hour before the doors open the victoria rain sprinkles down on them they re protected by their thrifted arc teryx raincoats the lineup is broken up into different groups of resellers martelino stands around in a circle with other clothing resellers and his personal friends they re all laughing and making jokes with one another half the reason we come here so early is to talk about thrifting jake another victoria reseller says it s a nice social thing says martelino but even though the rise of thrift shopping is keeping more unwanted clothing out of the landfills there hasn t been a real decrease in clothing consumption in the fast fashion industry the negative part of is it s not making a real dent on the consumption of new clothes says clarke we re not seeing a parallel decrease in consumption of new clothes at the same time we re seeing an increase consumption of second hand clothes even though reselling and thrifting hasn t made a dent in overall consumption it is creating jobs for young entrepreneurs like martelino and many other local resellers here in victoria it doesn t feel like a lot says martelino at least i m starting my own business last name omitted to protect identity

sit writing this review the scent of rich lamb stew wafts through my house it s the final gift from a night spent at the hotel bellinzona in hepburn springs where the lamb for two 95 could easily feed four or five as a result we were able to bring home more than half of the falling from the bone lamb shoulder pop it in a pot with some stock and white beans and a tin of good tomatoes and continue to enjoy the warming goodness of our meal for days afterwards at this time of year everything about bellinzona feels warm the 119 year old historic hotel just up the street from the town s famous bathhouse has undergone an extensive renovation in recent years reviving its 43 room accommodation and also its two restaurants the virgin which is a breakfast and lunch cafe and the oxford dining room referred to now simply as the dining room when you enter the hotel the wide lobby is filled with inviting leather chairs and couches logs burn in open fireplaces and a lobby bar serves up cocktails and more it s a dream of a place a fantasy of a cosy winter escape and maybe best of all despite the luxe outfit this still feels like a hotel in regional australia rather than a schmick replica of city life advertisement lamb shoulder with almond sauce anchovy parmesan and pine nuts bonnie savage i was touched of all things by the plaid carpet that runs through the whole property a style choice that feels wholly appropriate for a country pub the property was bought by tony demarco and theresa albioli in 2019 and the couple brought in theresa s son julian albioli to help run it julian had trained at movida before moving to new york where he worked for years after six months of renovations numerous lockdowns thwarted opening plans but the hotel launched late last year and the dining room opened this june with julian albioli manager tim foster and a dedicated kitchen team collaborating on the menu the 60 seat restaurant is fitted out in full belle epoque glory all gilded mirrors and nude statues there s so much boob related art on the property it s practically a theme it s grand enough to feel worthy of a special occasion but the vibe and style of service are relaxed enough to make almost anyone feel comfortable individual servings of kingfish bonnie savage advertisement the kitchen team has a cooking style that s perfect for the venue sitting securely between creativity and comfort the menu has a selection of bite sized appetisers such as a thick sliver of raw kingfish 5 firm and sweet and buttery served with fennel citrus and pepperberry or croquettes 10 for 2 made with mushroom and smoked scamorza cheese and served with leek ash aioli a kingfish collar 23 is marinated grilled leaving it meaty and tender and topped with a salsa verde that s packed with herby vegetal goodness morcilla 19 here rendered as a thoroughly spiced black pudding comes with a cooling and tangy sauce gribiche and a radish salad for freshness and snap kingfish collar covered in salsa verde bonnie savage the main courses tend to be hearty and rich especially at this time of year duck breast 48 comes with sweet potatoes and pickled pine mushrooms a study of pinks and oranges and reds while the pork belly 42 has a vaguely germanic vibe with celeriac puree charred cabbage and a cider gastrique advertisement that lamb shoulder though is a thing of glory served over a creamy almond sauce and with anchovy parmesan and pine nuts setting off the juicy meat beautifully it s a dish worthy of a winter feast to be washed down with buckets of wine and good cheer speaking of wine the list is approachable and varied and the competent staff know it back to front morcilla with sauce gribiche and radish salad bonnie savage i often worry about regional australia and the change that s inevitably coming to these small towns what will that change look like will every hotel end up feeling like melbourne every cafe like a slice of fitzroy a look at the boutiques of daylesford might give you that impression this part of the state has long been a destination for moneyed melburnians so it s not exactly gentrification i fret over as much as the region losing its inherent and unique charm in favour of something more global and trendy the dining room at hotel bellinzona is a lovely example of the middle ground a place that has modernised just enough without giving up its integral appeal if winter has you down i suggest a trek out this way to remind you of the restorative power of a warm country meal in a beautiful and historic room advertisement vibe

closely related to these are the hopeful who grasp at the smallest signs that things are turning their way their favourite stocks have bottomed the macro environment is starting to change there s light at the end of the tunnel next come the humbled they ve had a shocker they know where they went wrong and they won t make the same mistake again and finally there s the smug they ve beaten the market and they re determined to tell you in graphic detail why they were so damn right typically with lots of graphs though they often omit that their strong year comes after a decade of underperformance these are of course wild generalisations except for the bit about graphs fundies love graphs and charts in all forms but for all the insights in these letters what you won t find is any admission that backing a fund manager is generally a losing proposition the common thread advertisement last month bank of america s sydney based quant guru nigel tupper published research in which he analysed 2000 funds managing us12 trillion 17 trillion and found only 32 per cent of active funds outperformed their benchmark in the 2021 financial year only 33 per cent outperformed over the past five years to explain these struggles tupper and his team came up with a list of 10 key reasons the thread linking many of these factors can be summed up like this markets change but investors rarely do at the top of tupper s list is the fact that many investors make incorrect assumptions about how alpha that is above market returns are generated the best example of this is deep value investing where a manager looks for unloved stocks whose qualities will eventually be appreciated by investors value outperformed for the best part of two decades during the 1990s and 2000s but investors who assumed it couldn t lose were badly stung in the 2010s advertisement linked to this is what tupper calls static allocation for example an investor may buy quality stocks that are inexpensive and never deviate but he says investment strategies that always consistently outperform are almost impossible to find and underperformance is inevitable growth managers would be the perfect example right now tupper also says a bottom up approach on its own that is focusing just on picking stocks without considering the broader market environment can get caught on the wrong side of style rotation which can be dramatic at times the rotation to growth in the fomo market of 2020 for example delivered massive returns no value manager could hope to match bank of america s 10 reasons investors underperform incorrect assumptions about alpha generation assumptions about how markets react to events static allocation focus on bottom up alone risk aversion in an upturn unintended exposures extrapolating investment lessons from the united states basis risk holding cash transaction costs risk aversion is another issue again this is about refusing to acknowledge that markets go through cycles advertisement many investors are not willing to add enough cyclicality to a portfolio in an upturn investors often prefer to remain in quality and underperform than have exposure to lower quality cyclicals and outperform in upturns tupper says he also argues investors don t think enough about the unintended exposures in their portfolio most focus on the stocks sectors and countries they are exposed to but ignore exposure to style the cycle interest rates bond yields currency oil commodities beta allocation sentiment news positioning products geographic revenue and more duration exposure that is the sensitivity of stocks to movements in discount rates is almost always ignored two drivers of underperformance that tupper highlights feel particularly important right now one is extrapolating investment lessons from the us which he says risks missing important differences in the structure dynamics and characteristics of individual markets not a mistake you would think investors in australia s resource and bank heavy markets would make advertisement the second is incorrect assumptions about how markets react to events assuming stocks fall when rates rise is a good example tupper says global equities actually rise an average of 9 2 per cent in the 12 months after the fed raises rates though clearly not this time around tupper s final three sources of underperformance are more technical basis risk stems from the fact investors who avoid some stocks in an index for some reason they re not liquid enough or not green enough can be caught out when those stocks are in favour the recent bull run for energy stocks is a good example finally there are two things that fund managers must do that immediately puts them behind sharemarket indices hold cash for redemptions and pay transaction costs tupper s list arguably ignores the realities of investing with fund managers for example many investors spread their risk across multiple managers and so a period of underperformance from one fundie is countered by strong performance at another these investors may want their fundies to stay true to their chosen style further the value proposition of many fund managers is built on their expertise or experience in specific areas of the market advertisement but tupper s research should get investors thinking about the way the markets and ahem the media place value on the idea of conviction we tend to lionise managers whose specific investment process and worldview delivers success even if the data and our own experience tells us this manager can t be right in all market conditions and we tend to look down on those whose style drifts would we be better off backing managers who are more open minded and more willing to think about how a broader package of factors stock selection market cycles the macro environment affect returns conviction is easy to sell one local manager says but if you get it wrong it can be super dangerous unfortunately a lot of funds are very driven by selling a message and a process
the u s economy shrank from april through june for a second straight quarter contracting at a 0 9 annual pace and raising fears that the nation may be approaching a recession the decline that the commerce department reported thursday in the gross domestic product the broadest gauge of the economy followed a 1 6 annual drop from january through march consecutive quarters of falling gdp constitute one informal though not definitive an indicator of a recession while most economists say this means we re in a recession the national bureau of economic research nber makes the final call on whether the us is officially in a recession but does that matter if consumer confidence and economic sentiment are muted the mindset of the average american matters and certain metrics like the inflation increase of 9 1 year over year is an indicator that in basic terms it just means that it s more expensive to buy what you need and want people feel that and make changes as big tech companies miss earning marks and the fed raises interest rates the employment rate is at 3 6 officially we are not in a recession because of course the national bureau of economic research has got their dating committee that essentially decides if we re in a recession or not and they do it retrospectively in some respects this is a debate over semantics that really doesn t matter because the truth of the matter is you ve got recessions and then you ve got recessions said dr michael greiner from oakland university consumer spending has slowed slightly and home construction was down 14 percent year over year stocks rallied despite the negative gdp news suggesting perhaps economic conditions could be much worse people seem to be holding onto their money a little bit more and are getting a little bit more concerned about the economy and their jobs and what s going to happen in the long run the truth of the matter is that s what the fed wants they re trying to get people to hold back on their spending a little bit because that s what reduces the demand and then enables inflation to stabilize a little bit greiner said president biden fed chair jerome powell and treasury secretary janet yellen have all towed the party line saying the us is not in a recession the labor market remains exceptionally strong that is not what we see in past episodes that the nber has labeled to be a recession yellen said
all investors dream of finding stocks that rise tenfold or even 20 fold these ten baggers and 20 baggers typically produce their spectacular gains over a period of five to 15 years the term ten bagger was coined by peter lynch who managed the magellan fund from 1977 to 1990 over this period his fund turned a 1 000 investment into 28 000 to achieve this excellent performance he invested in many companies whose share prices grew by between ten and 30 times or more during that 13 year period multi baggers needn t produce their stellar gains immediately lynch cites walmart as an example of a company that went public in 1970 and went on to appreciate 30 fold after 1980 walmart shares rose tenfold from 1972 to 1982 then climbed from 0 38 in june 1982 to 10 80 in march 1993 an increase of 28 times in less than 11 years or 284 times in 21 years the shares hit 43 40 in december 1999 but only reached that level again in june 2008 the record high of 160 was in april of this year but the shares have been selling for 130 recently subscribe to moneyweek subscribe to moneyweek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely free get 6 issues free sign up to money morning don t

analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up this price history shows that a ten bagger can go on to increase by another ten 20 or even 30 times there may also come a point when the shares flatline or fall for several years or merely yield steady unspectacular growth it is therefore all too easy for an investor to sell too early and miss out on a further tenfold growth spurt or to hang on too long and lose some of the initial gains it is important to check whether a company s initially successful business model for profitable growth is still working amazon provides another cautionary tale for those inclined to sell out after a nasty slide the shares rose from 0 08 in june 1997 to 4 70 in december 1999 to make it a 58 bagger in under three years but then collapsed as the dotcom bubble burst reaching 0 36 in november 2001 they then rose to 3 60 in mid 2007 a ten bagger in under six years but powered on to a high of 186 in july 2021 a 52 fold increase in those 14 years they are now around 115 amazon s business model was stronger than most dotcom companies and it both broadened its product range and entered cloud computing via aws amazon web services to ensure continued profitable growth my best multi bagger stocks two of my early ten baggers were uk engineering companies halma and renishaw i invested in halma a safety specialist with products ranging from air pollution gauges to eye health monitors at 112p in 2002 it became a ten bagger in may 2017 and a 20 bagger three years later had i invested at the market nadir in march 2009 when halma shares had dropped to 1 556p they would have reached ten bagger status by march 2019 just a decade rather than the 14 15 years it took for me that highlights two more key points the advantage of investing at a stockmarket low and the importance of sitting tight when there is an economic crisis as opposed to a problem with the company itself i invested in renishaw which makes high precision measuring and calibration equipment at 344p in mid 2002 the shares reached 3 440p a ten bagger in may 2017 and 16 bagger status in january 2018 again had i invested in renishaw at 258p in march 2009 at the time of the financial crisis it would have become a ten bagger in just under six years by february 2015 an additional fillip from dividends halma also illustrates the substantial income that can be derived from a more mature multi bagger halma has a 43 year record of raising its dividend by 5 or more every year however since the share price has also risen the yield for those buying today is only 0 9 at the recent price of 2 144p but those who bought halma at 112p in 2002 as i did received a 2022 dividend of 18 88p per share that translates to a yield of 16 9 on their original investment several us technology stocks have become multi baggers one example is alphabet google s parent company which rose tenfold between december 2008 and january 2020 and then powered on to become a 20 bagger by october 2021 another is salesforce the market leader in software for customer relationship management it had become a 20 bagger by january 2018 and a 30 bagger in january 2020 a third us example is intuitive surgical the leading robotic surgery company whose shares rose 18 fold between march 2009 and september 2018 mcdonald s meanwhile is an excellent example of a us dividend paying stock that became a 16 bagger in the 16 years to 2019 the annual dividend is now 5 52 implying a 43 yield on a 2003 investment the odds are better in britain a study by schroders of the decade to the end of december 2021 revealed surprisingly that uk stocks had a higher chance than their us counterparts of becoming ten baggers over the last decade taking only stocks with a market value over 150m there were 63 out of 915 uk stocks 6 9 that became ten baggers compared with 257 out of 4 515 us stocks 5 7 uk examples included the retailer jd sports ocado analytics business yougov industrial equipment hire firm ashtead halma and rentokil the fact that only 6 or 7 of stocks become ten baggers or better explains the observation that most of the growth in market indices such as the s p500 or nasdaq can be explained by the outperformance of a small number of stocks the schroder study found that expanding profit margins and sales growth were the largest drivers of shareholder returns useful indicators for investors eyeing up potential multi bagging stocks the key attributes of multi bagger stocks these high flying companies tend to display some or all of the following characteristics one is a so called wide moat something that provides a sustainable competitive advantage to defend it against potential rivals seeking to enter the market without a moat a growing profitable market will attract other companies offering very similar products or services and this added competition will drive down margins and slow the growth of the first entrant moats can be based on innovative and patented new products that satisfy important customer needs recognisable and trusted brands or a cost advantage from favoured access to low cost materials or from economies of scale another possibility is switching costs would customers incur a lot of cost and hassle in changing to a competitor finally government regulatory approvals can also comprise a moat we will look at examples of these five types of moat renishaw the precision metrology company is an excellent example of a company whose moat is based on innovative and patented new products it has long invested twice the proportion of sales into research and development r d typical of its sector electronic and electrical engineering this r d is focused on patentable inventions used to come up with a stream of new and improved metrology products that are essential for its manufacturing customers in a wide range of industries the power of top brands diageo is a good example of the power of a company with highly recognisable brands such as johnnie walker and lagavulin whisky gordon s gin captain morgan rum guinness and many others customers will pay extra for top notch labels alphabet boasts a very recognisable brand google with a dominant market share of online advertising coca cola s wide moat is based on both a cost advantage which it achieves through sheer scale and a highly recognisable brand stemming from a proprietary formulation of the soft drink i remember years ago buying quarry floor tiles from a uk family company whose cost advantage was a source of low cost materials they owned their own quarry with high quality clay that made excellent crack resistant floor tiles salesforce s moat is based on switching costs as well as innovative products salesforce started with customer relationship management software in 2000 and was the first company to deliver its software conveniently over the internet and charge a subscription software as a service or saas was an innovation salesforce offers a wide array of different saas software products and customers would find it both costly and onerous to change supplier indeed there here is no point in doing so as salesforce has a wide range of excellent offerings government regulations on safety provide a moat for pharmaceutical and medical device companies since a new drug for instance has to go through three stages of clinical trials and an approval process before gaining marketing authorisation this regulatory approval process coupled with patents provides wide moats for novel drugs and medical devices in addition to a wide moat ten baggers often boast innovative new products and a strong position in a growth market with sufficient finance to enable the company to expand quickly renishaw is again a good example with its innovative patented products yielding a healthy profit stream enabling the firm to invest in r d and expansion while maintaining a cash balance and paying dividends what can go wrong these stellar stocks sometimes come unstuck several companies have reached ten bagger status but then run into problems that cause the share price to fall sharply or stop rising this can sometimes be due to a major problem with a product as happened with boeing the shares rose from a low of 33 40 in march 2009 to achieve ten bagger status in january 2018 they then reached a high of 440 60 in february 2019 just before the second 737 max crash in march 2019 add in the covid 19 pandemic and associated drop in air travel and the shares fell 78 to 95 in march 2020 questions about a company s accounts whether ultimately validated or not can also be a large setback burford capital the world s largest commercial litigation funding specialist became a ten bagger in just over three years and a 20 bagger in six but in august 2019 it became a target of the us short seller muddy waters which queried burford s accounting practices in particular the valuation of ongoing cases burford s shares fell from 1 600p in july 2019 to 700p a month later and 313p in march 2020 the company has defended its accounting and its shares have recovered to 900p now but remain still some way below their highs changes in a growth market can also undermine investors expectations fever tree drinks saw growing sales of its novel mixer drinks propel the share price from 175p in december 2014 to 3 863p in september 2018 to make it a 22 bagger in under four years but fears about flattening demand for its pricey mixers caused the share price to drop back to 2 149p in december 2018 and 935p in march 2020 the shares are now around 920p having fallen this year on fears of cost increases eating into margins overall key warning signs to look for in a potential or actual ten bagger include weakness in the company s moat including the threat of disruptive technology weakness in sales growth and or margins accounting irregularities problems with a major product and a large or unrelated acquisition in a worst case scenario one must be alert for outright fraud us energy firm enron was a high flier rising from a single digit share price in the late 1980s to a high of 91 in mid 2000 but then tumbled to less than 1 by november 2001 as it became clear that management was cooking the books the company filed for bankruptcy in december 2001 benefiting from bolt on acquisitions big or unrelated purchases can be warning signs for a multi bagger or a company that might become one however a number of multi baggers have used bolt on acquisitions to enhance their technology or market position or build a new and related division one example is halma the 20 bagger halma acquires related companies that have global niches in markets with long term growth drivers it has acquired more than 50 companies and disposed of several others whose growth had slackened another uk example is judges scientific which has put together a portfolio of scientific and testing instrument companies the shares rose from 64p in february 2009 to 2 375p in march 2014 to make it a 37 bagger in five years the shares then fell and only reached 2 375p again in april 2018 before rising almost another four times to a high of 8 640p in october 2021 multi baggers are fairly rare as the schroder s study shows among companies with a market capitalisation of more than 150m 7 of uk stocks and 6 of us stocks fit the bill that s why peter lynch s magellan portfolio contained up to 1 400 stocks so he could be confident of having a good number of multi baggers that s far too many stocks for a private investor but you do need a portfolio of a reasonable size to raise your chances of having a few really successful ones to boost your odds further look for companies with a wide moat innovative technology or products a strong position in a growth market and sufficient finance and cash flow to maintain high growth signs that these conditions are being met include strong sales growth and high and increasing margins it is sometimes possible to identify a multi bagger because it is following a similar business model to a previously successful one for example sdi is a digital imaging sensors and controls specialist with some similarities to judges scientific the 37 bagger highlighted earlier both companies have made a number of bolt on acquisitions sdi s shares rose from 9p in september 2015 to 215p in november 2021 making it a 24 bagger in six years sdi was my tip of the year in december 2020 at 104p it had more than doubled to 217p by november 2021 had i spotted it in march 2020 at 40p the gain would have been more than five times what to look for now i am not going to give hostages to fortune by listing potential multi baggers but you should select companies that are already showing sales growth with good margins thanks to a sustainable business model make sure you understand why the company has a wide moat check that it has a strong position in a growing market and generates sufficient cash to be able to continue its high growth rate monitor its results news and trading updates carefully for any signs that may indicate a change in its successful formula such as slackening sales growth or shrinking margins but do not be misled by a company s share price falling owing to a general retreat in share prices the financial crisis of 2008 2009 provided an excellent buying opportunity for shares in potential multi baggers and if you hold one that has matured to a steady growth stage but pays increasing dividends consider hanging onto it for the double digit yield it gives on your original investment happy hunting

food items in the whole fair to feature an unfried vegetable we love a healthy option vegan nachos state fairs aren t always the friendliest places for our vegan friends looking for a bite to eat black leaf vegan made history last year when they brought the very first all vegan food truck to the indiana state fair entered in the taste of the fair competition this year are their vegan nachos

brownies deep fried cheese stick and a peach shakeup what to make this year as a follow up to their success was something gidget hall owner of r w concessions began thinking about as soon as they won it s what i do all winter long is see what i m going to do next year i look at different food channels and different places that i go to shop i look for things to deep fry hall said the deep fried brownie is a worthy successor to last year s treat the brownie is dipped in funnel cake batter drizzled with powdered sugar and chocolate syrup even if you don t end up loving it could you really hate it deep fried cheese on a stick it s an innocent enough inquiry that s at the core of most state fair foods if i took this already good food and deep fry it could it be an even better food simple yet aspirational is the deep fried cheese stick it s also uncommon despite incorporating two state fair staples cheese and corn dogs the outside tastes like a traditional corn dog the inside is all melted mozzarella cheese r w concessions makes this one as well i could have but did not out of sheer decency have five of these things peach shake up a summery take on an old classic the peach shake up has all natural ingredients according to maker r w concessions and uses lemons sugar ice and some peach flavoring to make a refreshing drink esquites or mexican corn in a cup known though indiana may be for our abundance of corn we aren t the ones who developed it more recent studies show it originated in mexico as early as 9 000 years ago esquites have long held a prominent spot in mexican street vendor fare corn is nice enough slathered in butter but can it really compare to what happens when its topped with cojita cheese hot sauce chile powder and lime juice esquites are here at the indiana

washington business wire on july 20 2022 the steer coalition was formed to drive the passage of the steer act a bill that would modernize the trucking industry by incentivizing greater adoption of fuel saving technologies for heavy duty trucks the steer coalition members include aperia technologies cibus21 covenant transportation dhl idle smart link manufacturing stoneridge the international council on clean transportation trucklabs and western express the steer act is a sensible bipartisan bill that was introduced by the house of representatives which addresses our climate goals by encouraging innovation and private sector driven solutions the steer act establishes a 500m voucher program to offset the up front costs of fuel saving technologies so fleets can choose the technologies which work best in their operations rather than a one fits all model the steer act can provide immediate reductions in co2 emissions and badly needed support for the trucking industry as it could improve efficiencies by up to 15 reducing annual domestic fuel consumption by 4 5 billion gallons and decreasing carbon dioxide emissions by 50 million tons trucking is the backbone of american industry and is currently facing many challenges such as a shortage of drivers rising fuel prices and increased operating costs which have been exacerbated by the covid 19 pandemic and russia s invasion of ukraine the steer act can save trucking companies 24 8 billion dollars annually at today s fuel prices as the first order of business the steer coalition recognizes that the inflation reduction act of 2022 is an important bill to address both climate and combat rising inflation but we believe it misses a key opportunity to make it far more effective at both goals the coalition is calling on legislators who are looking for pragmatic timely and costed solutions to either get this important piece of legislation formally introduced as a stand alone bill in the senate asap or to consider adding the steer act to the inflation reduction act as the best bang for the buck to reduce the us s carbon emissions to learn more about the steer act please visit the website or access the full text here the steer coalition is open to new members that are looking to support the passage of the steer act organizations interested in joining the steer act coalition can reach out to bess lauer at or max bocheff at for more information view source version on businesswire com bess lauer max bocheff source trucklabs

congress should do more to produce the most technologically advanced semiconductor chip fabrication facilities in the world when most americans think of washington they think of lobbyists loopholes and bailouts they re not wrong on wednesday the senate voted sixty four to thirty three on a 76 billion semiconductor subsidy and tax credit bill that could balloon through an amendment to fund all sorts of bureaucratic initiatives for advanced technology the next day the house voted 243 187 in favor of the bill as well sending it to president joe biden s desk together all this could potentially reach a price tag to taxpayers of 280 billion intel and texas instruments are just some of the companies that expect to benefit financially from this boondoggle that independents and republicans bucking party leaders should oppose for two reasons it won t work because it is a scattershot bureaucratic strategy and it is unfair because it puts significant taxpayer funds at risk without any upside potential before getting to a better strategy we need to look back to why our semiconductor supply chain is fractured and how peer rival china is catching up this chips and science bill is rich in irony because the reason american semiconductor firms aren t competitive in advanced semiconductor chips is primarily due to the decisions they have made to always put share price above america s economic and national security unlike semiconductor chip design which is not capital intensive and offers high profit margins the fabrication of chips especially high performance advanced chips requires enormous amounts of capital time and technical skill u s foundries that make the still important but less advanced chips should largely fund their capital needs through financial markets now it would be very hard to overstate the importance of semiconductors to the future of the u s china rivalry and america s economic and national security semiconductors are the most strategically important technology because they underpin the circuitry at the heart of everything from smartphones to advanced satellites you might think of these microchips as the brains inside all advanced technology equally critical is building a cushion of government and private stockpiles of semiconductor supply chain inputs such as rare earths and metals these can serve as a bridge until we have secure domestic mining and refining in place a process that could take a decade or more and also require expedited permitting and financial support today 75 percent of total chip production is in asia with china on a trajectory that could give it a 30 percent market share by 2030 by 2025 40 percent of the world s capacity to produce chips with 28 nanometer nodes will be in china up from 15 percent last year china is investing significant resources in becoming self sufficient in both mature and more advanced chips including by offering tax waivers for up to ten years china is also on a buying spree of the world s chip making equipment while u s regulations block china from the most advanced chipmaking equipment in 2021 chinese foundries bought almost 15 billion in from three american companies applied materials lam research and kla corp according to the wall street journal meanwhile many american leading chipmakers still receive 35 percent or more of annual revenue from china in one form or another advanced micro devices better known as amd has a china story that sums up america s vulnerability due to the seeking of profits at all costs in 2008 it spun off its lower margin capital intensive chip fabrication operations to go as they say in the industry fabless through the formation of global foundries the emirate of abu dhabi then became the owner of global foundries through its sovereign wealth fund the advanced technology investment company atic amd s next move in 2016 was even more controversial in short through a joint venture amd transferred technology to develop advanced computer chip technology to its chinese partners in return for a sizable cash infusion according to the wall street journal in february 2016 amd reached a joint venture deal involving a leading chinese supercomputer developer and a state backed military supplier called sugon information industry to make chips licensing amd s advanced processor technology in exchange the chinese government gave amd 293 million in licensing fees plus royalties on the sales of any chips developed by the venture it s the keys to the kingdom said retired brigadier general robert spalding who served on the national security council in 2017 and 2018 furthermore in april 2016 amd sold an 85 percent stake in two of its semiconductor factories in china and malaysia to an entity controlled by china integrated circuit industry investment fund for 371 million amd s share price soared the most recent turn of events for globalfoundries gfs is telling as it went public last october through an initial public offering raising nearly 2 6 billion intel and texas instruments made their big blunder much earlier when both were invited and declined to participate in the funding of taiwan semiconductor tsmc now the world s dominant leader in producing microchips with complete domination of high performance microchips tsmc was formed when the taiwanese government persuaded the dutch multinational philips to partner alongside several local private firms to start a chip foundry in 1987 the taiwanese government invested 21 percent of the start up capital philips contributed 28 percent and other private investors provided the rest even more painful is that the founding ceo of taiwan semiconductor morris chang born in mainland china earned his bachelor s and master s degrees in mechanical engineering degrees from the massachusetts institute of technology became a u s citizen and then spent a quarter century working at texas instruments with responsibility for its worldwide semiconductor business texas instruments also sent him to stanford university where he attained his doctorate in electrical engineering in 1997 taiwan semiconductor tsmc listed its stock on the new york stock exchange and now has a market value of over 455 billion the company now makes 12 million semiconductor wafers a year and has over 50 000 employees chang has stated that tsmc s scale and technical lead mean that production at their u s factories cost 50 percent more than in taiwan congress should go back to the drawing board with one goal combining existing american and samsung technology through a consortium that includes america s leading chip makers chip designers and manufacturers of chip making equipment companies while leveraging america s leading financial markets to produce the most technologically advanced semiconductor chip fabrication facilities in the world the price tag for this could reach over 300 billion over five years american taxpayer support for this initiative should be tied to a non voting equity stake in the consortium as a potential reward for putting taxpayer funds at risk south korea s samsung electronics is already investing more than 116 billion in its effort to keep up and has already announced that it is considering expanding operations in austin texas profitable american chip designing firms such as nvidia should also chip in

thank you bar vacilando for introducing me to the marvelous mist machine i was sitting in your courtyard with rebecca brown and emily hall they were talking about some book concerning the 20th century russian composer dmitri shostakovich when an attendant entered the courtyard and informed us that the machine was about to be activated get ready we are going to get a little wet and then the mist happened and as it drifted it cooled the air in the shade beneath the big and velvety leaves of a sprawling princess tree how had i lived so long with no knowledge about this kind of machine they are

billion the big economic story of the day was of course the contraction of the us s gdp the right was quick to declare a recession the us s economy is now dying thanks to biden and his socialism and free money to everyone job claims however fell this week but that s not the point what s really amazing about all of this recession talk even by the economists on the left is this simple fact has not been pointed out a recession only hurts after a crash a recession following a long period of gdp growth is not the same beast as one that follows the strike of the rich a sudden and violent collapse of the capital markets and business investment but even if we don t accept the technical definition of a recession two months of gdp deceleration the dems are still fucked because the standard of economic success is still growth measured by compound interest we live in world that s burning and we still want growth rates that are by every measure out of this world more than melancholy should be

denver the country s gross domestic product gdp fell 0 9 during the second quarter according to advanced estimates it is the second consecutive quarter of declines the gdp dropped 1 6 in the first quarter theoretically it really means that we are officially in recession because the technical definition of recession is two quarters of negative gdp growth said kishore kulkarni a distinguished professor of economics at metropolitan state university of denver unlike previous recessions the country is experiencing high inflation at 9 1 but low unemployment kulkarni says jobs in the u s are plentiful and almost all companies are looking for labor this time around though kulkarni says it s the workers who are reluctant to accept jobs because of the circumstances that come with the job such as and masks vaccines or non flexible work schedules the federal reserve has taken steps over the past several months to try to stave off some of the inflation by raising interest rates by historic levels we clearly increased the interest rate in less than eight months by about 2 and that is unprecedented kulkarni said over at the bienvenidos food bank in denver executive director greg pratt doesn t need to look further than his front doors to see the signs of a recession we knew back in like 2007 when there was the real estate bubble that happened nobody else was really seeing that but we at food pantries saw that long before it started being recorded in the news so we were an economic indicator pratt said this time around he s seeing similar indicators the lines at the food bank are getting longer pratt is seeing a 25 increase in people coming through bienvenidos doors while fewer donations are coming in people are telling us that they haven t needed to use a food bank and they re coming down for the first time pratt said along with inflation much of the federal and state pandemic assistance has run out leaving families looking for ways to fill the gaps for people on fixed incomes their money simply isn t going as far the food bank has been around for 46 years in north denver on an average thursday they expect to see around 200 families come in because they ve been around so long bienvenidos knows how to prepare for bad times when the covid 19 pandemic hit pratt knew hard times would be ahead so they started setting aside money for a rainy day fund to brace themselves for the future but with more need and fewer donations the bank is spending more on everyday staples like eggs dairy and meat bienvenidos and many other food banks are in desperate need of more donations to help families find healthy meals with a possible recession looming financial advisors say it s not a bad idea for families to start bracing themselves for bad times now we really want to be prepared in all circumstances so be prepared for that layoff have that emergency fund said eric courage founder and a wealth strategist for honest margin courage offered some tips for people to prepare for a recession first it s important for families to start saving up money but how much depends on your situation if someone is an entrepreneur they don t know when their next paycheck is coming you know maybe that s a longer runway like 12 months of emergency reserves if someone is a judge or a teacher has guaranteed income maybe that s more like something like three months on hand courage said the second piece of advice make sure to review and understand your debt any floating debt like a credit card or home equity line of credit is usually tied to the u s prime rate which just increased it s important to review the debt and make sure you can afford the payments third it might be a good time to think twice about large purchases like a home or car with interest rates on the rise borrowing is more expensive and payments are higher each month if you re uncertain about whether you will have a job in three to six months or if you re worried about being laid off it might be a good idea to open a line credit and start the job hunt for different employment now also preparing for more taxes that might sound strange but a lot of people forget that when you are going through a layoff or you are receiving a package you re going to have more pto you re going to have severance you might have any sort of like equity compensation that all gets lumped together and all of a sudden you have a huge tax bill courage said taking a closer look at your insurance and planning for cobra is also important paying off credit cards could be a good idea but if
