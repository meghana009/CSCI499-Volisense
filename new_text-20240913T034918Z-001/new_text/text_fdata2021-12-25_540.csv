in 2021 there was hardly a sliver of the entire economy that was immune to inflation but prices rose sharpest and fastest in the categories where most households spend most of their money the degree to which your life was interrupted however probably has a lot to do with how well you were doing before things started to get more expensive read what did biden and congress mean for our wallets in 2021 social security 2022 how the cola will increase benefits for the average senior couple prices are rising throughout the economy said gary zimmerman a former investment banker and current ceo and founder of maxmyinterest increases have been most acute in the housing and used car markets reflecting a mismatch between supply and demand since these are the largest expenses for most households the impact of inflation in these sectors has been particularly painful for many families by contrast low interest rates have driven up stock prices so those with investment portfolios may be feeling particularly flush these days at least in nominal terms first the good news a handful of pantry staples and dairy items saw fairly significant price drops between january and november 2021 the price of spaghetti and the flour that it comes from for example fell by double digits cheese ice cream butter and bread all dropped by percentages in the mid to low single digits that might not be a big deal in ordinary times but with the overall rate of inflation coming in at 6 8 over that same time period any break is welcome news for shoppers and the economy in general inflation is dangerous since the very expectation of inflation can cause inflation zimmerman said once this cycle starts it can be difficult and painful to unwind much of our society is built on the expectation of relatively benign inflation and few contracts have inflation escalators built in read here s how stimulus money changed everything in 2021 the big 3 energy food and housing doled out most of the suffering the trifecta of american life and the country s consumer economy are food fuel and housing they re the things that no one can go without lower income households already tend to spend much more of their budgets on these three essentials than the larger population and it was exactly these three categories that inflation hit the hardest all year long in 2021 inflation caused prices to go up for essential commodities said jake smith owner and managing director of absolute reg maintaining the same budget to buy household needs became a daily challenge for most people especially those greatly affected by the pandemic related 8 surprising facts about stimulus checks in 2021 the price of gas went up by nearly 50 rising by 1 15 from 2 33 to 3 48 piped utility gas jumped by 25 the price of a single family home went up by nearly 44 from 217 623 00 to 312 728 00 a nearly six figure jump and the median rent rose by 159 from 1 727 00 to 1 886 00 in terms of food the price of the following items climbed by between 10 and one third between november and january frankfurters bacon beef steak beef roast ground beef eggs frozen orange juice ham ground chuck pork chops don t qualify for snap the commodity supplemental food program could help seniors get food as low supply tugged from one end high demand pulled from the other an increase in demand can cause prices to rise as can a drop in supply the perfect storm of circumstances behind the economic drama of 2021 delivered both at the same time there are two scenarios that would be most affected by inflation either an inelastic demand with a supply disruption or an inelastic supply with an increase of demand said dr tenpao lee professor emeritus of economics at niagara university for example the food and energy sectors had inelastic demands with supply disruptions under the pandemic and resulted in significant inflations the lumber and used car sectors had inelastic supply with an increase of demands under the pandemic and this also resulted in significant inflation on the other hand some sectors that were discretionary and highly substitutable may have less impact from inflation for example name brand apparel sport entertainment and luxury vacations keep more of your money all the states that don t tax social security fixed wages and cash savings pulled an incredible shrinking act in 2020 the pandemic challenged conventional wisdom about the old fashioned emergency account as side hustles offered more security than money collecting 0 06 in the bank in 2021 those same emergency funds lost about 5 or 6 of their emergency stopping power the inflation in 2021 affected people who kept cash savings kevin miles a specialist with loanadvisor and also the workers with fixed wages it s impossible after all to discuss inflation without discussing labor check out the average social security check the year you were born inflation was the backdrop of both the labor crisis and the move to gig work as workers were able to buy less and less with the same paycheck some had more negotiating power than others this past year inflation has especially affected workers in non unionized jobs said ahmed mir founder and managing editor of sip coffee house this is because the workers have less bargaining power to ask for higher nominal wages in order to keep up with the rising inflation this means that at the end of the year their wages are 5 less than when the year started that according to smith is exactly what drove so many people into the gig economy in 2021 without a raise a second income stream was the only way to battle back against the tide of higher prices the effect of this mismatch in the inflation rate and the salary increase leaves people to sacrifice some primary commodities to counter the hike in product prices smith said this situation forces them to level down their social needs to ensure that their income supports their lifestyle also the year was not kind to businesses that make things here and send them there it has had a huge effect on the export system too where the exporters find the demand for goods declining thereby becoming less competitive in the market miles said but there s also plenty of evidence to suggest that the market has already begun righting itself the economy is dynamic in nature lee said consumers spending demand and suppliers manufacturers response supply will shape the economic outcomes optimally therefore inflation can be viewed as a short term phenomenon and transitory more from gobankingrates this article originally appeared on

cory sandhagen s year may have ended with back to back losses but the 29 year old bantamweight isn t deterred he knows how close he was to authoring a different story coming off the two losses kind of sucks but i m a little bit more of a deeper thinker than just yeah my last two were ls sandhagen said recently on the mma hour my first l this year was one of the most controversial decisions that the ufc has maybe ever had and then the second one was a short notice title fight against one of the best guys in the world so i m not too beat up about it man i really think that i m just a couple mistakes away from beating these guys and that just means that i just need to work that much harder i still know i m going to be champ sandhagen suffered a controversial split decision loss to former ufc champion t j dillashaw in july then dropped a short notice opportunity against petr yan in october with an interim ufc bantamweight title on the line while the result of dillashaw fight still bothers him it s the latter bout that was the bigger missed chance for sandhagen even after stepping in on just one month s notice sandhagen was in control of the fight s early stages before a third round knockdown turned the tide for yan sandhagen went on to drop the championship rounds at ufc 267 and lose a unanimous decision to the russian it s been a bitter pill to swallow especially considering what a win could ve meant for sandhagen s career but the colorado native has tried to keep some perspective about what he accomplished in an admittedly tough spot i feel ok about it man sandhagen said i thought i fought really well i m not one to make excuses i really would ve liked some more time because yan is one of the best guys in the world so i would ve definitely preferred to have some more time but no man i thought that the fight went really good for me i think that one i was doing well two i was doing well even though the judges gave it to him i still think that probably in colorado i would ve taken two round 3 i was doing good all the way up until that last minute when i got dropped in that one and then kind of had to fight the rest of the fight on wobbly legs a little bit so i think i was just one mistake away from taking that fight and all the credit to yan for knocking me down and hurting me and making it so that i couldn t fight the same for the rest of the fight he protected himself really well sandhagen added that was a little bit something that i thought i would have a little bit more of an edge on is i thought that i would be able to hurt him a little bit better than i was able to hurt him but the guy protects himself really well and that was a tough thing and that s why i kind of go back to me only having five weeks to get ready for it is i do a lot of figuring people out in those kind of later weeks of training camps so to only have four against one of the best guys in the world it s tough to try to figure someone out in that amount of time since its conclusion sandhagen s battle with yan has drawn plaudits as one of the best fights of 2021 it was also one of those occasional results you see in mma where even the loser s stock doesn t take much of a hit sandhagen is still ranked no 4 on mma fighting s global bantamweight rankings yet an emotional response to the disappointing result was inevitable the team elevation product admitted that he d already visualized what it d be like to pack his glimmering new golden belt into his suitcase bring it home sit it on his couch and just stare at it for a while as the title of ufc champion washed over him that dream appeared to be within reach after an opening round at ufc 267 where sandhagen nearly doubled yan s offensive output but it wasn t meant to be that s kind of his style right sandhagen said we anticipated that he doesn t start the fastest he started a little bit quicker than i think he normally does with me but yeah in two and three he just picked up the pace a little bit and that s kind of how he fights and in four he kicked my ass in round 4 but like i said man i was kind of on stilts from getting dropped i have a really good chin so if you drop me you must ve hit me really hard and that s not going to be something that isn t going to play a factor into the rest of the fight so i made that mistake man and i paid for it so that s how the sport works sandhagen said he doesn t have any immediate plans to return to the cage after a busy 2021 he wouldn t mind taking some time off to focus solely on improving his craft it s hard to be creative when you re in camp for a fight he said his biggest leaps in skill historically happen when he has the free time to let his creativity roam on the mats in colorado it s a good time for a break anyway considering that the ufc bantamweight division is essentially stuck at a standstill again at least until yan and shelved champion aljamain sterling are able to settle their business sometime in 2022 the two rivals fought previously in march at ufc 259 with sterling earning a disqualification victory in a bout that yan was winning before throwing an illegal knee late in the fourth round sandhagen sees a similar result playing out whenever the two meet again only without the illegal strike that ultimately gave the belt to sterling i think yan s got it sandhagen said that s based off of the first fight and that s just based off of yan s good man yan s good sterling s good also but i think yan just protects himself so well and he s super dangerous guy to fight and that s not an easy match

owned national securities law firm with offices in new york pennsylvania california and georgia according to the complaint the company made false and misleading statements to the market robinhood suffered from major issues with revenue growth at the time of the ipo with its touted transaction based revenues from cryptocurrency trading only providing a temporary boost to otherwise flat growth the company s supposed significant investments in reliability and infrastructure growth were subpar creating the opportunity for service disruptions and cybersecurity failures based on these facts the company s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the ipo period when the market learned the truth about robinhood investors suffered damages on october 26 2021 after the markets closed robinhood reported its third quarter 2021 financial results revealing that its total net revenue for the period between july 1 2021 through september 30 2021 the same period during which the company conducted its ipo came in at 365 million badly missing analyst estimates by nearly 73 million and declines in its monthly active users maus funded accounts assets under custody auc and average revenue per user arpu robinhood also disclosed that third quarter transaction based revenue from cryptocurrency trading which in the lead up to the ipo had been the bulk of the company s revenues was a measly 51 million staggeringly below the 233 million robinhood earned from crypto trading in the second quarter the proportion of robinhood s cryptocurrency transaction based revenue generated by dogecoin alone fell 40 in q3 with robinhood only generating 20 4 million in q3 compared to 144 5 million in q2 at the same time robinhood s net losses skyrocketed from 11 million to 1 32 billion due to a remarkable 1 24 billion stock based compensation expense that was tied to the stock s post ipo performance and its initial rally which boosted its shares to an all time high of 85 a share on august 4 2021 and triggered a massive payout to defendants tenev and bhatt to make matters worse robinhood also guided for less than 1 8 billion in revenue for the full year implying a maximum 85 growth which fell well short of analyst expectations of 111 analysts immediately took note with those at j p morgan for example downgrading their price target and characterizing the company s trading revenue as a disappoint noting in particular how equity trading was particularly weak down both sequentially and yoy despite a near doubling of accounts and mtus and how rypto trading revenue fell 78 down more than the crypto industry average of 40 and the decline of dogecoin trading of 75 before concluding we believe robinhood has been overearning and guidance will weaken for 22 j p morgan also questioned why management did not disclose trading volumes finding it peculiar for a company generating 75 of revenue on volumes but nonetheless suspecting revenue per trade had been elevated a weaker business outlook on this news robinhood s stock declined nearly 10 5 falling from 39 57 per share on october 26 2021 to close at 35 44 per share on october 27 2021 then on november 8 2021 after the markets closed robinhood disclosed that it had suffered a data security incident on november 3 2021 admitting that an unauthorized third party had obtained email addresses for approximately five million users and the full names of a different group of about two million users indicating that the attack potentially affected nearly 40 of robinhood s maus what is more robinhood said the additional personal information of 310 other users including their names dates of birth and zip codes were exposed and within that group that 10 users suffered even more extensive breaches on

the bingham west mountain mining district is located 22 mi southwest of salt lake city in southwest salt lake county bingham is the oldest and largest district in utah and hosts a giant porphyry cu au mo deposit the bingham canyon open pit porphyry cu au mo mine is the largest mine in the u s and the bingham district is the largest cu mo au ag pb and zn producer in utah the district s total historical metal production at modern metal prices is valued at approximately 174 billion and the bingham canyon mine is still in production the bingham district forms a lynchpin in the bingham park city mineral belt in the basin and range province the district is centered on a giant high k calc alkaline porphyry cu mo au ag deposit usgs model 17 this deposit is associated with a small composite monzonite stock dated at about 38 ma this stock intrudes a thick intercalated sequence of pennsylvanian permian marine quartz sandstones and limestones a 400 to 1000 ft wide quartz monzonite porphyry dike and a swarm of narrower east northeast trending dikes cut the north flank of the early monzonite stock the hypogene porphyry mineralization is concentrically zoned around the quartz monzonite porphyry dike from a deep inner low sulfide core through progressively overlapping hypogene molybdenite bornite chalcocite chalcopyrite and pyrite zones the inverted cup shaped cu shell is largely coincident with potassic alteration and garnet cu au skarns usgs model 18a the surrounding pyrite halo is spatially associated with propylitically altered rocks each of three major phases of porphyry intrusion is followed by cycles of fracturing alteration veining and metal deposition this cyclic vein formation resulted in complex vein relationships partly constrained by age dates and crosscutting relations the quartz monzonite porphyry dike and younger dikes are spatially coincident with the highest grades of cu and au in the orebody porter and others 2012 the exposed quartz monzonite porphyry stock is too small to have provided the fluids and metals for the district necessitating a connection to a far larger magma chamber at depth the outermost fringe of the pyrite halo is overprinted by the inner margin of a 3000 ft wide intermediate sulfidation sphalerite galena tetrahedrite manto vein zone where alteration is largely confined to the immediate vein walls usgs model 19a the outer perimeter of the pb zn veins locally contains rhodochrosite and or barite the barneys canyon and melco distal disseminated au deposits usgs model 19c lie 4 mi north northeast of the center of the district and outside bingham s megascopically recognizable sulfide and alteration system but on the outer fringe of a weak as au geochemical halo babcock and others 1995 in 1848 erastus bingham and his two sons were the first to discover mineralization in bingham canyon because the church of jesus christ of latter day saints l d s church of which they were members discouraged mining the location was forgotten until 1863 when colonel p e conner of the u s army stationed at fort douglas in salt lake city and others rediscovered the silver rich lead ore while picnicking in the area on september 17 1863 george ogilvie a logger who first reported the find colonel conner and 23 others staked the jordan claim in bingham canyon eldredge and wilkerson 1990 this claim was the first in the district and the first recorded in utah in 1863 the west mountain mining district was officially organized in 1864 placer gold was discovered near the mouth of bingham canyon by a group of california miners with this discovery gold became the first mineral mined in the district placer mining recovered approximately 72 600 ounces of gold the largest gold nugget over 7 ounces ever found in utah was in bingham canyon by the early 1870s placer mining was declining because the deposit was almost played out beginning in 1870 mining began on the silver rich oxidized lead ores at the highland boy jordan last chance brooklin and yosemite mines the jordan last chance and brooklin mines have since been consumed by the present day bingham canyon open pit mine by the late 1880s most of the shallow silver rich ore bodies had been exhausted and between 1890 and 1900 many of the mining properties were consolidated extensive underground mining of the silver lead gold and copper ores began at mines that included the lark u s butterfield group highland boy and carr fork underground mining continued until 1971 when the lark and u s mines closed in 1885 native copper found growing in organic rich portions of upper bingham creek led to the discovery that the creek water contained copper in solution a small operation began to produce metallic copper by running creek water over scrap iron where the copper in solution would precipitate onto the iron in 1897 enos wall noticed copper carbonate mineralization on both sides of bingham canyon and scattered copper mineralization in monzonite in several abandoned mining tunnels he subsequently staked a number of claims known as the wall group subsequently acquired by the utah copper company about the same time samuel newhouse who developed and sold the highland boy mine also was aware of scattered copper mineralization and acquired property southwest of the wall group for the boston consolidated mining company the boston consolidated and utah copper companies began to mine copper ore in the early 1900s both companies started steam shovel stripping or open pit mining in 1906 utah copper shipped the first ore in 1907 and boston consolidated shipped ore in 1908 over the next several years utah copper and boston consolidated properties were the leading producers of copper in the district in 1910 utah copper merged with boston consolidated for 310 000 utah copper shares valued at nearly 19 million in 1936 kennecott utah copper corporation acquired the mine from the utah copper company during world war ii kennecott supplied one third of the total amount of copper used by the allied forces in 1978 kennecott utah copper was sold to standard oil company a subsidiary of british petroleum british petroleum sold its interests to the rio tinto zinc corporation in 1987 in the 1980s copper became uneconomical to mine due to high labor haulage smelting and refining costs over the next several years kennecott spent 2 billion modernizing its operations and facilities as a result the mine is now one of the most efficient in the world at present 2005 the bingham canyon mine is more than a half mile deep and about 2 5 miles across from rim to rim the barneys canyon and melco gold deposits located north of the bingham canyon mine were initially found in 1878 but the significance was unrecognized sampling was conducted in 1968 69 at an old mine dump in barneys canyon that returned values of 0 10 to 0 20 ounces of gold per ton drilling on the barneys canyon deposit began in 1985 and the deposit was discovered on the

the fed has options for countering the record inflation the u s is facing that are more productive and less risky than raising interest rates the federal reserve is caught between a rock and a hard place inflation grew by 6 8 in november the fastest in 40 years a trend the fed has now acknowledged is not transitory the conventional theory is that inflation is due to too much money chasing too few goods so the fed is under heavy pressure to tighten or shrink the money supply its conventional tools for this purpose are to reduce asset purchases and raise interest rates but corporate debt has risen by 1 3 trillion just since early 2020 so if the fed raises rates a massive wave of defaults is likely to result according to financial advisor graham summers in an article titled the fed is about to start playing with matches next to a 30 trillion debt bomb the stock market could collapse by as much as 50 even more at risk are the small and medium sized enterprises smes that are the backbone of the productive economy companies that need bank credit to survive in 2020 200 000 more u s businesses closed than in normal pre pandemic years smes targeted as nonessential were restricted in their ability to conduct business while the large international corporations remained open raising interest rates on the surviving smes could be the final blow cut demand or increase supply the argument for raising interest rates is that it will reduce the demand for bank credit which is now acknowledged to be the source of most of the new money in the money supply in 2014 the bank of england wrote in its first quarter report that 97 of the uk money supply was created by banks when they made loans in the u s the figure is not quite so high but well over 90 of the u s money supply is also created by bank lending left unanswered is whether raising interest rates will lower prices in an economy beset with supply problems oil and natural gas shortages food shortages and supply chain disruptions are major contributors to today s high prices raising interest rates will hurt not help the producers and distributors of those products by raising their borrowing costs as observed by canadian senator and economist diane bellemare raising interest rates may cool off demand but today s high prices are tightly tied to supply issues goods not coming through to manufacturers or retailers in a predictable way and global markets not able to react quickly enough to changing tastes of consumers a singular focus on inflation could lead to a ratcheting up of interest rates at a time when canada should be increasing its ability to produce more goods and supplying retailers and consumers alike with what they need rather than a reduction in demand we need more supply available locally and to fund its production credit money needs to increase when supply and demand increase together prices remain stable while gdp and incomes go up so argues uk prof richard werner a german born economist who invented the term quantitative easing qe when he was working in japan in the 1990s japanese banks had pumped up demand for housing driving up prices to unsustainable levels until the market inevitably crashed and took the economy down with it the qe that werner prescribed was not the asset inflating money creation we see today rather he recommended increasing gdp by driving money into the real productive economy and that is what he recommends for today s economic crisis how to fund local production smes make up around 97 99 of the private sector of almost every economy globally despite massive losses from the pandemic lockdowns in the u s there were still 30 7 million small businesses reported in december 2020 small companies account for 64 percent of new u s jobs yet in most u s manufacturing sectors productivity growth is substantially below the standards set by germany and many u s smes are not productive enough to compete with the cost advantages of chinese and other low wage competitors why werner observes that germany exports nearly as much as china does although the german population is a mere 6 of china s the chinese also have low wage advantages how can german small firms compete when u s firms cannot werner credits germany s 1 500 not for profit community banks the largest number in the world seventy percent of german deposits are with these local banks 26 6 with cooperative banks and 42 9 with publicly owned savings banks called sparkassen which are legally limited to lending in their own communities together these local banks do over 90 of sme lending germany has more than ten times as many banks engaged in sme lending as the uk and german smes are world market leaders in many industries small banks lend to small companies while large banks lend to large companies and to large scale financial speculators german community banks were not affected by the 2008 crisis says werner so they were able to increase sme lending after 2008 and as a result there was no german recession and no increase in unemployment china s success too werner attributes to its large network of community banks under mao china had a single centralized national banking system in 1982 guided by deng xiaoping china reformed its money system and introduced thousands of commercial banks including hundreds of cooperative banks decades of double digit growth followed window guidance was also used harmful bank credit creation for asset transactions and consumption were suppressed while productive credit was encouraged werner s recommendations for today s economic conditions are to reform the money system by banning bank credit for transactions that don t contribute to gdp creating a network of many small community banks lending for productive purposes returning all gains to the community and making bank behavior transparent accountable and sustainable he is chairman of the board of hampshire community bank launched just this year which lays out the model it includes no bonus payments to staff only ordinary modest salaries credit advanced mainly to smes and for housing construction buy to build mortgages and ownership by a local charity for the benefit of the people in the county with half the votes in the hands of the local authorities and universities that are its investors public banking in the united states north dakota s success that model cut out the middlemen and operationalize community banks to create credit for local production also underlies the success of the century old bank of north dakota bnd the only state owned u s bank in existence north dakota is also the only state to have escaped the 2008 09 recession having a state budget that never dropped into the red the state has nearly six times as many local banks per capita as the country overall the bnd does not compete with these community banks but partners with them a very productive arrangement for all parties in 2014 the wall street journal published an article stating that the bnd was more profitable even than jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs the author credited north dakota s oil boom but the boom turned into a bust that very year yet the bnd continued to report record profits it has averaged a 20 return on equity over the last 19 years far exceeding the roi of jpmorgan chase and wells fargo where state governments typically place their deposits according to its 2020 annual report in 2019 the bnd had completed 16 years of record breaking profits its 2020 roi of 15 while not quite as good was still stellar considering the economic crisis hitting the nation that year the bnd had the largest percentage of payroll protection plan recipients per capita of any state it tripled its loans for the commercial and agricultural sectors in 2020 and it lowered its fixed interest rate on student loans by 1 saving borrowers an average of 6 400 over the life of the loan the bnd closed 2020 with 7 7 billion in assets why is the bnd so profitable then if not due to oil its business model allows it to have much lower costs than other banks it has no private investors skimming off short term profits no high paid executives no need to advertise and until recently it had only one branch now expanded to two by law all of the state s revenues are deposited in the bnd it partners with local banks on loans helping with capitalization liquidity and regulations the bnd s savings are returned to the state or passed on to local borrowers in the form of lower interest rates what the fed could do now the bnd and sparkassen banks are great public banking models but implementing them takes time and the fed is under pressure to deal with an inflation crisis right now prof werner worries about centralization and thinks we don t need central banks at all but as long as we have them we might as well put them to use serving the main street economy in september 2020 saqib bhatti and brittany alston of the action center on race and the economy proposed a plan for stimulating local production that could be implemented by the fed immediately it could make interest free loans directly to state and local governments for productive purposes to better fit with prevailing fed policies perhaps it could make 0 25 loans as it now makes to private banks through its discount window and to repo market investors through its standing repo facility they noted that interest payments on municipal debt transfer more than 160 billion every year from taxpayers to wealthy investors and banks on wall street these funds could be put to more productive public use if the federal reserve were to make long term zero cost loans available to all u s state and local governments and government agencies with that money they could refinance old debts and take out loans for new long term capital infrastructure projects while canceling nearly all of their existing interest payments interest and fees typically make up 50 of the cost of infrastructure dropping the interest rate nearly to zero could stimulate a boom in those desperately needed projects the american society of civil engineers asce estimates in its 2021 report that 6 1 trillion is needed just to repair our nation s infrastructure as for the risk that state and local governments might not pay back their debts bhatti and alston contend that it is virtually nonexistent states are not legally allowed to default and about half the states do not permit their cities to file for bankruptcy the authors write according to moody s investors service the cumulative ten year default rate for municipal bonds between 1970 and 2019 was just 0 16 compared with 10 17 for corporate bonds meaning corporate bonds were a whopping 63 times more likely to default unicipal bonds as a whole were safer investment than the safest 3 of corporate bonds us municipal bonds are extremely safe investments and the interest rates that most state and local government borrowers are forced to pay are unjustifiably high the major rating agencies have a long history of using credit ratings to push an austerity agenda and demand cuts to public services moreover they discriminate against municipal borrowers by giving them lower credit ratings than corporations that are significantly more likely to default he same banks that are major bond underwriters also have a record of collusion and bid rigging in the municipal bond market several banks including jpmorgan chase and citigroup have pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid billions in fines to financial regulators there is no reason for banks and bondholders to be able to profit from this basic piece of infrastructure if the federal reserve could do it for free to ensure repayment and discourage over borrowing say bhatti and alston the fed could adopt regulations such as requiring any borrower that misses a payment to levy an automatic tax on residents above a certain income threshold borrowing limits could also be put in place politicization of loans could be avoided by making loans available indiscriminately to all public borrowers within their borrowing limits another possibility might be to mediate the loans through a national infrastructure bank as proposed in hr 3339 all of this could be done without new legislation the federal reserve has statutory authority under the federal reserve act to lend to municipal borrowers for a period of up to six months it could just agree to roll over these loans for a fixed period of years bhatti and alston observe that under the 2020 cares act the fed was given permission to make up to 500 billion in indefinite long term loans to municipal borrowers but it failed to act on that authority to the extent allowed loans were limited to no more than three years and the interest rate charged was so high that most municipal borrowers could get lower rates on the open municipal bond market private corporations which the authors show are 63 times more likely to default were offered much more generous terms on corporate debt and 330 corporations took the offer versus only two municipal takers through the municipal liquidity facility the federal government also made 10 4 trillion in bailouts and backstops available to the financial sector after the 2008 financial crisis a sum that is 2 5 times the size of the entire u s municipal bond market stoking the fire with credit for local production playing with matches that could trigger a 30 trillion debt bomb is obviously something the fed should try to avoid prof werner would probably argue that its policy mistake like japan s in the 1980s has been to inject credit so that it has gone into speculative assets inflating asset prices the fed s liquidity fire hose needs to be directed at local production this can be done through local community or public banks or by making near zero interest loans to state and local governments perhaps mediated through a national infrastructure bank this article was first posted on scheerpos
it s almost hard to believe that ike ibeabuchi is just 48 years old even harder to fathom is the reality that to a segment of boxing fans and media the president and his story is still as relevant today as it was during his all too short prime in the late 90s yes as we approach 2022 there is still talk about a possible comeback from the nigeria native who dominated headlines from 1997 to 1999 thanks to wins over david tua and chris byrd even though no one knows where he is after his latest release from an ice detention center in arizona for those who don t know about ibeabuchi his rapid rise and even faster fall from grace luke williams book president of pandemonium the mad world of ike ibeabuchi gets you up to speed and fills in the many blanks in the latest offering from hamilcar publications noir series for williams whose previous boxing book richmond unchained is also a must read chronicling ibeabuchi s life to this point was a natural for him describing it as an endlessly fascinating story a crazy story and though he admits it was quite a dark experience writing the book he was all in on the former heavyweight contender from way back even in england far away from arco arena in sacramento when ibeabuchi s arrival on the scene against tua in 1997 hit home as soon as the result found its way to him he s always fascinated me said williams i ve always been a fan of him as a boxer going right back to when he fought david tua i was a big big boxing obsessive and obviously i had been following tua he was the dempsey the tyson this and that and then i just read that he lost and i had never even heard of ibeabuchi at that time i read about the compubox numbers and it sounded like an amazing fight it wasn t on u k tv so i went to the back pages of boxing monthly magazine and they had people who would advertise fight videos from america and you could send them money and they would send you videos of those fights so me and a friend of mine at school we sent for the video of tua ibeabuchi it was such an amazing fight i loved the fight and that got me interested in ibeabuchi and then i followed his career from then on at the time of his epic 12 round decision win over the 27 0 tua ibeabuchi was 16 0 with 12 knockouts and making his name on the regional scene but not anywhere else tua was expected to walk through the prospect on the hbo broadcast but that didn t happen and in the process the pair combined to set a compubox heavyweight record of 1 730 punches tua s stock didn t suffer and ibeabuchi s rose to new heights as he was seen to be a serious threat to win a world title but as his career blossomed his life outside the ring began to spiral out of control shortly after the tua fight he abducted his ex girlfriend s son and ran his car into a concrete post sentenced to four months in jail ibeabuchi was back in the ring in the summer of 1998 and after a pair of stoppages of tim ray and everton davis his brutal fifth round tko of chris byrd in march 1999 had his name on the lips of everyone in the boxing business that would be his last win and last fight ibeabuchi was arrested for attempted sexual assault in july 1999 ultimately receiving two to ten years for battery with the intent to commit a crime and three to 20 years for attempted sexual assault his issues are well documented by williams and when supplemented by interviews with several of those close to the fighter at that time it paints a complete picture of a talented but troubled athlete who was clearly coddled because of his ability to win fights and potentially win a world heavyweight title telling that story could have been a tricky process but williams pulled it off by sticking to the available facts and not editorializing the way i went about the research for this book was to get all the newspaper reports of when he was around interviewing as many people as i could and i guess in a way that s how i sort of justify it that i m chronicling the story he said i m not necessarily condoning or condemning i m chronicling what s there and i just find the sport and the range of characters endlessly fascinating was he the victim in some ways yes in some ways no i say in the book that people didn t really look out for him eric bottjer said that he was always uncomfortable about the fact that cedric kushner kept promoting him he told cedric you shouldn t be promoting this guy he s going to do something terrible but ike would have found some way to fight because he wanted to fight i wanted it to be a fair book williams continues to what extent did he just do these things because maybe he s just not a great guy that dividing line between what he did because he had mental issues and what he would have done anyway that s part of the mystery of the whole story as williams notes ibeabuchi s mother had significant documented mental issues and there is also the possibility of cte with that damage possibly kicking in after his brutal bout with tua as that was when he began running afoul of the law sometimes a positive life event like a great triumph can be a trigger for a manic episode as well as negative life events said williams it s interesting that after his two biggest victories that was when he committed his two biggest crimes after the byrd fight and ibeabuchi s subsequent imprisonment he became a cautionary tale as he fell off the boxing map and after a bunch of legal back and forth he was ultimately released detained and released again with comeback talk following every step of the way his current whereabouts are unknown but it s clear that if he does resurface someone will try to put him in a boxing ring again such is boxing williams shakes his head about the business of a sport that has seen an evander holyfield comeback at 58 and the emergence of youtubers jake paul and his brother logan as boxing stars in 2021 and while he knows a possible ike ibeabuchi return will produce similar moans and groans from the hardcore fans he admits that he will be watching the circus has always been a part of life and a part of boxing he said i guess what we hope for from boxing is the freak show and the circus don t overshadow the main event there was a point this summer when it seemed like the circus was taking over thankfully we ve had some great fights and great events like tyson fury and deontay wilder that sort of tipped the balance back again but there s always going to be a commission that would license somebody always gonna be someone putting up the money and it doesn t say much for the sport it doesn t say much for humanity but it s just the reality at the end of the day i can condemn it but probably pay to watch it because i m invested in ibeabuchi in one way or another and i want to see

as montana s tally of new covid cases neared 1 000 each day in september shelly stanley lehman worried about when the virus would reach her day care in billings she wanted to have covid tests on hand to help prevent an outbreak from sweeping through her business but stores were sold out she spent days making calls and searching online when stanley lehman finally got her hands on a box of tests later that month it was too late a child s family member unknowingly infected had exposed the day care to covid the virus quickly spread to four others including kids and staffers we got the tests just in time to close down stanley lehman said rapid antigen tests for covid have emerged as a public health tool that can help keep schools and businesses open they are less accurate than polymerase chain reaction tests known as pcr tests which must be sent to a laboratory for results however the rapid tests turnaround time of as little as 15 minutes can spot cases early and through quarantines and isolation prevent infected people from spreading the virus at schools businesses and other workplaces but a box containing two at home binaxnow tests made by abbott laboratories costs 24 at a retail pharmacy and they are often in short supply the tests are much more accessible for those who are part of montana s state run free rapid test distribution program which gives away at least two types of binaxnow rapid antigen tests and a third non antigen test called abbott id now from the same manufacturer abbott this fall the state delivered as many as 113 000 antigen tests to hospitals health clinics government offices local health departments and others but communication on how to access tests has been inconsistent such as with certain detention centers and child care providers while some jails are screening symptomatic inmates with tests from their local public health department other law enforcement officials hadn t heard of the availability of the state s rapid tests at all tina bets his medicine assistant to the sheriff in roosevelt county said jail staffers there had not received rapid tests from the state or been trained on how to use them we re definitely interested she said that would eliminate some problems for us because we certainly don t want people sick in our jail the state has communicated with schools and local health officials about the program but it hasn t been more broadly publicized in the past two years of the state s covid 19 public service announcements none advertise a supply of rapid binaxnow tests or explain how to apply for shipments eligibility requirements for the free tests can be complex some school districts are ordering recurring shipments of tests for students and staff members but private child care centers and private employers have to obtain a federal waiver to administer certain kinds of tests and others who are eligible either don t know about the tests don t want them or are stretched too thin to add another burdensome covid task the result is an uneven distribution of the state s free tests state officials cited several reasons for that including the federal waiver restrictions a limited national supply chain also means officials must prioritize recipients but some public health officials see the gaps in test distribution as another indicator of an overwhelmed and under resourced public health system drenda niemann lewis and clark county s public health officer said many children and families in her county can get tested through school districts while other residents have few options when pharmacies sell out it s really hit or miss and we re just doing the best with the resources that we have niemann said there s no consistency montana s department of public health and human services said it distributed nearly 550 000 binaxnow rapid tests from october 2020 through this october dphhs sent 45 of those to hospitals and health clinics according to a montana free press and khn analysis of the state s data an additional 13 or about 73 000 tests went to assisted living and long term care facilities but only 5 or 26 500 tests went to a category titled other which includes group homes services for people with disabilities and child care centers that comes to slightly more than 70 tests a day for that entire category statewide during the same period fewer than 2 of all tests distributed approximately 11 000 went to dozens of state corrections facilities and jails other states comparatively have swung open the gates to testing tennessee created a program for interested businesses to obtain covid test kits free of charge with guidelines on how to qualify colorado is shipping binaxnow rapid tests directly to homes free of charge around the washington d c region libraries offer them at no cost both the trump and biden administrations have encouraged widespread distribution of rapid tests the biden administration aims to boost testing by increasing supplies to 200 million rapid tests a month in an ideal world you would have readily available testing much like we see in countries in europe where families can get 10 tests a day for their home said michael osterholm director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota in ordering abbott binaxnow tests montana is careful not to stockpile more than it can deliver before the tests expire after 12 months it sent 51 200 tests to colorado in may that were close to their expiration date the state doesn t track how many tests go unused after they ve been distributed montana gov greg gianforte spokesperson brooke stroyke said that testing is an important component of the state s pandemic response and that the state distributes tests to eligible vulnerable and underserved populations based on local health officials input after all local leaders know the needs of their communities best stroyke said missoula county is using rapid abbott id now tests the third kind of rapid covid test the state is distributing the abbott id now is not an antigen test but a molecular test similar to pcr tests the state has distributed an average of 3 120 of those tests a month matt volz khn a sign tells customers at the walgreens pharmacy in helena montana on oct 5 2021 that sales of at home covid 19 tests are being rationed those tests can be more reliable county officials said brian chaszar its covid 19 operations section chief said his county has access to plenty of tests and is able to get the word out about what s available he said some businesses and groups are bound to get missed in a large county and not every place will opt to receive tests whether it s because of the workload or potential backlash against covid precautions particularly in some school districts i have no envy for principals of those schools chaszar said some parents really want masking and testing other parents want to have nothing to do with it and refuse to participate in it with the rise of the contagious delta variant this fall the state increased distribution of tests to public and private k 12 schools that asked for them we would like as many k 12 schools to tap into these resources to help schools to stay open and be safe todd harwell the state health department s public health and safety administrator wrote in a september email to local and tribal health officials but dphhs spokesperson jon ebelt said supplying rapid tests directly to private businesses is complicated by federal regulations that require each business to receive a waiver to administer them ebelt said most of the state distributed tests are tethered by those federal rules which he said offer better reporting and quality control and are less expensive one of the two types of antigen tests the state receives from abbott doesn t need a federal waiver but it has a far more limited supply of them since june the state has doled out about 18 000 of those at home tests ebelt said the state s limited stock of the less regulated at home tests has been prioritized for other entities such as local health departments we were very concerned that we would not be able to secure enough tests from our supplier to expand distribution ebelt said although some businesses such as child care providers could apply for federal waivers to access more tests ebelt said dphhs did not think that was the best route because of the additional work for those already understaffed groups one former dphhs official disagreed with the department s interpretation of federal rules jim murphy formerly the state s lead epidemiologist said the state could find a way to distribute tests to day cares and other businesses if it provided proper training and oversight ideally murphy said the public health philosophy for navigating the pandemic should be focused on solutions rather than hurdles we shouldn t find obstacles here he said we should find ways to get these tests in the right hands one workaround offered by health officials in montana has been to connect child care centers with a federal pcr testing initiative operated through the u s department of health and human services the same program stanley lehman of billings used to order tests for her child care facility ebelt said the department knew of nine montana child care providers that had signed up to work with that program by early november as of this year montana had nearly 1 200 licensed child care facilities montanans access to tests varies by county partly because of how many tests local officials request and how they are used joe russell health officer for the flathead city county health department said that he knows people are struggling to find tests but that it s not all on the state to advertise that tests are available sometimes it will fall to us the county and sometimes it s the responsibility of the business you know to push forward and ask russell said

efforts to regulate the world s technology giants are revealing the enormous differences between beijing and washington s respective approaches both positions are very clear there is a need for more regulation to avoid monopoly abuses and in both cases guidelines have been set to strengthen this framework there the similarities end in the united states the biden administration has dedicated itself to placing intellectuals experts and academics in antitrust legislation in strategic posts prompting amazon and facebook to demand their recusal it seems that a professional life dedicated to the rigorous study of a given subject merely means bias and joe biden s statements when they point to a specific company are quickly and carefully nuanced but in beijing the approach is radically different xi jinping s administration acts with an iron fist demanding absolute obedience and is not concerned about turning on companies it once bragged about in international forums after refusing to postpone its ipo in the united states despite beijing s suggestions ride hailing giant didi now faces an unprecedented fine in addition to the obvious problem that the company has been unable to incorporate new users since july 4 as its app is excluded from china s download platforms didi s share price has dropped to around 8 from 14 when it when it made its stock market debut on june 30 at 14 reaching 16 40 don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free a harsh punishment designed to illustrate the omnipotence of the chinese government it is clear that beijing is willing to do whatever it takes to bring the tech giants into line it has now turned its sights on amazon bytedance netease and didi for their alleged abuse of user data proving that in china if anybody ever had any doubts that the only organization that can collect and use people s data as it sees fit is the chinese communist party is this simply a question of upholding a particular system or is it about deeper attitudes in china nobody dares challenge the government s decisions but in the united states the biden administration is facing litigation challenges and problems of all kinds to implement change that was part of biden s electoral program and enjoys considerable support not only among his supporters but even within the ranks of the opposition as a result some such as investor and venture capitalist roger mcnamee are beginning to call on joe biden to take a tougher hand with big tech if he wants to restore such fundamental issues as privacy competition and democracy itself guaranteeism or weakness initially biden seemed firm decisive and even aggressive by putting leading figures feared by technology companies in key positions his ardor for change now seems to be cooling let s not forget that big tech was among the main donors to his campaign are we talking about a situation where everyone is entitled to a fair defense or is this a president who despite his high sounding statements is wary of offending those who helped him into office if we don t start seeing results that put the tech companies in their place sooner rather than later i fear we will have seen enough of what the tone of joe biden s presidency is going to be all bark and no bite this post was previously published on medium join the good men project as a premium member today all premium members get to view the good men project with no ads a 50 annual membership gives you an all access pass you can be a part of every call group class and community a 25 annual membership gives you access to one class one social interest group and our online communities a 12 annual membership gives you access to our friday calls with the publisher our online community register new account log in if you wish to renew an existing subscription username email first name last name password password again choose your subscription level yearly 50 00 1 year monthly 6 99 1 month credit debit card paypal choose your payment method auto renew subscribe to the good men project daily newsletter our terms of service which can be found here need more info a complete list of benefits is here photo credit istock

republican lawmakers are sponsoring a bill designed to protect financial transactions known as payment for order flow in which brokerages route their clients trades to market makers pennsylvania republican sen pat toomey ranking member of the senate banking committee introduced the investor freedom act of 2021 in late october to protect zero commission trading and user friendly mobile apps from securities and exchange commission sec rules that would prohibit payment for order flow arguing the bill would help lower the barrier to entry for retail investors critics say payment for order flow creates a fundamental conflict of interest as brokers may not be incentivized to route trades to the best market maker for the trader but instead to the highest bidder and sec chairman gary gensler has even floated the idea of prohibiting the practice entirely opposition to this bill seeks to reward companies who restrict access to the market for everyday americans and stifle competition by throwing up barriers to entry for innovators sen kevin cramer told the daily caller news foundation republican lawmakers are sponsoring a bill designed to protect financial transactions known as payment for order flow in which brokerages route their clients trades to market makers the practice is at the heart of the burgeoning online trading industry that has helped open up the stock market to retail investors by lowering trading fees however regulators have targeted payment for order flow as ripe for abuse arguing that brokerages may be incentivized to act against their clients interests pennsylvania republican sen pat toomey ranking member of the senate banking committee introduced the investor freedom act of 2021 in late october to protect zero commission trading and user friendly mobile apps from securities and exchange commission sec rules that would prohibit payment for order flow the legislation is co sponsored by republican sens tim scott of south carolina and kevin cramer of north dakota who each signed onto the bill earlier in december payment for order flow allows brokerages to charge lower trading fees or often no fees at all as instead they earn revenue by selling their clients trade orders to market makers such as hedge funds who then execute the trade themselves related republican lawmakers say china s cryptocurrency crackdown is an opportunity for america the practice is employed by many of the most popular online brokerages and trading apps including robinhood charles schwab td ameritrade e trade and many others proponents of the practice argue that because it allows brokerages to operate without charging traders a commission it lowers the barrier of entry for smaller retail investors thereby democratizing the market critics say the practice creates a fundamental conflict of interest as brokers may not be incentivized to route trades to the best market maker for the trader but instead to the highest bidder sec chairman gary gensler has even floated the idea of prohibiting the practice entirely they get the data they get the first look they get to match off buyers and sellers out of that order flow gensler told barron s in august that may not be the most efficient markets for the 2020s toomey who is spearheading the investor freedom act has dismissed regulators arguments that payment for order flow creates a conflict of interest pointing out that the practice has benefited consumers by opening up the stock market to smaller investors related biden s fcc nominee gigi sohn wants to silence dissent top senate republicans say tens of millions of americans are investors who never were before and they are therefore participating in the returns of the greatest capital market on the planet toomey told yahoo finance in november arguing that payment for order flow was not the whole reason but it s a contributing factor charles schwab which operates an online trading platform and brokerage donated 16 800 to toomey and 9 400 to scott during the 2016 election cycle in which both senators were running according to campaign finance data from opensecrets the firm also donated 8 100 to cramer in 2018 during his senatorial campaign morgan stanley the owner of e trade donated 27 200 to toomey and 10 000 to scott in 2016 and 2 700 to cramer in 2018 ally financial donated 2 500 to scott and 2 000 to toomey td ameritrade donated 2 700 to cramer and the vanguard group contributed 7 000 to scott and 1 400 to toomey at the end of the day we want the stock market to be as accessible to the american people as possible the investor freedom act recognizes the new innovations and technologies that have made this a reality cramer told the daily caller news foundation opposition to this bill seeks to reward companies who restrict access to the market for everyday americans and stifle competition by throwing up barriers to entry for innovators cramer added that he receives contributions from farmers and truck drivers too that appreciate good policy when reached for comment amanda thompson spokeswoman for toomey characterized efforts to ban payment for order flow as motivated by left wing ideology socialists are attacking republicans for introducing legislation to protect commission free trading because they want to make it harder and more expensive for average americans to invest in the stock market thompson told the dcnf she also pointed out that toomey is not running for re election and did not consult with brokerages before introducing the bill in response to questions about campaign contributions when the extreme left and their allies in the press can t win an argument on the merits they malign republicans motives those making this libelous smear clearly haven t bothered to look at senator toomey s career which he has spent advocating for free markets and economic freedom she said scott s office did not respond to the dcnf s request for comment payment for order flow drew attention in early 2021 amid the gamestop short squeeze after retail investors were temporarily prevented from trading on certain brokerage apps the events resulted in a house financial services hearing in which lawmakers questioned the practice among other topics the sec also released its report on the gamestop situation in late november echoing prominent criticisms of

governance day on the birthday of the late atal bihari vajpayee who reminded modi of raj dharma in the wake of the post godhra riots despite his polarising presence the clear positives under modi s governance are the jan dhan yojana which took financial inclusion to the poor the ujjwala yojana gifting free cooking gas cylinders to the rural poor the rural electrification programme the insolvency and bankruptcy code which made it possible for banks to recover debts earlier thought to be irretrievable the gst a tax reform that was long overdue and the swacch bharat abhiyan to eliminate open defecation and improve solid waste management one can say that modi built on decades of trial and error by his predecessors or that he has merely renamed existing schemes but there s no denying that he has tweaked and translated them into results certainly much more than 15 paisa per rupee as rajiv gandhi famously lamented reaches the intended beneficiary perhaps this is what has helped him win two back to back elections even if it was like an india bangladesh match on the flip side modi s failures are of tragic proportions no prizes for guessing that the brainless demonetisation which robbed the country of two percentage points in gdp tops the list truly worthy of mohammed bin tughlak in any other democracy it would be deemed anti national and lead to impeachment the mishandling of the corona crisis was a double whammy for the economy further impoverishing the working class even the supreme court s nudge to invoke sections 92 and 100 of the patents act issuing compulsory licenses to the pharma firms to ensure adequate production and supply of vaccines did not work this is what happens when self promotion reigns supreme and the pm s selfie adorns vaccination certificates certainly not good governance although the government claims to the contrary and is jailing all those who disagree including stand up comedians modi had promised that he would not be vindictive but under his watch central agencies such as the cbi income tax and the ed have targeted 570 opposition politicians non nda politicians their relatives and aides activists lawyers independent media houses or journalists members of the film fraternity and even government officials who spoke against the ruling party on the other hand only 39 individuals linked to the bjp or its allies have faced such action according to ndtv the 570 figure is a massive 340 per cent increase compared to similar action under the congress led upa 2 government during whose term 85 individuals or groups seen as critical of the congress were targeted by central agencies this works out to an average of 17 cases per year compared to 75 cases a year under the modi government christmas day coincides with the culmination of the sushashan saptah good governance week under which the department of administrative reforms and public grievances had issued guidelines for a nationwide campaign prashasan gaon ki aur government at the grassroots to be helmed by the collectors or district magistrates however barring a few most ias ips officers seem to exist to please their political masters rather than to serve the public we have seen how the hathras district magistrate threatened the family of the rape and murder victim on national tv how the karnal sub divisional magistrate instructed cops to break the heads of protesting farmers how the sc had to intervene to probe the mowing down of four unsuspecting farmers such is the omnipresence of bad governance in india that not only have we accepted it and got used to it as a way of life we don t expect simple governance from our civic administrators or the government at large our civil servants are not ashamed of mid day meals served to poor children at schools being found unfit for human consumption their conscience is not pricked when minors in shelter homes are raped nor their pride wounded when even dog sterilisation programmes fail coming home to maharashtra its home department is the laughing stock of the country but look at some recent news about other departments bmc reinstated 117 officials many of whom were suspended over graft charges just one of the 100 plots reserved for electric vehicle charging stations in the thane development plan is available today cabinet clears the creation of a town planning

personal records all the same there are motivated officers such as a sridevasena who turned the high dengue risk peddapalli district in telangana into india s cleanest district umakant rao who created 16 000 ponds to fight drought in dewas mp manisha verma who made it possible for tribal students from maharashtra to crack the jee and neet ake ravi krishna who as superintendent of police in andhra pradesh s kurnool district in 2017 brought peace and progress to the village of kapatrala at a time when the village was beset by a series of faction killings and revenge murders watchdog organisations such as the people s union for civil liberties the national alliance for people s movement the public concern for governance trust communalism combat and praja in mumbai and the loksatta party based in hyderabad also play their role however the government now sees civil society itself as an enemy of the nation the relevant quote in this situation comes from pete hoekstra a dutch american politician who served as the united states ambassador to the netherlands under donald trump good governance requires working towards common ground it isn t easy if the government is serious

artificial intelligence powered weapons have radically transformed the battlefield but can or should they also be made to follow ethical rules although many nations still practice the tried and tested military tactics and techniques of world war ii vintage major powers particularly the us china russia and israel are grappling with the moral ethical tactical and strategic implications of the growing use of artificial intelligence ai and autonomous weapons which are increasingly independent of human interventions the digital revolution is changing our world in incredible ways challenging conventional wisdom values and ethics which most of us took for granted and perhaps nowhere is this more obvious than on the battlefield although many nations still practice the tried and tested military tactics and techniques of world war ii vintage major powers particularly the us china russia and israel are grappling with the moral ethical tactical and strategic implications of the growing use of artificial intelligence ai and autonomous weapons which are increasingly independent of human interventions autonomous weapons would lack the human judgment necessary to evaluate the proportionality of an attack distinguish civilian from combatant and abide by other core principles of the laws of war says stop killer robots an outfit working with military veterans tech experts scientists roboticists and civil society organisations around the world to ensure meaningful human control over the use of force history shows their use would not be limited to certain circumstances it s unclear who if anyone could be held responsible for unlawful acts caused by an autonomous weapon the programmer manufacturer commander or machine itself creating a dangerous accountability gap says the group the letter signed by over 40 000 ai professionals so far argues for a ban on such weapons because it will only be a matter of time until they appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists systems which do not require a human order to shoot are already in use but they are mostly defensive in nature and are programmed to shoot when a specific pre determined line is crossed these include the us ship based mk15 phalanx close in weapon system south korea s sgt a1 armoured sentry bot and israel s iron dome anti missile system but these are considered automatic rather than autonomous then there are other systems like unmanned aerial vehicles or drones like the us mq1 predator and mq9 reaper which provide battlefield commanders with unprecedented situational awareness using powerful onboard sensors can loiter identify target and destroy find fix fire finish adversaries they ve been used to track terrorists in yemen afghanistan and pakistan missiles in north korea and drug cartels in mexico but though they can identify search and follow pre defined targets they can only use lethal force when a human operator gives the order theoretically however it requires just another line or two of code to remove the human from the loop completely popular sci fi books and hollywood blockbusters in which cyborgs and killer robots revolt against mankind have led to legitimate as well as ludicrous fears not just among civil society but also a section of security analysts they sanctimoniously point to english author mary shelly s 1818 novel frankenstein or the modern prometheus as an example of what could go wrong but most of these concerns revolve around the ability of ai enabled weapons or even robots that are propounded to replace regular soldiers to differentiate between friend and foe the enemy and hapless civilians while there is no agreed international definition of lethal autonomous weapon systems laws a 2012 department of defense directive updated in 2020 defines laws as weapon system that once activated can select and engage targets without further intervention by a human operator also known as human out of the loop or full autonomy other categories include human supervised or human on the loop autonomous weapon systems which allows operators to monitor and halt a weapon s target engagement and the semi autonomous or human in the loop weapon systems that only engage individual targets or specific target groups that have been selected by a human operator these include fire and forget weapons like guided missiles which become autonomous after being programmed with specific targets china s leaders have made clear they intend to be globally dominant in ai by the year 2030 while the directive excludes autonomous or semiautonomous cyberspace systems for cyberspace operations unarmed unmanned platforms unguided munitions munitions manually guided by the operator e g laser or wire guided munitions mines unexploded explosive ordnance it mandates that all systems including laws be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force this basically means that humans must decide how when where why and in what quantum these weapon scan be used with appropriate care and in accordance with the law of war applicable treaties weapon system safety rules and applicable rules of engagement it also rules that any changes or upgrades to the system s operating state would entail full re testing and evaluation autonomous weapons select and engage targets without human intervention begins an open letter released in july 2015 by the international joint conference on artificial intelligence ijcai an annual gathering of ai practitioners and researchers they might include for example armed quad copters that can search for and eliminate people meeting certain pre defined criteria but do not include cruise missiles or remotely piloted drones for which humans make all targeting decisions ai technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is practically if not legally feasible within years not decades and the stakes are high autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare after gunpowder and nuclear arms it said the letter signed by over 40 000 ai professionals so far argues for a ban on such weapons because it will only be a matter of time until they appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists dictators wishing to better control their populace warlords wishing to perpetrate ethnic cleansing autonomous weapons are ideal for tasks such as assassinations destabilizing nations subduing populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group we therefore believe that a military ai arms race would not be beneficial for humanity there are many ways in which ai can make battlefields safer for humans especially civilians without creating new tools for killing people it was probably to address these fears that on 24 february 2020 the us department of defense released a number of guidelines meant to reassure citizens and perhaps the rest of the free world that these all weapons using artificial intelligence would be designed and deployed in an ethical manner fundamentally these guidelines revolve around responsibility equitability traceability reliability and governability in july 2021 speaking to the national security commission on artificial intelligence us secretary of defense austin said our use of ai must reinforce our democratic values protect our rights ensure our safety and defend our privacy asserting that over the next five years the department would invest nearly 1 5 billion usd to accelerate the adoption of ai he pointed out that obviously we aren t the only ones who understand the promise of ai china s leaders have made clear they intend to be globally dominant in ai by the year 2030 beijing already talks about using ai for a range of missions from surveillance to cyber attacks to autonomous weapons in the ai realm as in many others we understand that china is our pacing challenge but unlike china we have a principled approach to ai that anchors everything that this department does we call this responsible ai and it s the only kind of ai that we do the three main arguments in favour of the use of ai in war are reduction in civilian casualties reduction in the need for military personnel reduction in overall harm and collateral damage due to precise targeting in fact in a hot combat environment ai might do a better job than humans at present artificial intelligence technology with deep learning algorithms as the core enables intelligent combat platforms to pass large scale operations the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons ccw has held meetings since 2014 to discuss the technological military legal and ethical dimensions of emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon systems laws and examine whether they will be capable of complying with international humanitarian law and whether additional measures are necessary to ensure that humans maintain an appropriate degree of control over the use of force while it is possible to inject some level of ethics into ai driven weapons american commanders on the ground remain sceptical would these ethical weapons not be at a distinct military and economic given that coding ethics for robots is expensive disadvantage when enemy nations like china and russia or even some well funded terror outfit deploy weapons which don t have any such ethical issues and when even regular human soldiers have trouble differentiating between civilians and terrorists who use them as human shields how can you tweak artificial intelligence to do so without radically cutting down their efficiency at the end of the day the future soldier whether assisted or replaced totally by robots with ai must be able to take out threats before the threats eliminate them americans have not yet grappled with just how profoundly the ai revolution will impact our economy national security and welfare much remains to be learned about the power and limits of ai technologies nevertheless big decisions need to be made now to accelerate ai innovation to benefit the united states and to defend against the malign uses of ai begins the 756 page final report of the national security commission on artificial intelligence commissioned and tabled before the us congress in march 2021 as a bipartisan commission of 15 technologists national security professionals business executives and academic leaders the national security commission on artificial intelligence nscai is delivering an uncomfortable message america is not prepared to defend or compete in the ai era this is the tough reality we must face it said insisting that the us and its allies should reject calls for a global ban on ai powered autonomous weapons systems it says ai will compress decision time frames which humans cannot make quickly enough and warns that russia and china would be unlikely to honour any such treaty if autonomous weapons systems are properly tested and authorised for use by a human they should be consistent with international humanitarian law it says urging that by 2025 the department of defense and the intelligence community must be ai ready india which faces a giant hostile neighbour to the north and its lapdog with nuclear weapons in the west could certainly use some ai powered weapons urging congress to get allies and partners on board to help it says china s plans resources and progress should concern all americans it is an ai peer in many areas and an ai leader in some applications we take seriously china s ambition to surpass the united states as the world s ai leader within a decade noting that the commission engaged with hundreds of representatives from the private sector academia civil society and across the government as well as anyone who thinks about ai works with ai and develops ai who was willing to make time for us the nscai executive director yllbajraktari said we found consensus among nearly all of our partners on three points the conviction that ai is an enormously powerful technology acknowledgement of the urgency to invest more in ai innovation and responsibility to develop and use ai guided by democratic principles we also talked to our allies old and new from new delhi to tel aviv to london there was a willingness and desire to work with the united states to deepen cooperation on ai describing it as a shocking and frightening report that could lead to the proliferation of ai weapons making decisions about who to kill prof noel sharkey spokesman for the campaign to stop killer robots said if implemented the recommendations of the nscai will lead to grave violations of international law chinks in the bamboo curtain while the consensus in western military circles appears to be that the peoples liberation army pla will have no ethical or moral compulsions in its race to become the undisputable leader in ai by 2030 it is perhaps pertinent to refer to an article titled random discussion on legal issues of intelligent warfare in guangming net guangming daily dated 20 july 2019 which almost mirrors the concerns raised by civil society in the west mahatma gandhi once said there are seven things that can destroy us and science without humanity is one of them says the author liang jie associate professor department of military judicial work school of political science national defense university beijing at present artificial intelligence technology with deep learning algorithms as the core enables intelligent combat platforms to pass large scale operations data analysis and learning to understand human combat needs and directly participate in combat operations as a creative partner it can obtain information judge the situation make decisions and deal with situations relatively independently on the battlefield and gradually shift from assisting human combat to replacing human combat he says but while exclaiming that the era of unmanned warfare is coming people cannot help worrying about whether human control will be lost in future wars we should clearly realize that no matter how intelligent military technology develops it should not change the ultimate decisive role of man in war after all technology is a tool for mankind to achieve combat goals and should not be separated from human control consequently chinese scientists and engineers released a code of ethics for artificial intelligence which seem remarkably similar to those being framed by the west the beijing ai principles released in may 2019 by the beijing academy of artificial intelligence baai an organization backed by the chinese ministry of science and technology and the beijing municipal government spell out guiding principles for research and development in ai including that human privacy dignity freedom autonomy and rights should be sufficiently respected while it is true that liang s article and the principles could just be an attempt by beijing to show that it is aligned with international humanitarian law even as it goes ahead on war footing to develop weapons that do not necessarily comply with these laws the very fact that such an article was run is significant because it shows that the chinese are aware of the complex issues and public sentiment involved moscow mule similarly the argument that russia has no ethical framework for the use of artificial intelligence in war seems presumptuous although again whether moscow will walk its talk remains unclear while russia is not a leader in commercial and academic ai research as the united states and china are the russian military seeks to be a leader in weaponizing ai technology lt gen michael groen director of the pentagon s joint artificial intelligence centre told national defense while pushing for extensive research and development for ai powered weapons since they are essential for russia s security and growth president vladimir putin also agrees that it could be dangerous and requires internationally accepted restrictions in his speech at the unga in september last year he urged the members to both encourage the use of ai and seek regulations that balance military and technological security with traditions law and morality a year earlier russian security council secretary nikolai patrushev sought a comprehensive international regulatory framework as quickly as possible to keep ai from undermining national and international security but while endorsing meaningful human control over lethal autonomous weapons systems russia also argues that the un call to regulate and limit laws is ahead of its time because apparently ai is not yet ready to drive truly autonomous weapons yet in august 2021 russian prime minister mikhail mishustin approved the concept for the development of regulation of relations in ai technologies and robotics until 2024 which calls for new regulatory norms for the ethical development and deployment of ai and robotics developers are urged to ensure that ai should be based on basic ethical standards and make a reasonable assessment of risk to human life and health and comply with state laws and safety requirements the israeli connection when the israeli palestinian conflict flared up once more in may this year the israeli defense forces idf responded to rocket attacks on jerusalem by launching air strikes that destroyed thousands of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad pij targets in the gaza strip but this time there was something different the operation dubbed guardian of the walls relied on intelligence both human and artificial and while minimising civilian casualties it eliminated most of hamas and pij s rocket manufacturing facilities command and control sites weapon warehouses and rocket stocks it also sank hamas s naval capabilities blocked underground tunnels from gaza into bordering israeli villages and neutralized several high level commanders in both organizations here s what avikalo who leads frost and sullivan s defense consulting branch in israel says in a report the explosion of data and its widespread availability has been motivating idi to evaluate ai powered applications that streamline and analyze data while strengthening military operational effectiveness hence israel s recent operation guardian of the walls will go down in military history as the first military campaign where human machine relations were really put to the test indeed these highly sophisticated and unprecedented ai approaches are transforming all that we know about military conops in the modern battlefield israel has been a frontrunner in this regard and armed forces across the world are set to steer a strategic course towards acquiring these game changing capabilities this is also the moment for commercial and military intelligence communities to seize the business opportunities that this presents as part of the ever changing scenarios inherent in modern asymmetric warfare israel has established itself as a pioneer of autonomous weapons like the harop suicide drone which can autonomously attack any target which meets its presetcriteria but has a man in the loop facility to let a human intervene if needed then there s israeli border control sentry tech turret deployed along gaza s border aimed at stopping palestinians from entering israeli territory automated robo snipers using heavy duty 7 62 calibre machine guns and explosive rockets create automated kill zones at least 1 5 km deep if any turret detects human movement the entire chain of guns can concentrate firepower on the interloper to increase its effectiveness its automation consumes information provided by a larger network of drones and ground sensors spanning a 60 kilometer border but rafael sentry tech s manufacturer insists that a human operator still has to give the decision to fire india which faces a giant hostile neighbour to the north and its lapdog with nuclear weapons in the west could certainly use some ai powered weapons for operations ranging from border patrols to protecting military assets as well as space and just like the us russia and china and israel it should pay lip service to demands for international legislation governing their use until it has its own inventory of such weapons while talks are on to acquire the reaper from the us and an indigenous missile carrying drone is being tested it is important to understand that just a few such weapons are useless for them to have real impact they need to be integrated into the nation s military doctrine and strategy and that takes time effort and both political and military will the debate over whether automated weapons distinguish between soldiers or civilians or be held responsible for mistakes or even whether weapons need ethics absolving human decision makers of responsibility can continue because regardless of the arguments for and against ai enabled weapons the fact remains that they are already in use and will become increasingly more powerful with or without ethics and those without it are unlikely to find a place on the world s top table anytime soon
the stock market is on track for a decade long bull market driven by the rise of millennials according to fundstrat s tom lee lee said the s p 500 could hit 19 349 by 2029 as the most populous american generation enters its prime earning years and forms families lee s sky high price target for the s p 500 represents potential upside of 313 and a cagr of 20 sign up here for our daily newsletter 10 things before the opening bell advertisement while fundstrat s tom lee has bullish expectations for 2022 forecasting a return of at least 11 for the s p 500 it s his long term outlook that is especially eye popping in a presentation to clients on tuesday he outlined how millennials are set to fuel a decade long bull market in stocks as america s most populous generation enters its peak earning years and begins to form families the biggest reason to stay bullish is because of millennials lee explained noting that stocks boomed when baby boomers and generation x entered the age range of 30 to 50 years old he said the s p 500 could surge to 19 349 by 2029 representing potential upside of 313 from current levels a surge to that level would translate to a compounded annual growth rate of 20 well above the stock market s historic average of between 7 and 10 supporting lee s bull thesis is the fact that many mega cap companies today were founded by business leaders who were in their 30 s at the time including costco home depot cisco and oracle among others additionally us patent issuances tend to spike when the us sees a surge in its population of 30 to 50 year olds indicating that innovation is strong advertisement the millennial generation overtook baby boomers in population size around 2015 and the most populous age in america right now is about 31 years old lee follows demographics because they tend to serve as a leading indicator in identifying potential tops and bottoms in the stock market he noted the number of adults between the age of 30 and 50 years old fell until 2008 as the great recession took hold that age group is set to accelerate until 2026 and the number of millennials in that range won t decelerate until the early 2030 s according to lee demographics of the us are turning into a tailwind right now so we have this 14 year window ahead of us where we have a demographic tailwind if this plays out we still have a very strong bull market ahead he said
the city park apartments completed in 1957 was the first modern post war apartment complex built in toronto the three towers of the city park co op apartments on wood street behind maple leaf gardens don t really stand out among the numerous high rises of the church wellesley village but the anonymity of the trio of 14 storey towers belies an important piece of toronto history because this was the first modern multi building apartment complex in the city and at the time of its construction in 1954 the biggest residential project in the country city park was conceived in 1952 when toronto city council formally identified the land enclosed by wellesley street jarvis street wood street and the future subway line as a target for redevelopment the yonge line under construction along the western flank of the area was expected to drive prosperity and force out slum conditions that had developed among the mostly victorian housing stock many of the homes close to carlton street were in particularly bad shape due to years of neglect by the landlord the t eaton co department store chain eaton s wound up owning the future site of city park in the 1910s following a dizzying and unprecedented three day land acquisition spree in just 72 hours the company bought up 75 percent of the land in the two blocks north of carlton between yonge and church streets the haste was necessary to avoid news leaking that eaton s was planning a new midtown store in the area as it happened eaton s college street was built on the southwest corner of college and yonge in 1928 but the company continued to own the land it had assembled selling it in pieces for maple leaf gardens and the toronto hydro headquarters in 1931 by the 1950s the department store was leasing the homes on the land it owned between wood and alexander streets allowing many to fall into disrepair and subletting to get out of control toronto alderman william dennison called it a civic disgrace an eyesore of the worst kind to remedy the situation in the carlton street area the city offered to expropriate parcels of land and lease them to developers willing to put up high rise buildings in a style similar to the east side of new york at the same time the city was planning the second phase of the regent park housing project south of dundas and had also identified the houses east of trinity bellwood park between queen and dundas as substandard and in need of redevelopment a group of citizens calling themselves the bloor cartlton ratepayers association formed to oppose some aspects of the college street area redevelopment plan particularly the city s unusual offer to expropriate the land why isn t some other district of toronto named for redevelopment wondered john downes of maitland street to the globe and mail if people want to redevelop the town why don t they do it somewhere else the ratepayers group agreed however that the future site of the city park complex was suitable for renewal of some kind the plan for city park revealed to the public in 1952 was designed by peter caspari a jewish german born architect who fled his home country during the build up to the second world war eventually settling in london england where he designed several streamline moderne apartment buildings caspari arrived in toronto in the early 1950s and he designed the vincent court and buckingham court apartment buildings on eglinton avenue and several others during his first few years in the country when it was announced city park was caspari s largest commission to date in fact it was also the largest private development proposal in canada with an anticipated 1 000 middle income units spread between four 15 storey towers the 8 million project was financed by swiss building company hubert buildings ltd instead of asking the city to expropriate as had first been suggested the developers bought the land from international realty co an eaton s subsidiary for 500 000 in february 1954 by the start of construction the original city park plans had been scaled back slightly instead of four towers the complex would consist of three 14 storey towers allowed better light use and larger landscaped areas between the buildings than would otherwise have been possible architect caspari wrote in the royal architectural institute of canada journal in 1957 caspari also simplified his towers creating three geometric blocks made almost entirely of reinforced concrete even the walls between the indviidual units were made of poured concrete to eliminate all noise transmission between apartments and public corridors caspari wrote caspari was extremely concerned about noise transmission in addition to the thick concrete walls between units special acoustic plaster was sprayed in the public passages and the units were arranged so the bedrooms were separated from the entryways by at least one internal door double glazed windows made in switzerland reduced outside noise and noisy boiler equipment was separated from living areas by the communal laundry rooms the city gave caspari special permission to include one parking space for every three units rather than the one for one ratio stipulated in the planning bylaw in total there would 774 suites with 578 parking spaces underground and on the surface between the towers construction began with the demolition of the homes on the wood church alexander yonge block in 1954 and the project was completed approximately a year and a half later in 1956 the crisp international style apartment towers were as modern as tomorrow according to the complex s promotional pamphlet each unit opened into a continental style hallway off which the various rooms and closets were located the living areas came with hardwood parquet floors built in tv outlets and french windows that opened onto a full length balcony the kitchens came fitted with general electric appliances in a range of pastel colours turquoise green canary yellow or satin white and a milk box connected directly to the hallway for easy deliveries there were sun gardens on the roof of each tower and the lobbies were decorated with marble floors and polished terrazzo walls bachelor apartments started at 90 830 in 2017 a month one bedrooms were 155 1430 2017 and the most expensive units two bedrooms on the top floor were priced at 195 1 800 2017 city park was noticed around the world when it was completed the swiss financial backing of the towers generated front page newspaper coverage der bund a national german language newspaper based in bern the uk sunday times also noticed the development in a full page story on the benefits of emigrating to canada written by former chancellor of the exchequer peter thorneycroft the crisp white church street towers appeared beside a photograph of the rocky mountains as symbols of this country the towers were an outstanding example of modern canadian architecture the piece noted in an attempt to build on the success of city park toronto began seeking bidders willing to develop the next block north between maitland and alexander streets as a sweetener the city pledged to this time expropriate the land and lease it to a developer of its choosing the eventual winner ridout real estate proposed 1 500 residential units spread across eight 17 storey towers as part of the deal hammered out during an all night city council session the city would buy the land at a cost of 5 million and lease it to ridout allowing it to build its 17 million complex the financial arrangement proved controversial so ridout agreed to withdraw its plans and resubmit with other developers in 1956 but the project soon became mired in problems firstly only a handful of developers submitted acceptable proposals one contained a heliport then the city was denied federal money that would have covered the cost of expropriation in january 1957 ridout went bankrupt further jeopardizing the redevelopment in february the globe and mail described the city s attempt at a public private development partnership as an object lesson in how not to handle redevelopment peter caspari and the developers of city park made an offer that would have mostly covered the cost of expropriation in exchange for the right to put up four buildings on the site but were unsuccessful the city repealed the development bylaw in june 1957 ending the experiment it would be almost 10 years before the block was privately developed as the village green complex caspari went on to design the cibc tower at 2 bloor street west which was completed in 1974 and was his last major work in toronto before retirement he died in 1999 having introduced toronto to the post war high rise

nurses and doctors attend to a covid 19 patient on a ventilator photo location and date not specified photo courtesy of intermountain healthcare st george news st george researchers from intermountain healthcare played a key role in a new international study that has found that an antiviral drug designed to inhibit the ability of the sars cov 2 virus to reproduce itself is effective at preventing severe illness from covid when given early in the symptom course according to a press release from intermountain healthcare results from the new study were published wednesday in the new england journal of medicine dr brandon webb an infectious diseases physician at intermountain healthcare and local principal investigator of the study said the results that show the effectiveness of the drug remdesivir in treating covid patients are encouraging these results highlight the importance of early antiviral treatment of the viral phase of illness webb said they suggest that remdesivir is another useful option for treating patients who are at higher risk of having more severe disease or needing hospitalization this is especially important because omicron has disrupted the landscape for treatments several of our monoclonal antibodies are no longer effective against omicron now more than ever we need as many effective tools as possible for treating covid 19 remdesivir is an antiviral drug that inhibits the ability of the sars cov 2 virus to multiply it is fda approved for treatment of moderate and severe covid 19 in hospitalized patients based on data that suggested that it helps patients recover more quickly remdesivir is expected to be fully active against all known variants including omicron all anti viral medications work best very early in the course of infection when the viral levels are highest webb said the pinetree trial aimed to find out whether remdesivir is effective at preventing severe illness when given intravenously once a day for three days to nonhospitalized patients patients were eligible to participate if they were at least moderate to high risk for hospitalization and still within the first seven days after symptoms began it was a phase iii placebo controlled randomized trial that enrolled patients in more than 30 sites in the united states and europe intermountain healthcare was one of the top participating sites in the united states and intermountain investigators helped to design the trial dr samuel brown senior medical director for clinical trials at intermountain healthcare and a member of the pinetree trial steering committee said that intermountain and the community it serves have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to solve hard problems quickly even in the face of the terrible hardships created by this awful virus the pinetree trial identifying another solid treatment to prevent severe disease and lessen the burden on hospitals is a key reminder of that fact brown said i m incredibly proud to be part of the intermountain community intermountain used a novel research model by partnering with intermountain homecare and hospice so that trial participants could be treated by experienced research nurses in their own homes the trial originally planned to enroll about 1 200 patients but by late spring the availability of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines made it difficult to find eligible patients so the trial was stopped and analyzed with more than 600 participating patients results from the pinetree trial showed that when given early in the symptom course to moderate and high risk patients remdesivir reduced the risk of requiring hospitalization by 87 researchers say there are some important limitations to this treatment making an immediate impact first identifying higher risk patients early in the symptom course remains a challenge it is important that patients who are older overweight or who have chronic medical conditions or problems with their immune system get tested as soon as possible after developing even mild symptoms like runny nose cough sore throat fevers chills body aches or loss of taste or smell second remdesivir is currently only available intravenously which limits where patients who are contagious with covid 19 can get treated and third because these results are new insurance companies may not yet cover remdesivir given outside of the hospital the fda is currently considering whether these new data merit formal authorization of the drug s use in nonhospitalized patients while we remain committed to fostering the discovery of and are grateful for all effective treatment options for covid 19 it is important to remember that preventive measures and vaccination remain by far the most effective and most economical methods for preventing hospitalization and saving lives webb said copyright st george news saintgeorgeutah com llc 2021 all rights reserved
by whitney pipkin bay journal news service large white shrimp the kind that might star in a white wine scampi have been riding warmer waters into the chesapeake bay in growing numbers their increased presence could be the first culinary boon of climate change in the region invasive blue catfish notwithstanding though this larger shrimp species commonly known as white shrimp or gulf white shrimp has historically been in the region waters off the mouth of the chesapeake bay were until recently not warm enough to host large numbers of them according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s fisheries service warmer ocean temperatures over the last decade have been pushing the species more often associated with north carolina fisheries farther north those numbers are now large enough to sustain a nascent commercial fishery off virginia s coast in 2017 the virginia marine resources commission issued its first experimental permits to fishermen interested in trying their hand at shrimping in coastal state waters near virginia beach the agency has issued a handful of additional permits each of the past few years and is also testing the waters with a few experimental permits for fishermen plying ocean waters near the eastern shore i saw em when i was a kid but it seems like there are more and more said bob crisher who with his business partner dave portlock was the first to get an experimental permit to trawl for shrimp in virginia waters the pair have been spending their winters bringing them in ever since this year crisher is one of a dozen fishermen hauling in boatloads of shrimp which they call green tails to be sold fresh off their boats at virginia beach docks from oct 1 to jan 31 though restrictions on trawling don t allow such commercial harvesting inside the bay the shrimp are likely spending much of their life in chesapeake waters before heading to the ocean in the late fall and early winter the virginia institute of marine science has been tracking the increased presence of penaeid shrimp a category that includes white brown and pink shrimp in the chesapeake through surveys since 1991 white shrimp are by far the most abundant in the bay and starting in 2016 the trawl surveys began to bring in orders of magnitude more shrimp from about 41 shrimp in 1991 to 5 809 shrimp in 2016 according to a 2021 paper on the subject high numbers of shrimp were picked up not only near the mouth of the bay but also in virginia s james york and rappahannock rivers when you see changes like that it s indicative of climate change troy tuckey a senior research scientist with vims said of the shrimp numbers warmer waters have in the past meant we get manatees and things like that odds and ends but this is the first one that s taken hold and has some benefits in terms of food and employment the elizabeth river project and chesapeake bay foundation also have been trawling in the lafayette and elizabeth rivers near the mouth of the bay at least twice a year for about a decade to survey species we started picking up shrimp pretty consistently five or six years ago more and more of these larger shrimp said joe rieger deputy director of restoration for the elizabeth river project every year there s been significantly more this past year rieger said a 7 minute trawl in wayne creek a tributary to the lafayette river brought in about 50 shrimp the landscape surrounding that creek is a densely populated suburban swath of norfolk so rieger was surprised to be pulling in such huge gigantic shrimp white shrimp penaeus setiferus are considerably larger than and easily distinguished from the small nearly transparent common grass shrimp that have long been found in the chesapeake chris moore senior regional ecosystem scientist with the chesapeake bay foundation said educators running boat tours for the foundation also have reported seeing the larger shrimp well into the bay and its rivers including the lynnhaven nansemond and james and as far north as the rappahannock near the mouth of the bay shrimp surveying is becoming a mainstay of cbf s educational boat tours residents on the elizabeth and lafayette rivers who are handy with a cast net and licensed to use it might be able to pull some in right off their docks in the fall before they migrate back out to the ocean sterling rollings who recently installed a living shoreline on his elizabeth river property in portsmouth said he was pulling in a couple dozen jumbo shrimp each evening for a few weeks in october we had them 15 minutes from the water to the steamer said rollings who freezes most of the shrimp for later with butter and garlic they were some kinda good a license is required for the recreational use of a cast net to bring in shrimp the vmrc in august approved for the first time a recreational limit for shrimp caught in the bay a daily limit of 20 quarts of shrimp with heads on or 15 quarts of shrimp with heads off even so the virginia department of health advises against eating more than two meals a month of many species of fish caught in the elizabeth river and its branches because of the potential accumulation of toxics in their tissue unlikely river unlike freshwater rivers that flow to the chesapeake from farther inland the elizabeth river and its tributaries are so close to the ocean that they have high levels of salinity and therefore many saltwater species but the river s not so distant past still makes it hard to believe people can net shrimp for supper from their shorelines in 1983 the u s environmental protection agency singled out the elizabeth river as one of the most highly polluted bodies of water in the bay watershed and the river remains on the agency s impaired waters list today as home to one of the busiest military and commercial ports in the world the elizabeth river has been subject to 400 years of filling deepening and paving to accommodate industry and growth in the cities of norfolk portsmouth chesapeake and virginia beach to say nothing of the chemical pollution from industry military installations and shipyards but according to the elizabeth river project s regular reports the river is now also among the bay s most improved costly cleanups over the years have removed legacy toxics from the river s bottom the impacts of sea level rise and increasingly common flooding in the region also are causing more residents to consider their impact on water quality an estimated 6 000 residents are enrolled in the elizabeth river project s river star homes program which encourages them to install living shorelines rain barrels and rain gardens and to reduce fertilizer use among other measures to benefit the river the elizabeth river s most recent report card grade of c is only remarkable the report states if you realize that when the first group of scientists gathered to review the river s health in 1994 professors vied for whose slides showed the most deformed fish some elizabeth river tributaries are doing better than others the lafayette river was removed from virginia s list of bacteria impaired waterways in 2016 opening it to recreational use in 2018 the lafayette was deemed the first river in the state to reach its oyster restoration goal with nonprofits and hundreds of thousands of dollars helping to protect and create a total of 80 acres of oyster reefs the reefs rieger said at the time would create more habitat for fish and other species that list now includes shrimp shrimp cycle white shrimp are born on the ocean s continental shelf before migrating into estuaries to eat and grow throughout the spring and summer with some help from wind and rains the shrimp swim back into ocean waters in late fall and through the early winter months many aquatic animals feed on shrimp including turtles and fin fish red drum for instance hopefully one benefit of in the chesapeake bay is that we have more forage species moore said there are long documented concerns about other species like menhaden in the bay this hopefully may serve as another option one of the reasons the vmrc has proceeded cautiously with opening a shrimp fishery is to prevent depleting their supply before scientists fully understand local population dynamics that could help the region avoid some of the pitfalls associated with derby style fisheries that end up being shut down as quickly as they opened because of overfishing moore said people are very excited about the prospect of another fishery for the commonwealth and it s a high value fishery for our watermen he said by slowly expanding a new shrimp fishery moore said i think vmrc is trying to make sure we avoid some of the issues that are plaguing other states when it comes to trawl fisheries in their estuarine waters to reduce bycatch fishermen like bob crisher are using beam trawls with fish excluders to net shrimp near the seafloor the virginia permit allows them to use such gear in the 3 mile strip of waters off the state s coast the shrimp they bring in are 4 8 inches long including the head but not the antennae which are often longer than the shrimp itself they sell for 5 a pound for comparison to what might be found frozen at the grocery store crisher said the large shrimp are about 15 count to the pound and medium come in around 21 26 count per pound crisher and portlock use social media to let customers know when they are bringing shrimp to the docks near winston salem avenue at virginia beach s rudee inlet signs are posted there too shrimp is the most popular seafood in the united states but almost 90 of what s eaten here is imported and according to the advocacy group oceana much of it is farmed in ways considered harmful to the environment before the shrimp fishery crisher usually sustained his business by selling atlantic spiny dogfish for about 19 cents a pound in the winter months but shrimp pays a whole lot better when you can catch them

salmon trends and create a coordinated research strategy for pacific salmon in alaska to support salmon management the research task force would be directed to conduct a comprehensive review of pacific salmon science relevant to understanding and managing salmon returns in alaska and publish a report within one year of convening to provide recommendations identifying knowledge and research gaps and further research priorities for salmon in alaska the proposed legislation came just days after a two day salmon roundtable that the alaska congressional delegation hosted with a panel of alaska native leaders and state and federal officials during the salmon roundtable alaska native leaders from the yukon kuskokwim unalakleet and chignik regions spoke to the impacts that issues like climate change and salmon bycatch are having on local wild salmon runs which have returned at record low levels in recent years as was shared during the salmon roundtable we are at a critical moment for the yukon kuskokwim unalakleet and chignik watersheds dozens of alaska native communities are facing a long winter without salmon and a potential future without salmon we can t allow that in alaska not on our watch said tim bristol executive director of salmonstate and it s not just those watersheds where salmon are struggling we are seeing low salmon returns throughout much of the state and it s taking a toll on alaska s local fishermen businesses and communities we applaud the senators for taking an important first step towards ensuring alaska remains a place where wild salmon and the people who depend on them thrive we hope that their bill passes swiftly and we look forward to seeing what recommendations come from the task force in the meantime we encourage the senators and state and federal agencies to utilize the research and information that s already available and deploy immediate measures that we know for a fact will help alaska s wild salmon protect alaska s most productive salmon watersheds integrate indigenous knowledge in management decisions minimize any potential salmon bycatch and invest in salmon habitat restoration and climate resiliency it is difficult to overstate the importance of salmon to alaska our communities our economy and our traditional way of life over the past several years alaskans in some parts of the state have witnessed strong historic runs of salmon while alaskans in other regions have seen shocking and unprecedented declines said sen sullivan our existing management system with the state s authority to manage alaska s salmon harvest and the federal government managing federal fishery salmon harvest and much of the at sea research has created a clear gap in research and research prioritization that urgently needs to be addressed this crisis warrants the combined attention of our state and federal governments and the expertise of our greatest scientific minds as well as the indigenous communities that have harvested salmon for millennia with this legislation we would establish a body to expand our understanding identify knowledge gaps and ultimately drive us toward concrete policies and management decisions that we hope will bring increased abundance and stability to our salmon stocks for the benefit of all alaskans it has been said that the summer season doesn t arrive in alaskan coastal and in river communities until the salmon do in some regions we are seeing not just a decline in salmon runs but a crash that is damaging to not only the local economies but to the culture and spirit of the people in the region it is clear we must further our understanding of salmon and their ecosystems in these times of rapid change i am proud to join senator sullivan on the alaska salmon research taskforce act as we seek to identify and bolster the necessary science to chart a path forward to ensure these critical species thrive said sen murkowski i also continue to welcome feedback from affected community members and groups on how best to target research funding and craft policy to identify and mitigate the drivers of these declines and ensure the vitality of alaska s salmon fisheries for future generations the research task force would be composed of between 13 and 19 members with the secretary of commerce appointing a representative from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the north pacific fishery management council and the u s section of the pacific salmon commission the secretary would also appoint between two and five representatives from alaska covering the wide array of state fisheries stakeholders including subsistence and commercial or recreational users lastly the secretary would appoint five academic experts in salmon biology management and ecology or marine research the governor of alaska would appoint one representative of the state the bill also directs the research task force to establish a working group specifically focused on salmon returns in the ayk region of western and interior alaska where salmon return failures have had devastating impacts and provides flexibility for the research task force to establish other geographically focused working groups on the web salmon roundtable portal submit comments to sen murkowski source of news office of u s sen lisa murkowski www murkowski senate gov

perhaps you ve been standing in the checkout line at the grocery store and noticed your cart full of weekly essentials has been getting more and more expensive or you ve watched gas prices creep up over 3 a gallon when last year you could fill up your tank for a third less we re seeing the impact of surging inflation which has reached a 39 year high on the goods we buy every day but what s behind this inflation when will it end and what should you do about it three wisconsin economic experts have answers to those questions what is inflation and how does it happen inflation is the overall increase in prices it s not one price or one small group of prices said fox valley technical college economics instructor rick reid and it s not when they kind of blip up or go up and down a little bit this is a little more sustained some level of inflation about 2 per year is normal and essential for a healthy growing economy reid said but inflation in november hit a 39 year high the consumer price index jumped 6 8 from november 2020 as the country s economy continues to deal with the effects of the covid 19 pandemic according to the u s department of labor there are two kinds of inflation cost push and demand pull cost push inflation occurs when the cost of production increases so the cost of the final product becomes more expensive demand pull inflation happens when the demand for goods or services is higher than the production capacity what s unique about right now is that we seem to have both of them going on at the same time reid said what goods are most impacted right now most wisconsinites are probably feeling the impact of inflation in their everyday lives at the grocery stores and gas pumps as of november prices had risen 6 4 annually for groceries according to the labor department meats saw some of the biggest jumps with annual increases of 16 8 for pork 13 9 for beef 8 4 for chicken and 8 for fish gas prices soared 58 over the past year rising 6 1 monthly in november according to the labor department the rising price of gas and oil not only impacts how much it costs to fill up your personal vehicles but also increases the cost of airfare and shipping goods used car and truck prices are up 31 4 from a year ago and new vehicles are 11 more expensive as the car industry continues to struggle with a microchip shortage that is impacting carmakers ability to deliver new vehicles related looking to buy a car here s what you need to know about vehicles shortages and how they re impacting northeast wisconsin dealers buyers the cost of housing continues to increase as well in wisconsin the median home price is up 7 6 from november 2020 according to the wisconsin realtor s association natural gas is up about 25 over the last year and electricity costs are 5 higher although wages are also climbing as a result of the worker shortages they re not keeping pace with inflation how did we get here the current increase in the inflation rate is closely tied to impacts from the covid 19 pandemic including a nationwide labor shortage and supply chain constraints at the beginning of the pandemic the rate of inflation was almost zero and prices were falling said dr menzie chinn an economics professor at the uw madison la follette school of public affairs in response the government passed robust support packages including stimulus checks enhances unemployment benefits and tax cuts to boost spending the spending those programs created was concentrated more on goods than services chinn said we have kind of a weird time where people have shifted more towards buying goods and we get a lot of our goods from china and abroad chinn said so that means you have this collision at least in the goods sector of enhanced demand and not quite enough supply to keep up and what happens is prices go up supply and demand the measures put in place by the government to help people worked as they were supposed to chinn said but the pandemic also exacerbated a long developing worker shortage driven by years of declining birth rates and increasing retirements other people left the workforce for reasons directly related to the pandemic to care for children or sick relatives out of fear of catching the virus or to reassess their work lives related these two demographic trends are driving the help wanted signs inside so many business windows the pandemic also created worldwide supply chain and shipping disruptions ships carrying goods from abroad to the u s are backlogged at ports as trucking companies struggle to find drivers to move products across the country what that has done is it s put upward pressure overall and particularly in goods and that s where the supply chain issue comes in chinn said it s not like the ports suddenly lost the ability to bring in lots of stuff it s the ports and the truckers have a hard time keeping up with the higher level of goods that are being demanded the transportation industry has been hit particularly hard by the workforce shortage said angela winker the lead instructor of supply chain management at northeast wisconsin technical college the united states is short 60 000 truck drivers she said what can the government do to stop this to combat rising inflation the federal reserve can raise interest rates earlier this month the fed agreed to accelerate the phaseout of its bond buying stimulus putting it in a position to start raising interest rates earlier and faster than it had initially projected usa today reported the fed expects three interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 and two in 2024 which would push the rate up to 2 1 by the end of 2024 but how does this put the brakes on inflation the federal rate is now near zero essentially unchanged since the start of the pandemic other news assembly republicans look to tackle worker shortage through bills aimed at increasing workforce housing in wisconsin other news 12 projects aimed at boosting wisconsin s workforce get 59 5m in federal funds higher interest rates make it more costly for individuals and companies to borrow money for example a business might decide not to expand and build a new factory therefore not increasing the demand on building materials if mortgage rates rise fewer people may want to buy homes banks can also raise the interest rate for other sorts of borrowing like car loans that s going to diminish people s ability to buy things chinn said those things are taking away from the total amount of demand so then you re taking away that upward pressure on prices when can people expect prices to go down since the wave of inflation is tied to the pandemic inflation likely won t be under control until the virus is winker foresees the inflation rate returning to normal once labor shortages decrease fuel prices go down ports are no longer as congested and other pandemic impacts wane if you want to get inflation under control it really means getting the virus and the spread of the pandemic under control because that s really at the root cause of these things reid said optimistic projections look for inflation to begin to subside in 2022 however winkler believes it is more likely that prices won t start leveling off until 2024 that wouldn t surprise reid either he said the longer the pandemic goes on the more of those variants we re going to see and the most risk we re going to have to more supply disruptions and that s going to impact our pocketbooks reid said other news wisconsin farms received 50 million in state support program other news wisconsin unemployment rate in november ties a record low of 3 what can i do about this it seems like high inflation rates are going to stick around for a while so reid suggests people plan not panic and consider a few key areas energy wisconsinites will more acutely feel the impacts of rising gas and electric costs this winter to help offset some of those costs ask your utility company about options for budget billing consider turning your thermostat down a couple degrees and make sure your furnace has been recently inspected and cleaned wisconsinites will more acutely feel the impacts of rising gas and electric costs this winter to help offset some of those costs ask your utility company about options for budget billing consider turning your thermostat down a couple degrees and make sure your furnace has been recently inspected and cleaned housing if you re coming to the end of your rental lease consider what other options are available before re signing the lease with a rent hike if you re looking to move into a new apartment or buy a house plan ahead and think about whether this is the right time to move if you re coming to the end of your rental lease consider what other options are available before re signing the lease with a rent hike if you re looking to move into a new apartment or buy a house plan ahead and think about whether this is the right time to move transportation keep up with your vehicle maintenance and plan for emergencies such as if your car breaks down or there s an accident gas prices are an area to watch as well try to fill your tank when you notice a dip in prices if possible if you have extra income now is a good time to pay down debts reid and winkler said especially balances on variable rate credit cards as those interest rates will be among the first to go up making your debt more expensive if you don t have debts consider putting extra money into savings winkler said winkler also suggests trying to buy more u s made

brussels belgium the european union has launched legal proceedings against poland raising questions about the 27 nation bloc s legal order in october poland s constitutional court ruled that its national laws have supremacy over eu laws in areas where they conflict contradicting the bloc s regulations requiring member countries to bring their laws in line with the union s rules which are overseen by the european court of justice in launching the legal action the eu s executive branch the european commission said it considers two constitutional tribunal decisions made this year by poland which joined the union in 2004 as expressly challenging the primacy of eu law economy commissioner paolo gentiloni who announced the legal action said the rulings are in breach of the general principles of autonomy primacy effectiveness and uniform application of union law and the binding effect of rulings of the court of justice of the eu he added that the commission which proposes eu laws and supervises the way they are applied considers that the polish court no longer meets the requirements of an independent and impartial tribunal established by law as required by the eu treaty the legal action is the latest in a list of disputes between brussels and warsaw s right wing government in warsaw over the state of the country s justice system rule of law standards and media freedoms earlier this year the ecj ordered poland to pay 1 2 million per day to prevent serious and irreparable harm to eu legal order and values polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki has rejected the commission s objections and brussels questioning of the polish constitutional court s independence the court not only fulfils all independence criteria but it is a constitutional tribunal that stands guard over the constitution and ensures that it remains the highest law of the republic of poland he said as reported by the polish news agency pap however polish justice minister zbigniew ziobro said that the eu s action would help transform it into a federal state which poland s ruling party strongly opposes the logic of today s position of the european commission is obvious it is about incapacitating the polish state and polish democracy he said meanwhile john morijn professor of law at the university of groningen in the netherlands welcomed the commission s action telling the associated press it confirms that poland s constitutional court threatens basic eu principles

country distribute millions of free at home tests and boost federal resources to hospitals in need joe biden who had spent his adult life as an elected official boarded the amtrak out of washington dc

1 million in 2019 and 630 000 in 2020 the tale of how biden became wealthy after leaving office as vice president by using his fame to sell books and give speeches has been repeated many times however a deeper analysis of the numbers raises an unasked question why isn t biden much wealthier for forbes you d expect someone with a 2 5 million net worth to be worth more than 8 million if he starts with a 2 5 million net worth and gets 17 3 million when the markets are roaring so where did biden s money go well 7 million went to taxes 1 3 million to charity 180 000 to pay for home workers and an estimated 80 000 to pay for mortgage interest even if you exclude those goods you re still a few million ahead of biden s projected net worth joe biden s life and career joseph robinette biden jr was
