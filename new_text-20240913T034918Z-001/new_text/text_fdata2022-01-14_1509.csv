other officers and directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duty ii the motion to dismiss decision a claims held derivative not direct the chancery court held as a threshold matter that the stockholders claims are direct not derivative meaning the plaintiffs are suing on behalf of themselves and other stockholders not asserting the company s rights the thrust of the complaint is that the defendants impaired the public stockholders informed exercise of their redemption rights a harm that could not have run to the corporation 3 that opens the door to class actions which are more lucrative for the plaintiffs bar than derivative cases b entire fairness test held to govern the court held that the defendants conduct must be judged under the entire fairness test delaware s most onerous standard of review 4 that test is typically applied when the board is not entitled to the protections of the business judgment rule the board is not entitled to business judgment rule protections if it hasn t complied with any of four fiduciary duties care loyalty good faith candor under the entire fairness test the defendant must prove fair dealing and a fair price for stockholders that framework applies the court concluded for two reasons 1 the case involves a conflicted controller transaction mr klein through his control of the sponsor was churchill s controlling stockholder the conflict arose because he stood to profit from any deal and would lose everything without a deal whereas public stockholders would have preferred liquidation over a bad deal on top of that churchill was advised on the deal by klein s investment bank which was paid 30 5 million a fact that bolsters the conclusion that this was a conflicted controller transaction 5 2 a majority of the directors were self interested due to their ownership of founders shares and or conflicted because they were beholden to mr klein due to other business ties against the entire fairness backdrop the court held that the plaintiffs pleaded viable claims against the director defendants and the controlling stockholder for purposes of the motions to dismiss the alleged disclosure violations sufficiently give rise to a lack of overall fairness 6 the court s ruling on the standard of review substantially increases litigation risk churchill is not unusual for spacs in either its structure or in the way it compensates its independent directors the issues noted by vice chancellor will will apply identically to virtually all other delaware spacs iii takeaways the chancery court s decision in multiplan counsels caution in connection with their business combination transactions delaware spacs should consider the following 1 the board s process 2 should a financial advisor issue a fairness opinion 3 can the issue of interested independent directors be addressed 1 cons c a no 2021 0300 lww 2022 del ch lexis 1 jan 3 2022 2 id at 4 3 id at 24 4 id at 36 5 id at 43 6 id at 52 a claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against the spac s financial advisor the klein group also survived given allegations that it knew the undisclosed facts about the target a claim against churchill s cfo for breach of fiduciary duty on the other hand was dismissed for lack of supporting allegations

netrix s new ceo more acquisitions hiring on the way we ll continue to focus around cybersecurity and digital transformation continue to offer application development and provide it managed services both in the traditional it msp space as well as the mssp space we re really focusing on the recurring services we can offer mid market to enterprise businesses says russ reeder ceo of netrix prepping for the managed services future msps and mssps are living in a world of change they are facing unprecedented growth as business clients increasingly recognize the value of managed services but at the same time face massive changes in the technologies clients need particularly in security as well as a big shortage of the kinds of skilled personnel they need to service those clients enter russell reeder reeder who until recently served as ceo of infrascale a leading cloud based data protection company was wednesday unveiled as the new ceo of netrix a bannockburn ill based msp and mssp reeder is no stranger to netrix having served on the board of the company for the past year so when he was offered the chance to take over netrix after its previous ceo rob dang decided to step down he jumped on it id unit 1659132512259 type sponsored post reeder in an exclusive meeting with crn discussed not only the company but also his vision going forward which is based in part on acquisitions to gain new skills and help alleviate the shortage of skilled personnel needed to carry out the msp s mission on the top line revenue growth we have organic growth through our sales team and in organic growth through acquisition he said same thing for hiring we have our organic which is we re building our recruiting team as well as in organic which is through acquisition you know also called the acquihires and i think it s a great way to bring on team members but only as long as you find companies that have similar goal alignment and cultures for more on netrix its new ceo and its place in the msp mssp business click through the slideshow who s taking over the ceo position at infrascale i knew you were going to ask that the cfo chief financial officer rob peterson has been named ceo of infrascale so how did you get involved with netrix i ve worked with the private equity firm that acquired netrix oceansound partners it s a new fund they have three founding partners that really understand the growth side of technology companies and i love growing technology companies i love the cloud security space i mean that s the world i play in and they asked me to come on the board after the acquisition a year ago so i sat on the board of netrix for a year and when the ceo of netrix rob dang wanted to step down they started a ceo search and then asked me if i wanted to throw my name in the hat i think netrix has a perfect opportunity to really be a leader in the msp and mssp managed security service provider space and so i m very excited netrix is in acquisition mode right we may have some news coming out pretty soon here about a new acquisition so the company is growing but it s all through the backing of oceansound partners which companies did netrix acquire last year there s psc in chicago the it services business unit of prosum in in el segundo calif and the managed it business unit of contegix which is called dss distributed systems services and they re all around professional services and app development and msp and mssp so what s netrix s acquisition strategy going forward what are things the company looks for in acquisitions so we re going to continue to acquire companies in the cloud business the digital transformation space specifically around recurring revenue so those managed services that help companies with their it and their security infrastructure do potential acquisitions have to be profitable or growing we re looking at companies anywhere from i d say 20 million to 150 million in top line revenue so how big is netrix we are on the upper side of the scale we re over 120 million in net revenue with close to 800 employees how is netrix doing on the employee side are you hiring we are hiring like crazy so how difficult is it to find good employees well it s very difficult i d say it s good news and bad news the good news is that a lot of people that weren t on the market before are now on the market and so everyone s kind of taking a step back and looking at hey is there a company with more growth and a better culture where i can personally grow and professionally grow and live life happier than i am right now and so i think there s more people on the market and i d say it s harder because there are more people on the market and every company out there is competing so even though the supply has increased the demand has increased even greater than the supply has and so that makes it difficult for instance i was talking to someone that we re looking to bring in as a recruiter and so this is a person that hires for a living and they re being recruited to go to a startup company and that recruiter that was recruiting them was pitching them on how many millions of dollars the options were going to be worth when they go public two to three years from now which is totally just un honorable and i told this person this is what you do for a living you would never tell someone what their stock would be potentially worth three years from now when they go public that s just not realistic so i think people are lying to candidates and they re not being honest about really what the offer is and when people get competitive it s going to be dangerous for people as they leave their secure positions and go to a new company because any change can either be good or bad and so if they listen to the hype for a company that isn t sustainable and doesn t have the culture that is right for that employee it could be a really bad move so is acquisition a valid strategy for taking care of the hiring squeeze or not on the top line revenue growth we have organic growth through our sales team and in organic growth through acquisition same thing for hiring we have our organic which is we re building our recruiting team as well as in organic which is through acquisition you know also called the acquihires and i think it s a great way to bring on team members but only as long as you find companies that have similar goal alignment and cultures if you are just merging two teams together it doesn t always mean that there s going to be a better team and so i d say the statistics show that most acquisitions don t meet the acquisition thesis and they re really hard it s not easy to acquire companies and make them profitable and exceed what the acquisition thesis was but when you do get it right it can work out really well looking at 2022 what s your strategic focus at netrix we ll continue to focus around cybersecurity and digital transformation continue to offer application development and provide it managed services both in the traditional it msp space as well as the mssp space we re really focusing on the recurring services we can offer mid market to enterprise businesses and do you think you have a team that is ready to meet those challenges or is there anything missing we have an amazing team many of whom have been at netrix quite a long time through the acquisitions we have some new talent in the netrix team so i feel like we have a very good team to pull from and it s nice to be in this msp and mssp space where one of the services we offer is a vciso virtual chief information security officer and vcto virtual chief technology officer type offering we have all these strategic advisors that we bill out to clients to help clients make strategic decisions around technology we can have team meetings and pull in some of our team members not to say that they re going to be specifically taken off working with clients but the amount of brain power that we have access to within our team is amazing

by daniella diaz cnn two senators from different sides of the aisle have both introduced similar bills that would ban lawmakers and their families from buying and selling stocks while in office democratic sen jon ossoff of georgia introduced a bill this week with fellow democratic sen mark kelly of arizona called the ban congressional stock trading act which would require lawmakers their spouses and dependent children to place their stock portfolios into blind trusts if passed the legislation would not allow lawmakers to use inside information to trade stocks and make money republican sen josh hawley of missouri introduced a very similar bill wednesday called the banning insider trading in congress act which would also ban lawmakers from trading stocks while in office there are some key differences between the two proposals ossoff s legislation would apply the ban to any dependent children in addition to the spouses while hawley s bill would not also ossoff s legislation would have the congressional ethics committee oversee the issue while hawley s bill would have the government accountability office audit and probably the biggest difference ossoff s legislation would fine the lawmakers from their salaries if they broke the law while hawley s would require lawmakers in the wrong to return their profits to the american people through the treasury department a similar bipartisan bill was introduced on the house side led by democratic rep abigail spanberger of virginia and republican rep chip roy of texas that would require lawmakers to put their assets into qualified blind trusts when they enter office the bills from the senators come after an investigation by business insider found that 52 members of congress had violated the federal stock act which is meant to stop insider trading by government officials the issue of lawmakers trading stocks has gained traction on capitol hill in recent weeks and has widespread bipartisan support but is unlikely to get a vote in the house while nancy pelosi is the house speaker because of her opposition to the legislation pelosi said during a news conference last month she doesn t think members or members spouses should be banned from trading in individual stocks while serving in congress no the california democrat said when asked about a ban we have a responsibility to report on the stock but i m not familiar with that five month review but if the people aren t reporting they should be when pressed why members shouldn t be halted from trades while they serve in congress pelosi dismissed the need for a ban saying this is a free market and people we are a free market economy they should be able to participate in that senate majority leader chuck schumer s office did not respond to cnn s request for comment on the proposals the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

toronto north american stock markets moved lower as the technology sector was hurt by comments from the dovish federal reserve s vice chair nominee that interest rates have to increase soon to fight inflation at her senate confirmation hearing thursday lael brainard said she s open to rate hikes in march because inflation is too high the u s consumer price index rose to a near four decade high in december at seven per cent while there s little difference between comments from brainard and fed chairman jerome powell his testimony this week was viewed positively while hers was seen as surprising said kevin headland co chief investment strategist at manulife investment management when you get her on the side of rate hikes are going to happen it seems to be the reaction he said in an interview headland said rate hikes from such a low base aren t negative but merely a recognition that we no longer need ultra accommodative policy used to fight the covid crisis i think the market is paying too much attention perhaps to some of the headline news and some of the talks out there and less on the actual fundamentals that we re in a solid economy despite the near term omicron variant reactions still the prospect of higher interest rates is particularly negative for technology stocks that have thrived amid low rates and are among the biggest companies in the u s if i look at the tsx what is driving that down is really shopify and i think it s just being dragged down with its peers in the u s headland said the s p tsx composite index closed down 102 04 points to 21 292 96 in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 176 70 points at 36 113 62 the s p 500 index was down 67 32 points at 4 659 03 while the nasdaq composite was down 381 58 points or 2 5 per cent to a three month low of 14 806 81 shopify lost 8 8 per cent to drive the canadian technology sector down 2 7 per cent materials and energy decreased on lower metal crude oil and natural gas prices the february gold contract was down us 5 90 at us 1 821 40 an ounce and the march copper contract was down 3 1 cents at nearly us 4 55 a pound the february crude oil contract was down 52 cents at us 82 12 per barrel and the february natural gas contract was down 58 7 cents at us 4 27 per mmbtu that sent shares of birchcliff energy ltd down 6 8 per cent and crescent point energy corp 5 0 per cent lower iamgold corp fell 6 4 per cent headland said the decreases reflect a little pause after an unsustainable growth in prices especially crude rather than anything negative about commodities the prospect that omicron is peaking in the u s and other parts of the world suggests demand will pick up in the spring as economies reopen he said we shouldn t be looking necessarily at one or two days of volatility to judge the outlook on commodities clothing retailer aritzia inc rose nearly 19 per cent to lead the tsx after reporting stellar quarterly results the vancouver based company is an example of how the market will respond this quarter to solid earnings the market is going to reward those companies that meet or exceed expectations and also have solid guidance headland said noting he expects the fourth quarter will be strong albeit not as good as recent quarters banks are among those that are expected to shine the heavyweight financials sector increased thursday as banks performed well in anticipation of higher interest rates and improved net interest margins the canadian dollar traded for 80 10 cents us compared with 79 94 cents us on wednesday headland said the loonie is getting a tailwind from anticipation that the bank of canada will raise rates more often this year than the federal reserve this report by the canadian press was first published jan 13 2022 companies in this story tsx shop tsx bir tsx cpg tsx atz tsx img tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x ross marowits the canadian press

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story it s hard to get economists and financial analysts to agree on much of anything but most experts agree the new year will bring significant financial headwinds unlike anything we ve seen in the past several years if you re retired or nearing retirement these challenges could be especially dangerous for your nest egg these are three of the biggest threats to your retirement savings in 2022 threat 1 soaring inflation are you concerned about inflation if so you re not alone according to cnbc more than 7 out of 10 investors 71 believe that rising inflation will negatively impact their retirement savings inflation hasn t been on anyone s radar for decades because rates were so low but that swiftly changed in 2021 when inflation hit the highest rates in nearly 40 years the fed tried to brush it off by saying it was transitory but the monthly consumer price index report told a different story inflation rates kept climbing and it wasn t temporary today every single american is feeling the sting of higher prices you re paying more for groceries gasoline and just about every household staple prices for real estate construction new and used cars and travel have also gone through the roof inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hitman said ronald reagan the people who get hit the hardest by inflation are those who are in or nearing retirement here s why when everything is more expensive and you re living on a strict budget you re either forced to make steep sacrifices to your lifestyle or take bigger withdrawals from your savings which could cause you to run out of money far too soon threat 2 higher taxes are coming in the past couple of years the government has spent trillions of dollars on economic stimulus new infrastructure and social policy bills as a result our national debt has soared to nearly 30 trillion what does that mean for our economy and how does it impact you economist and inflation expert peter schiff explained it perfectly when it comes to stimulus most people forget that it has to be paid for government doesn t have money of its own it has to take it from the private sector before it can spend it it s either taken through taxation today or borrowed and taken through taxation tomorrow in other words the government must raise taxes to pay for this 30 trillion in debt there s no other way to pay for it we re not certain what these tax increases will look like but we could see significant hikes on federal income taxes capital gains taxes corporate taxes estate taxes and the taxes on your tax deferred retirement accounts any tax increases could impact you directly or indirectly but even if you re not considered wealthy you could still feel the effects this is especially dangerous if you re in or nearing retirement higher taxes on your ira 401k and other tax deferred accounts could leave you with a fraction of the money you were counting on for retirement threat 3 it s going to be a challenging year for investors we ve all been through a lot with the pandemic including isolation disease and death despite a short correction caused by the pandemic investors have had it pretty darn good lately nobody can argue that according to a recent post in the wall street journal between the beginning of 2019 and the end of 2021 the s p 500 returned 100 4 counting reinvested dividends so the s p doubled in just 3 years that s quite a performance the post went on to say the last time u s stocks doubled in only three years was from 1997 through 1999 just before they fell by 40 the fed recently committed to raising interest rates to tighten its monetary policy soaring inflation may cause this to happen sooner than originally anticipated so it s safe to say you should not expect the same stock market returns in 2022 some economists have been arguing for a while that the stock market is overvalued and a correction is imminent sometimes there are times to make money in the stock market sometimes there are times not to lose money said david tepper billionaire investor and hedge fund manager the closer you are to retirement the less appetite you have for risk any potential portfolio losses coupled with your need to make consistent withdrawals could deplete your savings faster than covid canceled air travel in 2020 how to grow your nest egg in the new year so it begs the question given these significant headwinds how do you grow your nest egg today our response is simply this when you re faced with a challenge sometimes it s best to go around the mountain believe it or not the fastest and safest way to grow your nest egg this year could be by lowering your taxes in retirement after all the less money you pay the irs the more money you keep in your pocket not many people think of tax planning as a way of growing their wealth but if you take advantage of some little known strategies you could save tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes to learn exactly how much money you could save in taxes when you retire schedule a free

montreal the federal government says the vaccine mandate for truckers crossing into canada from the united states will come into effect this saturday as planned despite a previous statement from the canada border services agency that said canadian truck drivers would be exempt in a release thursday health minister jean yves duclos along with the transport and public safety ministers said the cbsa statement from wednesday evening was provided in error and that canadian truckers must be vaccinated if they want to avoidquarantine and a pre arrival molecular test starting this weekend this has not changed the cabinet ministers said our teams have been in touch with industry representatives to ensure they have the correct information unvaccinated american big riggers will be turned back at the border beginning jan 15 the ministers said with the u s preparing to impose similar restrictions on canadian truckers on jan 22 government representatives offered no explanation for the incorrect information emailed to media more than 20 hours earlier up to 26 000 of the 160 000 drivers who make regular cross border trips will be sidelined as a result of the mandate adding further bottlenecks and potential price hikes to the flow of goods ranging from produce to auto parts and medical devices say the canadian trucking alliance and the american trucking associations the federal conservatives as well as trade groups representing oil manufacturing and export companies called on ottawa this week to postpone the impending deadline which was announced on nov 19 today s reversal by the trudeau government will only make canada s cost of living crisis worse by driving the price of basic essentials like groceries up conservative transport critic melissa lantsman said in a statement at a time when inflation is already at a record high canadians will be the ones paying the price for the trudeau government s poor policy decisions bison transport ceo rob penner says the new rule will hamstring long haulers who carry the bulk of the roughly 24 billion in food products imported to canada annually from the u s according to the united states trade representative i don t know if it s grocery shelves empty or just significantly more expensive meals said penner whose winnipeg based fleet of 1 000 tractor trailers carries retail goods and food and beverages into canada some 30 000 trucks roll across the border each day hauling nearly 850 million in freight according to 2020 figures from the u s bureau of transportation statistics teamsters canada which represents 15 000 truckers in canada says the logistics chain is already missing tens of thousands of drivers due to poor working conditions blaming professional drivers is not the answer spokesman st√©phane lacroix said in an email referring to possible cost increases or stock shortages it is the labour shortage that is primarily responsible not the pandemic and its impact government officials met virtually with union and corporate representatives on wednesday where the latter were told that the trucking industry s exemption from the vaccine mandate would end saturday as planned according to canadian trucking alliance president stephen laskowski canadian truckers who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated will need to undergo a 14 day quarantine they will also need to meet requirements for pre entry arrival and day 8 testing the ministers said thursday the arrivecan app or web portal remains the only way to submit vaccination information including for american truckers starting saturday the border services agency said in an email tuesday further proof of vaccination may be required at the border cbsa spokeswoman rebecca purdy wrote this report by the canadian press was first published jan 13 2022 christopher reynolds the canadian press
champaign ill new research offers an alternative perspective on adaptation to climate threats in southeast asia sean kennedy a professor of urban and regional planning at the university of illinois urbana champaign looked at the ways that small cocoa farmers in indonesia are adapting to threats from climate change including prolonged drought he found that corporations are shaping the behavior of small farmers fixing their labor in place in a way that alleviates the corporations economic displacement but increases the vulnerability of the farmers he reported his research findings in an article in annals of the american association of geographers recent trends in the indonesian cocoa sector offer a lens to examine the politics of displacement in the context of socioeconomic and climatic change kennedy said climate change can result in various forms of displacement but the consequences of efforts designed to minimize displacement haven t received the same attention he said the farmers in the region he studied are all smallholder producers with at least 1 million families engaged in cocoa farming cocoa productivity has rapidly declined due to climate change pests and poor soil health as well as consumer demands for sustainable cocoa necessitating increased investment in its production a growing number of smallholders have abandoned cocoa production often the goal of climate adaptation is to allow people to stay in place for instance building a sea wall to protect against flooding managing wildfires or increasing a crop s productivity in response to drought kennedy said however the cocoa farmers historically have been highly mobile moving to seek supplemental income from nonagricultural jobs and in response to seasonal variations and climatic disruptions they also could choose to grow other commodity crops he said but chocolate manufacturers needed farmers to stay in place and continue to produce cocoa beans kennedy examined the efforts of mars inc to manage climate related supply chain risks like other chocolate manufacturers for mars the combined impact of climate related productivity declines increased demand for certified chocolate and the growing unwillingness of smallholder producers to engage in cocoa cultivation have resulted in significant supply threats kennedy wrote climate smart cocoa aims to transform and reorient farming systems to decrease greenhouse gas emissions boost adaptive capacity and improve productivity while supporting incomes the corporation s strategies included standardization of farming practices and creation of financial dependencies mars created training programs that focus on techniques to increase production including the use of fertilizers and pesticides through purchase agreements cocoa producers were required to participate in training buy plant stock fertilizers and pesticides through mars and sell their beans to the corporation bypassing the local traders that in the past had provided supplies and financing arrangements and bought the beans credit was provided through microfinance arrangements that used the farmers land as collateral the result kennedy said is that farmers are beholden financially to the corporation which dictates production practices they cannot abandon cocoa production to grow other commodity crops or pursue a different source of income because their assets are tied up in those arrangements when some entity is saying here s a climate adaptation program intended to keep people in place often staying in place is not the best way to adapt to climate change people have been adapting to climatic variation for a long time in ways that often involved moving around kennedy said mars has avoided being displaced economically but it is transferring the risks it faced onto others outreach programs that are framed as benefiting small producers are actually benefiting corporate producers rather than the people on farms growing cocoa the research shows that climate adaptation is not limited to smallholder farmers and their environments but is part of the global economic landscape and that corporate sustainability efforts are actually a transfer of risk from the corporations to the producers kennedy wrote
california s governor rejected releasing robert f kennedy assassin sirhan sirhan from prison more than a half century after the 1968 killing left a deep wound during one of the us s darkest times governor gavin newsom who has cited rfk as his political hero and embraced the historical significance of his decision rejected a recommendation from a two person panel of parole commissioners newsom said sirhan now 77 poses an unreasonable threat to public safety mr sirhan s assassination of senator kennedy is among the most notorious crimes in american history newsom wrote in his decision after decades in prison he has failed to address the deficiencies that led him to assassinate senator kennedy mr sirhan lacks the insight that would prevent him from making the same types of dangerous decisions he made in the past he said factors in his decision including sirhan s refusal to accept responsibility for his crime his lack of insight and the accountability required to support his safe release his failure to disclaim violence committed in his name and his failure to mitigate his risk factors sirhan will be scheduled for a new parole hearing no later than february 2023 sirhan will ask a judge to overturn newsom s denial said his defence lawyer angela berry we fully expect that judicial review of the governor s decision will show that the governor got it wrong she said state law holds that inmates are supposed to be paroled unless they pose a current unreasonable public safety risk she said adding that not an iota of evidence exists to suggest mr sirhan is still a danger to society she said the parole process has become politicised and newsom chose to overrule his own experts on the parole board ignoring the law parole commissioners found sirhan suitable for release because of his impressive extensive record of rehabilitation over the last half century she said since the mid 1980 s mr sirhan has consistently been found by prison psychologists and psychiatrists to not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public kennedy the us senator from new york was shot moments after he claimed victory in california s pivotal democratic presidential primary advertisement five others were wounded during the assassination at the ambassador hotel in los angeles his brother president john f kennedy had been assassinated in 1963 the parole panel s recommendation in august to release sirhan divided the kennedy family with two of rfk s sons douglas kennedy and robert f kennedy jr supporting his release but six of kennedy s nine surviving children and ethel kennedy rfk s wife urged newsom to block his parole the panel s decision was based in part on several new california laws since he was denied parole in 2016 the 15th time he had lost his bid for release commissioners were required to consider that sirhan committed his crime at a young age when he was 24 that he now is elderly and that the christian palestinian who immigrated from jordan had suffered childhood trauma from the conflict in the middle east in addition los angeles county prosecutors did not object to his parole following district attorney george gascon s policy that prosecutors should not be involved in deciding whether prisoners are ready for release the decision had a personal element for newsom a fellow democrat who displays rfk photos in his official and home offices one of them is of kennedy with newsom s late father newsom has previously reflected on the gravity of having sirhan s fate in his hands saying it was an emotional issue that echoed back to the turbulent 1960s and reopened memories many want to forget sirhan originally was sentenced to death but that sentence was commuted to life when the california supreme court briefly outlawed capital punishment in 1972 he now has a heart condition and has survived prostate cancer valley fever and having his throat slashed by another prisoner in 2019 said ms berry munir sirhan has said his older brother can live with him if he is freed and not deported to jordan sirhan sirhan waived his right to fight deportation during his parole hearing the white haired sirhan called mr kennedy the hope of the world but he stopped short of taking full responsibility for a shooting he said he does not recall because he was drunk it pains me the knowledge for such a horrible deed if i did in fact do that sirhan said

977 000 or 0 47 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 to 3 97 million or 1 90 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 management commentary as we stated in prior press releases our plan was to produce and ship aggressively in the first six months of fiscal 2022 in preparation for the facility relocation and then reduce production levels and net sales in the last half of the fiscal year due to the facility relocation we surpassed our goals in the first nine months of the 2022 fiscal year we expect sales in fiscal 2022 fourth quarter to be significantly lower due to the planned facility relocation our current estimate is for net sales in the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter to be approximately 1 5 million production levels are expected to be above the 1 5 million quarterly level and we expect some inventory build up bookings were lighter than we hoped in the quarter as we continue to see delays in contract awards we expect our largest contract with raytheon to be awarded during the fiscal fourth quarter we are still experiencing significant supply chain delays on certain items this is symptomatic of the electronics components shortages affecting the automotive and other industries we will continue to work with suppliers to attempt to address and mitigate these disruptions we believe our results over the first nine months have shown the potential operating leverage the business has unfortunately the continued impact of the coronavirus has hurt bookings by limiting our ability to make site visits to our existing customers and potential new customers to show them solitron s capabilities to meet their needs once we are able to make visits it will be a slow process as site visits frequently lead to further engagement and bookings which can be six to twelve months after the initial visit typically sales are then six to nine months after receipt of bookings in the interim we continue to focus on increasing our web based marketing and are pleased with the page views our newer products are getting we are continuing to manufacture and deliver sample products to customers to review in the meantime our primary focus over the next three months will continue to be completing the new facility upgrades relocating to the new facility and adjusting our cost structure we anticipate that once we complete our relocation to our new facility and headquarters we will realize annual aggregate cost savings of approximately 1 0 million consisting of the elimination of the 40 000 monthly rent reduced costs for gases and utilities due to the smaller footprint of the new facility and headquarters the company s decision to not relocate and operate our wafer fab at the new facility and headquarters payroll savings and insurance cost savings as our balance sheet has improved we have begun and will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we would consider everything from small tuck in acquisitions up to a significant acquisition that would involve the issuance of both debt and equity if we believe it will increase the intrinsic value of the company on a per share basis we make no guarantees that we will be able to find a suitable acquisition candidate or that we will be able to consummate any such suitable acquisition on favorable terms and within a favorable timeframe or at all solitron devices inc statements of operations

with inflation rapidly eating away purchasing power it is imperative to invest in a vehicle that gives returns above the inflation rate the kenyan inflation rate is 5 73 per cent according to data from the central bank of kenya in the us it stands at seven per cent the highest level since 1982 while allocating your money in offshore stocks it is advisable to benchmark on the exchange traded fund etf such as the sp500 etf to achieve market returns or you can concentrate your allocations to a smaller batch of companies but to achieve your goals it is important to understand the stock market its cycles its rotations its sectors and industries individual stocks and the economic environment where the stocks are operating this involves putting in hours of research and study the current economic environment in the us is characterised by abnormally high inflation a very low unemployment rate of 3 9 per cent an ultra low federal funds rate of 0 1 0 25 per cent and a massive quantitative easing programme of 120 billion every month that started reducing by 15 billion a month since december this is a perfect recipe to stimulate economic growth the downside is inflation that is causing high consumer prices and hurting household budgets to address this threat the us has promised to conduct at least three interest rate hikes this year with the first expected in march experienced stock traders know that an interest rate rise largely benefits the banking industry there is a strong possibility that banking stocks will do well under these conditions assuming that there will be no more covid 19 restrictions and that economic activity accelerates in 2022 in 2021 both west texas intermediate wti oil and brent oil made 55 5 per cent and 50 5 per cent gains respectively this led to a similar performance in energy stocks across the us and europe the growth was largely attributed to the lowering of covid 19 restrictions reopening of global economies and a surge in economic activity that drove oil demand higher this year the price of oil is expected to continue going up towards 100 per barrel as global demand continues rising this is already gaining momentum as investors shrugged off omicron s fears and bet on higher oil prices driving the prices over four per cent higher this could in turn increase revenues in the energy sector thereby delivering alpha returns for the year this being a unique year that starts at a seven per cent inflation rate companies will be forced to raise product prices and transfer the inflation cost to consumers on the other hand buyers may reduce the expenditure on consumer discretionary products and maintain the quality and quantity of purchases in the consumer staples sector what this means is that people will still buy bread and milk but may find it harder to purchase a new set of furniture or vehicle because their purchasing power is eroded by inflation as an investor it makes good sense to purchase consumer staple stocks as these companies have the power to increase prices while maintaining demand for their products any consumer staple stock that demonstrates a strong pricing power will be a favourite of investors looking to exploit this market feature investors will also be considering allocating some of their money to luxury goods stocks luxury products are classified as veblen goods high quality goods that are made well are exclusive and are a status symbol and their demand tends to increase with higher prices since such products are considered a show of wealth and status when their respective price increases they are seen as more attractive as they represent an even high status some firms that produce luxury items will offer a limited quantity of each product so when they raise the price and demand increases customers hurry to buy more as the existing supply reduces to a defined maximum supply this means that the company can easily hike prices during an inflation period to make extra revenue over the past 22 years technology stocks have demonstrated a record of delivering strong growth even in times of adversity this is because they can easily scale their products while minimising expenses over this period it has become difficult to separate technology stocks from growth stocks as they have overly been the ones beating the overall market returns year over year these includes rapidly growing companies such as tesla google amazon netflix facebook twitter and apple the best time to start investing was yesterday the next best time is today
managers at platinum and antipodes have highlighted the problems faced by the dominance of mega cap tech names in global markets the s p 500 was the best performing market in 2021 with returns of 36 6 but five companies microsoft alphabet apple nvidia and tesla accounted for one third of this return apple microsoft and alphabet were individually worth more than all listed australian businesses combined according to factset the dominance of these individual companies meant there were fewer companies which were outperforming the index leading to higher market concentration low breadth and high market cap concentration isn t a backdrop conducive to markets rising higher it suggests the market will be more vulnerable to shocks antipodes said the market is crowding into an increasingly narrow subset of stocks large cap tech the firm referenced the hhi index which measures company size relative to total market capitalisation and said it had reached extreme levels platinum international fund managers andrew clifford clay smolinski and nikola dvornak added the dominance of a few companies masked the performance of weaker stocks these companies mask the weaker performance of stocks in general markets outside the us offered only 14 in aud in 2021 successive waves of higher interest rates have shown up weaknesses in valuation arguments in hotter areas we expect this continue in 2022 platinum said with this in mind the platinum international fund had zero exposure to the largest tech companies in its top 10 holdings and had only 20 allocated to north america however the antipodes global fund held microsoft as its largest holding at a 3 6 weighting part of a 29 weighting to north america

977 000 or 0 47 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 to 3 97 million or 1 90 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 management commentary as we stated in prior press releases our plan was to produce and ship aggressively in the first six months of fiscal 2022 in preparation for the facility relocation and then reduce production levels and net sales in the last half of the fiscal year due to the facility relocation we surpassed our goals in the first nine months of the 2022 fiscal year we expect sales in fiscal 2022 fourth quarter to be significantly lower due to the planned facility relocation our current estimate is for net sales in the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter to be approximately 1 5 million production levels are expected to be above the 1 5 million quarterly level and we expect some inventory build up bookings were lighter than we hoped in the quarter as we continue to see delays in contract awards we expect our largest contract with raytheon to be awarded during the fiscal fourth quarter we are still experiencing significant supply chain delays on certain items this is symptomatic of the electronics components shortages affecting the automotive and other industries we will continue to work with suppliers to attempt to address and mitigate these disruptions we believe our results over the first nine months have shown the potential operating leverage the business has unfortunately the continued impact of the coronavirus has hurt bookings by limiting our ability to make site visits to our existing customers and potential new customers to show them solitron s capabilities to meet their needs once we are able to make visits it will be a slow process as site visits frequently lead to further engagement and bookings which can be six to twelve months after the initial visit typically sales are then six to nine months after receipt of bookings in the interim we continue to focus on increasing our web based marketing and are pleased with the page views our newer products are getting we are continuing to manufacture and deliver sample products to customers to review in the meantime our primary focus over the next three months will continue to be completing the new facility upgrades relocating to the new facility and adjusting our cost structure we anticipate that once we complete our relocation to our new facility and headquarters we will realize annual aggregate cost savings of approximately 1 0 million consisting of the elimination of the 40 000 monthly rent reduced costs for gases and utilities due to the smaller footprint of the new facility and headquarters the company s decision to not relocate and operate our wafer fab at the new facility and headquarters payroll savings and insurance cost savings as our balance sheet has improved we have begun and will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we would consider everything from small tuck in acquisitions up to a significant acquisition that would involve the issuance of both debt and equity if we believe it will increase the intrinsic value of the company on a per share basis we make no guarantees that we will be able to find a suitable

article 3 months old international jan 14 2022 part 3 final of a deep dive in today s consequences from a decade and more of exceptionally low interest rates by ahead of the herd s rick mills richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information lower interest rates and massive asset purchases by central banks are the monetary tools of choice when it comes to restoring shocked financial systems the idea being that making the cost of borrowing cheap for individuals and businesses will entice them to spend spend spend the downside of quantitative easing qe for short is a major accumulation of global debt of which there are three kinds government corporate and household the institute of international finance iif found that governments companies and households borrowed 24 trillion last year to offset the pandemic s economic toll bringing total global debt to an all time high at the end of 2020 of 281 trillion government debt even with vaccine rollouts low interest rates worldwide are keeping debt above pre pandemic levels the federal reserve continues to purchase 120 billion per month in government bonds and mortgage backed securities as part of its quantitative easing policy the bank of canada s qe program was scaled back in july but is still being maintained at 2 billion per week despite over 75 of the country 12 and older fully vaccinated against the coronavirus global debt more than doubled from us 116 trillion in 2007 to 244 trillion in 2019 the iif estimates that governments with large budget deficits are expected to add another 10 trillion in 2021 last year south africa and india had the biggest increases in government debt ratios with china seeing the biggest jump in emerging markets followed by turkey kor ea and the united arab emirates among mature economies france and spain had the sharpest increases in non financial industry debt to gdp ratios iif data showed another set of figures via the world economic forum wef found that falling revenues combined with costly pandemic relief measures increased global debt by 20 trillion between the third quarter of 2019 and the end of 2020 excluding the financial sector canada s debt to gdp ratio climbed by nearly 80 last year the highest of any developed country in a december 2020 report rbc wealth management contributed more illuminating statistics that paint a grim picture of a growing global debt burden powered by pandemic related borrowing the canadian bank quoted the imf in stating that the public debt of advanced economies has climbed nearly 27 since january 2020 and now sits beyond the greater than 120 of gdp reached after world war ii the united states and japan are the two most indebted economies accounting for half of total global government debt see the pie chart below global debt is a tamer 102 of gdp because many of the largest emerging economies have lower debt burdens however it s still a record noted rbc the united states is the obvious poster child of excessive debt accumulation according to usdebtclock org the current national debt sits at 28 7 trillion and it is increasing with each tick of the clock source usdebtclock org the next round of government spending involves president joe biden s 1 trillion infrastructure bill just passed by the senate but not yet approved by the house and a 3 5 trillion anti poverty and climate plan senate democrats hope to get passed this fall debt is clearly a major limitation on a growing economy according to the world bank if the debt to gdp ratio exceeds 77 for an extended period of time every percentage point of debt above this level costs a country 0 017 percentage points in economic growth the us is currently at 125 7 so that is 48 7 basis points multiplied by 0 017 0 82 nearly a full percentage point of economic growth the balance notes that a combination of recessions defense budget growth and tax cuts has raised the debt to gdp ratio to record levels throughout the years us military spending has been a major contributor to the debt during the first iraq war in 1991 the debt to gdp ratio hit 54 between 2001 and 2020 america s war on terror consumed 6 4 trillion helping to elevate the debt to gdp ratio from 55 in the year of 9 11 to 127 in 2020 the current national debt of 28 7 trillion and the current debt to gdp ratio of 125 7 doesn t include the 1 trillion infrastructure bill before the house nor the 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan we also have to add the federal budget numbers president biden s budget for full year fy 2022 totals 6 011 trillion more than any other previous budget the us government estimates that for fy 2022 revenues will again fall short of expenditures leaving a 1 8 trillion deficit better than the projected 3 trillion deficit for 2021 almost the same as last year s 3t but it still means nearly 2 trillion will be added to the national debt cnbc notes the budgetary shortfall this year is equivalent to 13 4 of gdp the second largest level since 1945 and exceeded only by 2020 spending adding it all up you get 28 7t national debt 1 trillion infrastructure bill 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan 6t fy 2022 budget spending 3t 2021 deficit 1 8t 2022 deficit 44t by 2022 the national debt presuming all of the spending commitments use borrowed or printed money will be approaching 44 trillion the fed is severely constrained in how much it can raise interest rates to quell rising inflation due to ballooning debt following 4 5 trillion spent on pandemic relief and trillions more to come through biden administration spending along with the continuation of quantitative easing what i like to call quantifornication to the tune of 120 billion in asset purchases per month the fed has in one year doubled its balance sheet to around 8 3 trillion source us federal reserve according to the committee for a responsible federal budget the federal government this year will spend 300 billion on interest on the national debt this is the equivalent of 9 of all federal revenues collected or more than 2 400 per household a today s debt levels each 1 rise in the interest rate would increase interest expenditures by roughly 225 billion on a per household basis a 1 interest rate hike would increase interest costs by 1 805 to 4 210 quantitative easing is a technique used by the us federal reserve and other central banks to stimulate the economy in times of crisis the fed buys up securities from its member banks thereby adding new money to the economy this is where the expression the fed is printing money comes from it s a way of funding new expenditures without actually dipping into the federal budget the idea is to free up more money for banks to make loans to individuals and businesses thus growing the economy the money is not cash but credit that is added to banks deposits when it wants to print money the fed lowers the benchmark federal funds rate and banks in turn lower their interest rates making capital more affordable so that businesses and investors are more likely to borrow the fed used quantitative easing in the wake of the 2008 09 financial crisis and it did so again in 2020 to deal with the coronavirus pandemic qe continues although the fed has stated it wants to start tapering its monthly asset purchases qe was successful in preventing a financial meltdown during 2008 and 2020 but the effect has been a reliance on cheap credit that has fueled both a stock market bubble and a real estate bubble that many observers believe is in danger of popping bond investors have also become addicted to fed stimulus excessive money printing not only in the united states but britain and the eu is continuing to devalue currencies at an alarming rate this by definition is inflation because it takes more units of currency to buy the same amount of goods as before for which precious metals namely gold and silver are the best defence inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies and eventually they become worthless the dollar has lost 90 of its purchasing power since 1950 by contrast since 1972 gold has gone from 35 oz to 1 800 source goldprice org corporate debt according to the iif global debt in the financial sector hit 86 of gdp in 2020 the largest increase since 2007 and the first annual rise since 2016 the debt of non financial corporations has also grown significantly nearly doubling from 46 6 trillion in the second quarter of 2009 to 81t in the third quarter of 2020 says statista chinese corporations had the most debt in 2019 at 21 2t exceeding us corporate debt of 16t the same year in the third quarter of 2020 the coronavirus pandemic pushed the debt of nonfinancial corporations worldwide to 101 of global gdp total debt of non financial corporations in major developed and emerging economies 2006 19 source statista statista shows us based telecom firm at t carrying the largest long term debt in 2020 at more than 147 billion followed by ford motor company whose debt exceeded 114b in the united states companies in need of cash issue bonds in the corporate bond market buyers of these bonds are essentially lending companies money and picking up a coupon interest as long as they continue to hold that company s debt according to the federal reserve and the securities industry and financial markets association sifa us companies now face the highest debt levels on record at more than 10 5 trillion in 40 years the amount of corporate bonds outstanding has grown by over 2 000 from 16 of us gdp in 1980 to 50 of gdp in 2020 forbes notes the level of corporate debt is actually much higher because the above mentioned figures only include fixed income debt not loans and lines of credit these debt levels were massive even before the coronavirus about 9 trillion with rock bottom interest rates left over from the financial crisis making it very easy for corporations to borrow money according to accounting firm deloitte the corporate debt surge in 2020 was likely due to at least one of three factors 1 some businesses were forced to borrow to keep operations running as large swaths of the economy shut down 2 some had to invest in technology to support remote work and 3 not all businesses were worse off due to covid 19 consequently some of them needed to borrow to grow their enterprises whatever the reason for rising leverage deloitte found that non financial business debt at the end of 2020 was 82 of gdp higher than the pre pandemic third quarter 2019 ratio of 75 there has been talk of a corporate bond bubble triggering the next financial crisis after the fed took extraordinary measures at the beginning of the pandemic to buy corporate bonds part of a 250 billion program funded by the cares act questions emerged about why the fed was purchasing the bonds of companies that really didn t need their help including such economic stalwarts as microsoft visa and home depot moreover several of them had junk bond as opposed to investment grade status such as heinz ford and macy s the corporate bond market is hanging on right now by a very precarious string how long can we continue to live on red ink asks a march 12 cnbc video on the subject most of the 10 6t in us corporate debt is made up of bonds the other part is loans which as mentioned are divided into investment grade and high yield junk bonds independent ratings agencies decide on the classification based on a company s ability to make their debt payments to bondholders the danger is if the bond market crashes which could happen if enough companies are unable to pay their debts ie redeem bonds upon maturity plus interest the bond market is several times larger than the stock market amplifying the risk of a crash when the bond market blows a gasket the damage is much worse for the economy states the cnbc video right now the corporate bond picture looks good because interest rates are so low again it s very easy for companies to issue bonds and to get investors to purchase them they much prefer to do this rather than dip into their own cash piles or issue stock which dilutes the share float but problems occur when companies get reckless with their debt resulting in a status downgrade currently there are a number of companies teetering on the edge of investment grade status when they are downgraded to junk bond status a lot of bond investors sell these fallen angels in 2020 50 companies worth 200 billion in debt were downgraded including macy s ford and occidental compared to 40 50b in a normal year companies unable to find enough investors to buy their corporate bonds may go bankrupt equally bad if a company is unable to pay back the principal plus interest on bonds when they reach maturity the firm could default on its loans the number of bankruptcies during all of last year and the first quarter of 2021 were above average according to forbes in march 2021 there were 61 corporate bankruptcies double the amount in february with consumer discretionary companies and industrials comprising the largest number of business failures as the cbnc video notes defaults last year would have been higher if not for the fed buying corporate debt for the first time the amount of bonds that the fed actually purchased was very small versus what they could just the fed announcing it setting it up doing a little bit was more validating to the market than the actual need desire to buy everything the huge amount of corporate debt is benign for now but what happens if the fed hikes interest rates to deal with rising inflation this is a very real possibility if inflation stays above the fed s 2 target for much longer it currently sits at 5 4 even a 100 150 basis point interest rate could spell doom for a company that s living on the edge says the cbnc video referring to so called zombie companies that are drowning in debt to the point where they could default on their loans these companies are only making interest payments they re not investing in their businesses or employees meaning they ultimately are dragging down national economic growth yet poorly managed companies are still qualifying for loans and issuing debt an analysis earlier this year by s p global market intelligence found that a record high 67 4 billion was issued in the first quarter from borrowers with a b corporate rating on at least one side that represents 40 of total issuance during the quarter note that for any full year the share of comparable b issuance has never been above 36 if ability to repay debt is the main concern the above mentioned deloitte report makes some interesting observations first analysis of the data by cohorts reveals that the top 50 companies by market value are leading the debt surge with only 5 of 1 000 companies accounting for 30 7 of the group s total long term debt second ability to repay debt has deteriorated for all companies except the largest ones for example during the pandemic the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda fell by 18 2 for the 501 1 000 and by 16 7 for the 101 500 cohort the top 10 cohort was better placed than others in its net debt to ebitda ratio third the pandemic affected most companies ability to pay interest on their debt again with the exception of the top 10 cohort the interest coverage ratio a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes ebit fell for all cohorts except the top 10 in 2020 with ebit dropping by 40 3 for the 501 1 000 cohort and by 28 5 for the 101 500 one deloitte s analysis suggests there is inequality with respect to corporate debt and companies ability to pay it off only 5 of 1 000 companies account for 30 7 of this group s debt and these companies are least likely to default on their debts or fail to pay the interest on their debts this means 95 of the other 1 000 companies in deloitte s study group hold 70 of the rest of the debt with the pandemic impacting most s ability to repay how many of these 950 companies are zombies on the edge of bankruptcy or are close to being downgraded to junk bond status the 10 6 trillion in corporate debt is certainly something we as investors need to be aware of and keep tracking so as to stay ahead of a potential meltdown if many companies begin defaulting on their loans household debt in the united states consumer spending makes up nearly 70 of gdp meaning the ability of households to spend and to handle debt burdens is of utmost importance globally the figure is similar household debt is defined by stats canada as mortgage debt on all residences and real estate and consumer debt including debt outstanding on credit cards personal and home equity lines of credit secured and unsecured loans from banks and other institutions and unpaid bills in its recent report rbc notes that in some countries household debt is of greater concern than government debt in other countries the reverse is true for example in the decade following the financial crisis canada s household debt rose from 93 of gdp to 106 compared to federal debt falling from 47 to 40 whereas in the us government debt has surpassed household debt and continues to swell in the oecd bar graph below countries are ranked according to their total household debt as a percentage of net income denmark leads the pack with household debt greater than 250 of income followed by five other european countries then korea canada is ninth at 175 with the us 19th at 105 household debt as a percentage of net income source oecd getting more granular cnbc reports that us consumer debt rose to nearly 14 6 trillion at the end of 2020 driven by a record breaking increase in mortgages which in february totaled over 10 trillion as home buyers took advantage of low mortgage rates mortgage debt in q4 2020 increased 1 4 or 206 billion making it the fastest fourth quarter rise since 2006 student loan debt last year increased marginally to 1 37 trillion as a result of low interest rates and student loan forgiveness the biden administration announced it will cancel another 5 8b of student loan debt by the end of this year while credit card debt fell by 108b to 820b many americans holed up at home either unemployed or working remotely elected to save money during the pandemic or pay down loans with help from direct stimulus checks the serious delinquency rate or 90 days past due for all debt fell from 2 36 to 1 25 during the fourth quarter 2020 however it appears that americans parsimony was shortlived a more recent cnbc story states that household debt jumped the most in 14 years in the second quarter of 2021 though mostly driven by the housing market credit card debt is reportedly back on the rise despite significant paying down card balances the average balance is above 5 000 and there are signs that fiscal prudence may be waning including the fact that government stimulus checks are slowing and that consumers are in the mood for spending with around 2 trillion in forced savings ready to be unleashed a creditcards com survey quoted by cnbc found 44 of people saying they are willing to take on debt in the second half of 2021 for non essential purchases such as dining out a may report from the federal reserve found that credit card balances rose 11 from april to may the largest increase in five years on aug 4 the fed reported the highest second quarter jump in household debt in 14 years to nearly 15 trillion this can t go on forever it s not a stretch to envision a scenario whereby the world s reserve currency the us dollar collapses under the weight of unmanageable debt triggered say by a mass offloading of us treasuries by foreign countries that currently own about 7 trillion of us debt this would cause the dollar to crash and interest rates would go through the roof choking consumer and business borrowing import prices would skyrocket too the result of a low dollar hitting consumers in the pocketbook for everything not made in the usa business confidence would plummet mass layoffs would occur growth would stop and the us would enter a recession all the countries that sold their treasuries would then face a major slump in demand for their products from american consumers their largest market eventually companies in these countries would begin to suffer plus all other nations that trade with the us like canada and mexico before long the recession in the us would spread like a cancer to the rest of the world apocalyptic visions like these have pundits offering outside the box solutions according to economist david rosenberg and others the only policy prescription is debt default debt default yes you read that right debt jubilee the global debt overhang which as stated has more than doubled since 2007 has severely curtailed governments ability to deal with a major financial crisis such as the coronavirus interest rates are already so low that central banks are limited in how much they can cut the fed has already used up all its bullets in setting interest rates at 0 to 0 25 a cross the board debt jubilee might sound radical but a reading of history shows that retiring debt can actually make a country s economy and its indebted citizenry all the better for it there is even a relatively recent example in 2000 u2 front man bono launched a campaign to provide debt relief to developing countries the jubilee 2000 coalition managed to get the g8 to agree to write off 100 billion in debts that developing countries owed to developed nations the term jubilee comes from the old testament the book of deuteronomy refers to a sabbath year during which any slaves would be freed and everyone would be allowed to return to their family farms and live off the land during the jubilee all debt obligations would be forgiven such as land or crops that debtors had pledged to creditors in those days the main creditors were royal families and their close supporters religious orders and wealthy nobles thus canceling debts really only meant snuffing out debts owed to themselves as explained by vox what the king lost in immediate payment he got back in encouraging a land holding peasantry who could pay future taxes and provide the backbone of the army moreover rivals to the crown foreign enemies or internal upstarts could foment rebellion by threatening to cancel debts themselves if the new monarch did not do so first the main economic justification for a modern debt jubilee is simple with debts forgiven governments could spend the money currently devoted to interest and principal repayments on worthwhile programs businesses would suddenly be freed from debt bondage and could expand hire more staff and households would have more disposable income all of which would in turn increase aggregate demand and encourage economic growth billionaire investor and hedge fund manager ray dalio in his book principles for navigating big debt crises argues that when interest rates can t go any lower and qe has already been tried ie right now a central bank s last resort is to provide relief for the common people we have already reached this point within president joe biden s 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief package passed earlier this year was 1t in direct relief to taxpayers including increased stimulus checks up to 1 400 per person this is the last resort central bank stimulus to deal with the covid 19 crisis should involve buying forgiving student loans delinquent car loans personal lines of credit credit card debt and mortgages in august the biden administration announced it will cancel another 5 8b of student loan debt by the end of this year canadian students leaving university owe an average 28 000 it s not uncommon for law or medical students to carry a debt load into their first job surpassing 100 000 student loan debt is a major inhibitor to college university grads being able to obtain a mortgage during the financial crisis the obama administration tried bringing in mortgage forgiveness but was unable to get it through congress ironic that in 2008 the federal reserve printed 4 trillion to buy up the banks bad debts while congress sat back and allowed 10 million american homeowners to be foreclosed canadian families are carrying nearly 2 trillion in mortgage borrowing and home equity lines of credit heloc this debt grew by 18 billion in april the biggest monthly gain ever garth turner former conservative politician in his popular real estate blog greater fool writes it s everywhere you know the numbers four in ten people have less than 200 a month after servicing their debts and buying yogurt and street cannabis the debt to income ratio has never been higher borrowing is running four times hotter than inflation even when house values go down mortgage debt goes up it s hopeless addicted we re pickled in the stuff an outright cancelation of sovereign debt shouldn t be ruled out during the great depression france and greece had about half of their national debts written off completely in 1953 the london debt agreement between germany and 20 creditors wrote off 46 of its pre war debt and 52 of its post war debt the country only had to repay debt if it ran a trade surplus thus encouraging germany s creditors to invest in its exports which fueled its post war boom as we pointed out in 2000 100 billion worth of debts owed by developing countries were wiped off the books again this is not as far fetched as it sounds because we live in a fiat monetary system currencies are not backed by anything physical the reserve currency the us dollar was de coupled from the gold standard in the early 1970s it s not like a raid on vaults full of gold which have an inherent physical store of value in reality there is nothing preventing central bankers from doing a complete global reset putting all debt back to zero the benefits of a debt jubilee would accrue to governments no longer bound to austerity programs businesses that could invest in their operations instead of paying interest and principal to corporate bondholders and taxpayers who would benefit from increased social spending and higher household disposable income garth turner argues that erasing people s debt is the same as cutting their taxes the effect being the same a marked increase in spending it actually means interest rates can go up to stem the tide of new borrowing because the economy gets a shot from the jubilee indebted consumers spend money on loan payments not on new silverados appliances or in alberta s case weapons so a debt holiday would actually boost the economy as a whole helping employment corporate profits wages markets and investors of course not everyone wins from a debt jubilee the losers would include credit card companies auto manufacturers and banks all of which would lose the value of the debt which for them is an asset conclusion we and others have been warning about debt for quite a while people are being misled into believing that the us federal reserve is going to scale back its 120 billion per month asset purchase program qe and raise interest rates the fed can telegraph its intentions all it wants the fact remains that at such unsustainably high debt levels the interest payments will eventually cripple the federal government in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis the committee for a responsible federal budget crfb calculated that under current law net interest payments will nearly triple over the next decade to 928 billion by 2029 in 2019 the national debt stood at 23 2 trillion compared to the current 28 7 trillion so already we know the projections are too conservative remember the current debt doesn t include the 1 trillion infrastructure bill before the house nor the 3 5t anti poverty and climate plan nor president biden s budget for full year fy 2022 totaling 6 trillion more than any other previous budget under the crfb s alternative fiscal scenario which assumes that lawmakers extend the tax cuts and spending passed under the trump administration interest on the debt will exceed 1 trillion by 2029 as a concession to senate republicans joe biden earlier this year proposed keeping intact donald trump s 2017 tax cuts instead of raising corporate taxes to pay for the 1 trillion infrastructure plan his administration would work to ensure corporations don t exploit tax loopholes again this is before the 4 5 trillion already spent on covid and the trillions more to come the way we re going interest payments on the debt will almost certainly top 1 trillion by the end of the decade if not before some see the national debt going much higher given that the way it is calculated now doesn t include unfunded social security and medicare promises when that 129 trillion worth of bills is added the truth is closer to 133 trillion now we are talking about interest payments of four to five times the current 300 billion ie 1 2t to 1 5t the people supposedly represented by the government can t afford that level of interest they will suffer higher interest payments on their own debt same as businesses cannot afford higher interest payments on their debt corporations will simply pass on the higher interest obligations to their customers cut dividends or in the worst case scenarios lay off staff but there is a way to avoid this slow moving car crash a global debt reset a debt jubilee if you will imagine what could be achieved if all the central banks acted together in retiring all the world s debt all 281 trillion of government corporate and consumer loans of course the financial institutions would balk their hands would need forcing but the effects on the economy would be immediate and profound governments businesses and households would finally be free of the debt shackles that constrict their ability to grow governments business and people can start borrowing and spending all over and why not what most think of money isn t money its credit created by a bank it s ones and zeros on a computer represented by paper and coins the world will get to do it all over again after all it s not like there s a day of reckoning in the future the coronavirus is the perfect opportunity to reset the global monetary system through a debt jubilee without a plan to reduce the debt the era of free money will continue benefiting gold and silver prices for the

the 2020 2021 lockdowns around the world have put severe strains on public finances larch et al 2021 the fiscal situation of most countries is becoming so serious that there have already been calls for a wealth tax to permit the continued financing of existing expenditures and debt but a tax that is levied indiscriminately on all forms of wealth is a massive disincentive to the accumulation of productive capital one of the major forms of wealth and could also lead to migration of the wealthiest out of a country that implements it our paper instead proposes a tax reform that shifts taxes away from productive labour and capital where they reduce incentives to work and save and onto land where they do not distort any such incentives kumhof et al 2021 this provides not only sustainable government financing as land cannot migrate out of the country but also a much needed and potentially very large output stimulus it has been well known since the physiocrats quesnay 1756 and the classical economists smith 1776 ricardo 1817 mill 1848 george 1879 that a tax on the annual rental value or the capitalised asset value of unimproved land assuming that land is put to its highest and best use while excluding the value of buildings and capital goods currently situated on the land does not distort incentives and is therefore desirable on grounds of economic efficiency when the land value tax revenue is used to reduce taxes on labour or capital buildings plus capital goods output and economic welfare grows in addition a land value tax effectively pools property risk by reducing the private value of the riskiest component land of the property asset and transferring it to the whole community to make these arguments it is necessary to think in terms of a three factor production function in labour capital and land however at the end of the 19th century neoclassical economics started instead to assume a two factor production function that merged land into capital stiglitz 2015 argues that this obscures important insights about growth and distribution we argue that it obscures perhaps even more important insights about the potential benefits of tax reform harrison 2012 and others argue that land value taxes are also desirable on environmental grounds the reason is that like environmental taxes land value taxes discourage idle land speculation and the underuse waste and sprawling development of sites data a key calibrated input into our analysis is the size of the tax base specifically the share of land and other non produced assets in the total value of physical assets where the latter receive around 40 of gross income in the national accounts we approximate the us land share by subtracting the bea measure of the stock of physical capital from the fed flow of funds net worth of households and non profit organisations over the last decade this shows a us land share in total nonfinancial assets of more than 50 more than 40 since the early 1990s while the ratio of land to annual gdp currently equals more than 250 this means that the tax base is very large oecd data for other industrialised economies which in several cases use high quality bottom up methodologies for determining land shares corroborate this result finding land shares that are mostly between 40 and 60 the most common method for determining the share of land in real estate values is the so called land residual method which deducts the replacement construction cost of buildings from the total combined value of the site however this confuses the cost of construction with the value in use and especially for older buildings tends to greatly underestimate land values due to locational obsolescence of the buildings the correct building residual method instead determines the value of buildings as a residual after determining land values in their highest and best use independently due to computer aided valuation techniques combined with hedonic estimation approaches this has become increasingly feasible on a large scale conceptually the proper definition of the tax base for a land tax is the entire material universe excluding people and their products including surface land mineral resources water air sunlight and the electromagnetic spectrum but typically data including even the oecd data include only or mostly surface land gaffney 2009 emphasises that as a result the concept of taxes on land is far broader than the traditional property tax on real estate excluding buildings and that land is even more lightly taxed than is commonly perceived tax reform simulations to study the effects of a shift of taxes onto land we develop a closed economy dynamic economic model where land is a third factor of production in addition to labour and capital and where households supply the three factors of production and have standard greenwood et al 1988 preferences over consumption and labour this model features government spending and transfers that are constant relative to trend and that are financed by taxes on the incomes of labour capital and land taxes on consumption and taxes on the values of capital and land we calibrate the model to match not only us macroeconomic aggregates but also the components of us fiscal expenditures and taxes very closely in order to obtain a realistic starting point we then perform various simulations whereby over a period of 20 years the tax rates on either the annual rental value or the capitalised asset value of land gradually increase while the tax rates on labour and capital incomes decrease to maintain a balanced budget we also compare such a reform to a wealth tax which increases taxes on both land and on the capital situated on the land equally and a constrained optimal tax which caps the tax rate on land at 20 and raises any remaining needed revenue in the least distortionary way possible through a consumption tax figure 1 shows the results figure 1 four simulated tax reforms our baseline tax reform black solid line is an increase in the land asset value tax lavt specifically an increase in the tax rate on the capitalised asset value of land from its current 0 55 to 5 55 accompanied by reductions in capital and labour income tax rates of 28 and 10 percentage points this is a very large tax reform but it would not be unprecedented by us historical standards see wallis 2000 on the 19th and early 20th centuries the baseline lavt reform increases output by almost 15 relative to trend in an economy with separate groups of workers capitalists and landlords the output gain remains the same when we increase the elasticity of labour supply with respect to after tax wages from its baseline 0 75 to a still quite standard 1 00 the output gain increases from 15 to 21 another alternative we study is an increase in the land rental value tax lrvt an increase in the tax rate on the annual rental value of land while this also has strong stimulus effects this tax rate needs to reach almost 100 to have comparable effects to the baseline reform the reason is that a lrvt only taxes rental values but not capital gains which account for a very high share of the return to land we also show that the relationship between the lavt rate and the resulting gain in tax revenue is monotonically increasing but becomes quite flat when the tax rate goes much beyond 10 the same is true for the relationship between the lavt rate and output gains for a wealth tax red dotted line output gains are only just over half as large as in the baseline this is because this tax only improves the incentive to work but not the incentive to save for a constrained optimal tax blue dashed line output gains are almost twice as large as in the baseline this is because this reform maximises the incentives to work and save by completely abolishing all income taxes it raises 55 of all tax revenue through land taxes with the remaining 45 raised through a 12 consumption tax an intermediate case between the land and wealth taxes is the property tax which taxes land and buildings but not capital equipment plassmann and tideman 2000 study pennsylvania cities that shifted taxes from buildings to land they find that a one percentage point difference in the annual taxes on buildings and land led to a 15 8 increase in annual construction this strongly supports the idea that the property tax would be much less effective than the land tax in stimulating the economy because it still reduces the incentive to save only less so than the wealth tax we do not study the property tax in our paper discussion in the us shifting taxes from labour and capital onto land and consumption can continue to finance existing levels of spending and debt while providing a massive boost to output the reasons are that the tax base for a land tax is very large and that the taxes on the incomes of labour and capital that are replaced by a land tax are very distortionary given that the us land share is not unusually high similar results are likely to hold in most other economies furthermore as we discuss in more detail in our paper the number of net winners from this reform would far exceed the number of net losers who if necessary could be exempted or compensated at little budgetary cost the winners would even include almost all of the very rich who not only hold the vast majority of us land but who as a rule are also very well diversified with land only accounting for a small share of their portfolios they would benefit greatly from the countervailing cuts in labour and capital income taxes there are two main and interrelated reasons why such a beneficial shift has nevertheless not been undertaken the first is that there is an immediate and potentially large drop in land values while the full benefits in terms of incomes take longer to develop the second is political with the small number of potential losers often being in a strong political position the drop in land values could affect the financial system due to the pervasive use of land as loan collateral however as a rule loans are repaid out of total borrower cash flow rather than through liquidation of collateral and we show that unless a borrower derives their cash flow exclusively or nearly exclusively from rent their total cash flow would improve this is because the cash flow diverted to the government through land taxes is not kept but used to lower taxes elsewhere furthermore any initial negative effects on net taxpayer cash flow is small due to a gradual phase in while when land taxes become more substantial the economy has started to generate much higher cash flows due to the economic stimulus if the initial drop in land values is nevertheless perceived to be a problem the obvious solution would be to reduce the initial size of the reform an example of a smaller scale reform is shown in the figure green solid line with black markers it limits the lavt to only 2 by the end of the phase in period land prices now only drop by around 15 in the short run and 10 in the long run much less than the 45 and 38 in the baseline and therefore much less likely to be perceived to be a problem but there is a clear trade off in that the long term output gains drop from 15 in the baseline to 7 politicians would have to manage this trade off carefully especially if voters understand what is at stake to overcome the political hurdles and maximise the benefits of the reform it would therefore be of paramount importance that voters understand how extreme one s income situation would have to be not to be a net winner and how large the benefits could become if the reform was subsequently made more substantial in size if there was political will this information could be produced and disseminated by governments perhaps in the form of a representative set of tax returns that show before and after columns politicians have every reason at least to study this option despite the obvious hurdles as it would put government finances on a much more sustainable footing while making the vast majority of their voters very happy references gaffney m 2009 the hidden taxable capacity

new bedford ma accesswire january 13 2022 the port of new bedford massachusetts the center of the east coast commercial fishing industry is offering mixed reaction to the bureau of ocean and energy management s boem announcement wednesday that the agency will conduct a wind energy lease auction for six areas totaling 480 000 acres of the new york bight in february port of new bedford credit adobe stock the new bedford fishing fleet the nation s top grossing fleet relies heavily on the fishing grounds of the new york bight for its success given the importance of the bight new bedford mayor jon mitchell and the new bedford port authority nbpa have been actively engaged with boem regarding the development of the bight for offshore wind energy projects in an april 2021 letter to boem director amanda lefton mayor mitchell as chairman of the port authority recommended changes in the configuration of the proposed bight lease areas to help reduce the impact on the atlantic sea scallop industry and other fish species principally landed in new bedford specifically the mayor called for the southeastern boundary of the bight s hudson south lease area to be shifted 5 miles to the west the mayor s letter was followed in august 2021 by a second letter further explaining the need for a boundary adjustment with its announcement yesterday boem responded to the new bedford requests agreeing to shift the boundary in question 2 5 miles to the west as well as reducing the size of another bight lease area the so called central bight area mayor mitchell commented on yesterday s developments the overarching lesson from yesterday s announcement is the importance of staying engaged and offering pragmatic solutions that are responsive to the concerns of both wind proponents and fishing interests i appreciate the willingness of director lefton and the boem team to listen and adjust their approach based on the strength of the case we have made to them mitchell added this is by no means to say that the port s concerns with boem s approach to offshore wind development in the bight are all addressed we will continue to call on boem to use the wind project permitting process to minimize the economic impact on commercial fishing and equally important to ensure fishermen are compensated for any economic damages caused by wind project development i can t emphasize enough how important the fishing industry is to our nation s food security and how economically important the industry is to state economies of new england the federal government should pursue a policy agenda that simultaneously takes into account the economic consequences to fishermen and the economic opportunities from offshore wind energy development it s not an either or proposition federal regulators at boem and other agencies must consider both in all their decision making said mitchell for its part new bedford is uniquely positioned on issues of both economic impact and economic benefit the port is the largest and most profitable seafood port on the east coast and also has the distinction of being home to the nation s only purpose built offshore wind staging facility the new bedford marine commerce terminal the nation s first industrial scale offshore wind project vineyard wind will begin staging from the commerce terminal in 2023 advocating for an effective mitigation strategy is part of the port s commitment to ensuring that offshore wind advances in ways that safeguard the viability of our commercial fishing industry of particular concern to the port is boem s mitigation approach which remains limited to consideration of environmental impacts the port s position is that wind project mitigation plans need to consider economic impacts given the size of the fishing industry thirty percent of the nation s 5 5 billion seafood industry is landed in the northeast with seafood landings in the port of new bedford itself worth 450 million annually in new bedford the scallop fishery alone is responsible for 300 million in annual landings a 2019 economic impact study of the port of new bedford conducted by martin associates and foth cle engineering group determined that the regional seafood industry s economic contribution comprises 39 000 jobs 11 billion in local economic impact 162 million in direct state taxes and 391 million in direct federal taxes mitigation efforts also need to acknowledge that economic disruptions to commercial fisheries from wind farms will be felt across multiple states not just those whose waters will host wind projects while wind projects may be built off the coast of new york and new jersey their impacts will not be limited to those states large volumes of sea scallops caught off the coast of new york and new jersey are landed daily in new bedford and fishermen who live in new england regularly fish in federal waters off the coasts of new york and new jersey commercial fishing is an interconnected region wide industry and needs a mitigation plan that is similarly broad in its scope the port has therefore advocated for boem to take a proactive approach to its fisheries mitigation efforts by establishing definitive minimum standards for the mitigation process and requiring developers to use specific measures and methodologies to mitigate the impacts of offshore wind projects press contact mike

in march 2021 premier li keqiang announced china s objective to increase r d investments by 7 per year between 2021 and 2025 this target impacts an already large base in terms of total r d spending china is currently second only to the united states even as a share of gdp 2 4 in 2020 china invests more than richer economies like the eu or the uk china s national innovation driven development strategy states as a goal for the country to become a technological innovation powerhouse by 2050 but is china actually on path to achieve such an ambitious goal larger and larger r d investments is no guarantee of success a recent paper by chen et al 2021 analyses innocom a programme providing incentives for r d investment through corporate income tax cuts the authors show that many chinese firms respond to r d subsidies by relabelling non r d expenditures as r d expenses zilibotti 2017 warns of the limits of a top down approach to innovation economic reforms improving investor protection and the independence of the judiciary system are preconditions for nurturing the type of grassroots innovation culture which flourished earlier on in some western nations these reforms are difficult to fit in the current institutional framework r d misallocation another reason for r d expenditures to be potentially inefficient is misallocation the investments could be carried out by the wrong firms and in an ineffective way china s economic policy biases resource allocation in favour of state owned firms and private firms that are connected to the state e g song et al 2011 hsieh and song 2015 and bai et al 2020 however to date the literature is silent on how r d and its misallocation affect innovation and long run economic growth in a forthcoming paper koenig et al 2022 we propose the first evidence based assessment of the effects of r d on chinese growth the novelty of our methodology is the use of firm level data to estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model that bears predictions about the effects of r d investments on aggregate productivity and growth innovation and random interactions our theory features endogenous technical change driven by innovations which diffuse across firms through random interactions in the vein of koenig et al 2016 the evolution of the total factor productivity tfp distribution is determined by the activity of profit maximising firms seeking to improve their technology over time each firm can attain this goal by either imitating technologies already used by other firms or pursuing more fundamental innovation an innovation strategy requires an r d investment and possibly reduces the focus of the organisation on imitating other firms a firm s position in the tfp distribution determines its comparative advantage in pursuing either strategy firms closer to the technology frontier have a stronger drive to invest in innovation because they face fewer opportunities to improve their technology by imitating other firms critically the r d decisions are distorted by firm specific wedges a la hsieh and klenow 2009 some large but not very productive firms have stronger private incentives to invest in r d than smaller constrained high productivity firms this is socially inefficient because the positive knowledge spillovers hinge just on productivity not on size the theory bears four salient testable predictions 1 the probability that a firm invests in r d is increasing in its tfp 2 conditional on tfp larger firms are more likely to engage in r d 3 expected tfp growth is falling in current tfp especially for non r d firms 4 r d firms experience higher future tfp growth than non r d firms more so among high productivity firms evidence and structural estimation these predictions are borne out in the data from the census of chinese manufacturing firms for the period 2007 12 figure 1 shows four patterns panel a shows the share of r d firms by tfp percentile the share of r d firms almost doubles as one moves from the lowest decile to the top percentile of the tfp distribution panel b shows that firm size is also positively correlated with the share of r d firms a feature that holds true even if one keeps tfp constant panel c shows that the tfp growth rate is decreasing in tfp among non r d firms convergence finally panel d shows that tfp growth is significantly higher for r d firms than for non r d firms at most percentiles especially for high tfp firms figure 1 model prediction versus data notes the figure shows the data and the fit of the model refer to as ipm in koenig et al 2022 the x axis in panel a c and d is the total factor productivity tfp percentiles defined on four intervals the 10th to 49th the 50st to 79th the 80th to 94th and the 95th to 99th the x axis in panel b is the first period value added percentiles defined on the same four intervals the solid lines in panel a and b plot the fraction of r d firms in each tfp and value added interval respectively panel c plots the median annualized tfp growth among nonr d firms in each tfp interval in the data against the corresponding expected growth rate for firms in the model panel d plots the difference between the median tfp growth between r d and non r d firms in the data against the corresponding difference in the model we use these data to structurally estimate our growth model the estimated model accurately fits the four panels both qualitatively and quantitatively as the figure shows at the aggregate level the theory predicts that the productivity distribution is a travelling wave namely a stationary distribution whose average grows at an endogenous constant rate the dispersion of the productivity distribution is also endogenous while we do not target any of the aggregate moments in the estimation the estimated model predicts both a growth rate and a dispersion of productivity that are in the ballpark of the empirical observation the fit of the data further improves if we augment the theory with some selective industrial policy or if we allow some firms to fudge r d for example by relabelling as r d ordinary expenses in order to cash in subsidies in line with the findings of chen et al 2021 in this case the estimated proportion of fudging firms is moderate at below 10 last but not least we document that firms investing in r d are on average more likely to patent innovations in the following years this together with the evidence that tfp grows faster for r d than for non r d firms indicates that a significant part of the r d expenditure bears fruit in terms of innovation altogether our analysis indicates that already in 2007 12 r d was an important determinant of aggregate productivity growth in china despite large distortions attenuating its benefits the result is robust to introducing international knowledge spillover in the theory in a counterfactual policy experiment we find that a moderate increase of r d subsidies across the board could enhance tfp growth although an overly generous subsidy policy would backfire and reduce growth by hindering technology diffusion reducing misallocation e g state support to politically linked firms would also have a powerful and potentially less expensive growth enhancing effect mainland china versus taiwan we also estimate our model on firm level census data from taiwan the qualitative patterns we document in the figure for mainland china are similar in the taiwanese data more productive and larger firms are more likely to engage in r d firms investing in r d grow faster than the other firms in fact the tfp growth differential for r d firms is larger in taiwan than in mainland china estimating the model confirms that r d investments are more productive in taiwan than in mainland china because taiwan is a more advanced economy the finding that r d is a more salient source of growth in taiwan are consistent with the prediction of acemoglu et al 2006 that the importance of innovation increases as economies approach the world technology frontier if chinese firms had access to the same technology to create new ideas that taiwan firms use aggregate productivity growth would be higher taking stock the take home messages of our study are the following despite pervasive distortions in the allocation of labour and capital innovation plays an important role in the growth process of china the productivity of innovation could be substantially enhanced by reducing distortions in the chinese economy further stimulating r d expenditure is neither necessary nor sufficient to sustain high growth there is even a risk of too much of a good thing improving institutions and making sure that the more productive firms do r d e g by alleviating credit constraints is no less important our results are subject to a few caveats most important we focus on the period 2007 12 when growth is still relatively strong for the chinese economy more recently there are signs of productivity slowdown chen et al 2019 we expect that innovation has not decreased its relative importance as a source of growth but this conjecture requires additional empirical validation our column

this afternoon small satellite launcher virgin orbit successfully lofted seven tiny satellites into orbit around earth marking the third successful mission for the virgin galactic spinoff company the payloads consisted of various research satellites for the department of defense along with three small satellites from companies satrevolution and spire global the launch comes less than a week after virgin orbit s stock began publicly trading for the first time on the new york stock exchange virgin orbit announced in august its plan to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company or spac making it one of three small rocket launch companies to follow the trend in 2021 on friday january 7th virgin orbit ceo dan hart rang the nasdaq opening bell while the company put a model of its primary rocket launcherone on display in new york city s times square less than a week after virgin orbit s stock began publicly trading for the first time virgin orbit is one of many rocket companies that have cropped up in the last few decades aimed at specifically launching small to medium sized satellites into orbit however the company s approach to getting these satellites into space is a bit unique compared to its competitors instead of launching vertically from the ground virgin orbit s launcherone rocket is designed to take off from underneath the wing of a carrier aircraft a refurbished boeing 747 called cosmic girl the plane is meant to take launcherone up to an altitude of approximately 35 000 feet where the rocket is then released in mid air launcherone ignites its main engine and propels its payloads the rest of the way into earth s orbit today s flight called above the clouds began at 4 39pm et when cosmic girl took off from a runway at the mojave air and space port in california where virgin orbit has a testing facility the plane flew out west over the pacific ocean where launcherone was released at 5 52pm et flying the plane for this mission was virgin orbit s pilot eric bippert he was accompanied in the cockpit by matthew stannard or stanny a test pilot for the royal air force in the united kingdom who has been seconded to virgin orbit stanny was the one to initiate launcherone s release from underneath cosmic girl s wing virgin orbit s launch occurred on the same day as spacex s second launch of the year which also sent a crop of small satellites into orbit on the company s falcon 9 rocket out of cape canaveral florida spacex s launch called transporter 3 hoisted a whopping 105 small satellites into orbit deploying them one by one into space such a flight is often referred to as a rocket rideshare and it s another option for small satellite manufacturers to get their payloads into space since spacex s falcon 9 has a bigger capacity than a smaller rocket like launcherone it can carry a bunch of small satellites at once into space a bit like a cosmic carpool spacex aims to launch at least three dedicated rocket rideshares a year through its smallsat rideshare program today s flight was called above the clouds rocket rideshares have their downsides though for one thing small satellite manufacturers often need to wait until enough satellites are packed onto one rocket in order to launch there are also some logistical issues that can come with launching so many satellites at once dedicated small launch providers like virgin orbit can tailor their missions to just a few customers and can in theory provide a quicker route to the launchpad in fact virgin orbit claims that spire s satellite was added relatively last minute to today s flight in just under two weeks we got them on board tony gingiss virgin orbit s coo said during a press conference ahead of the launch within 24 hours of signing the contract we already had them integrated into the fairing the nosecone on top of the rocket
the brazilian airline finished off 2021 on a high note what happened brazilian airline azul azul 4 72 saw an uptick in traffic in december an encouraging sign for investors hoping the worst is over for the airline the news helped spark a rally in azul shares with the stock up as much as 13 4 for the week as of close of trading thursday so what airline stocks have been hit hard by the pandemic and latin american airlines have had more trouble than most but azul has held up better than some of its rivals that ended up in bankruptcy and as the pandemic fades the airline should have an opportunity to pick up market share the airline on jan 11 delivered positive news about traffic flows azul saw domestic passenger traffic up 20 9 compared to december 2019 for the full year traffic increased by 2 8 over 2019 factoring in international travel which remains restricted traffic fell 1 9 in december and 17 for the year compared to the same periods in 2019 our december traffic results continued the momentum seen throughout the fourth quarter of 2021 with strong revenue performance from both leisure and corporate segments ceo john rodgerson said in a statement while it is early to determine the exact impact of the omicron variant in brazil these results give us confidence in the competitive advantages of our business model and our plans for 2022 as rodgerson notes azul is still dealing with omicron and there remains reason for concern that other future variants could delay a recovery but for investors eager to see good news the december traffic numbers topped off what was a surprisingly strong 2021 for azul and the stock shot higher as a result now what for investors willing to wait out what might be an uneven recovery and invest in the potential long term growth in latin american travel azul looks like the best choice out there azul has said it is hopeful about acquiring at least parts of some weaker rivals the airline has been closely linked with a deal for the brazilian operations of bankrupt latam airlines group which would give it control of more than half of the domestic market and a real advantage over rival gol linhas aereas inteligentes gol 10 00 even with this week s gains azul still trades well below where it did prior to the pandemic we re still a long way from normal and it is tough to predict how long it will take for azul to again fly high but for those willing to stomach a little turbulence there is good reason to be excited about azul right now

all the reporting these days is about rising prices and i get that a 7 percent surge in the consumer price index over the past year comes as a shock especially because so many people myself included didn t see it coming but there s another story that should be getting more attention america s extraordinary success in limiting the damage from a horrifying pandemic in fact there s a good chance that in retrospect we ll view economic management over the past two years as a policy triumph despite the inflation spike i wrote about some of this in my newsletter last week but i think more needs to be said as i pointed out in that newsletter unemployment has lately been falling as fast as it did during the reagan era morning in america recovery what i want to do now is put the recovery in some broader historical context early in the pandemic many observers feared that we were about to experience a replay of the 2008 financial crisis only worse there were in fact a couple of weeks in march 2020 when the financial system teetered on the edge of collapse but the federal reserve pulled us back from the brink

thursday s firmer tone helped support secondary market activity and new issue demand according to a new york trader i think the municipal market is still trying to get its feet under it with the new year starting this is the first real week of any supply he said there is definitely improvement from earlier in the week when municipal yields rose by three to six basis points on monday on elevated selling pressure while short u s treasuries also saw pressure he noted i think munis are reacting positively to the firmer tone in treasuries today he said adding that investors don t like choppy markets the recent volatility was definitely putting people on their heels on the buy side municipals strong fundamentals and historical high quality is keeping the asset class supported as the first quarter gets under way according to joe boyle fixed income product manager at hartford funds while the previous strong demand that drove the municipal market in 2021 has waned slightly as the increase in individual taxes may be less severe than first expected municipals continue to have a positive backdrop compared to the negative backdrop in other traditional fixed income classes on the back of rising rates boyle said muni markets relative to traditional core had a strong year and investors likely want to lock that in he said demand for total return will exist in fixed income and investors

specifically there was a decline of 12 7 month over month and requests fell by 2 6 overall in 2021 although municipal request volume has slowed year over year we ve still seen an incredibly strong appetite for new issuance among equity and debt market participants in 2021 said gerard faulkner director of operations for cusip global services the combination of a favorable interest rate environment and relatively healthy markets suggests this trend will continue through the early part of the new year requests for new corporate identifiers meanwhile rose in december helping total corporate cusip request volume edge higher in 2021 versus the previous year cusip identifier requests for the broad category of u s and canadian corporate equity and debt rose 11 9 versus november

put upward pressure on prices while the omicron variant and associated surge in covid 19 cases may further skew inflationary risks to the upside said berenberg capital markets chief economist for the u s americas and asia mickey levy there are some indications goods inflation is easing on a three month annualized basis durable goods prices rose 4 8 a sharp decline from july s 11 2 he said but as supply issues ease and the pandemic dissipates he expects demand for services will climb and lead to a further moderation of rising goods prices anecdotal evidence suggests sustained increases in labor and input costs are increasingly affecting businesses inflationary expectations and price setting behavior levy said most analysts expect inflation to slow later this year as does gary schlossberg global strategist wells fargo investment institute however the real test for the market is whether or not they will be satisfied with a disappointingly flat trajectory lower as rents and other services prices pick up some of the slack from slowing goods costs he said fed gov lael brainard much like fed chair jerome powell who testified on tuesday before the senate banking committee continued to reinforce a message of the fed s diligence toward inflation and employment said john farawell managing director and head of municipal trading at roosevelt cross acknowledging these trying times for the economy she tried to communicate the central bank s role in battling inflation and supply change issues in a non partisan way this wasn t easy as politics seemed to continue to be part of some of the committee s agenda despite the politics he said brainard responded in a competent manner bond yields farawell said will signal what the market thinks about the future economic trends and inflation inflation has become the second biggest concern of ceos according to the conference board with 55 of surveyed executives saying they believe inflation will persist into 2023 and perhaps beyond brainard said inflation is too high and the fed is determined to reducing price pressures our monetary policy is focused on getting inflation back down to 2 while sustaining a recovery that includes everyone she said this is our most important task sen pat toomey r pa noted brainard opposed the easing of financial regulations and took an activist role in environmental issues brainard was also questioned by sen thom tillis r nc about her contribution to hillary clinton s presidential campaign which he said didn t mesh with the fed s independence she responded had she known fed officials rarely make political contributions she would not have given the money the most visible takeaway from brainard s remarks said wells fargo s schlossberg was the shift from promoting growth to containing inflation the shift by one of the board s most dovish suggests greater unanimity in the policy tilt from growth to inflation control the bond market rallied he said given the stronger commitment to controlling inflation while stocks slipped as investors expectations tilted a degree or two toward more aggressive rate increases but the fed s hawkish slant will be pressured schlossberg said both by an unfavorable combination of slowing growth and persistent inflation pressures as the economy feels the brunt of the omicron outbreak on the reopening and supply chain disruptions and brainard s comments could provide a counterweight should president biden s nominees to fill the three empty fed seats be dovish as expected he said as they will face resistance at the policy deliberations from a more hawkish rotation of bank presidents to the fomc federal reserve bank of philadelphia president patrick harker said he expects three rate hikes this year beginning as early as march and possibly a fourth if inflation continues at an elevated pace the inescapable logical conclusion of this situation inflation higher than we want and a very robust jobs market is to tighten monetary policy he said according to prepared text of a speech released by the fed i expect us to complete our taper of asset purchases by march then we can probably expect a rate hike of 25 basis points we could very well continue to raise rates throughout the year as the data evolve federal reserve bank of richmond president thomas barkin hedged on when he expected liftoff saying the federal open market committee will be free to begin normalizing rates should circumstances support that once asset purchases end in march inflation will determine the fed s moves he said the closer that inflation comes back to target levels the easier it will be to normalize rates at a measured pace barkin added but were inflation to remain elevated and broad based we would need to take on normalization more aggressively also released thursday initial jobless claims rose to 230 000 on a seasonally adjusted basis in the week ended jan 8 from 207 000 a week earlier while continuing claims fell to 1 559 million in the week ended jan 1 from 1 753 million a week earlier economists expected 205 000 claims in the week this may well be the first report suggesting omicron is leading to new job loss said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate the future path of the pandemic remains highly uncertain but the underlying job market narrative overall continues to be one of scarcity

a fresh supreme court ruling does neither stock any favors what happened in what hardly qualifies as a surprising development shares of both pfizer pfe 0 19 and biontech bntx 1 63 fell in price on thursday this was on the back of a supreme court decision that struck down a key government vaccination mandate the two companies are perhaps best known by the general public these days for the comirnaty coronavirus vaccine so they were directly in the line of fire when the decision was handed down after the smoke cleared pfizer s stock price fell by nearly 2 while the far smaller and less diversified biontech suffered an 8 hit so what the supreme court actually ruled on two aspects of the government s existing corporate vaccination rules the one that was blocked covered large employers whose workers were required to get vaccinated against the coronavirus or be masked and subject to regular weekly testing however the court upheld the federal mandate on workers at healthcare enterprises that receive public funding for the medicare and medicaid programs during oral arguments on the mandates last friday several justices seemed to cast doubt on the federal government s authority to enact such sweeping mandates however in previous rulings the supreme court had upheld certain vaccine mandates at the state level now what while president biden has pledged to continue pushing unvaccinated americans to get their jabs the court s decision to strike down the employer mandate isn t going to do wonders for biontech stock in contrast to pfizer which has a bulging portfolio of commercialized medicines and a large pipeline the germany based company s current fortunes are strongly tied to the fate of comirnaty

president joe biden will nominate sarah bloom raskin to be the federal reserve s next vice chair for supervision a powerful regulatory role biden will also nominate lisa cook and philip jefferson to serve as federal reserve governors according to a person familiar with the matter the nominations come at a precarious time for the fed which has in recent weeks signaled it will soon move to raise interest rates to fight inflation president joe biden will nominate sarah bloom raskin to be the federal reserve s next vice chair for supervision arguably the nation s most powerful banking regulator according to people familiar with the matter biden will also nominate lisa cook and philip jefferson to serve as federal reserve governors according to the people who asked not to be named in order to speak freely each nominee will in the coming weeks face questioning from the senate banking committee the congressional body in charge of vetting presidential appointments to the central bank should the senate confirm their nominations cook would be the first black woman to serve on the fed s board while jefferson would be the fourth black man to do so get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters that committee on tuesday held a nomination hearing for fed chair jerome powell whom biden chose to nominate to a second term it held a similar hearing for fed governor lael brainard on thursday whom biden picked to be the central bank s next vice chair in choosing raskin for the vice chair for supervision post biden looks to make good on democrats promises to reinforce laws passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis and restore aspects of a rule named for former fed chair paul volcker that had restricted banks ability to trade for their own profit raskin has experience at the fed and served as a governor at the central bank from 2010 to 2014 before serving as deputy secretary of the treasury under the obama administration she is married to rep jamie raskin d md powell and brainard are both expected to clear the senate without fanfare and with bipartisan support but raskin cook and jefferson could see tougher confirmation odds pennsylvania republican sen pat toomey the ranking member of the banking committee was quick to pan biden s latest choices sarah bloom raskin has specifically called for the fed to pressure banks to choke off credit to traditional energy companies and to exclude those employers from any fed emergency lending facilities he said in a statement thursday evening i have serious concerns that she would abuse the fed s narrow statutory mandates on monetary policy and banking supervision to have the central bank actively engaged in capital allocation i will closely examine whether ms cook and mr jefferson have the necessary experience judgment and policy views to serve as fed governors he added while jefferson s name had more recently come up in closed door discussions to serve as a governor cook s nomination was well telegraphed cnbc reported in may that she was the top choice of sen sherrod brown the banking committee s chairman and an ohio democrat to serve as a governor with these nominees president biden is showing the country what a federal reserve standing on the side of workers and their local communities looks like brown said in a statement friday morning they will bring important perspectives to the federal reserve board about the economic issues women black and brown workers and rural and industrial communities across the country face cook is a professor of economics and international relations at michigan state university she is also a member of the steering committee at the center for equitable growth a progressive washington based think tank that counts several of biden s top economists among its alumni she also served as a senior economist in the obama administration s council of economic advisors jefferson meanwhile is vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty at davidson college his decadeslong career in academics has focused on labor markets and poverty notable works of his include a 2005 study that evaluated the costs and benefits of monetary policy that promotes a high pressure economy in which the fed allows easier access to cash and lower interest rates to spur tighter labor markets he and other economists including brainard have argued in general and barring extraordinary economic conditions that the added benefits of lower rates on maximum employment is worth the potential for warmer inflation raskin and regulation since leaving the government raskin has pressed the fed and other financial regulators to take a more proactive role to address the financial risks posed by climate change while none of its regulatory agencies was specifically designed to mitigate the risks of climate related events each has a mandate broad enough to encompass these risks within the scope of the instruments already given to it by congress raskin wrote in september in light of the changing climate s unpredictable but clearly intensifying effects on the economy u s regulators will need to leave their comfort zone and act early before the problem worsens and becomes even more expensive to address she added former vice chair for supervision randal quarles who recently left the fed played a major role in reducing capital requirements for u s banks with less than 700 billion in assets and relaxing the volcker rule s audit rules for trades made by jpmorgan chase goldman sachs and other investment banks fed officials in favor of an easier regulatory stance argue the industry is well capitalized and not in need of some of the more restrictive measures enacted in the wake of the crisis many democrats including massachusetts sen elizabeth warren have pushed back and said rollbacks leave the banking sector more vulnerable to shocks and liable to excess risk taking inflation battle the nominations come at a precarious time for the fed which has in recent weeks has started to wind down its easy money policies in the face of recovering employment and the highest level of year over year inflation since 1982 in times of normal economic activity the fed adjusts short term interest rates to maximize employment and stabilize prices when the fed wants the economy to heat up it can cut borrowing costs to spur the housing market and broader economic activity as well as employment but if it is concerned about an overheating economy or unruly inflation it can raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive in times of economic emergency the central bank can also tap broader powers and purchase vast quantities of bonds to keep borrowing costs low and boost financial markets with easy access to cash it did so in 2020 with the arrival of the covid 19 pandemic a move that worked to pacify traders and soothe companies concerned about liquidity bond yields fall as their prices rise meaning that those purchases forced rates lower but ending those types of emergency era liquidity measures and the prospect of higher rates can have the opposite effect on markets the release of the fed s latest meeting minutes earlier in january which showed several officials in favor of cutting the balance sheet and raising rates soon sparked a sell off on wall street

shorter durations the weighted average interest rate on the loan portfolio was 3 38 as of december 31 2021 a decrease from 3 47 as of september 30 2021 due primarily to payoffs of loans at higher than

serve as federal reserve governors according to a person familiar with the matter the nominations come at a precarious time for the fed which has in recent weeks signaled it will soon move to raise interest rates to fight inflation president joe biden will nominate sarah bloom raskin to be the federal reserve s next vice chair for supervision arguably the nation s most powerful banking regulator according to people familiar with the matter biden will also nominate lisa cook and philip jefferson to serve as federal reserve governors according to the people who asked not to be named in order to speak freely each nominee will in the coming weeks face questioning from the senate banking committee the congressional body in charge of vetting presidential appointments to the central bank should the senate confirm their nominations cook would be the first black woman to serve on the fed s board while jefferson would be the fourth black man to do so get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters that committee on tuesday held a nomination hearing for fed chair jerome powell whom biden chose to nominate to a second term it held a similar hearing for fed governor lael brainard on thursday whom biden picked to be the central bank s next vice chair in choosing raskin for the vice chair for supervision post biden looks to make good on democrats promises to reinforce laws passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis and restore aspects of a rule named for former fed chair paul volcker that had restricted banks ability to trade for their own profit raskin has experience at the fed and served as a governor at the central bank from 2010 to 2014 before serving as deputy secretary of the treasury under the obama administration she is married to rep jamie raskin d md powell and brainard are both expected to clear the senate without fanfare and with bipartisan support but raskin cook and jefferson could see tougher confirmation odds pennsylvania republican sen pat toomey the ranking member of the banking committee was quick to pan biden s latest choices sarah bloom raskin has specifically called for the fed to pressure banks to choke off credit to traditional energy companies and to exclude those employers from any fed emergency lending facilities he said in a statement thursday evening i have serious concerns that she would abuse the fed s narrow statutory mandates on monetary policy and banking supervision to have the central bank actively engaged in capital allocation i will closely examine whether ms cook and mr jefferson have the necessary experience judgment and policy views to serve as fed governors he added while jefferson s name had more recently come up in closed door discussions to serve as a governor cook s nomination was well telegraphed cnbc reported in may that she was the top choice of sen sherrod brown the banking committee s chairman and an ohio democrat to serve as a governor with these nominees president biden is showing the country what a federal reserve standing on the side of workers and their local communities looks like brown said in a statement friday morning they will bring important perspectives to the federal reserve board about the economic issues women black and brown workers and rural and industrial communities across the country face cook is a professor of economics and international relations at michigan state university she is also a member of the steering committee at the center for equitable growth a progressive washington based think tank that counts several of biden s top economists among its alumni she also served as a senior economist in the obama administration s council of economic advisors jefferson meanwhile is vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty at davidson college his decadeslong career in academics has focused on labor markets and poverty notable works of his include a 2005 study that evaluated the costs and benefits of monetary policy that promotes a high pressure economy in which the fed allows easier access to cash and lower interest rates to spur tighter labor markets he and other economists including brainard have argued in general and barring extraordinary economic conditions that the added benefits of lower rates on maximum employment is worth the potential for warmer inflation raskin and regulation since leaving the government raskin has pressed the fed and other financial regulators to take a more proactive role to address the financial risks posed by climate change while none of its regulatory agencies was specifically designed to mitigate the risks of climate related events each has a mandate broad enough to encompass these risks within the scope of the instruments already given to it by congress raskin wrote in september in light of the changing climate s unpredictable but clearly intensifying effects on the economy u s regulators will need to leave their comfort zone and act early before the problem worsens and becomes even more expensive to address she added former vice chair for supervision randal quarles who recently left the fed played a major role in reducing capital requirements for u s banks with less than 700 billion in assets and relaxing the volcker rule s audit rules for trades made by jpmorgan chase goldman sachs and other investment banks fed officials in favor of an easier regulatory stance argue the industry is well capitalized and not in need of some of the more restrictive measures enacted in the wake of the crisis many democrats including massachusetts sen elizabeth warren have pushed back and said rollbacks leave the banking sector more vulnerable to shocks and liable to excess risk taking inflation battle the nominations come at a precarious time for the fed which has in recent weeks has started to wind down its easy money policies in the face of recovering employment and the highest level of year over year inflation since 1982 in times of normal economic activity the fed adjusts short term interest rates to maximize employment and stabilize prices when the fed wants the economy to heat up it can cut borrowing costs to spur the housing market and broader economic activity as well as employment but if it is concerned about an overheating economy or unruly inflation it can raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive in times of economic emergency the central bank can also tap broader powers and purchase vast quantities of bonds to keep borrowing costs low and boost financial markets with easy access to cash it did so in 2020 with the arrival of the covid 19 pandemic a move that worked to pacify traders and soothe companies concerned about liquidity bond yields fall as their prices rise meaning that those purchases forced rates lower but ending those types of emergency era liquidity measures and the prospect of higher rates can have the opposite effect on markets the release of the fed s latest meeting minutes earlier in january which showed several officials in favor of cutting the balance sheet and raising rates soon sparked a sell off on wall street

once again some shelves are bare at groceries stores causing anxiety and the need for some to have to stock up on food and necessities whether it be toilet paper or their favorite yogurt it hails back to the early days of the pandemic but this time there is added supply chain issues and inflation concerns everybody is tired of this there has to be a way to fix this nancy mcguire told wptv outside of publix laurah pastel shames a clinical social worker from miami noted that what has happened during this prolonged pandemic isn t classic hoarding which is an obsessive compulsive disorder if it s out of anxiety and fear that when i need this i won t be able to get it it s a valid fear especially when we are kind of used to going to the supermarket and realizing the things that were easily able to be picked up are now a lot more difficult to find said shames one item that was the subject of panic buying is covid 19 tests but that is abating on thursday woolworths reinstated product limits nationwide as a precautionary move amid supply chain constraints a may 2020 paper posted by the national institutes of health in its librarydescribes panic buying as socially undesirable and a form of herd behavior shames said it is hard to point fingers at panic buyers in the time of covid 19 inflation and supply chain breakdowns i don t know what s irrational right now because the truth is i don t think anyone knows said shames the researchers who wrote the paper on the nih website found panic buying is influenced by four factors the first is a perception of a threat such as the pandemic or inflation or just the scarcity of products the second is the fear of the unknown people are anxious that the pandemic will never end and that there will be just one burden after another put in their lives during these trying times the third is coping behavior which is where panic buying is an avenue to relieve anxiety it gives people some sense of control where they feel powerless and finally there are psychological factors this could be social media where a person s network is panicking about the scarcity of items or it could just be seeing someone stocking up on toilet paper at the grocery store especially in the media or on the news when you re seeing these images of supermarkets and the shelves are empty and you re thinking oh goodness next time i go i need to do that too shames said when in reality it might just have been that so many people were kind of reacting the same way
missouri s highest court on tuesday reversed the statutory rape conviction of a st louis man finding video testimony violated the defendant s 6th amendment rights jefferson city mo an overturned conviction in missouri is raising new questions about video testimony in criminal court cases nationwide and the ruling could have ripple effects through a justice system increasingly reliant on remote technology as it struggles with a backlog of cases during the coronavirus pandemic missouri s highest court on tuesday reversed the statutory rape conviction of a st louis man finding that an investigator s video testimony violated the defendant s sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him the investigator appeared remotely in 2019 because he was on paternity leave testifying that dna evidence taken from the victim s clothing matched the defendant s dna the victim had since recanted her accusations so the conviction and sentence of probation turned on the dna evidence many state and federal courts halted all criminal trials for months during the pandemic allowing remote trials only when defendants explicitly agreed to forfeit any rights to in person confrontation of their accusers the missouri ruling differs from many pandemic era cases because the judge went ahead despite the defendant s objections state court systems typically handle millions of cases every year in total the vast majority of which will not be directly affected by the legal questions raised in the missouri ruling but even if that decision impacts only several hundred cases it would mean yet more challenges for an already overburdened judiciary the decision could eventually make this a test case for the u s supreme court said michael wolff a former chief justice of the missouri supreme court and a professor at the st louis university school of law this guy was convicted with the use of zoom technology and could not have been convicted without it wolff said the nation s highest court has allowed exemptions for child witness to testify remotely to shield them from a potentially traumatic experience but you still don t get away from the fact that the constitution says there s a right to confrontation the u s supreme court has grappled with the legal ramifications of remote testimony for decades though the constitutional questions it raises have never been fully answered a landmark ruling in maryland v craig in 1990 upheld a trial judge s decision to let a victim of child abuse testify remotely in a 5 4 decision the court said the sixth amendment doesn t guarantee an absolute right to in person confrontations especially if remote testimony is necessary to further an important public policy it said lessening the trauma of testifying to a child was a compelling public interest the dissenters said the constitution provided no wiggle room and that the point was to place the witness under the sometimes hostile glare of the defendant some of those same justices were in the majority 14 years later in crawford v washington which asserted that the right to confront an accuser in person was near to absolute recently the minnesota state court of appeals differed from the missouri court by ruling that allowing a witness to testify via live remote two way video did not violate a defendant s rights during the pandemic multiple trial level state and federal courts have displayed care in not appearing to trample on the principle which dates to roman times that those accused of crimes that could cost them their freedom have a right to confront their accusers in august the commonwealth of kentucky court of appeals upheld a lower court s decision denying a prosecutor s request to let one witness testify by video at a fraud trial from prison because traveling to court would put him and others at risk of getting covid 19 the appeals court said general concerns about the spread of the virus do not justify abridging a defendant s right to in person confrontation and that prosecutors never proved the witness was particularly vulnerable to covid 19 the fundamental question has been this is a remote witness testifying by technology functionally the same as being there said fredric lederer chancellor professor of law and director of the center for legal and court technology at william mary law school we don t know if this is constitutional at this point those testifying in person can help show that they are speaking voluntarily people often take body language into account as they are judging truthfulness but research has raised serious questions about the widely held idea that people can gauge trustworthiness better in person lederer said there really is no science to back that up he said at all quite the opposite while the original missouri case unfolded before the pandemic began the use of remote video during court proceedings has expanded exponentially since it took hold this potentially affects every criminal case in which a prosecutor wants to present a remote witness he said but in many pandemic era proceedings defendants have agreed to waive their sixth amendment rights so trials can go forward the missouri case was different in that the defendant objected to the investigator appearing remotely if there was not an objection i think the courts would be wary about upsetting the results of a conviction wolff said in st louis county for example prosecutors are confident in the convictions they have secured during the pandemic largely because defendants waived the right to confront witnesses in person said chris king spokesman for prosecuting attorney wesley bell so there should be no grounds for appeal king said defense attorney nina mcdonnell argued the recently decided missouri case and said the ruling is especially important during the pandemic it makes it clear that it should be up to what rights defendants want to give up or maintain not any other factor said mcdonnell an assistant public defender in st louis two years into the covid 19 pandemic we know it s not the same thing to have video testimony mcdonnell said that s why courts are scrambling to reopen __
