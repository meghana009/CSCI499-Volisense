president biden is pushing to prevent congressional democrats from scaling back his tax proposals as lawmakers work on a 3 5 trillion social spending package aimed at advancing the president s economic agenda the white house and congressional democrats both want to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations and strengthen tax enforcement to pay for investments in areas such as child care health care and climate but the legislation that the house ways and means committee approved wednesday raised some taxes by less than biden had previously proposed and left out some of biden s proposals altogether it remains to be seen whether the administration can get lawmakers to be more aggressive on tax increases and enforcement given democrats narrow majorities in congress in recent days the white house has stepped up its messaging and lawmaker outreach efforts around the social spending package and in particular has been emphasizing its proposals to raise taxes on high income households and corporations and to increase irs enforcement against the wealthy the tax proposals were front and center in a speech biden gave at the white house on thursday i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great god bless you biden said all i m asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn t happening now biden pushed back on republican criticisms of his economic plans saying gop lawmakers would rather protect the tax breaks of those at the very top than give tax breaks to working families the new efforts came as house panels advanced their portions of the 3 5 trillion package notably the ways and means committee advanced a portion that includes tax increase provisions as well as provisions that extend expansions of tax credits that benefit low and middle income households the committee s proposal is less aggressive in raising taxes on high income households and corporations than proposals biden released earlier this year house democrats are proposing smaller increases in the corporate tax rate and the top capital gains rate than biden had additionally the committee left out several of biden s revenue raising proposals including those to tax capital gains at death and to increase the amount of information financial institutions report to the irs about bank accounts white house officials have publicly spoken positively about the ways and means committee bill saying it s a key step toward accomplishing biden s goals on taxes at the same time the administration is pushing congress to do more biden the day of his speech also spoke on the phone with house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and senate majority leader charles schumer d n y about his economic agenda a readout of the call from the white house emphasized unity with the two democratic leaders it said that the three policymakers reaffirmed that as we act at this crucial moment to ensure working families are dealt back into our economy it is only fair that we pay for these tax cuts and investments by repealing the trump tax giveaways to the wealthiest americans and big corporations who often pay little to nothing in taxes the administration has made touting the proposal on irs reporting a focus in recent days the proposal calls for requiring financial institutions to provide the irs with information about account inflows and outflows in an effort to prevent wealthy people from avoiding paying taxes they already owe it s about the super wealthy finally beginning to pay what they owe what the existing tax code calls for just like hard working americans do all over this country every tax day biden said in his speech thursday treasury secretary janet yellen and irs commissioner charles rettig also sent letters to ways and means committee chairman richard neal d mass last week in support of the information reporting proposal the objective of this reporting regime is to help the irs pursue high end noncompliance by providing some information about opaque income streams that disproportionately accrue to the top yellen wrote there are indications that some type of proposal on bank account reporting could make it into the final legislation neal said wednesday that his committee is in conversations with the administration on reporting proposals that target sophisticated tax avoidance and evasion without impacting middle class and working americans former congressional tax aides say it s not surprising that the white house is seeking to emphasize its position on taxes during the negotiations over the social spending package it seems fairly predictable to me that they re trying to get congress to support as much of the president s agenda as they can said ryan abraham a former senate finance committee aide who is now a principal at ey s washington council the white house may also be hoping that senate democrats propose tax increases that go beyond house democrats legislation senate finance committee chairman ron wyden d ore has expressed interest in tax increase options that were not in the ways and means bill such as taxing billionaires investment gains annually and an excise tax on stock buybacks this policy is far from done abraham said at the same time biden has to get nearly every democratic house member and every democratic senator to vote for a final piece of legislation and some moderates have already raised concerns about tax and spending proposals in house democrats bill on wednesday biden met with sens joe manchin d w va and kyrsten sinema d ariz two moderates who have raised concerns about the size of the social spending package democrats will also face a major effort from business groups and republicans to advocate against his tax proposals for example a group of financial industry and business organizations on friday urged house leaders to not adopt biden s irs information reporting proposal saying it is not well targeted at uncovering instances of wealthy people not complying with tax laws congressional observers say biden will need to work to get moderates and progressive to reach a consensus when the political margins are very tight you just can t ignore that said jorge castro a former congressional aide and senior irs official who now is a co leader of the tax policy practice at miller chevalier

while much of the legislative attention has been on the bipartisan infrastructure deal and the far left 3 5t reconciliation bill a more pressing battle is taking shape in order to avoid default and to pay for all the democrats wildest dreams the debt ceiling needs to be raised treasury secretary janet yellen has already called senate minority leader mitch mcconnell in a desperate plea to get republicans to play along advertisement he was having none of it though as mcconnell let it be known that democrats were on their own in their quest to further blow out the budget now the media blitz is on to paint that move as some kind of national betrayal analysis senate republicans say they will vote to allow a debt default leaving democrats scrambling for plan to avert economic crisis the washington post washingtonpost september 18 2021 the minority which the gop is in the senate doesn t allow anything that s the entire thing with being a minority and having no real power so why are democrats so angry that republicans won t do their dirty work for them after all the democrats could pass a debt ceiling increase via reconciliation all on their own yet not only are they pretending that s not an option but nancy pelosi has already rejected the idea the washington post seems to believe that democrats have leverage here and i m just not seeing it now almost two years later democrats have set up a similar type of strategy that if successful will force republicans to accept their fair share of the national debt that now tops 28 trillion if this strategy fails the federal government could run out of funding authority and enter another congressionally forced shutdown the fourth in less than a decade and create a debt crisis that could rattle global financial markets the similar type of strategy being cited is the one pelosi used in regards trump s first impeachment where she sent over baseless articles of impeachment in hopes of shaming mcconnell into creating the spectacle she wanted to his credit he didn t take the bait took the media lumps and quickly moved to a vote that ultimately failed advertisement i think pelosi has even less ability to bully mcconnell this time around republicans are not in power and the party that s in power is who will be blamed for a shutdown if the debt ceiling isn t raised and they should be given they have the votes to raise it themselves no gop member should oblige in taking any share of the blame for yet more inflation but you can expect the media to keep pushing this idea that it s somehow the republicans who won t raise the debt ceiling no it s democrats who could do it but don t want to do it alone well tough luck if they want their massive reconciliation bill they need to own every bit of it frankly i think a shutdown battle will only help the gop going into 2022 their position is strong there s no reason to give in now

september 15th we all need to be unified and everyone knows that so that doesn t mean people don t fight for their beliefs but at the end of the day we have to come together thus far we have is it going to be easy on reconciliation absolutely not but if past is prologue we got a chance it s good decent chance house speaker nancy pelosi faces a similar challenge since she can only afford to lose a handful of votes from her caucus the house is expected to return from its recess early on august 23 to vote on the budget resolution that the senate passed earlier this week advertisement democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected share copy link copy president joe biden and congressional democrats want to raise taxes on the rich to pay for their 3 5 trillion plan to expand the nation s safety net saying the wealthy should pay their fair share the rich would be hit in a variety of ways under the proposal advanced by the house ways means committee the house legislation calls for reversing a key plank of the republicans 2017 tax cuts by returning the top marginal income tax rate to 39 6 up from 37 that new top rate would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 a year and married couples filing jointly earning more than 450 000 annually that s lower than the roughly top 1 threshold that biden proposed earlier this year in his american families plan but the committee s plan also is in keeping with the president s pledge that he would not increase taxes on those earning less than 400 000 which is more than 90 of taxpayers all told the legislation would bring in an additional 1 trillion in revenue from high income americans according to the committee i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great biden said in an economic speech thursday all i m asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn t happening now here are three things to know about the very rich 1 it took 540 000 in adjusted gross income to get into the top 1 in 2018 according to the latest internal revenue service data that s the highest the threshold has been since at least 2001 the agency changed its methodology so prior data is not strictly comparable more than 1 4 million returns fell into this category in 2018 the dollar figure had climbed steadily at the start of the century before plunging in 2008 and 2009 during the great recession it began rising again as the economy and stock market improved the top 1 is not a static group however only 30 of taxpayers were in the cohort for five consecutive years between 1991 and 2009 on average according to 2013 research by treasury department office of tax analysis economists 2 the top 1 accounted for roughly 21 of total adjusted gross income in 2018 the figure has fluctuated with the business cycle since 2001 hitting a low of 16 the following year and nearly 23 in 2007 according to the irs most of their income comes from investments rather than labor their salary and wage income accounted for only around 11 of total salary and wage income in 2018 but for 67 of total capital gains income and for about 50 of total qualified dividend income said erica york economist with the right leaning tax foundation meanwhile the share of income reported by the bottom 50 of taxpayers was 11 6 in 2018 the tax policy center uses a much broader definition of income including student loan interest employer paid health insurance retirement plan contributions employers share of payroll taxes and income from cash transfers using the center s definition the top 1 accounted for 15 8 of income and paid 37 3 of federal individual income taxes in 2020 said robert mcclelland senior fellow at the tax policy center 3 the top 1 paid 615 7 billion in federal income taxes about 40 of the total in 2018 that s the highest percentage since 2001 when it was 33 2 according to the irs data the share bounced around a bit after that but has risen steadily since 2016 part of the reason the wealthy are paying a larger slice is because expansions of refundable tax credits and the near doubling of the standard deduction as part of the republicans tax cuts reduced the share paid by those lower on the income scale york said the percentage of federal income tax paid by the bottom half of taxpayers fell from 4 9 in 2001 to just below 3 in 2018 however just because the wealthy have been paying a larger share of taxes doesn t mean they are forking over more money to the federal government mcclelland said the amount the top 1 paid in taxes in 2017 was roughly the same in terms of dollars and their average tax rate was 26 8 that year versus 25 4 in 2018 by contrast the tax rate for the bottom 50 was 3 4 according to the irs looking over the longer term the tax rate of the rich has fallen sharply since world war ii it plummeted from about 40 in 1945 to about 25 in 2015 for the top 1 according to the tax policy center which used a different measure that includes untaxed capital gains but the rate across all taxpayers has remained relatively stable over that time here s how the democrats want to tax the rich the top marginal income tax rate would rise to 39 6 up from 37 and would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 and married couples earning more than 450 000 annually the top capital gains rate would increase to 25 from 20 for individuals earning more than 400 000 and couples making more than 450 000 that s lower than biden s proposal which would have raised it to the top marginal rate for wages and salaries of 39 6 for those earning more than 1 million annually in addition lawmakers would slap a 3 surcharge on individuals earning more than 5 million this means that their top marginal income tax rate would rise to 42 6 and it would push their capital gains rate to 28 before the 3 8 net investment income tax is factored in and that net investment income tax would be extended to cover business income included on taxpayers personal returns known as pass through income currently it is only levied on interest dividends capital gains and other forms of investment income the legislation would also end the higher estate tax exemption enacted under the republicans tax cuts this year instead of after 2025 the exemption would be 6 million per person in 2022 a sharp decline from this year s 11 7 million level the democrats are planning to push through the 3 5 trillion budget package via reconciliation so it would not need any republican support in the senate
in an effort to get a clearer picture on how generation z invests gobankingrates surveyed 1 000 americans aged 18 through 24 from across the country on aug 19 through aug 20 2021 asking six different questions about their finances the survey focused on what gen zers invest in where they got their financial education and other basic financial information ranging from debt levels to job priorities and spending preferences gobankingrates used purespectrum s survey platform to conduct the poll here are some of the highlights of that survey take a look the 10 best stocks for the gen z investor read 4 industries gen z might save and 4 it might destroy how does gen z invest as the youngest generation it s perhaps not surprising that gen z is just getting started with investing in fact 34 of survey respondents indicated that they don t invest at all but with an upper age range of about 25 most gen zers are just starting out with some just beginning their first jobs while others still remain in school so where are gen zers putting their money an impressive 19 of respondents indicated they are investing in real estate making it the second most popular asset class behind stocks and just ahead of cryptocurrency real estate investing typically involves significant down payments and or high levels of income making this response a bit of a surprise however these investors may be participating via real estate investment trusts crowdfunding platforms or other avenues to real estate investing about 11 of respondents were invested in collectibles and 12 5 owned mutual funds or etfs almost 17 of respondents mentioned investing in an ira or 401 k plan one of the most surprising responses on the survey was that 12 9 of gen zers indicated that while they were invested they weren t sure what they were investing in another notable statistic is that a much higher percentage of women than men indicated they were not invested at all at 38 1 versus 25 8 respectively see surprising ways gen z and millennials are worlds apart financially where did gen z get their financial education the most popular individual source of financial information among respondents is parents or family garnering 22 7 of responses however when grouped together a whopping 38 8 of respondents indicated that their primary source of financial education is either youtube tiktok or other social media like twitter or instagram an additional 7 6 of gen zers reported doing their own research or using reddit forums for information only 17 6 indicated they got their financial education from a high school or college class this is perhaps befitting given the online adeptness typically associated with generation z but it might have ramifications on the quality of the financial information they re receiving it might also be a reason why nearly 13 of gen zers indicated they didn t know what they were invested in find out what gen z can learn from millennials money mistakes how much debt does gen z have generation z isn t quite old enough yet to have taken on the massive amounts of student and other debt that plague older generations in fact 34 3 of respondents reported having no debt at all with only 3 5 having debt of 75 000 or more about 15 5 had debt of 25 000 or more overall men reported having slightly higher debt levels than women with 36 08 of women reporting no debt at all versus 31 09 of men however some recent studies have indicated that gen zers have taken on a lot more debt to finance their investments than other generations take action 7 moves gen z should be making to protect themselves financially what does gen z prioritize in a job perhaps as a sign of the times only 16 5 of gen z respondents indicated that money was the most important thing they were looking for in terms of a job work life balance was the top response at 24 8 and career passion was the second most popular answer at 19 6 more men than women prioritized pay and performance bonuses while women showed a higher preference for work life balance and good management company values what does gen z spend their money on overall besides rent the single biggest expense for gen zers is food including both groceries and eating out encouragingly saving or investing is the second biggest expense category coming in at 15 9 other major expenses in descending order included entertainment utility bills credit card bills material purchases of goods such as clothing student loan payments and car related costs according to the survey results women tended to spend more money on food and auto related expenses while men put more money toward saving investing entertainment and credit card bills check out a look at gen z s financial habits from spending to saving and more what is the current living situation for gen z nearly 50 of gen z respondents indicated they have either always lived with their parents or moved back in with them during the pandemic an additional 13 9 indicated that they did move back in with their parents during the pandemic but have since moved back out only 20 2 indicated that they lived on their own and didn t consider returning to their

following a meeting on sunday with the regulator ofgem mr kwarteng said well rehearsed plans were in place to ensure consumers were not cut off in the event of further failures however he is expected to come under pressure from the big suppliers for a major government support package to help them through the crisis the financial tines reported the industry wants the creation of a so called bad bank to absorb unprofitable customers from firms that fail meanwhile boris johnson sought to reassure consumers the price increases were only temporary as the world economy picked up after the covid pandemic it s like everybody going back to put the kettle on at the end of a tv programme you re seeing huge stresses on the world supply systems he told reporters travelling with him to the united nations general assembly in new york oguk representing the offshore oil and gas industry reported wholesale prices for gas have surged 250 since january with a 70 rise since august alone following a weekend locked in emergency talks mr kwarteng acknowledged it was a worrying time for customers but said he was confident supplies could be maintained he said consumers would be protected from sudden price hikes through the government s energy price cap however that puts pressure on the suppliers particularly smaller companies who are unable to pass on the increases in wholesale gas prices to their customers four firms have already folded and there are fears that more could follow some analysts have reportedly predicted that the uk s energy companies could be reduced to three quarters over the coming months leaving as few as 10 after meeting ofgem chief executive jonathan brearley on sunday mr kwarteng indicated that in the event of further failures he could appointment a special administrator effectively a form of temporary nationalisation our priority is to protect consumers if a supplier of last resort is not possible a special administrator would be appointed by ofgem and the govt the objective is to continue supply to customers until the company can be rescued or customers moved to new suppliers 3 7 kwasi kwarteng kwasikwarteng september 19 2021 our priority is to protect consumers if a supplier of last resort is not possible a special administrator would be appointed by ofgem and the government he said the objective is to continue supply to customers until the company can be rescued or customers moved to new suppliers at the same time ministers are grappling with warnings of potential shortages on the shelves as the knock on effect of the gas price rise ripples through the economy producers have warned that supplies of meat poultry and fizzy drinks could all be hit due to a shortage of carbon dioxide co2 it follows the shutting down of two large fertiliser plants in teesside and cheshire which produce co2 as a by product with the owners citing the increase in gas prices the food and drink federation chief executive ian wright said co2 was essential to many production processes and warned there could be serious consequences for supplies within a matter of days on sunday mr kwarteng met with tony will the global chief executive of cf industries the uk s biggest supplier of co2 and the owner of the two fertiliser plants he said they had discussed the pressures the business was facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies including to our food and energy industries the rise in gas prices has been blamed on a number of factors including a cold winter which left stocks depleted high demand for liquefied natural gas from asia and a reduction in supplies from russia mr johnson however insisted that he remained confident energy supplies would be maintained gavin barwell has said the current situation around gas has the potential to become a crisis stefan rousseau pa i have no doubt that supply issues will be readily addressed we re very confident in our supply chains he said but in the meantime we will make sure we work with all the gas companies to do whatever we can to keep people s supplies coming to make sure they don t go out for business and to make sure we get through the current difficult period tory peer lord barwell who was theresa may s chief of staff warned the current situation could become a crisis speaking on bbc radio 4 s the westminster hour lord barwell said it definitely has the potential to become a crisis i think that the first concern of government will be about ensuring security of supply making sure that we re all still getting the gas that we need both domestic and businesses but the second concern will be about prices that consumers are being asked to pay more generally the government will also be worried about the cost of living we ve got the tax increases that they ve just brought in we ve got the universal credit reduction that s about to come online plus rising energy bills i think there is a real political danger here of cost of living issues becoming a real difficulty for the government

as it looks to restore its public image in the wake of a series of scandals in recent years wells fargo co is continuing to draw attention to itself with another federal fine and calls from u s sen elizabeth warren d mass for the federal reserve to break up the bank san francisco based wells fargo nyse wfc is the philadelphia region s largest retail bank with nearly 34 billion in deposits employing about 6 000 people locally its ceo charlie scharf has worked to revamp the institution including by restructuring it into five lines of business and cutting expenses to keep up with competitors like bank of america and jpmorgan chase co the business journal recently sat down with vice chairman of public affairs bill daley a former white house chief of staff in the obama administration to talk about wells fargo s efforts to recover from recent debacles including its damning fake accounts scandal below are additional key takeaways from daley about the bank s journey forward in a pandemic world responses have been edited for length and clarity what do small businesses especially minority owned enterprises need from their banks now in the pandemic right now they re just trying to survive community development financial institutions usually turn around and lend money to their customers but now they re seeing the need isn t so much a loan as much as a grant just to help them stay alive a lot of small businesses in philadelphia have gone away and when you get into communities of color many of these are really small businesses they ve struggled with employment getting people to work we re trying to work with lots of organizations and come up with ways whether it s granting money or changing lending standards to try to be there for small businesses what strategy is charlie scharf using to move wells fargo forward from challenges of recent years charlie came into a very difficult situation with a company that is the third largest bank in the country asset wise but with a challenged regulatory situation he s very focused disciplined and went about this in a way that you would expect nobody expects a pandemic it was a curveball to all of us the first thing he did was make some dramatic leadership changes his operating committee is about two thirds of people who came in from outside of the top 200 people in the bank 100 are new or have new jobs that s how you move one of these big institutions you ve got to get control of people and move people in who have experience he also was challenged with the need for diversity we now have three people of color on our operating committee and a fourth coming on there was also a sense of needing to make some change in the diversity of our products and appealing to communities of color what did you learn from your time in politics about building back from crises that you can now apply at wells fargo at any big institution you ve got to have a team that you are comfortable with and depend on for charlie to build that was the biggest challenge it s different in that when you come into a crisis and everyone you re bringing in comes into a crisis you can t do it to be frank as the administrations are able to when they change relatively immediately it took charlie getting the right team starting in october 2019 through today you can t predict things when you think things are going great something s going to happen that s what happens in a big company as it does in government you just have to try to get prepared for whatever comes at you what do you anticipate for the future of online and mobile banking and how could that impact branch operations some people have been predicting the end of branches forever lots of people still like to engage in going into a branch to talk to people have questions answered make their financial transaction in person there s no doubt online and mobile banking is rising generationally substantially that younger generation doesn t have the need for what resources may be in a branch for payroll or things like that our branch consolidation that s happened is more about right sizing to where people live and where our customers are it s a big challenge for institutions like ours because these new fintechs and other groups that are just using technology don t have the same infrastructure nobody demands them to have a branch in a certain neighborhood or engage in communities like we do whether that historic model is going to change is something that may or may not happen in the coming years but it will have a lot of ramifications in communities that some people may not realize right now what does all this mean in terms of potential staffing cuts headed into 2022 we re a pretty inefficient organization compared to other big banks this is public knowledge it s been acknowledged in different publications we ve begun to expense control to try to bring our numbers down we have way more employees than our competitors who are much more efficient and effective and do a better job at a lot of things we re in the middle of that that s multiyear we don t have a number to cut but we re trying to make ourselves more efficient and effective at the same time we re hiring in rather large numbers nationally but we re in uncharted waters what is the post pandemic world going to look like are people going to want to go back into the office do the jobs they were doing before it s going to be a challenging couple of years there s no question i think anybody who thinks we re going back however you want to define what going back was ain t gonna happen how do you see hospitality businesses and other sectors faring now you had two economies going on at the same time and to a large degree still do the people contact businesses were very challenged and then you had outlying businesses and those less dependent upon personal contact skyrocketing that person to person economy is still very challenged whether it s tourism hotels restaurants cruise lines airlines we all thought three four months ago that by the holiday season everyone would be roaring back into retail stores and other places where you have contact that seems to maybe not be the case which will slow down the general economy and recovery that people were predicting which was going to be so vibrant so strong there were predictions of eight to 10 gdp growth the economy is still strong i think the delta variant will have an impact on that massive growth that people thought was going to come are there any plans to relocate headquarters there was some conjecture after scharf brought in new leadership from the new york area headquarters is in san francisco and charlotte had more employees than san francisco did for a long time so charlotte s a big base for us and new york with a number of the operating committee members we have i think 16 000 people in minneapolis 11 000 in des moines we have a big presence in phoenix so no there s no plans to move the headquarters and in today s world everybody seems to want to be wherever they want to be

program no republicans are expected to support the plan and it s unclear whether it will get the backing of all senate democrats which is necessary to pass democratic senators kirsten cinema and joe manchin don t support the current cost yesterday manchin said he has serious concerns about the grave consequences of spending that much money but president biden has argued this long term investment will be fully paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations he said it will enable middle and working class families to get ahead by lowering their cost of living and addressing factors that keep people out of the workforce if your primary concern right now is the cost of living you should support this plan not opposed it because the vote against this plan is a vote against lowering

lower than biden s proposal which would have raised it to the top marginal rate for wages and salaries of 39 6 for those earning more than 1 million annually in addition lawmakers would slap a 3 surcharge on individuals earning more than 5 million this means that their top marginal income tax rate would rise to 42 6 and it would push their capital gains rate to 28 before the 3 8 net investment income tax is factored in and that net investment income tax would be extended to cover business income included on taxpayers personal returns known as pass through income currently it is only levied on interest dividends capital gains and other forms of investment income the legislation would also end the higher estate tax exemption enacted under the republicans tax cuts this year instead of after 2025 the exemption would be 6 million per person in 2022 a sharp decline from this year s 11 7 million level the democrats are planning to push through the 3 5 trillion budget package via reconciliation so it would not need any republican support in the senate

democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected today president biden will continue to drum up support for his 3 5 trillion human infrastructure plan the white house says he ll speak about how it will lower the cost of prescription drugs the president touted his build back better agenda yesterday hours after the senate passed a budget resolution kicking off the process for drafting and passing it in a party line vote we need to make this economy work better for working families in the long run these challenges are with us long before the pandemic and before i took office but as we recover from this crisis now is the moment to put in place the long term plan to build back america better president biden s plan includes universal pre k two years of free community college clean energy and transportation incentives investments in housing via hospitals and work force development it would also add dental vision and hearing benefits to the medicare program no republicans are expected to support the plan and it s unclear whether it will get the backing of all senate democrats which is necessary to pass democratic senators kirsten cinema and joe manchin don t support the current cost yesterday manchin said he has serious concerns about the grave consequences of spending that much money but president biden has argued this long term investment will be fully paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations he said it will enable middle and working class families to get ahead by lowering their cost of living and addressing factors that keep people out of the workforce if your primary concern right now is the cost of living you should support this plan not opposed it because the vote against this plan is a vote against lowering the cost of health care housing childcare elder care and prescription drugs for american families senate majority leader chuck schumer acknowledged the hardest work may be yet to come in order to get all 50 democrats to support expanding the social safety net he said committee chairs will meet with their members at least once a week during their month long recess schumer wants the bill drafted by september 15th we all need to be unified and everyone knows that so that doesn t mean people don t fight for their beliefs but at the end of the day we have to come together thus far we have is it going to be easy on reconciliation absolutely not but if past is prologue we got a chance it s good decent chance house speaker nancy pelosi faces a similar challenge since she can only afford to lose a handful of votes from her caucus the house is expected to return from its recess early on august 23 to vote on the budget resolution that the senate passed earlier this week advertisement democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected share copy link copy president joe biden and congressional democrats want to raise taxes on the rich to pay for their 3 5 trillion plan to expand the nation s safety net saying the wealthy should pay their fair share the rich would be hit in a variety of ways under the proposal advanced by the house ways means committee the house legislation calls for reversing a key plank of the republicans 2017 tax cuts by returning the top marginal income tax rate to 39 6 up from 37 that new top rate would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 a year and married couples filing jointly earning more than 450 000 annually that s lower than the roughly top 1 threshold that biden proposed earlier this year in his american families plan but the committee s plan also is in keeping with the president s pledge that he would not increase taxes on those earning less than 400 000 which is more than 90 of taxpayers all told the legislation would bring in an additional 1 trillion in revenue from high income americans according to the committee i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great biden said in an economic speech thursday all i m asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn t happening now here are three things to know about the very rich 1 it took 540 000 in adjusted gross income to get into the top 1 in 2018 according to the latest internal revenue service data that s the highest the threshold has been since at least 2001 the agency changed its methodology so prior data is not strictly comparable more than 1 4 million returns fell into this category in 2018 the dollar figure had climbed steadily at the start of the century before plunging in 2008 and 2009 during the great recession it began rising again as the economy and stock market improved the top 1 is not a static group however only 30 of taxpayers were in the cohort for five consecutive years between 1991 and 2009 on average according to 2013 research by treasury department office of tax analysis economists 2 the top 1 accounted for roughly 21 of total adjusted gross income in 2018 the figure has fluctuated with the business cycle since 2001 hitting a low of 16 the following year and nearly 23 in 2007 according to the irs most of their income comes from investments rather than labor their salary and wage income accounted for only around 11 of total salary and wage income in 2018 but for 67 of total capital gains income and for about 50 of total qualified dividend income said erica york economist with the right leaning tax foundation meanwhile the share of income reported by the bottom 50 of taxpayers was 11 6 in 2018 the tax policy center uses a much broader definition of income including student loan interest employer paid health insurance retirement plan contributions employers share of payroll taxes and income from cash transfers using the center s definition the top 1 accounted for 15 8 of income and paid 37 3 of federal individual income taxes in 2020 said robert mcclelland senior fellow at the tax policy center 3 the top 1 paid 615 7 billion in federal income taxes about 40 of the total in 2018 that s the highest percentage since 2001 when it was 33 2 according to the irs data the share bounced around a bit after that but has risen steadily since 2016 part of the reason the wealthy are paying a larger slice is because expansions of refundable tax credits and the near doubling of the standard deduction as part of the republicans tax cuts reduced the share paid by those lower on the income scale york said the percentage of federal income tax paid by the bottom half of taxpayers fell from 4 9 in 2001 to just below 3 in 2018 however just because the wealthy have been paying a larger share of taxes doesn t mean they are forking over more money to the federal government mcclelland said the amount the top 1 paid in taxes in 2017 was roughly the same in terms of dollars and their average tax rate was 26 8 that year versus 25 4 in 2018 by contrast the tax rate for the bottom 50 was 3 4 according to the irs looking over the longer term the tax rate of the rich has fallen sharply since world war ii it plummeted from about 40 in 1945 to about 25 in 2015 for the top 1 according to the tax policy center which used a different measure that includes untaxed capital gains but the rate across all taxpayers has remained relatively stable over that time here s how the democrats want to tax the rich the top marginal income tax rate would rise to 39 6 up from 37 and would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 and married couples earning more than 450 000 annually the top capital gains rate would increase to 25 from 20 for individuals earning more than 400 000 and couples making more than 450 000 that s lower than biden s proposal which would have raised it to the top marginal rate for wages and salaries of 39 6 for those earning more than 1 million annually in addition lawmakers would slap a 3 surcharge on individuals earning more than 5 million this means that their top marginal income tax rate would rise to 42 6 and it would push their capital gains rate to 28 before the 3 8 net

peter quinn wanted to do something simple it was 1994 and quinn had just published banished children of eve his epic novel of new york city and the irish famine up until then there had been a monumental gap in american literature the irish had been in new york city going back to the days when peter minuit as legend has it hoodwinked the local algonquins and snatched up the island of manhattan for 24 bucks in trinkets and yet despite this massive irish presence there had never been an iconic irish novel of new york city chicago had its james t farrell boston had its edwin o connor true there were many brilliant new york irish writers but it seemed there never was going to be a new york studs lonigan trilogy or a new york equivalent of o connor s the last hurrah more disappointing still was the fact that the famine had apparently exacted such a toll on the new york irish that it was always hard to find writings from the era the actual words of survivors so traumatized it seemed were these banished children that survival was all that mattered putting pencil to paper and recounting this experience was just too painful and would be for decades then along came peter quinn banished children of eve which won an american book award gave a voice to those traumatized immigrants in fact quinn created an entire chorus a fictional and historical symphony of a city which loathed the irish yet absorbed them forever transforming both the city and those immigrants meanwhile almost a decade before martin scorsese and leonardo dicaprio had everyone talking about the new york city draft riots with their film gangs of new york banished children of eve shed important light on these tragic events which everyone seemed to want to forget quinn in fact was an adviser to scorsese on gangs of new york what must be added is that banished children of eve was a big book not just because it took on big themes and big ideas no it was also literally big weighing in at well over 600 pages meaning quinn had to put in years of research in order to accurately depict new york during the middle of the 19th century when all the research was done his book written and accolades accepted quinn was sure of one thing when it came to writing his second book he wanted to keep it simple i love raymond chandler he said during a recent interview referring to the famed noir author of such detective classics as the big sleep and the long goodbye so i said let me try something fast i ll try a detective thing i ll set it in new york city instead of l a nearly a decade later quinn is back with his detective thing entitled hour of the cat the novel splits time between berlin and new york and explores the frightening eugenics movement on the eve of adolph hitler s mad quest for global domination is this peter quinn s idea of a fast thing the 58 year old author laughs then says what i really wanted to be in life was a historian i love the research there s no better excuse to not actually write quinn continues in having written two novels now i ve come to see that part of the process is getting totally lost sometimes you go down alleyways some don t pan out some lead you to other places part murder mystery part historical warning hour of the cat has already received rave reviews entertainment weekly called it a tingling thriller while usa today called it the best kind of historical novel driven by memorable characters a suspenseful plot and real life issues raymond chandler had his beloved private eye philip marlowe quinn has irish american fintan dunne we first meet dunne as he is investigating what quinn calls a simple new york city homicide in 1938 but like the reader dunne will soon learn that this killing has its roots in nazi germany where hitler s designs on the world may or may not be thwarted by a secret coup being planned by a cadre of german military officers quinn journeys the reader halfway around the world to introduce us to admiral wilhelm canaris an actual historical figure who indeed opposed hitler the berlin setting of hour of the cat also allows quinn to introduce one of the book s central ideas the eugenics movement which was popular in both europe and north america according to quinn hour of the cat had its roots in the once fashionable notion that the irish were genetically inferior i had some questions left over after banished children of eve says quinn a bronx native who now lives in hastings on hudson with his wife kathleen and his teenaged children genevieve and daniel quinn adds that 19th century scientists believed that you could tell the intelligence level of people by the size of their skulls many believed the irish had abnormally large skulls and thus were genetically less intelligent than many other ethnic groups by the 1930s of course the nazis had turned genetics into a justification for mass murder but the uncomfortable fact about hour of the cat is that it shows eugenics had powerful supporters in the u s as well while researching hour of the cat quinn published a shocking article in american heritage about the eugenics movement in america by the beginning of the twentieth century several forces had joined together to give the eugenics movement new power and prominence quinn wrote by the 1890s a large and to many old stock americans alarming wave of foreigners was arriving between 1898 and 1907 annual immigration more than quintupled from 225 000 to 1 300 000 and its primary source was no longer northern europe but italians slavs and jews from southern and eastern europe quinn continues it wasn t long before the presumptions of eugenics about the unfit and the growing threat they posed began to find their way into law with the enthusiastic endorsement of president theodore roosevelt a true believer in the threat posed by weaker stocks congress voted in 1903 to bar the entry of persons with any history of epilepsy or insanity forced sterilization became a popular way to prevent defective humans from reproducing ultimately quinn says that 60 000 americans were sterilized under the guise of being genetically weak the ideas quinn explores in hour of the cat are not locked away in the past he sees echoes of it in the 21st century scientific quest for genetic information people are always looking for a gene to explain human conduct and human intelligence quinn says peter quinn was born and raised in the bronx and attended bronx schools from kindergarten to high school his grandparents were irish immigrants who fled the famine and its aftereffects the quinns came from near holy cross in tipperary in the 1870s says quinn there are also mannings and purcells in his family tree who arrived in 1847 from we think kilkenny quinn continues my mother s mother catherine riordan was from blarney her father seamus murphy was from outside macroom also in cork i went back with my mother to his village in the late 1970 s the priest said that 200 of the 300 families in the town had murphy as a last name so unless we knew my grandfather s grandfather s first name it would be hard to trace our line things can get complicated in the irish countryside the household in which quinn grew up emphasized education quinn s parents peter and viola nee murphy were both first generation college graduates school was a big deal quinn recalls so was storytelling both my novels are stuffed with tales facts and lore gleaned from a lifetime in new york quinn s dad worked as an engineer but attended law school at night eventually going into politics where he was elected a congressman and later became a judge we worshipped fdr and we thought the second coming was when kennedy was elected president said quinn of his loyal irish democratic family quinn graduated from manhattan college in 1969 with a degree in history then went to kansas city where he worked as a teacher he thought about moving even further west to california but being out of the bronx for the first time in his life made him look back at his hometown with a different set of eyes specifically he wondered about his immigrant grandparents he d known a lot about the place where they and so many others settled new york and america what he knew little about because few people ever seemed to talk about it was the place they came from famine scarred ireland quinn returned home taught at paramus catholic high school and eventually received a master s degree in history from fordham and completed all the work for a ph d other than the dissertation quinn never thought about following his dad into politics the bronx was changing quinn notes i grew up at a time when old immigrants were leaving this was literally a crumbling world more historically than politically inclined quinn nevertheless did follow his father in one way quinn became a political speechwriter eventually working for new york s last irish american governor hugh carey as well as governor mario cuomo quinn helped write cuomo s famous 1984 speech at notre dame considered a landmark document on how roman catholics could remain close to their faith in the political arena the grind of politics however soon wore quinn down he signed on with media conglomerate time inc as chief speechwriter in 1985 quinn then began something of a double life as a writer and commentator on irish america quinn along with his brother tom wrote a 1987 tv documentary mcsorley s new york which won a new york area emmy award for outstanding historical programming quinn also served as editor of the recorder the journal of the american irish historical society and also contributed articles and reviews to american heritage the catholic historical review the los angeles times the new york times and the philadelphia inquirer quinn first went to ireland in the late 1960s i was shocked at how poor the country seemed i remember o connell street at rush hour being filled with bicycles and bad food and shoddy goods in the department stores it felt to me like an eastern european country still i fell instantly in love with the place his last visit was in 1998 with frank mccourt during the filming of angela s ashes all had changed changed utterly he says quoting yeats ireland was a modern booming part of the eu following banished children of eve quinn also became a prominent talking head for acclaimed documentaries such as the irish in america and new york a documentary film quinn is still at the company now known as time warner serving as corporate editorial director he plans to retire this year which he says will allow more time for writing next up for quinn is a collection of his essays to be published by notre dame university press the tentative title is looking for jimmy reflections of a bronx irish catholic then quinn plans to write what he is calling a family memoir which will look back at the lives and times of his parents and would also explore the great depression the murder of one of his uncles and even the infamous disappearance of tammany hall loyalist judge joseph crater which was back in the headlines recently in the end it s not surprising quinn would turn his historian s eye on his own family for all of the rich history and grand scope of his trans atlantic novels it was from his bronx parents that quinn learned a simple powerful

committee reviewed clinical data showing a booster dose of comirnaty elicits high neutralization titers against sars cov 2 and all currently tested variants reactogenicity profile within seven days of the booster dose was typically mild to moderate with frequency of reactions similar to or lower than after the primary vaccination series real world data presented by israel ministry of health show additional protection after receiving a booster translated to vaccine effectiveness comparable to levels seen early in the country s vaccine rollout fda expected to make its decision in the coming days new york mainz germany business wire pfizer inc nyse pfe and biontech se nasdaq bntx announced today that the u s food and drug administration s fda vaccines and related biological products advisory committee vrbpac voted unanimously to recommend the fda grant emergency use authorization eua for a booster dose of comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna in individuals 65 years of age and older and individuals at high risk of severe covid 19 the committee recommended that the additional dose be administered at least six months after the two dose series the panel also agreed that healthcare workers and others at high risk for occupational exposure should be included in this eua vrbpac is made up of independent experts who advise the fda on scientific and regulatory matters including the evaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy at this time vrbpac did not vote in favor of approval of a booster dose for the full population for which pfizer and biontech submitted their supplemental biologics license application which was individuals 16 and older the same data have recently been submitted to the european medicines agency ema and will be filed with other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks the companies remain vigilant and continue to generate relevant comirnaty booster dose data for evaluation for future licensure in further groups as well as to address emerging variants of concern the fda is expected to make its decision in the coming days this decision could allow comirnaty to be the first covid 19 vaccine with a booster authorized in the u s today the vrbpac reviewed data from our clinical program showing a favorable safety profile and strong immune responses against sars cov 2 after a booster dose of our vaccine these data and the larger body of scientific evidence presented at the meeting underscore our belief that boosters can be a critical tool in the ongoing effort to control the spread of this virus said kathrin u jansen ph d senior vice president and head of vaccine research development pfizer we thank the committee for their thoughtful review of the data and will work with the fda following today s meeting to address the committee s questions as we continue to believe in the benefits of a booster dose for a broader population we are committed to support the ongoing efforts to reduce infections and covid 19 cases the data we submitted to the fda ema and other regulatory authorities underline that a booster induces a strong immune response against all tested variants of concern and may contribute to address a public health need said özlem türeci m d co founder and chief medical officer of biontech vrbpac based its recommendation on the totality of scientific evidence shared by the companies including data from their clinical program evaluating the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of comirnaty a booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial sars cov 2 virus wild type as well as the beta and delta variants when compared with the levels observed after the two dose primary series the reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two the adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical safety data for comirnaty real world surveillance data also were presented to the vrbpac by the israel ministry of health providing further support for the public health impact of boosters the data presented from israel included an analysis published this week in the new england journal of medicine the analysis comprised approximately 1 1 million individuals ages 60 years and older who were eligible for a booster dose of the vaccine between july 30 through august 31 2021 no new safety signals were observed and reported adverse events were lower than those observed after dose two the analysis showed that a booster dose restored very high levels of protection against covid 19 infections and severe disease in this period when delta was the dominant strain individuals who received the booster dose were less likely by a factor of 11 3 95 ci 10 4 12 3 to develop a confirmed infection and less likely by a factor of 19 5 95 ci 12 9 29 5 to develop severe illness compared to those who were previously fully vaccinated but did not receive a booster dose the additional protection after receiving a booster translated to vaccine effectiveness comparable to levels seen early in the country s vaccine rollout an estimated 95 when the alpha variant was predominant under the eua of the pfizer biontech vaccine in the u s a third dose was previously authorized for individuals at least 12 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplant or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise this authorization of a third dose for immunocompromised individuals is separate and distinct from the booster dose reviewed by vrbpac today the third dose for immunocompromised individuals is meant to address the fact that these individuals sometimes do not build enough protection after two doses of the vaccine in contrast the booster dose recommended today by vrbpac for eua refers to an additional dose of the vaccine that is given to those who have built enough protection after the primary two dose vaccination series but may have decreased protection over time due to waning of immunity comirnaty which is based on biontech s proprietary mrna technology was developed by both biontech and pfizer biontech is the marketing authorization holder in the united states the european union the united kingdom canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the united states jointly with pfizer and other countries submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned u s indication authorized use comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna is an fda approved covid 19 vaccine made by pfizer for biontech it is approved as a 2 dose series for prevention of covid 19 in individuals 16 years of age and older it is also authorized under emergency use authorization eua to be administered for emergency use to prevent covid 19 in individuals 12 through 15 years and provide a third dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine has received eua from fda to prevent covid 19 in individuals 12 years of age and older and provide a third dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise the fda approved comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna and the eua authorized pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the covid 19 vaccination series an individual may be offered either comirnaty covid 19 vaccine mrna or the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 caused by sars cov 2 eua statement this emergency use of the product has not been approved or licensed by fda but has been authorized by fda under an emergency use authorization eua to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 for use in individuals 12 years of age and older and the emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that

from the luddites destroying woollen machines in 1800s to doctors or bankers today being disrupted by robots it is now clear that technological progress has a major impact on the wage distribution in an economy as firms heterogeneous in their capabilities continuously innovate and adopt new technologies the relative demand for different types of workers changes in the process the returns to these types of workers changes differentially such as for skilled and unskilled workers faia et al 2020 over the last few decades technological change has induced significantly higher wage and employment growth for skilled workers as compared to unskilled workers a phenomenon broadly referred to as skill biased technological change by researchers and this has spurred extensive discussions on its welfare consequences oecd 2011 undp 2013 ilo 2016 world bank 2016 for instance the proportion of routine low skilled labour in the us declined from 39 in 1968 to 23 6 to 1968 in 2013 while non routine skilled labour saw an increase from 24 4 to 33 6 eden and gaggl 2014 further evidence confirms these findings for several countries with different levels of technology e g srour et al 2013 marouani and nilsson 2016 gaggle and wright 2017 1 studies of this disproportionate demand for skilled relative to unskilled workers focus mainly on structural changes driven by an increasingly connected global economy and its interaction with innovation as also highlighted by oecd 2013 2014 public policies such as patent policies are one of the main elements to influence the relationships between technology and labour in both developed and developing countries academic work has also shown how globalisation trade and technological change have contributed to the rise of wage inequality both within firms across worker groups as well as across firms with some firms attaining superstar status by cornering a large share of the total worker compensation in the economy to better understand this process from the vantage point of firms as the predominant economic units that drive employment and determine the wage structure it is important to ask how incentives for technological change and innovation affect the compensation structure of a firm a major challenge in answering this question is to find an economic event i e a natural experiment that influences the incentives for innovation for firms without simultaneously being subject to the influence of the wage structure or organisational architecture our new paper bhattacharya et al 2021 takes up this exercise and investigates how a change in the indian intellectual property regime ipr brought about by landmark legislation the patents amendment act 2002 affected the wage share of managers vis à vis workers or non managers for a cross section of firms in the indian manufacturing sector to the best of our knowledge our work is the first to look at how a change in ipr affects wage inequality specifically we study how a large cross section of indian manufacturing firms responded to this act in terms of changes in compensation structure 2 prior to the act of 2002 india only recognised patents for new production processes and not new products which allowed for easy imitation of new products with mildly altered processes highlights of the act of 2002 were the introduction of product patents in all fields of technology an increase in the term of patents from 14 to 20 years limiting the scope of the government use of patented products and streamlining the process of patent grants the act also significantly broadened the scope for the implementation of the trips complying ipr regime that india was committed to adopting as a signatory to wto in 1995 by strengthening the protection of patent rights the act significantly increased firms incentives for innovation higher investments in innovation and or higher technology adoption by a firm can increase the relative demand for managers through at least two channels aghion et al 2020 first innovation involves a whole range of activities that are intensive in skilled workers or managerial talent research conceptualisation and development of new products branding and marketing the product and so on teece 1996 second technology adoption pushes existing processes closer to the technological frontier through use of more r d expenditure technology transfer import of capital goods and so on acemoglu et al 2006 if one conceptualises production as a sequence of problems and managers as problem solving experts garicano 2000 innovation presents a firm with more complex problems thereby raising the value of managers these reasons indicate that managerial effort and capital both technology and knowledge are complementary inputs in innovation therefore an across the board increase in incentives to innovate will not only lead to expansion in demand for managers relative to non managers within firm inequality such expansion will be larger in firms that have a larger stock of capital between firm inequality bloom et al 2021 in our study we employ prowess a comprehensive database of indian manufacturing firms which reports detailed labour compensation divided into managerial and non managerial components chakraborty and raveh 2018 details of technology such as r d investment and technology transfer as well as other firm characteristics on a panel basis the panel format of the data enables a dynamic specification in which technological investments and other firm decisions can potentially affect the demand for managers one of the main aims of our study is to establish a causal link between innovation incentives and compensation structure both within and between firms a benchmark hypothesis in our study is that the increase in wage inequality between managers and non managers as a response to the ipr shock is higher in the firms that were technologically advanced at the time of the shock we split the firms into two groups those above the median in technological investments in each industry pre 2002 the high tech firms and those below the median the low tech firms and compare the response to the ipr shock of these two groups of firms panel a of figure 1 plots the normalised technology adoption expenditure for the sample of indian firms for the period 1990 2006 the two groups show similar trends before 2002 but after 2002 we see opposite effects technology adoption expenditure doubles for high tech firms and drops for low tech firms panel b of figure 1 does the same for the normalised share of managerial compensation in total compensation the figure clearly shows that while there was not much difference between the two groups in the early 1990s but once india started to liberalise from the mid 1990s the difference started to grow it became significantly stark once stronger patent reforms were passed in 2002 this figure suggests a causal association between technology adoption innovation and demand for managers the regression results show that the change in manager s share of total compensation due to the reform is 1 3 to 8 3 higher in the high tech group of firms than the low tech group figure 1 innovation expenditure and managerial compensation high tech and low tech firms further in depth analysis shows that the response to ipr shock is strongest in the marginally high capital stock firms i e those in the 5th to 8th decile within the respective industries while the effect is insignificant in the below median firms and superstar firms this result that is reminiscent of a snail shape is consistent with the idea of wage dynamics and innovation effort being driven by competition for patents between firms within a given product group or industry figure 2 plots the coefficient estimates for each of the deciles 3 the figure shows the snail shape clearly no effect for below median and 9th decile firms and highest for marginally big firms the broader picture that emerges is that it is not only the firms within high tech industries but it is the marginally large firms within each industry that drives wage inequality between firms in the economy thus a strengthening of ipr and consequent technology adoption produces wage inequality virtually across the entire economy and not just within the high tech industries also within and across firms figure 2 2002 patent reform and managerial compensation snail shaped effect these results provide strong indications of the kind of changes developing economies can go through with increasing formalisation and integration with the global economy given that the trips provisions are soon to be implemented in the least developed countries one must recognize that wage polarisation throughout the economy is an important trade off associated with the structural transformation of these economies leveraging technology while our paper provides an early indication there should be more careful examination of the effects of technology adoption or innovation on wage inequality across nations such as brazil chile or china using employer employee datasets to bring in more systematic evidence on the welfare effects of

and the united states ct041 was granted an orphan drug designation by the fda in 2020 for the treatment of gastric cancer gastroesophageal junction gc gej cancer and was granted the orphan medicinal product designation by the ema for the treatment of gastric cancer in 2021 appealing data of cldn18 2 car t in advanced gastric cancer revealed at esmo this trial is a multicenter open label investigator initiated clinical trial in china for patients with cldn18 2 10 digestive system tumors this clinical trial consists of a dose escalation stage and a dose expansion stage the primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of ct041 and the secondary objective is to assess the efficacy and pharmacokinetics as of april 8 2021 37 patients received ct041 infusion and completed at least 12 weeks of evaluation including 28 cases of gastric gastroesophageal junction cancer gc gej 5 cases of pancreatic cancer pc and 4 cases of other types of digestive system tumors the cell dose levels were 2 5 108 3 75 108 and 5 0 108 car t cells respectively approximately 84 of patients had received at least 2 prior lines of therapies and the median number of metastatic organs was 3 for the 28 patients with gc gej 67 9 of the subjects had peritoneal metastases 42 9 and 35 7 of the subjects had been exposed to anti pd l 1 antibody and polykinase inhibitors respectively in terms of safety profile ct041 was generally well tolerated no treatment related death or immune cell therapy associated neurotoxicity syndrome icans were reported approximately 95 of patients experienced crs all being grade 1 or 2 for the 36 patients with target tumor lesions gc gej pc and other types of digestive system tumors 31 subjects had different degrees of shrinkage of target lesions with an orr of 48 6 and a disease control rate dcr of 73 0 18 gc gej patients who failed at least 2 prior lines of therapy including 8 44 of patients ever exposed to an anti pd l 1 antibody at the dose of 2 5 108 recommended phase 2 dose rp2d car t cells achieved an orr of 61 1 dcr of 83 3 median pfs of 5 6m median dor of 6 4m median os of 9 5m with a median follow up of 7 6m for the 28 gc gej patients subgroup analysis revealed that orr could be maintained at 50 and above in patients with different baseline characteristics historical data shows that for the gc gej patients who failed at least 2 prior lines of therapy the efficacy rate of chemotherapy is about 4 to 8 and the efficacy rate of anti pd 1 antibody is about 11 therefore compared with other treatments for gc gej patients who failed at least two prior lines of therapies ct041 has a significant improvement of orr since many patients in this phase of the trial had received anti pd l 1 antibody treatment the efficacy data disclosed indicate that ct041 may become a new treatment for advanced gc gej patients further data of this clinical trial is planned to be disclosed in academic journals or conferences in 2020 there were 480 000 new cases of gastric cancer in china accounting for 43 9 of the total incidence globally moreover there is a rising trend in the incidence of gastric cancer among young people major treatments for advanced gastric cancer are chemotherapy and her2 targeted therapy but the percentage of her2 positive patients in gastric cancer is only 7 20 despite several products such as pd 1 monoclonal antibodies that have been approved for advanced gastric cancer in recent years there are still significant needs for innovative therapies professor lin shen of beijing cancer hospital commented that gastric cancer is of high incidence globally and particularly in asia gastric cancer incidence in china is approximately 50 of the overall global incidence research and treatment options for gastric cancer are still quite limited and there are strong needs for more innovative therapies to change the treatment paradigm data presented at esmo showed significant efficacy and excellent tolerability of ct041 and we hope that it could benefit more cancer patients dr zonghai li co founder ceo cso chairman of the board of carsgen therapeutics commented that i would like to express the sincere gratitude to dr changsong qi for presenting the latest clinical trial data of ct041 in esmo 2021 and to all the other investigators and researchers involved in the

weekend locked in emergency talks mr kwarteng acknowledged it was a worrying time for customers but said he was confident supplies could be maintained he said consumers would be protected from sudden price hikes through the government s energy price cap however that puts pressure on the suppliers particularly smaller companies who are unable to pass on the increases in wholesale gas prices to their customers four firms have already folded and there are fears that more could follow some analysts have reportedly predicted that the uk s energy companies could be reduced to three quarters over the coming months leaving as few as 10 after meeting ofgem chief executive jonathan brearley on sunday mr kwarteng indicated that in the event of further failures he could appointment a special

essential to many production processes and warned there could be serious consequences for supplies within a matter of days on sunday mr kwarteng met with tony will the global chief executive of cf industries the uk s biggest supplier of co2 and the owner of the two fertiliser plants he said they had discussed the pressures the business was facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies including to our food and energy industries the rise in gas prices has been blamed on a number of factors including a cold winter which left stocks depleted high demand for liquefied natural gas from asia and a reduction in supplies from russia mr johnson however insisted that he remained confident energy supplies would be maintained gavin barwell has said the current situation around gas has the potential to become a crisis stefan rousseau pa i have no doubt that supply issues will be readily addressed we re very confident in our supply chains he said but in the meantime we will make sure we work with all the gas companies to do whatever we can to keep people s supplies coming to make sure they don t go out for business and to make sure we get through the current difficult period tory peer lord barwell who was theresa may s chief of staff warned the current situation could become a crisis speaking on bbc radio 4 s the westminster hour lord barwell said it definitely has the potential to become a crisis i think that the first concern of government will be about ensuring security of supply making sure that we re all still getting the gas that we need both domestic and businesses but the second concern will be about prices that consumers are being asked to pay more generally the government will also be worried about the cost of living we ve got the tax increases that they ve just brought in we ve got the universal credit reduction that s about to come online plus rising energy bills i think there is a real political danger here of cost of living issues becoming a real difficulty for the government
democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected today president biden will continue to drum up support for his 3 5 trillion human infrastructure plan the white house says he ll speak about how it will lower the cost of prescription drugs the president touted his build back better agenda yesterday hours after the senate passed a budget resolution kicking off the process for drafting and passing it in a party line vote we need to make this economy work better for working families in the long run these challenges are with us long before the pandemic and before i took office but as we recover from this crisis now is the moment to put in place the long term plan to build back america better president biden s plan includes universal pre k two years of free community college clean energy and transportation incentives investments in housing via hospitals and work force development it would also add dental vision and hearing benefits to the medicare program no republicans are expected to support the plan and it s unclear whether it will get the backing of all senate democrats which is necessary to pass democratic senators kirsten cinema and joe manchin don t support the current cost yesterday manchin said he has serious concerns about the grave consequences of spending that much money but president biden has argued this long term investment will be fully paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations he said it will enable middle and working class families to get ahead by lowering their cost of living and addressing factors that keep people out of the workforce if your primary concern right now is the cost of living you should support this plan not opposed it because the vote against this plan is a vote against lowering the cost of health care housing childcare elder care and prescription drugs for american families senate majority leader chuck schumer acknowledged the hardest work may be yet to come in order to get all 50 democrats to support expanding the social safety net he said committee chairs will meet with their members at least once a week during their month long recess schumer wants the bill drafted by september 15th we all need to be unified and everyone knows that so that doesn t mean people don t fight for their beliefs but at the end of the day we have to come together thus far we have is it going to be easy on reconciliation absolutely not but if past is prologue we got a chance it s good decent chance house speaker nancy pelosi faces a similar challenge since she can only afford to lose a handful of votes from her caucus the house is expected to return from its recess early on august 23 to vote on the budget resolution that the senate passed earlier this week advertisement democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected share copy link copy president joe biden and congressional democrats want to raise taxes on the rich to pay for their 3 5 trillion plan to expand the nation s safety net saying the wealthy should pay their fair share the rich would be hit in a variety of ways under the proposal advanced by the house ways means committee the house legislation calls for reversing a key plank of the republicans 2017 tax cuts by returning the top marginal income tax rate to 39 6 up from 37 that new top rate would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 a year and married couples filing jointly earning more than 450 000 annually that s lower than the roughly top 1 threshold that biden proposed earlier this year in his american families plan but the committee s plan also is in keeping with the president s pledge that he would not increase taxes on those earning less than 400 000 which is more than 90 of taxpayers all told the legislation would bring in an additional 1 trillion in revenue from high income americans according to the committee i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great biden said in an economic speech thursday all i m asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn t happening now here are three things to know about the very rich 1 it took 540 000 in adjusted gross income to get into the top 1 in 2018 according to the latest internal revenue service data that s the highest the threshold has been since at least 2001 the agency changed its methodology so prior data is not strictly comparable more than 1 4 million returns fell into this category in 2018 the dollar figure had climbed steadily at the start of the century before plunging in 2008 and 2009 during the great recession it began rising again as the economy and stock market improved the top 1 is not a static group however only 30 of taxpayers were in the cohort for five consecutive years between 1991 and 2009 on average according to 2013 research by treasury department office of tax analysis economists 2 the top 1 accounted for roughly 21 of total adjusted gross income in 2018 the figure has fluctuated with the business cycle since 2001 hitting a low of 16 the following year and nearly 23 in 2007 according to the irs most of their income comes from investments rather than labor their salary and wage income accounted for only around 11 of total salary and wage income in 2018 but for 67 of total capital gains income and for about 50 of total qualified dividend income said erica york economist with the right leaning tax foundation meanwhile the share of income reported by the bottom 50 of taxpayers was 11 6 in 2018 the tax policy center uses a much broader definition of income including student loan interest employer paid health insurance retirement plan contributions employers share of payroll taxes and income from cash transfers using the center s definition the top 1 accounted for 15 8 of income and paid 37 3 of federal individual income taxes in 2020 said robert mcclelland senior fellow at the tax policy center 3 the top 1 paid 615 7 billion in federal income taxes about 40 of the total in 2018 that s the highest percentage since 2001 when it was 33 2 according to the irs data the share bounced around a bit after that but has risen steadily since 2016 part of the reason the wealthy are paying a larger slice is because expansions of refundable tax credits and the near doubling of the standard deduction as part of the republicans tax cuts reduced the share paid by those lower on the income scale york said the percentage of federal income tax paid by the bottom half of taxpayers fell from 4 9 in 2001 to just below 3 in 2018 however just because the wealthy have been paying a larger share of taxes doesn t mean they are forking over more money to the federal government mcclelland said the amount the top 1 paid in taxes in 2017 was roughly the same in terms of dollars and their average tax rate was 26 8 that year versus 25 4 in 2018 by contrast the tax rate for the bottom 50 was 3 4 according to the irs looking over the longer term the tax rate of the rich has fallen sharply since world war ii it plummeted from about 40 in 1945 to about 25 in 2015 for the top 1 according to the tax policy center which used a different measure that includes untaxed capital gains but the rate across all taxpayers has remained relatively stable over that time here s how the democrats want to tax the rich the top marginal income tax rate would rise to 39 6 up from 37 and would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 and married couples earning more than 450 000 annually the top capital gains rate would increase to 25 from 20 for individuals earning more than 400 000 and couples making more than 450 000 that s lower than biden s proposal which would have raised it to the top marginal rate for wages and salaries of 39 6 for those earning more than 1 million annually in addition lawmakers would slap a 3 surcharge on individuals earning more than 5 million this means that their top marginal income tax rate would rise to 42 6 and it would push their capital gains rate to 28 before the 3 8 net investment income tax is factored in and that net investment income tax would be extended to cover business income included on taxpayers personal returns known as pass through income currently it is only levied on interest dividends capital gains and other forms of investment income the legislation would also end the higher estate tax exemption enacted under the republicans tax cuts this year instead of after 2025 the exemption would be 6 million per person in 2022 a sharp decline from this year s 11 7 million level the democrats are planning to push through the 3 5 trillion budget package via reconciliation so it would not need any republican support in the senate

third generation lobsterman nick prior was in eighth grade when he started working as a sternman on aquarius the lobster boat his grandfather built they still fish together out of bremen in midcoast maine but now nick who is in his last year of high school is at the helm while verge prior age 77 stuffs the bait bags and bands the claws of their catch between hauling traps verge quips that he plans to catch lobster until the end of his life some days i feel it s going to be tomorrow other days it seems longer his grandson wants to carry on the family tradition but thinks the future of lobstering is too uncertain to plan his life around there s no place i d rather be during summers fall and spring than on a lobster boat 17 year old prior says but he s also interested in history and hopes to play baseball in college long term i just don t see sustaining me you know to have the things i want and need in life prior is one of just over a thousand maine lobstermen who fish with student licenses while they re in high school or college and working toward a commercial license state data show their numbers are down about 10 from a peak four years ago after rising for almost a decade there s a lot of kids i know that go now that will not be doing it in even two three years prior says maine does not track how many lobstermen of any age are diversifying into other fisheries or the fast growing field of aquaculture even as those in the next generation face unprecedented uncertainty from forces within and outside the fishery for one the cost and effort of complying with evolving regulations aimed at protecting the lobster population and other species a new rule to protect whales means more costs for lobstermen claire harbage npr npr lobsters collected from ropeless fishing gear are seen on chris welch s lobster boat off the coast of kennebunkport maine in july the ropeless equipment is meant to protect north atlantic right whales from being caught in fishing gear the latest federal rule announced on aug 31 by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa is part of a plan to stop endangered north atlantic right whales from getting caught in fishing gear by 2030 the agency estimates that the population s decline has accelerated in recent years with 368 right whales remaining noaa has documented 34 right whale deaths since 2017 with at least nine of those mortalities confirmed to have been caused by entanglements in fishing gear including gear used by commercial gillnet or lobster and crab fisheries on the east coast noaa s new rule requires lobstermen to use gear with state specific markings that can be traced if a whale gets caught among other modifications such as weak points in fishing lines that allow entangled whales to break free the rule will also allow lobstermen to use so called ropeless gear a costly and controversial new technology that s still in the early stages of development in fishing areas that will be closed in certain seasons claire harbage npr npr patrice mccarron is the executive director of the maine lobstermen s association the group thinks the new regulations will impose a burden on the

putting too many barriers in that are really going to create winners and losers so it s scary mccarron says fishermen want to do their part to protect whales but she says no maine lobster gear has ever been confirmed to have caused the serious injury or death of a right whale a noaa spokesperson counters that its scientists are unable to determine the source of most entanglements and nearly half of mortalities go unobserved lobstermen are being encouraged to go ropeless claire harbage npr npr with ropeless technology orange markers rise to the surface of the water at the traps once they

more than a traditional lobster trap which is usually 80 180 instead of vertical fishing line that hangs between a buoy on the surface and a lobster trap below it stores rope on the ocean floor that s deployed on demand using gps and acoustic signals so far it is retrievable welch says but the challenge of the maine fishery is there s 5 000 lobstermen and we all fish amongst each other and attempt not to fish on top of each other with these units unless you re staring at your electronics all day or your ipad there s no way of knowing where the next guy is claire harbage npr npr chris welch tosses a lobster after pulling it from a ropeless lobster trap he s skeptical that the new ropeless technology will be practical for most lobstermen the 33 year old is against going ropeless and thinks the gear is a long way from being practical or affordable for most lobstermen i foresee it becoming a big boat fishery he says i think it s going to be challenging for new or younger guys or youth even to get into the industry because you re going to have to have such major money for start up costs federal fisheries managers hope more lobstermen will try ropeless gear and help improve it with provisions in the new rule designed to accelerate research and development they have a really successful way of fishing and we are challenging that with something that is unknown they call it star wars technology says biologist colleen coogan who leads a noaa team charged with reducing whale entanglements so far the measures they ve had to do not put them out of business and from our assessment of these measures it s not going to put them out of business either as long as the lobster stock remains strong as well claire harbage npr npr the view from chris welch s lobster boat foolish pride in the kennebunk river in southern maine there s more than enough lobster now but not forever the lobster population in the gulf of maine has spiked since the late 1980s according to

falling in the last few years to 96 million in 2020 according to the state s department of marine resources however research shows the gulf of maine is warming faster than most of the world s oceans

farm proposed for key fishing grounds which she sees as a more imminent threat to the industry s viability outside the abundance of lobster we have created a whole socioeconomic dependence even a

the judicial system has been a dilemma both symbolically and substantially for those citizens taking recourse of the law a high profile case gains priority publicity and importance while files of thousands of cases keep getting placed at the bottom for years and years when a plaintiff thanking the stars that the case would finally be heard on such and such date is soon discouraged because the legal community has called a strike for whichever and whatever reason back under the pile of file goes the plaintiff s case usually on each working day the business class section of the flights from karachi to islamabad are mostly occupied by top notch lawyers making a beeline at the highest court of the country ditto is the scene on the return flight returning home and this goes on as a matter of routine of course the client soon receives a fat bill for this unproductive activity usually all that the lawyer does is take a date for the next hearing another going round and round activity somehow there is a peculiar mentality in the various ministries try going to a ministry for a meeting with a grade 21 22 officer the stock answer is that the officer is in meeting with the prime minister or in the meeting of either the senate or the house standing committee try calling for an appointment say for two weeks hence same response the officer would be where else yes at one of the three places maybe it is time that there should be two federal secretaries for each ministry one to attend these meetings and one to run the ministry but till then it is another going round and round activity the representatives of corporations are über busy flying into and from islamabad to visit fbr and other ministries weeks before and weeks after the presentation of the federal budget there are many rent seekers among them hustling their way to ensure that their interests are not only protected but that more gravy comes their way at the same time leaders of the business community and office bearers of chambers and associations are in the same boat too they have been elected to espouse the cause of their members the annual ritual of preparing budgetary proposals and presenting these to relevant ministries is one of their prime responsibilities however they are now well aware that the bulky output painstakingly prepared by their organizations are seldom read by decision makers and that these presentations are neither filed nor studied but are disposed off into the proverbial dustbins there should be pity for the top business leaders who being involved in myriad activities of their trade organizations as well as running own business enterprises enjoying the publicity value of their activities having easy access into the corridors of power do feel that all this is too heavy a toll on their health family and business but they have to continue this going round and round activity fast track priority urgent can have different connotations for competent authorities political leaders have to create a climate that is easy for doing business and their obligation to the people the nation and the overall environment should occupy an equally high priority the culture of primordial decision making has aggravated the situation and it is high time someone at the top pushes through and gets implemented some reformatory sanity in the whole system it is generally obvious that most of the initiatives and policies are splendidly progressive and ready to speed on the highway but then something happens at the implementation stage and the racing car transforms into a tortoise crawling at its leisurely pace however for the citizens another round and round activity what is imperative now is the need for a true democratic dividend which abandons a past full of inequality and denial this is the only viable and lasting way instead of encouraging a false and deceitful optimism among the beleaguered denizens of the country a colonial mindset a charade of superiority a disdain attitude towards the people and blatant allegiance to personalities or dynasties do not make a progressive nation pakistan has to become a merit nation andrew sullivan the british american author and blogger stated if we don t change we don t grow and if we don t grow we don t learn and if we don t learn then we don t change do you see the cycle the round and round of the mulberry bush syndrome and this reminds all of the old nursery rhyme here we go round the mulberry bush the mulberry bush the mulberry bush here we go round the mulberry bush on a cold and

gkn automotive workers in birmingham are set to take all out continuous strike action from september 27 against the closure of the factory with the loss of 519 jobs the factory in chester road erdington gkn driveline produces drivelines for the uk operations of major auto companies jaguar land rover nissan and toyota the date for the strike was announced on september 13 by the unite union in its press release the union made clear that its aim had been to prevent strike action at all costs against melrose industries the venture capitalists and ftse 100 company which owns gkn automotive melrose gkn the release stated the union initially delayed issuing strike action and instead arranged a meeting with all interested parties to reach agreement on future production and support however melrose gkn refused to attend the meeting after initially accepting an invitation to do so as a consequence unite had no option but to initiate strike action steve turner unite assistant general secretary had already warned after the vote for strike action earlier this month it is now incumbent that everyone concerned with the future of gkn driveline come together to hammer out a future for the plant and the uk s supply of key components the alternative is a long drawn out dispute that will damage both gkn and the company s customer base as far as unite is concerned the profits of melrose must not be hit to apply pressure on behalf of workers to defend their livelihoods the reference to a long drawn out dispute is as a threat by unite against gkn workers and not the company it underlines the fact that they can expect no support to be mobilised by the union among its 100 000 members in the automotive sector during the pandemic unite and the trade unions have allowed sweeping redundancies with an estimated 10 000 jobs losses during 2020 across the car industry in the uk at gkn automotive unite has suppressed any independent action by workers in favour of winning endorsement for its alternative business plan from the conservative government and senior management it delayed a strike ballot for eight months after the announcement was made in january that the factory would close in 2022 ending more than half a century in production the depth of opposition unite has sat on was indicated in the august ballot which on september 1 returned 95 percent vote to strike on a 95 percent turnout newly elected unite general secretary sharon graham issued a statement combining moral hand wringing with the promotion of nationalism aimed at pitting gkn workers in birmingham against their co workers in europe gkn s cynical attempt to close its erdington plant is a disgrace we will not stand by and let this employer offshore british jobs without a fight we will leave no stone unturned in the ongoing battle to ensure the future of the birmingham factory and our members gkn will be one of the first major disputes under graham s leadership she has boasted that unite will be returned to doing what it says on the union tin and defend jobs pay and conditions her fraudulent boasts have been trumpeted by pseudo left groups such as the socialist party sp and socialist workers party swp which hailed graham as the workers candidate and have drawn a veil over the back room deals she cut to end major disputes against fire and rehire at british airways in 2020 and go north west buses in may of this year the false narrative of victories she claims to have secured through the removal of the ultimatum was predicated on unite signing up to inferior terms and conditions and ending strike action this is the content of the leverage strategy championed by graham leverage is based upon a repudiation of strike action in favour of public relations stunts directed towards winning favour with the political establishment and corporate heads it is about the union being welcomed into the boardrooms as full partners in imposing cost cutting while smothering widespread opposition the rescue plan advanced by unite over the closure of the birmingham factory is taken from this playbook it aims to assure melrose that its profit interests can be met through government hand outs to transition from the assembly of drivelines to the new propulsion units needed as car production switches from petrol and diesel to electrification by 2030 in addition the union will enforce high value operational savings based upon ensuring a highly adaptable workforce this corporate speak for job losses and speed ups is faithfully echoed by unite the combination of unite pledging greater competitiveness while lobbying the tory government and corporate heads was the same leverage campaign it launched in 2019 over the closure of the honda plant in swindon which closed for production in july this year with the loss of 3 500 jobs gkn automotive workers do not have to look any further than the fate of their colleagues at gkn aerospace in nearby kings norton whose site was announced for closure in 2019 with the loss of around 170 jobs unite prevented any mobilisation of workers against this and instead lobbied shareholders meetings to convince the board to reverse its decision since its 8 1 billion hostile takeover bid of gkn in 2018 melrose has been provided a free hand to fill its coffers and those of its wealthy investors in defence of their jobs gkn automotive workers do not need an alternative business plan aimed at bolstering the profits of melrose and pitting them against their co workers internationally gkn s global workforce of 27 500 employed in 51 manufacturing centres across 20 countries face the same enemy they should reject the economic nationalism of graham turner and the entire unite bureaucracy dividing workers across national lines only dictates a never ending race to the bottom an official silence has been maintained by unite over the fact that gkn automotive workers in florence italy are also faced with the same threat of closure in the same month of july that birmingham workers staged their protest workers at the camp bisenzio site downed tools and occupied the factory to defend the 422 jobs under threat no appeal has been made by unite to the workers in poland or france where the uk work is due to be transferred auto industry workers are fighting to defend their jobs and conditions all over the globe including volvo workers in the united states thousands of us workers employed by the auto parts conglomerate dana which has an axle producing facility employing hundreds of workers in birmingham a few miles from gkn s plant have just thrown out a union backed sweatshop company contract workers throughout gkn s global network in birmingham florence and every other production location must unify their struggles to take matters out of the hands of the union bureaucracy they must form rank and file committees that can organise gkn and automotive workers in britain italy and all over the world to take that fight forward the international committee of the fourth international has called for the formation of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc contact us today to discuss the way forward in this struggle
democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected today president biden will continue to drum up support for his 3 5 trillion human infrastructure plan the white house says he ll speak about how it will lower the cost of prescription drugs the president touted his build back better agenda yesterday hours after the senate passed a budget resolution kicking off the process for drafting and passing it in a party line vote we need to make this economy work better for working families in the long run these challenges are with us long before the pandemic and before i took office but as we recover from this crisis now is the moment to put in place the long term plan to build back america better president biden s plan includes universal pre k two years of free community college clean energy and transportation incentives investments in housing via hospitals and work force development it would also add dental vision and hearing benefits to the medicare program no republicans are expected to support the plan and it s unclear whether it will get the backing of all senate democrats which is necessary to pass democratic senators kirsten cinema and joe manchin don t support the current cost yesterday manchin said he has serious concerns about the grave consequences of spending that much money but president biden has argued this long term investment will be fully paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations he said it will enable middle and working class families to get ahead by lowering their cost of living and addressing factors that keep people out of the workforce if your primary concern right now is the cost of living you should support this plan not opposed it because the vote against this plan is a vote against lowering the cost of health care housing childcare elder care and prescription drugs for american families senate majority leader chuck schumer acknowledged the hardest work may be yet to come in order to get all 50 democrats to support expanding the social safety net he said committee chairs will meet with their members at least once a week during their month long recess schumer wants the bill drafted by september 15th we all need to be unified and everyone knows that so that doesn t mean people don t fight for their beliefs but at the end of the day we have to come together thus far we have is it going to be easy on reconciliation absolutely not but if past is prologue we got a chance it s good decent chance house speaker nancy pelosi faces a similar challenge since she can only afford to lose a handful of votes from her caucus the house is expected to return from its recess early on august 23 to vote on the budget resolution that the senate passed earlier this week advertisement democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected share copy link copy president joe biden and congressional democrats want to raise taxes on the rich to pay for their 3 5 trillion plan to expand the nation s safety net saying the wealthy should pay their fair share the rich would be hit in a variety of ways under the proposal advanced by the house ways means committee the house legislation calls for reversing a key plank of the republicans 2017 tax cuts by returning the top marginal income tax rate to 39 6 up from 37 that new top rate would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 a year and married couples filing jointly earning more than 450 000 annually that s lower than the roughly top 1 threshold that biden proposed earlier this year in his american families plan but the committee s plan also is in keeping with the president s pledge that he would not increase taxes on those earning less than 400 000 which is more than 90 of taxpayers all told the legislation would bring in an additional 1 trillion in revenue from high income americans according to the committee i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great biden said in an economic speech thursday all i m asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn t happening now here are three things to know about the very rich 1 it took 540 000 in adjusted gross income to get into the top 1 in 2018 according to the latest internal revenue service data that s the highest the threshold has been since at least 2001 the agency changed its methodology so prior data is not strictly comparable more than 1 4 million returns fell into this category in 2018 the dollar figure had climbed steadily at the start of the century before plunging in 2008 and 2009 during the great recession it began rising again as the economy and stock market improved the top 1 is not a static group however only 30 of taxpayers were in the cohort for five consecutive years between 1991 and 2009 on average according to 2013 research by treasury department office of tax analysis economists 2 the top 1 accounted for roughly 21 of total adjusted gross income in 2018 the figure has fluctuated with the business cycle since 2001 hitting a low of 16 the following year and nearly 23 in 2007 according to the irs most of their income comes from investments rather than labor their salary and wage income accounted for only around 11 of total salary and wage income in 2018 but for 67 of total capital gains income and for about 50 of total qualified dividend income said erica york economist with the right leaning tax foundation meanwhile the share of income reported by the bottom 50 of taxpayers was 11 6 in 2018 the tax policy center uses a much broader definition of income including student loan interest employer paid health insurance retirement plan contributions employers share of payroll taxes and income from cash transfers using the center s definition the top 1 accounted for 15 8 of income and paid 37 3 of federal individual income taxes in 2020 said robert mcclelland senior fellow at the tax policy center 3 the top 1 paid 615 7 billion in federal income taxes about 40 of the total in 2018 that s the highest percentage since 2001 when it was 33 2 according to the irs data the share bounced around a bit after that but has risen steadily since 2016 part of the reason the wealthy are paying a larger slice is because expansions of refundable tax credits and the near doubling of the standard deduction as part of the republicans tax cuts reduced the share paid by those lower on the income scale york said the percentage of federal income tax paid by the bottom half of taxpayers fell from 4 9 in 2001 to just below 3 in 2018 however just because the wealthy have been paying a larger share of taxes doesn t mean they are forking over more money to the federal government mcclelland said the amount the top 1 paid in taxes in 2017 was roughly the same in terms of dollars and their average tax rate was 26 8 that year versus 25 4 in 2018 by contrast the tax rate for the bottom 50 was 3 4 according to the irs looking over the longer term the tax rate of the rich has fallen sharply since world war ii it plummeted from about 40 in 1945 to about 25 in 2015 for the top 1 according to the tax policy center which used a different measure that includes untaxed capital gains but the rate across all taxpayers has remained relatively stable over that time here s how the democrats want to tax the rich the top marginal income tax rate would rise to 39 6 up from 37 and would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 and married couples earning more than 450 000 annually the top capital gains rate would increase to 25 from 20 for individuals earning more than 400 000 and couples making more than 450 000 that s lower than biden s proposal which would have raised it to the top marginal rate for wages and salaries of 39 6 for those earning more than 1 million annually in addition lawmakers would slap a 3 surcharge on individuals earning more than 5 million this means that their top marginal income tax rate would rise to 42 6 and it would push their capital gains rate to 28 before the 3 8 net investment income tax is factored in and that net investment income tax would be extended to cover business income included on taxpayers personal returns known as pass through income currently it is only levied on interest dividends capital gains and other forms of investment income the legislation would also end the higher estate tax exemption enacted under the republicans tax cuts this year instead of after 2025 the exemption would be 6 million per person in 2022 a sharp decline from this year s 11 7 million level the democrats are planning to push through the 3 5 trillion budget package via reconciliation so it would not need any republican support in the senate
third generation lobsterman nick prior was in eighth grade when he started working as a sternman on aquarius the lobster boat his grandfather built they still fish together out of bremen in midcoast maine but now nick who is in his last year of high school is at the helm while verge prior age 77 stuffs the bait bags and bands the claws of their catch between hauling traps verge quips that he plans to catch lobster until the end of his life some days i feel it s going to be tomorrow other days it seems longer his grandson wants to carry on the family tradition but thinks the future of lobstering is too uncertain to plan his life around there s no place i d rather be during summers fall and spring than on a lobster boat 17 year old prior says but he s also interested in history and hopes to play baseball in college long term i just don t see sustaining me you know to have the things i want and need in life prior is one of just over a thousand maine lobstermen who fish with student licenses while they re in high school or college and working toward a commercial license state data show their numbers are down about 10 from a peak four years ago after rising for almost a decade there s a lot of kids i know that go now that will not be doing it in even two three years prior says maine does not track how many lobstermen of any age are diversifying into other fisheries or the fast growing field of aquaculture even as those in the next generation face unprecedented uncertainty from forces within and outside the fishery for one the cost and effort of complying with evolving regulations aimed at protecting the lobster population and other species a new rule to protect whales means more costs for lobstermen claire harbage npr npr lobsters collected from ropeless fishing gear are seen on chris welch s lobster boat off the coast of kennebunkport maine in july the ropeless equipment is meant to protect north atlantic right whales from being caught in fishing gear the latest federal rule announced on aug 31 by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa is part of a plan to stop endangered north atlantic right whales from getting caught in fishing gear by 2030 the agency estimates that the population s decline has accelerated in recent years with 368 right whales remaining noaa has documented 34 right whale deaths since 2017 with at least nine of those mortalities confirmed to have been caused by entanglements in fishing gear including gear used by commercial gillnet or lobster and crab fisheries on the east coast noaa s new rule requires lobstermen to use gear with state specific markings that can be traced if a whale gets caught among other modifications such as weak points in fishing lines that allow entangled whales to break free the rule will also allow lobstermen to use so called ropeless gear a costly and controversial new technology that s still in the early stages of development in fishing areas that will be closed in certain seasons claire harbage npr npr patrice mccarron is the executive director of the maine lobstermen s association the group thinks the new regulations will impose a burden on the region s lobstermen the beauty of the lobster industry is that there s been a place for everybody says patrice mccarron executive director of the maine lobstermen s association we re at risk of putting too many barriers in that are really going to create winners and losers so it s scary mccarron says fishermen want to do their part to protect whales but she says no maine lobster gear has ever been confirmed to have caused the serious injury or death of a right whale a noaa spokesperson counters that its scientists are unable to determine the source of most entanglements and nearly half of mortalities go unobserved lobstermen are being encouraged to go ropeless claire harbage npr npr with ropeless technology orange markers rise to the surface of the water at the traps once they are triggered remotely on a boat near kennebunkport maine in late july lobsterman chris welch demonstrated new ropeless gear made by a massachusetts company it costs about 4 000 per trap several times more than a traditional lobster trap which is usually 80 180 instead of vertical fishing line that hangs between a buoy on the surface and a lobster trap below it stores rope on the ocean floor that s deployed on demand using gps and acoustic signals so far it is retrievable welch says but the challenge of the maine fishery is there s 5 000 lobstermen and we all fish amongst each other and attempt not to fish on top of each other with these units unless you re staring at your electronics all day or your ipad there s no way of knowing where the next guy is claire harbage npr npr chris welch tosses a lobster after pulling it from a ropeless lobster trap he s skeptical that the new ropeless technology will be practical for most lobstermen the 33 year old is against going ropeless and thinks the gear is a long way from being practical or affordable for most lobstermen i foresee it becoming a big boat fishery he says i think it s going to be challenging for new or younger guys or youth even to get into the industry because you re going to have to have such major money for start up costs federal fisheries managers hope more lobstermen will try ropeless gear and help improve it with provisions in the new rule designed to accelerate research and development they have a really successful way of fishing and we are challenging that with something that is unknown they call it star wars technology says biologist colleen coogan who leads a noaa team charged with reducing whale entanglements so far the measures they ve had to do not put them out of business and from our assessment of these measures it s not going to put them out of business either as long as the lobster stock remains strong as well claire harbage npr npr the view from chris welch s lobster boat foolish pride in the kennebunk river in southern maine there s more than enough lobster now but not forever the lobster population in the gulf of maine has spiked since the late 1980s according to stock assessments by interstate regulators the amount of lobster caught and sold in maine per year has also been on an overall upward trend since then reaching 132 million pounds in 2016 before falling in the last few years to 96 million in 2020 according to the state s department of marine resources however research shows the gulf of maine is warming faster than most of the world s oceans and its lobster population will eventually decline shannon mullen for npr shannon mullen for npr carla guenther chief scientist at the maine center for coastal fisheries in her office overlooking the harbor in stonington she s part of a research team studying the resilience of maine s lobster industry and the communities that depend on it where we are is probably not a natural or perpetual state of things says carla guenther chief scientist for the nonprofit maine center for coastal fisheries guenther points to other still emerging changes facing the industry such as a floating offshore wind farm proposed for key fishing grounds which she sees as a more imminent threat to the industry s viability outside the abundance of lobster we have created a whole socioeconomic dependence even a political framework around the existence of lobster and how much it means and how much it brings to these communities she says guenther is part of a research team at the university of maine that s working to measure resilience in the fishery and the communities that depend on it one study from a maine nonprofit found that maine s lobster industry contributes 1 billion to the state s economy each year and supports some 6 000 jobs on the water and 4 000 on land research on the industry s vulnerability to change is scarce particularly of young lobstermen as they reckon with changes that

democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected today president biden will continue to drum up support for his 3 5 trillion human infrastructure plan the white house says he ll speak about how it will lower the cost of prescription drugs the president touted his build back better agenda yesterday hours after the senate passed a budget resolution kicking off the process for drafting and passing it in a party line vote we need to make this economy work better for working families in the long run these challenges are with us long before the pandemic and before i took office but as we recover from this crisis now is the moment to put in place the long term plan to build back america better president biden s plan includes universal pre k two years of free community college clean energy and transportation incentives investments in housing via hospitals and work force development it would also add dental vision and hearing benefits to the medicare program no republicans are expected to support the plan and it s unclear whether it will get the backing of all senate democrats which is necessary to pass democratic senators kirsten cinema and joe manchin don t support the current cost yesterday manchin said he has serious concerns about the grave consequences of spending that much money but president biden has argued this long term investment will be fully paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations he said it will enable middle and working class families to get ahead by lowering their cost of living and addressing factors that keep people out of the workforce if your primary concern right now is the cost of living you should support this plan not opposed it because the vote against this plan is a vote against lowering the cost of health care housing childcare elder care and prescription drugs for american families senate majority leader chuck schumer acknowledged the hardest work may be yet to come in order to get all 50 democrats to support expanding the social safety net he said committee chairs will meet with their members at least once a week during their month long recess schumer wants the bill drafted by september 15th we all need to be unified and everyone knows that so that doesn t mean people don t fight for their beliefs but at the end of the day we have to come together thus far we have is it going to be easy on reconciliation absolutely not but if past is prologue we got a chance it s good decent chance house speaker nancy pelosi faces a similar challenge since she can only afford to lose a handful of votes from her caucus the house is expected to return from its recess early on august 23 to vote on the budget resolution that the senate passed earlier this week advertisement democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected share copy link copy president joe biden and congressional democrats want to raise taxes on the rich to pay for their 3 5 trillion plan to expand the nation s safety net saying the wealthy should pay their fair share the rich would be hit in a variety of ways under the proposal advanced by the house ways means committee the house legislation calls for reversing a key plank of the republicans 2017 tax cuts by returning the top marginal income tax rate to 39 6 up from 37 that new top rate would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 a year and married couples filing jointly earning more than 450 000 annually that s lower than the roughly top 1 threshold that biden proposed earlier this year in his american families plan but the committee s plan also is in keeping with the president s pledge that he would not increase taxes on those earning less than 400 000 which is more than 90 of taxpayers all told the legislation would bring in an additional 1 trillion in revenue from high income americans according to the committee i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great biden said in an economic speech thursday all i m asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn t happening now here are three things to know about the very rich 1 it took 540 000 in adjusted gross income to get into the top 1 in 2018 according to the latest internal revenue service data that s the highest the threshold has been since at least 2001 the agency changed its methodology so prior data is not strictly comparable more than 1 4 million returns fell into this category in 2018 the dollar figure had climbed steadily at the start of the century before plunging in 2008 and 2009 during the great recession it began rising again as the economy and stock market improved the top 1 is not a static group however only 30 of taxpayers were in the cohort for five consecutive years between 1991 and 2009 on average according to 2013 research by treasury department office of tax analysis economists 2 the top 1 accounted for roughly 21 of total adjusted gross income in 2018 the figure has fluctuated with the business cycle since 2001 hitting a low of 16 the following year and nearly 23 in 2007 according to the irs most of their income comes from investments rather than labor their salary and wage income accounted for only around 11 of total salary and wage income in 2018 but for 67 of total capital gains income and for about 50 of total qualified dividend income said erica york economist with the right leaning tax foundation meanwhile the share of income reported by the bottom 50 of taxpayers was 11 6 in 2018 the tax policy center uses a much broader definition of income including student loan interest employer paid health insurance retirement plan contributions employers share of payroll taxes and income from cash transfers using the center s definition the top 1 accounted for 15 8 of income and paid 37 3 of federal individual income taxes in 2020 said robert mcclelland senior fellow at the tax policy center 3 the top 1 paid 615 7 billion in federal income taxes about 40 of the total in 2018 that s the highest percentage since 2001 when it was 33 2 according to the irs data the share bounced around a bit after that but has risen steadily since 2016 part of the reason the wealthy are paying a larger slice is because expansions of refundable tax credits and the near doubling of the standard deduction as part of the republicans tax cuts reduced the share paid by those lower on the income scale york said the percentage of federal income tax paid by the bottom half of taxpayers fell from 4 9 in 2001 to just below 3 in 2018 however just because the wealthy have been paying a larger share of taxes doesn t mean they are forking over more money to the federal government mcclelland said the amount the top 1 paid in taxes in 2017 was roughly the same in terms of dollars and their average tax rate was 26 8 that year versus 25 4 in 2018 by contrast the tax rate for the bottom 50 was 3 4 according to the irs looking over the longer term the tax rate of the rich has fallen sharply since world war ii it plummeted from about 40 in 1945 to about 25 in 2015 for the top 1 according to the tax policy center which used a different measure that includes untaxed capital gains but the rate across all taxpayers has remained relatively stable over that time here s how the democrats want to tax the rich the top marginal income tax rate would rise to 39 6 up from 37 and would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 and married couples earning more than 450 000 annually the top capital gains rate would increase to 25 from 20 for individuals earning more than 400 000 and couples making more than 450 000 that s lower than biden s proposal which would have raised it to the top marginal rate for wages and salaries of 39 6 for those earning more than 1 million annually in addition lawmakers would slap a 3 surcharge on individuals earning more than 5 million this means that their top marginal income tax rate would rise to 42 6 and it would push their capital gains rate to 28 before the 3 8 net investment income tax is factored in and that net investment income tax would be extended to cover business income included on taxpayers personal returns known as pass through income currently it is only levied on interest dividends capital gains and other forms of investment income the legislation would also end the higher estate tax exemption enacted under the republicans tax cuts this year instead of after 2025 the exemption would be 6 million per person in 2022 a sharp decline from this year s 11 7 million level the democrats are planning to push through the 3 5 trillion budget package

new york ny yolanda lópez an artist and activist who created one of the most famous artworks in chicano history by boldly recasting the virgin of guadalupe in her own image as a young strong brown woman wearing running shoes and a wide grin died sept 3 at her home in san francisco she was 78 the cause was complications of liver cancer said her son rio yañez also an artist lópez made other types

appeared over the years in art books feminist histories and chicano anthologies it has shown up on t shirts and tattoos and along with similar work by patssi valdez and ester hernández it inspired younger generations of latina artists to rethink the roman catholic icon a vision of the virgin mary popular with mexicans and mexican americans in essence lópez took guadalupe the paragon of demure

place and she looks joyful jill dawsey who curated an exhibition of lópez s work scheduled to open in october at the museum of contemporary art san diego her first museum survey called it a striking revision of guadalupe divested of her colonialist and patriarchal origins and transformed into an image of radical feminist optimism it was radical enough that lópez periodically received death threats few realize just how many versions of the virgin of guadalupe she created including at least 20 collages and photomontages done as studies her finished image of the running virgin was part of a larger triptych that celebrates working class chicanas of different ages and body types and the idea of matriarchy itself one image has her heavyset mother mending the virgin s mantle at a sewing table another has her grandmother seated on top of the piled fabric as if it s a throne casually holding a knife and a snakeskin a dedicated feminist and activist in the chicano movement lópez also

democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected today president biden will continue to drum up support for his 3 5 trillion human infrastructure plan the white house says he ll speak about how it will lower the cost of prescription drugs the president touted his build back better agenda yesterday hours after the senate passed a budget resolution kicking off the process for drafting and passing it in a party line vote we need to make this economy work better for working families in the long run these challenges are with us long before the pandemic and before i took office but as we recover from this crisis now is the moment to put in place the long term plan to build back america better president biden s plan includes universal pre k two years of free community college clean energy and transportation incentives investments in housing via hospitals and work force development it would also add dental vision and hearing benefits to the medicare program no republicans are expected to support the plan and it s unclear whether it will get the backing of all senate democrats which is necessary to pass democratic senators kirsten cinema and joe manchin don t support the current cost yesterday manchin said he has serious concerns about the grave consequences of spending that much money but president biden has argued this long term investment will be fully paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations he said it will enable middle and working class families to get ahead by lowering their cost of living and addressing factors that keep people out of the workforce if your primary concern right now is the cost of living you should support this plan not opposed it because the vote against this plan is a vote against lowering the cost of health care housing childcare elder care and prescription drugs for american families senate majority leader chuck schumer acknowledged the hardest work may be yet to come in order to get all 50 democrats to support expanding the social safety net he said committee chairs will meet with their members at least once a week during their month long recess schumer wants the bill drafted by september 15th we all need to be unified and everyone knows that so that doesn t mean people don t fight for their beliefs but at the end of the day we have to come together thus far we have is it going to be easy on reconciliation absolutely not but if past is prologue we got a chance it s good decent chance house speaker nancy pelosi faces a similar challenge since she can only afford to lose a handful of votes from her caucus the house is expected to return from its recess early on august 23 to vote on the budget resolution that the senate passed earlier this week advertisement democrats in washington want to raise taxes on the rich here s who would be affected share copy link copy president joe biden and congressional democrats want to raise taxes on the rich to pay for their 3 5 trillion plan to expand the nation s safety net saying the wealthy should pay their fair share the rich would be hit in a variety of ways under the proposal advanced by the house ways means committee the house legislation calls for reversing a key plank of the republicans 2017 tax cuts by returning the top marginal income tax rate to 39 6 up from 37 that new top rate would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 a year and married couples filing jointly earning more than 450 000 annually that s lower than the roughly top 1 threshold that biden proposed earlier this year in his american families plan but the committee s plan also is in keeping with the president s pledge that he would not increase taxes on those earning less than 400 000 which is more than 90 of taxpayers all told the legislation would bring in an additional 1 trillion in revenue from high income americans according to the committee i m not out to punish anyone i m a capitalist if you can make a million or a billion dollars that s great biden said in an economic speech thursday all i m asking is you pay your fair share pay your fair share just like middle class folks do but that isn t happening now here are three things to know about the very rich 1 it took 540 000 in adjusted gross income to get into the top 1 in 2018 according to the latest internal revenue service data that s the highest the threshold has been since at least 2001 the agency changed its methodology so prior data is not strictly comparable more than 1 4 million returns fell into this category in 2018 the dollar figure had climbed steadily at the start of the century before plunging in 2008 and 2009 during the great recession it began rising again as the economy and stock market improved the top 1 is not a static group however only 30 of taxpayers were in the cohort for five consecutive years between 1991 and 2009 on average according to 2013 research by treasury department office of tax analysis economists 2 the top 1 accounted for roughly 21 of total adjusted gross income in 2018 the figure has fluctuated with the business cycle since 2001 hitting a low of 16 the following year and nearly 23 in 2007 according to the irs most of their income comes from investments rather than labor their salary and wage income accounted for only around 11 of total salary and wage income in 2018 but for 67 of total capital gains income and for about 50 of total qualified dividend income said erica york economist with the right leaning tax foundation meanwhile the share of income reported by the bottom 50 of taxpayers was 11 6 in 2018 the tax policy center uses a much broader definition of income including student loan interest employer paid health insurance retirement plan contributions employers share of payroll taxes and income from cash transfers using the center s definition the top 1 accounted for 15 8 of income and paid 37 3 of federal individual income taxes in 2020 said robert mcclelland senior fellow at the tax policy center 3 the top 1 paid 615 7 billion in federal income taxes about 40 of the total in 2018 that s the highest percentage since 2001 when it was 33 2 according to the irs data the share bounced around a bit after that but has risen steadily since 2016 part of the reason the wealthy are paying a larger slice is because expansions of refundable tax credits and the near doubling of the standard deduction as part of the republicans tax cuts reduced the share paid by those lower on the income scale york said the percentage of federal income tax paid by the bottom half of taxpayers fell from 4 9 in 2001 to just below 3 in 2018 however just because the wealthy have been paying a larger share of taxes doesn t mean they are forking over more money to the federal government mcclelland said the amount the top 1 paid in taxes in 2017 was roughly the same in terms of dollars and their average tax rate was 26 8 that year versus 25 4 in 2018 by contrast the tax rate for the bottom 50 was 3 4 according to the irs looking over the longer term the tax rate of the rich has fallen sharply since world war ii it plummeted from about 40 in 1945 to about 25 in 2015 for the top 1 according to the tax policy center which used a different measure that includes untaxed capital gains but the rate across all taxpayers has remained relatively stable over that time here s how the democrats want to tax the rich the top marginal income tax rate would rise to 39 6 up from 37 and would apply to single filers with taxable income greater than 400 000 and married couples earning more than 450 000 annually the top capital gains rate would increase to 25 from 20 for individuals earning more than 400 000 and couples making more than 450 000 that s lower than biden s proposal which would have raised it to the top marginal rate for wages and salaries of 39 6 for those earning more than 1 million annually in addition lawmakers would slap a 3 surcharge on individuals earning more than 5 million this means that their top marginal income tax rate would rise to 42 6 and it would push their capital gains rate to 28 before the 3 8 net investment income tax is factored in and that net investment income tax would be extended to cover business income included on taxpayers personal returns known as pass through income currently it is only levied on interest dividends capital gains and other forms of investment income the legislation would also end the higher estate tax exemption enacted under the republicans tax cuts this year instead of after 2025 the exemption would be 6 million per person in 2022 a sharp decline from this year s 11 7 million level the democrats are planning to push through the 3 5 trillion budget package via reconciliation so it would not need any republican support in the senate

global shares mostly fell over the last week on growth concerns us shares fell 0 6 not helped by the usual volatility associated with the expiry of option and futures contracts on friday eurozone shares lost 0 9 and chinese shares fell 3 1 with concerns about the evergrande group also weighing japanese shares managed a 0 4 gain australian shares fell but only by 0 04 with solid gains in energy and property shares offset by sharp falls in mining stocks on the back of the plunge in iron ore prices bond yields rose as did oil prices rose but metal and iron ore prices fell the a fell as the us rose shares remain at risk of a short term correction as noted last week september has on average been the weakest month of the year for us and australian shares over the last 35 years the us share market has fallen 5 of the last 10 septembers and the australian share market has fallen 7 of the last 10 septembers so far the direction setting us share market has found support at its 50 day moving average but key risks relate to coronavirus central banks slowing stimulus the need to raise the us debt ceiling the passage of biden s remaining stimulus and tax hikes global supply constraints and inflation and the slowing chinese economy with credit risks around evergrande group these could all result in further weakness in share markets in the near term however we would see this as just a correction as the likely continuation of the economic recovery beyond near term interruptions vaccines ultimately allowing a more sustained reopening and tight monetary policy being a long way off augurs well for shares over the next 12 months how worried should australia be about the 50 plunge in iron ore prices australia s largest export basically alert but not alarmed since july the iron ore price has more than halved reflecting chinese constraints on steel production the slowdown in its economy and recent concerns about the flow on to construction related demand from property developer china evergrande group s problems but bear in mind that the iron ore price has fallen from levels no one ever thought it would get to and is still very high and well above cost this will dent australia s national income and current account surplus and add a new blow out in the federal budget deficit which along with lockdown support payments may end up closer to 150bn this year than the 107bn in the may budget but against this most other commodity prices are surging including coal gas our 2nd and 4th largest exports aluminium and copper with most commodity price indexes near past mining boom levels in fact there is good reason to believe a new commodity super cycle ex iron ore has begun which should benefit australia the difficulties at evergrande are worth watching more broadly though as at about 6 5 of total chinese property sector debt and 10 of its high yield offshore market its collapse and liquidation could have a systemic impact like that of lehman brothers in 2008 in terms of a flow on to the chinese property and financial sectors and its economy for this reason a government directed restructuring is more likely but there could be a few big bumps along the way coronavirus update i gave coronavirus its own section so hopefully one day i can get rid of it the good news is that new global coronavirus cases are continuing to decline again for those into

europe looks to have a least stabilised and the us looks to have rolled over as the surge in the lowly vaccinated south slows china has seen some more clusters in fujian but numbers are low

hospitalisations and deaths likely helped by booster shots source ourworldindata org amp capital 44 of people globally and 69 in developed countries have now had at least one dose of vaccine source ourworldindata org amp capital the main issues of concern are the very low coverage in poor countries that 35 or so in developed countries are still unvaccinated posing risks coming into the northern winter the vaccines provide only around 60 80 protection against infection indications of declining vaccine efficacy against infection after six months particularly for pfizer and maybe moderna requiring booster shots and the risk of mutations resulting in eg a more deadly version of delta this all suggests it will be a long hard slog to fully get control of coronavirus and the more that are vaccinated the better ideally rich countries should be paying to vaccinate poor countries as it s in their own interest to do so in order to head off mutations coming back into the rich world against all this though the vaccines are providing a way out in terms of heading off serious illness booster shots are on the way in many countries and providing reopening is sensible we should be able to avoid a return to hard broad based lockdowns better news in australia while victoria is continuing to see a rising trend in new cases the act looks to have stabilised and nsw is looking like it may have peaked helped by rising vaccinations and the lockdown nsw s estimated effective reproduction rate has also fallen below 1 which if sustained points to a decline in new cases source covid19data com au amp capital 56 of australia s whole population has now had at least one vaccine dose the past week saw the pace of vaccination pick up to 1 89 million people a week and with supply picking up its likely to remain high as vaccine mandates provide a powerful incentive to get vaccinated or otherwise stay at home the next chart shows a projection of when nsw victoria and australia will meet vaccination targets for one dose based on an extrapolation of the average daily vaccination rates seen in the last 7 days note that for first doses for those aged 16 and over nsw is through 80 victoria through 70 and australian on average through 70 source covid19data com au amp capital on the basis of this projection the following table shows roughly when key double dose vaccination target dates will be met based on the current lag between 1st and 2nd doses nsw will hit the 70 of adults target around 7th october victoria around 4th november although i think it will speed up from here and australia on average around 27th october at the current rate nsw could hit 90 of adults with a single dose by 3rd october with 2 doses 35 days later given the risks with delta this is closer to what we should be aiming for current gap in days between 1st and 2nd doses source amp capital so nsw is on track to start reopening by the second week of october victoria in early november and the act not shown in late october ideally this should remain gradual initially until higher vaccination rates are met in order to avoid problems in the hospital system and hence setbacks meanwhile the vaccination of older people appears to be continuing to help keep the level of hospitalisations and deaths more subdued in this wave deaths the red line in the next chart are running around one quarter of the level predicted on the basis of the previous wave dashed line source ourworldindata org covid19data com au amp capital other key developments our us and european economic activity trackers have held up despite recent delta outbreaks with our european tracker well above pre coronavirus levels based on weekly data for eg job ads restaurant bookings confidence mobility credit debt card transactions retail foot traffic hotel bookings source amp capital while our australian economic activity tracker is well down from its june high it edged up again over the last week with nsw and victoria about as low as they are going to go australian economic activity has probably bottomed with reopening on track to drive the start of a recovery next quarter source amp capital rba governor lowe upbeat but pushes back against market expectations for the start of rate hikes next year and has no plans to raise rates to cool the housing market none of this is surprising or even new with the delta setback to the level of economic activity its hard to see full employment being reached next year which means that the 3 plus wages growth necessary for sustained 2 to 3 inflation and hence rate hikes is likely still a few years away and the rba has to set interest rates for the average of the economy not just the housing sector which is why last decade in the absence of being able to raise rates it used macro prudential controls to slow the property market we think it should be doing the same again and i tend to agree with governor lowe that if we want to address issues around poor housing affordability and we should be the way to go is through structural policies my shopping list on this front includes removing the capital gains tax discount speeding up constraints on land supply replacing stamp duty with land tax or gst and most importantly enabling more decentralised living sure low rates have enabled people to borrow more and hence pay more for housing but lots of countries have low or even lower mortgage rates but far more affordable housing should the rba be reviewed calls for a review of the rba seem to come from two perspectives that rates have been too high and hence the rba has undershot its inflation and full employment objectives or that rates are too low which has caused unaffordable housing these are contradictory on the former i would have agreed two or three years ago but it has now changed its approach to be more focussed on achieving full employment and actual inflation sustained at target so it s fixed itself and on housing the real issues are structural as pointed out in the last paragraph meanwhile there is no case to change the full employment objective the 2 3 inflation objective is about right and adding more objectives will just make them unachievable given the limited levers the rba has and it communicates its views so much that to do more will just add to the noise and national obsession with interest rates in australia that said one area arguably could be improved to put more monetary policy experts on the rba board more people from a social perspective and maybe less business people and no i am not looking for a position on the board america a few years back i went to see the beach boys again this was around the ltcm crisis and i needed good vibrations and they were also performing with america who i didn t really know much about apart from an 80s hit called you can do magic but these guys just wheeled out one fantastic song after another sister golden hair and i need you are my favourites the latter is such a classic that even andy williams cut a version that s up there with the original
