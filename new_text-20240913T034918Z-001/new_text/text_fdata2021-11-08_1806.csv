aluminium prices touched their lowest in more than three months on friday as rising coal output in china eased concerns over aluminium supply from smelters powered by the fossil fuel daily coal output in china the world s largest producer of aluminium was close to a record at 11 2 million tonnes on nov 3 helped by measures to ramp up production china is aiming to rein in surging coal prices caused by supply shortages energy prices account for about 40 of the cost to produce aluminium aluminium prices in the short are likely to be dictated by production costs and supply side policies around power rationing said london based brokerage marex benchmark three month aluminium on the london metal exchange lme fell as low as 2 510 a tonne its weakest since july by 1150 gmt prices were steady at 2 554 prices for the light metal used in automobiles and beverage cans are down about 20 since reaching a 13 year high in mid october the ongoing fall in coal prices in china amid stronger supply is likely to lower the risk of power shortages not only are the risks of disruptions lower costs of smelting the metal have also declined significantly anz analysts wrote inventories on warrant stocks of aluminium in lme registered warehouses are near 2019 lows at 621 850 tonnes malstx total aluminium stocks in warehouses monitored by the shanghai futures exchange rose 6 8 from last friday to 307 005 tonnes al stx sgh russia exports expectations that russia will remove taxes on aluminium exports and boost global supplies have triggered an inventory sell off reducing prices in the physical market in europe and the united states other metals lme copper shed 0 1 to 9 430 a tonne zinc lost 2 3 to 3 166 lead rose 0 8 to 2 366 tin cmsn3 was up 0 3 at 36 615 and nickel cmni3 gained 0 7 to 19 270 source reuters reporting by zandi shabalala editing by david goodman
toronto nov 7 2021 prnewswire first cobalt corp tsxv fcc otcqx ftssf the company today announced that it is expanding its strategic plan to provide battery grade nickel and cobalt recycled battery materials and precursor material to the north american supply chain the new business model would result in the creation of the only battery materials park on the continent providing north american automakers with direct access to a secure domestic source of low carbon raw materials to better reflect the company s vision first cobalt corp will change its name to electra battery materials corporation electra the name change which remains subject to shareholder approval better reflects the strategic positioning and more clearly communicates the company s long term value proposition for customers investors and other stakeholders electra battery materials is currently expanding a permitted hydrometallurgical refinery north of toronto to produce 5 000 tonnes of cobalt starting in q4 2022 the company has also been testing black mass feeds from recycled batteries and will be announcing results from test work and engineering studies in the coming weeks global consultancy firm cru has been retained to complete a nickel market study which will assess market conditions for a battery grade nickel sulfate plant in north america results from this study will support ongoing discussions with potential providers of nickel feed material as well as engineering studies for a future low carbon nickel plant capitalizing on an existing hydrometallurgical plant hydroelectric power and seasoned construction and processing teams development of similar integrated battery material complexes in europe and asia have resulted in the construction of precursor cathode active material pcam plants co located adjacent to integrated refining facilities as operational efficiencies can significantly lower the cost of battery cells highlights globalization has created an electric vehicle supply chain that is too long too costly and increasingly unreliable said trent mell president ceo our automaker clients have a strong interest in greater localization of the upstream supply chain to achieve greater reliability security of long term supply and a lower carbon footprint with the continent s rich mineral endowment the rationale for supplying battery materials through asia into a growing u s ev market is not sustainable electra will act as a bridge between north american electric vehicles and a north american source of primary and recycled material providing a low carbon solution for zero emission vehicles we see serious strains in the automotive supply chain and we are still in the early innings of ev adoption beneath the surface are several other factors that are of concern including carbon emissions associated with the current supply chain resource nationalism geopolitics and a race to secure raw material to power the vehicles of tomorrow electra s refinery is 100 powered by clean hydroelectric power from ontario power generation resulting in nearly zero greenhouse gas ghg emissions michael insulan vice president commercial added there have been several new battery plant announcements over the past few months in north america adding to a pipeline already exceeding 500 gwh these plants are going to require thousands of tonnes of locally sourced raw materials electra intends to become the first regional refiner capable of providing these materials in bulk through a modular plant design to keep up with a rapidly evolving market we can and must do more for the circular economy and through localised primary feeds resulting in more jobs and investments in our home market battery materials park electra s metallurgical complex in canada has a previous operating history and permits which will facilitate an accelerated establishment of a battery materials park the company has taken several steps to enable the future expansion of its existing industrial site and is in talks with other market participants and government officials who are supportive of these expansion plans phase 1 of the four phase plan is underway and consists of the expansion of an existing refinery complex to produce 26 of the ex china supply of battery grade cobalt the project is progressing on schedule and will be commissioned at the end of 2022 phase 2 involves treating battery materials from the cathode and anode of lithium batteries to recover lithium nickel cobalt copper and graphite leveraging existing plant equipment that previously recovered nickel copper and cobalt a scoping study is nearing completion and will benefit from existing processes and infrastructure and would be operated by the same team as the cobalt plant plans are underway to commission a demonstration plant in 2022 then start treating black mass from batteries on a commercial basis in 2023 electra anticipates being very competitive in battery recycling as its hydrometallurgical refinery is expected to provide higher yields at a lower cost and at significantly lower energy intensity compared to traditional pyrometallurgical facilities the capital cost of adding a recycling circuit to an existing refining complex will be much lower than planned greenfield facilities and much faster given that permits are in place closed loop recycling of lithium ion batteries will serve the electric vehicle market in north america and europe and in the short term will benefit from higher availability of cobalt rich consumer electronics nickel strategy in phase 3 electra intends to construct a modular nickel sulfate plant initially producing in excess of 60 000 tonnes of nickel a nickel plant will enable the company s ambition to build north america s first integrated battery materials park electra battery materials has initiated a nickel market study with global commodities intelligence and analysis firm cru to assess market opportunities for a nickel sulfate plant in north america the study will evaluate the outlook for battery grade nickel sulfate demand for electra to advance talks with prospective nickel raw material suppliers in the region electric vehicle sales in the u s and canada grew by nearly 130 year over year in the first half of 2021 to a total of almost 325 000 units according to rho motion an industry leading electric vehicle and battery forecasting and analysis firm battery cell manufacturers and automakers are gearing up to supply the growing market and require a regional battery materials supply solution precursor manufacturing the fourth phase of the company s growth strategy will see the construction of a battery precursor materials plant in 2025 likely with a joint venture partner the company seeks to replicate the successes of battery raw materials complexes in finland south korea and china catering to a rapidly expanding battery cell industry in the u s and canada co location of lithium ion battery precursor manufacturing with nickel and cobalt sulfate production represents a major cost saving in the battery value chain by removing the need to crystalize material prior to transportation an operational cost saving in the range of 4 6 can be achieved additional savings are realized through reduced logistics costs which also lowers the carbon footprint of cathode materials corporate matters in accordance with the company s long term incentive plan first cobalt has granted certain newly recruited employees of the company 50 000 restricted share units rsus and incentive stock options to purchase an aggregate of 250 000 common shares of first cobalt exercisable at a price of the previous day s closing price of c 0 35 for a period of five years the rsus will vest in three equal tranches and can be settled in cash or shares the company has also issued 35 714 deferred share units dsus to a director as compensation for their services long term incentive grants are a key retention and incentive tool for key employees and new hires and remain subject to the approval of the tsx venture exchange about electra battery materials electra is building north america s only fully integrated localized and environmentally sustainable battery materials park leveraging the company s own mining assets and business partners the electra battery materials park will host cobalt and nickel sulfate production plants a large scale lithium ion battery recycling facility and battery precursor materials production which will serve both north american and global customers electra battery materials is an integral part of the north american battery supply chain providing low carbon sustainable and traceable raw materials for the region s fast growing electric vehicle industry on

at heart biden s sweeping policies are an attempt to boost the productive capacity of the nation increase the number of americans working outside the home and create a more fair and equitable economy after decades of struggle for low income and middle class americans in recent decades the wealthiest americans have pulled further away from everyone else and the pandemic made these disparities even more striking biden and democrats have called for a more balanced economy that helps lift more people this political and economic experiment will now be put to the test the infrastructure bill is a significant investment in roads bridges ports pipes and more that is widely expected to make business deliveries and commuting easier in the united states the build back better bill invests heavily in child care preschool education for 3 and 4 year olds paid parental leave and elder care these initiatives are expected to make it easier for americans especially moms to work outside the home because they know their young children and older relatives will have good care estimates from independent groups such as oxford economics and moody s analytics predict the pace of growth will be higher and the number of people working will increase in the coming years if these bills are signed into law largely because their models forecast that the gains from higher productivity and more women working will be greater than any drag from the tax increases to pay for the initiatives oxford economics predicts 0 5 percentage point higher growth in 2022 and 0 9 percentage point higher grow in 2023 according to economist gregory daco in a report released thursday moody s analytics predicts stronger growth and 2 4 million jobs by the end of 2025 as spending ramps up on road construction and in preschools combined with additional infrastructure investment build back better is quite a significant boost to economic activity said daco chief u s economist at oxford economics the infrastructure bill will now become law the build back better package which ranges between 1 75 trillion and 2 trillion depending on what survives still must clear more hurdles but many democrats are newly optimistic that they can push it into law not all models agree that biden s agenda will result in big gains the penn wharton budget model from the university of pennsylvania predicts the build back better bill would have a slightly negative impact on growth over the coming decade largely because it estimates that some proposed but not agreed to tax hikes on big corporations and wealthy individuals will be a drag on the economy a major reason the house and senate have not passed the build back better bill yet is because moderate democrats want to see the nonpartisan congressional budget office s assessment of its costs and benefits the cbo said in august the infrastructure bill would add at least 256 billion to the debt over the next 10 years biden has said his bills are fully paid for but the cbo has not had sufficient time to parse the 2 135 page climate child care and health care plan yet senate democrats meanwhile have not said whether they would even agree to the house bill suggesting that key details could change in the coming weeks the build back better bill is widely expected to be close to if not fully paid for when the cbo runs its final tally the bill includes a 15 percent corporate minimum tax on big companies a new tax on firms that perform stock buybacks and a new surcharge tax on americans with incomes above 10 million these initiatives along with heftier enforcement of tax cheats should be close to covering the costs the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation found the new tax provisions alone would raise 1 5 trillion in revenue in total biden s initiatives would add only a small fraction to the debt compared with the 2017 gop tax cut that is on track to add 1 9 trillion over a decade but there are a number of gimmicks in the bill that will probably make the real price tag larger the generous child tax credit expires in one year the credits to make health care more affordable expire in four years and the sweeping new pre k programs last for only six years the true cost of the bill would probably be closer to 4 trillion if these programs were extended the full decade according to nonpartisan analysis from the penn wharton budget model and the committee for a responsible federal budget when you add in the costs of making all of these short term programs permanent you will see that we re adding a whole new structural deficit to the federal budget said tori gorman policy director for the concord coalition which advocates for a balanced federal budget it seems a little ridiculous to pass legislation that s not fully paid for when we haven t even paid for the promises we already made other policy experts argue that these big investments are needed to make the u s economy competitive against china and other large economies they point out that it is incredibly cheap for the nation to borrow money right now because interest rates are at historic lows making it a wise time to invest this is about doing what s right for our economic future in terms of climate change and in terms of investing in our children said betsey stevenson a university of michigan economist and former member of president barack obama s council of economic advisers this is a historic investment in child care sen joe manchin iii of west virginia one of the last hold out votes that democrats need has raised concerns about whether inflation could get worse from all of this government spending americans are already on edge about inflation which is at a 13 year high biden promised friday the bills would lower costs in the long term many economists agree for example 17 nobel laureates in economics signed a letter saying biden s policies would ease longer term inflationary pressures many of biden s investments roads and transit building more affordable homes lower drug costs and reducing child care costs should result in a more productive economy and lower prices but it takes time to implement these programs and the results may not be felt right away the u s economy is suffering from severe supply chain problems and many businesses are struggling to hire all the workers they need additional government spending runs the risk of pushing inflation up in the next year some warn if a home builder can t find a construction worker how will we find a person to repair a road or fix the bridge they are going to experience the same constraints said peter boockvar chief investment officer of bleakley advisory group but the details of the bills matter many of the tax and fee increases start right away which should help contain inflationary pressures gripping the broader economy the child tax credit should also help alleviate the burden of higher gas food and rent prices on low and moderate income families families earning up to 150 000 a year receive a credit of 300 a month for each child under 6 and 250 a month for each child 6 to 17 subsidies for child care and health care should make those payments more affordable for many families overall inflation might be a bit higher but for low and middle income households inflation will probably be lower said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the infrastructure deal has been widely praised and passed with bipartisan support it will be the largest boost in spending on infrastructure in decades the build back better package continues to be negotiated in the house and senate in the latest version of the deal more than half of the money goes to addressing climate change and investing in young children through a universal pre k program the monthly child tax credit payments and a cap on child care expenses for many families at 7 percent of income at a fundamental level economies grow because there are either more workers entering the labor force or because the existing workers are more productive for much of the past decade the nation struggled with weak productivity gains one of many factors holding back the recovery from the great recession there has been a recent boost of productivity from rapid digitization during the pandemic the hope is these major bills will drive further improvements in productivity that can pay off for years to come on the workforce side of the equation the united states was a leader on women s participation in work outside the home in the 1980s and 90s but now the united states is lagging behind many other advanced economies in europe canada australia and japan many economists predict a boost in working women from the build back better plan especially if the final version includes both paid parental leave and expanded child care we know from a lot of empirical research that these policies will boost labor supply they will help people who have care responsibilities fully participate in the economy white house economic adviser heather boushey said at a recent washington post live event as democrats debate the final details the house added a controversial increase in the state and local tax deduction known as salt to 72 500 from 10 000 this change would allow wealthy homeowners to deduct more of their property taxes and expenses it is a popular change in states like new jersey and new york where there are many expensive homes and high property taxes but critics across the political spectrum have blasted the salt change as a giveaway to the rich running contrary to democrats message that this bill is supposed to tax the wealthy and big corporations to make much needed investments in young people climate change mitigation and the care economy according to the committee for a responsible federal budget the salt change would be the third most expensive proposal in the build back better bill why are they doing this tweeted jason furman former head of obama s white house council of economic advisers this increase alone will go almost exclusively to households making over 1 million while the final details are being worked out on the build back better plan the emerging consensus is that these bills are a major attempt to address barriers that have long held back the u s economy from its full potential if you put the process to the side and focus on the policy from a cumulative view the democrats are on the verge of historic fiscal policy chris krueger managing director at cowen and company wrote in a note to clients

elon musk faces a tax bill of more than 15 billion in the coming months on stock options musk asked his 62 7 million twitter followers over the weekend whether he should sell 10 of his tesla holdings the looming tax bill makes a sale of tesla stock this year likely regardless of the outcome of the twitter vote tesla ceo elon musk faces a tax bill of more than 15 billion in the coming months on stock options making a sale of his tesla stock this year likely regardless of the twitter vote musk asked his 62 7 million twitter followers over the weekend whether he should sell 10 of his tesla holdings much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance so i propose selling 10 of my tesla stock he tweeted get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters the tesla ceo said he would abide by the results of this poll whichever way it goes the results were 58 in favor of selling and 42 against suggesting he will sell the shares no matter the results of the poll musk would have likely started selling millions of shares this quarter the reason a looming tax bill of more than 15 billion musk was awarded options in 2012 as part of a compensation plan because he doesn t take a salary or cash bonus his wealth comes from stock awards and the gains in tesla s share price the 2012 award was for 22 8 million shares at a strike price of 6 24 per share tesla shares closed at 1 222 09 on friday meaning his gain on the shares totals just under 28 billion the company has also recently disclosed that musk has taken out loans using his shares as collateral and with the sales musk may want to repay some of those loan obligations as tesla noted in its third quarter securities and exchange commission 10 q filing this year if the price of our common stock were to decline substantially mr musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further the options expire in august of next year yet in order to exercise them musk has to pay the income tax on the gain since the options are taxed as an employee benefit or compensation they will be taxed at top ordinary income levels or 37 plus the 3 8 net investment tax he will also have to pay the 13 3 top tax rate in california since the options were granted and mostly earned while he was a california tax resident combined the state and federal tax rate will be 54 1 so the total tax bill on his options at the current price would be 15 billion musk hasn t confirmed the size of the tax bill but he tweeted note i do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere i only have stock thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock since ceos have limited windows in which to sell stock and musk would likely want to stagger the sales over at least two quarters analysts and tax experts have been expecting musk to start selling in the fourth quarter of 2021 at an appearance at the code conference in september musk said i have a bunch of options that are expiring early next year so a huge block of options will sell in q4 because i have to or they ll expire musk of course could also borrow more against his tesla shares which now total over 200 billion yet he has already pledged 92 million shares to lenders for cash borrowing when asked at the code conference about borrowing against such volatile shares he said stocks don t always go up they also go down musk is still racking up options beyond those granted via tesla s 2012 pay package in march 2018 tesla s board of directors granted him an unprecedented ceo performance award consisting of 101 3 million stock options adjusted for the 5 for 1 stock split in 2020 in 12 milestone based tranches cnbc s lora kolodny contributed to this report

fargo it might be a howly growly christmas for some consumers this holiday after hearing about the potential liquor wine and beer shortages this holiday season thanks to covid the gift that keeps on giving you may have to brave your great aunt violet s hideous holiday gifts with nogless eggs nulled cider and 12 and under tom and jerrys the sobering trend has been tied to a perfect storm or maybe a perfect drought of factors ranging from escalating consumption among a stressed out populace to the same supply chain bottlenecks that have affected dozens of other industries rod thompson general manager of the bottle shoppe in moorhead and trax liquors in dilworth minnesota says the shortages have become more significant in the last three to four months we started noticing that every shipment we get is pretty much short items due to the lack of product he says every one of our vendors will say if i had it i would sell it it s my livelihood nader mossavi food and beverage director at the rosewild in fargo s jasper hotel said they ve especially felt the pinch in the last month he s not only seeing 750 ml bottles only available in 375 ml sizes but finding it can take anywhere from 30 to 40 days for some orders to be delivered advertisement i want to let our consumers know it s not us says mossavi who previously worked in las vegas for 21 years overseeing food and beverage operations for various casinos i want to sell you that 300 bottle of wine and i want people to come out and have a good time but i m hoping people understand that there s not only a labor shortage there s a consumer product shortage on the other hand there s no need to sing i m dreaming of a dry christmas yet some liquor stores have grown more strategic and creative in sourcing the alcohol their customers want manufacturers and suppliers have pivoted to accommodate container shortages and local restaurants and bars are exploring new ways to bring special holiday beverages to their patrons people might just have to practice patience the experts we interviewed insisted there s no need to panic buy enough pinot noir to fill three pantries this shouldn t become the big charmin squeeze or the great lysol wipe out dustin mitzel ceo of happy harry s bottle shop which runs five liquor stores in fargo and grand forks says there will still be plenty of holiday spirit to go around i have no indication from suppliers that this year will be any different from last year he says displaying a glass half full optimism about alcohol supplies but customers will need to brace for price hikes on their favorite brands as virtually every aspect of bringing wassail to the consumer s cup has become more complex and expensive dan sobolik vice president of sales for republic national distributing the second largest spirits and wine distributor in the country says he s used to seeing prices on alcohol rise about 1 every two to three years lately the increases are closer to 2 to 3 every year thompson estimates that beer prices have crept up anywhere from 4 to 10 while high end liquors have seen a 10 to 12 increase from week to week we see the case price increase says nader mossavi says i can see a lot of businesses especially smaller businesses are going to have to push that price range onto the consumer advertisement a perfect drought of conditions so what s the problem local liquor retailers distributors and manufacturers cite a number of factors a covid induced spike in consumer consumption even though bars and restaurants closed at home consumption soared as consumers stocked their pantries with box wines and other lower priced liquors to get through the pandemic glass aluminum plastic and cardboard shortages all triggered by factory shutdowns shipping issues and raw material shortfalls although alcoa the world s eighth largest producer of aluminum has built three new plants since covid started manufacturers are still struggling to meet demand sobolik says labor and transportation problems there s labor shortages all over sobolik says whether in distilleries and wineries or whether it s been in shipping a fleet of complications have bottlenecked the usual transportation and distribution routes ranging from backed up ports of shipping containers to a lack of truckers to bring the product to retailer s sobolik says fuel costs are also on the rise some trucking companies have compensated by increasing their rates by 30 to 35 sobolik says just in time or way too late another factor is our reliance on just in time jit manufacturing first introduced by toyota a mastermind in industrial efficiency a just in time model is based on parts being delivered to factories right when they re needed minimizing the need to stockpile them in vast inventories just in time manufacturing proved so effective at keeping companies more nimble while cutting costs that every industry from fashion to pharmaceuticals adopted them but the chaos of the last 20 months has shown that just in time can sometimes become way too late especially when a chain reaction of factors have caused major disruptions according to a new york times article on liquor supply issues it s sort of like supply chain run amok willy c shih an international trade expert at harvard business school told the times in a race to get to the lowest cost i have concentrated my risk we are at the logical conclusion of all that happy harry s doesn t rely on a just in time model mitzel says we have always been very aggressive to buy in quantity so if someone suddenly needs five cases of product x we ll have five cases of product x in stock but smaller stores don t always have the buying power or space for huge inventories and they are feeling the squeeze with just in time manufacturing and inventory it turns out to be not so great when there are hiccups says joel kath ceo of proof artisan distillers in fargo advertisement glass shortage bottle shock when kath first launched proof in fargo in 2014 he remembers how easy it was to order bottles he would place an order from the chinese manufacturer it would arrive seven to 10 days later about 45 days after that he would get the invoice now amid a worldwide glass shortage the process has become much harder if he wants to order bottles he must pay up front we re having to front the money to reserve the pallets when they do arrive says kath even after pre paying kath must wait sometimes for months for the bottles to arrive what we re seeing is that the small producers are impacted most kath says because we don t have a lot of buying clout a lot of times we re having to get whatever is left over from big orders and whatever the manufacturers can scrounge up for us kath explains why glass has become so difficult to source during the pandemic while many overseas glass manufacturers were shut down consumers continued to buy and deplete the glass stockpiles in warehouses overseas and when glass factories started back up they were not at all operating at full production he adds and they re still trying to catch up when you compound that with the freight and cargo shipping dilemma it s kind of a mess while domestic glass manufacturers have stepped in to help fill the gap kath says the us consumes a lot more than it produces advertisement the shortage has caused bottle prices to increase by as much as 50 he adds another factor is the shortage of liquid oxygen which is necessary to manufacture glass but which is being used by hospitals at unprecedented levels to treat covid patients mossavi says top shelf brands affected most availability of different types of alcohol seems to wax and wane according to current supply and labor issues for a while peach schnapps was as hard to find as fresh peaches in north dakota in january in the earlier days of covid hard seltzers grew scarce because of aluminum shortages cognac and jack daniels were also mia at different times nationally winemakers have been hampered by everything from bad weather to bottle shortages it s kind of all over the board thompson says it depends on which week it is the vendors will come in and they ll be so discouraged they ll say we re out of captain morgan this week and they ll shake their head thompson has noticed that some manufacturers have responded to shortages by changing container materials to plastic or aluminum by using smaller bottles or by switching 24 packs to 18 packs but thompson adds plastic isn t an option for 300 bourbon most of our sources agreed that the top shelf spirits will be harder to find in the next few months that s partly because these spirits take longer to make and age but also due to their distinctive harder to create glass containers advertisement it s not the actual spirit in the bottle it s the bottle itself that they are unable to produce nader mossavi food and beverage director the jasper hotel fargo businesses that specialize in these boutique liquors are definitely noticing the rosewild staff use premium brands for everything from their batch cocktails to the drinks they develop specifically for their seasonal menus we have 14 cocktails for a reason mossavi says we don t want to use a cheaper product and try to pass it off the shortfall has escalated to the point where mossavi and staff had to meet with liquor vendors recently to let them know they needed to make adjustments if a vendor who traditionally supplied them with a certain brand couldn t get it he told them they might have to temporarily change to a different vendor to source a close proximity to it one great thing about fargo is that we can have honest conversations about this he says our vendors have been very upfront about lead times even so the shortage has caused mossavi and rosewild chef austin covert to amend their menu numerous times to ensure they have the right cocktail or wine to pair with it we are literally working week by week to see what we have enough of mossavi says how long will this last that depends on who you ask some say things could get better by april or may of next year others think it could take several years mitzel errs on the side of optimism we don t have a crystal ball and we don t know exactly how many price increases were internalized that will get passed along in 2022 mitzel says hopefully as the months go by ingredients will be easier to get and more glass will be produced hopefully some of those will lead to decreases in price in 2022 advertisement the happy harry s ceo believes the liquor industry has greeted its supply and demand issues with considerable flexibility and creativity i don t think there s any reason for anyone to panic buy and stock up beyond what they would for normal consumption he says if your favorite thing happens to be out for a few days chances are it will be back in a short period of time if not there are a number of things you can try and enjoy and share with friends and family this holiday season thompson advises consumers buy in advance if they are concerned a favorite liquor won t be in stock the majority of the time we ve been lucky he says if you re patient it will come

the chevrolet corvette c8 has certainly stolen the spotlight from its older sibling the c7 everyone s excited about the upcoming z06 model and we can t even begin to imagine how insane the zr1 version is going to be it has quite a reputation to live up to as the c7 zr1 was nothing short of spectacular in itself getting your hands on a c7 chevrolet corvette zr1 meant gaining access to a supercharged 6 2 liter v8 that had an output of 755 horsepower that s 5 less horsepower when compared to a shelby gt500 but given the choice would you take the heavier mustang over the zr1 that aside how many zr1 owners do you think felt that 755 horsepower is not enough for their needs at what point do you draw the line between a streetcar and a race car looking through the classifieds i came across this 2019 shadow gray metallic zr1 you don t even need to read the description to realize that there s something insane about this car you just need to observe the rear 15 weld beadlock wheels i d say that you have to be pretty serious about racing your car to use that kind of a setup sure the car looks slightly strange with different size wheels up front but form follows function this zr1 is running a 390 ci 6 4 liters darton sleeved engine that has had quite a few upgrades done to it so far including diamond pistons callies rods and a synergy motorsports ported blower so forget about triple digit horsepower levels when using vp x85 fuel this zr1 will churn out a massive 1 071 wheel horsepower which equals about 1 250 hp to the crank that s more than you would get out of a bugatti veyron that s not to say that this would win against the french built hypercar but it does have you thinking about the outcome photo chicago motor cars if this were stock the manual gearbox might have been more interesting but with this kind of power having an 8 speed automatic feels like a blessing now the seller hasn t mentioned anything about how fast this car is down the quarter mile 402 meters instead the car is described as a hardcore american track monster upon doing a bit of research you ll find out that a zr1 with a hennessey hpe1000 package is capable of running the quarter mile in 9 4 seconds but if you take things up a notch up to 1 200 horsepower then you should be capable to dip in the high 8s this zr1 hasn t been converted for track use as it retains all of its creature comforts and it has an asking price of 179 800 which is less than what you d pay for a brand new porsche 911 turbo s while you can probably get a 9 second car for less money is it still going to be as impressive also is it going to be as reliable notice the driveshaft shop parts used in the build and the fact that the transmission has been strengthened as well to top things off this zr1 has only been driven for 4 127 miles 6 641 km which means the former owner has probably enjoyed it a quarter of a mile at a time himself

these fast growing companies will provide longer term value to investors than the digital currency growth stocks have been traveled on an inexorable path higher since the end of the great recession in 2009 federal reserve policies of keeping lending rates artificially low while engaging in quantitative easing have created an ocean of cheap abundant capital allowing companies with fast paced growth stocks tohire innovate and acquire their way to new heights and greater profits yet even those pale in comparison to those made by cryptocurrency darling shiba inu shib 2 10 the dog faced token that has returned more than 13 million percent in a little over a year a 10 investment in august 2020 means you would be a millionaire today however with little utility outside of changing hands back and forth among traders there s a good chance shiba inu could crumble at any minute compared with growth stocks which have economic tailwinds behind them to continue outperforming the market even with the s p 500 regularly setting new all time highs the following growth stock duo has the capability to make you richer in november and most importantly well beyond barking up the right tree keith noonan if you find yourself drawn to the cuteness of the shiba inu token s mascot i can t blame you heck those dogs are pretty cute however there s a good chance that long term investors will be better served by putting their money behind chewy chwy 6 55 a pet focused company that s growing at a rapid clip and has a long runway for expansion chewy operates an online marketplace for pet focused products including food toys and a wide range of other supplies the company also recently launched a separate platform that s geared toward veterinarians increasingly dogs cats and other animals are viewed as parts of the family and people are spending more on their pets than ever before chewy s sales surged nearly 27 year over year last quarter to reach 2 16 billion and the company has shifted into profitability across the first half of the current fiscal year the company closed out the period with 20 1 million active customers up 21 over the prior year period even better it s clear that shoppers are doing an increasing amount of spending through chewy s platform at the end of q2 existing customers had increased their spending 13 5 over the trailing 12 month period the company has a sizable quickly expanding market to tap into and it s been rapidly gaining share in its industry the american pet products association estimates that people in the u s will spend 67 5 billion on pet food treats supplies over the counter medicine and other relevant categories in 2021 and chewy s midpoint target calls for 8 95 billion in sales this year good for a roughly 13 market share that s up dramatically from the 7 4 share of 47 3 billion in category revenue that it claimed in 2018 with a large and growing user base and customers increasing their shopping dollars through the platform chewy has a powerful growth engine that could drive its share price much higher the perfect getaway stock rich duprey airbnb investors might have made a ton more money on shiba coin in the past few months than if they d invested in airbnb abnb 3 21 but short term vacation rental company is a far better high growth stock that will undoubtedly outperform the crypto over the next five years while still regaining its sea legs from the pandemic storm airbnb has a massive runway of opportunity ahead of it not least because this niche of the travel and tourism industry is in its infancy airbnb s asset light business model means it doesn t have to pay for construction or maintenance expenses a competitive advantage over hotels motels and resorts but should give it better profit margins airbnb has only been publicly traded since last december and it s still generating losses a situation the pandemic didn t help but its financial condition is steadily improving there are more than 130 million households in the u s and around 1 billion globally airbnb now has more than 4 million homeowners offering their properties for rental on the platform and gross booking value or the fees it charges for the stay cleaning and similar costs hit 13 4 billion in the second quarter up 320 over last year but also 37 higher than the same period in 2019 wall street forecasts that revenue will grow from 3 4 billion last year to 13 85 billion in 2025 a 32 compound annual growth rate while adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization will turn from a 250 million loss in 2020 to a 1 5 billion profit next year yet despite producing losses airbnb is generating positive free cash flow or the money its operations have left over after paying all the bills it had more than 1 4 billion on a trailing 12 month basis after the second quarter and with the third quarter including the peak summer month vacationing season there s a good chance it could grow substantially with a total addressable market of 3 4 trillion of which airbnb has only a small slice the opportunity to run circles around shiba inu over the next five years and beyond is great

arguably one of the greatest investors of all time since 1995 his company berkshire hathaway brk a 0 37 brk b 0 37 has netted investors a remarkable 20 average annual return the s p 500 s was only 10 2 and even though he s 91 years old he shows no signs of slowing down what s even more special is that he has adhered to some investing principles over the years when he looks for companies in which to invest he looks for businesses with a strong moat competitive advantages a large margin of safety and shareholder friendly management on top of that he holds his companies for a long time we re not all mini buffetts but we can learn from his lead and take advantage of companies he invests in and consider them for our own portfolios three motley fool contributors have reviewed his portfolio and chosen three of buffett s stocks to invest in during the month of november here s why they recommend moody s mco 0 24 the spdr s p 500 trust etf spy 0 76 and berkshire hathaway brk a 0 37 brk b 0 37 itself a ratings superstar with a huge moat eric volkman moody s corporation there are many stocks in berkshire s equity portfolio that constantly appear in the headlines hello apple and bank of america one that doesn t is a bit of a sleeper moody s corporation and like a lot of good sleeper stocks moody s has plenty of potential for investors of any stripe one investing principle buffett strongly believes in is that of a moat he s partial to companies operating in businesses with high barriers to entry moody s ticks that box as it s one of only three major credit rating agencies on the scene along with s p global s standard poor s global ratings and fitch ratings credit rating agencies gauge the investment worthiness of corporate and public debt instruments like bonds these ratings are crucial for investors particularly since many institutions only buy debt above a certain rating threshold it s good to be one of the three kings interest rates are hovering near all time lows at least for now which means a lot more borrowing since debt is relatively cheap combine that with the privations of the coronavirus outbreak and you ve got many more companies lining up to borrow money according to research from deloitte total corporate debt rose by 9 year over year in 2020 at the end of that year the grand total of borrowings by non financial businesses in this country stood at roughly 17 7 trillion that generates a lot of business for ratings specialists moody s is doing its usual good job of taking advantage of this moody s investors service mis the core ratings division of the company s operations took in 925 million in the third quarter alone up a sturdy 12 year over year interest rates won t stay on the floor forever particularly considering that inflation is rearing its ugly head but even if rates rise they ll still be low on a historical basis and companies will continue to borrow money besides judging corporate credit isn t moody s only activity the second component of its operations business intelligence unit moody s analytics has also been growing at encouraging rates in q3 revenue for the division increased 13 to 601 million in the space of five years that figure has nearly doubled by comparison mis s take rose by only 51 moody s is one of those powerful businesses that has modest expenses compared to what it earns in revenue in said q3 its headline net profit was 474 million on 1 53 billion in revenue this was not a fluke if we zoom out to the company s previous four fiscal years net margin has been similarly healthy ranging from 24 to 33 finally for income investors moody s also pays its shareholders on a regular basis its payout is not a high yield dividend at only 0 6 but it s steady and reliable the company hands it out every quarter and habitually and generously raises it every year is this the ultimate in defensive investments chuck saletta berkshire hathaway as ceo of berkshire hathaway warren buffett has built a mini economy unto itself there s energy generation and transportation goods and services transportation food clothing shelter insurance and more all wrapped up in that single corporate conglomerate as if that weren t enough the company is regularly criticized for carrying too much cash which can be rough in an inflationary environment but is wonderful when the economy hits the rocks most of those fairly defensive operating businesses are subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway which means that you can only buy a stake in them by buying the parent company and all that cash well it keeps piling up because those subsidiaries keep generating more of it can too much cash be a problem absolutely but it s certainly a better problem to have than the opposite one if that weren t enough investors can pick up shares of berkshire hathaway for just above 19 times the company s expected earnings that s a bit cheaper than the overall s p 500 s estimate above 21 making the company a relative bargain despite its incredibly strong financial position of course with such a defensive footprint berkshire hathaway isn t expected to post incredible growth through its operations remember though that along with the company s operating footprint by buying berkshire hathaway stock you also get the stock picking services of warren buffett and his handpicked successors with a total package like that what s not to love buffett s favorite investment of them all barbara eisner bayer spdr s p 500 trust etf there s no arguing that the oracle of omaha has been one of the world s greatest stock pickers of all time but even with this enormous talent he doesn t recommend investing in individual stocks for most people instead he s advocated time and time again that the best investment for individual investors is an index fund or exchange traded fund etf that tracks the s p 500 index as far back as 2013 buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders the goal of the non professional should not be to pick winners neither he nor his helpers can do that but should rather be to own a cross section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well a low cost s p 500 index fund will achieve this goal and as recently as the 2021 annual meeting buffett said it s a great argument for index funds if you just had a diversified group of equities u s equities that would be my preference but to hold over a 30 year period so what exactly is this investment vehicle that mr b is so excited about as implied in its name an index fund tracks a particular index and is available in a variety of investment classes small cap mid cap large cap sectors everything from healthcare to cryptocurrencies and domestic and international etfs trade like a stock and can be bought and sold any time but buffett prefers the s p 500 index because it holds 500 of the largest u s companies and has given investors an average annual return of 10 over the long term by purchasing this type of index fund you ll get instant diversification and the ability to invest without paying any attention to what s going on every day in the stock market does buffett walk the talk you betcha as of august 2021 he owned two index funds in the berkshire hathaway portfolio the spdr s p 500 trust etf spy 0 76 and the vanguard s p 500 etf voo 0 72 how much does buffett believe in index funds when he s gone he wants his wife s estate invested 90 in an s p index fund with the other 10 going into treasury bills if you want to invest like buffett follow his advice buy an s p index fund and hold it for the long term it s the best and most consistent holding he s recommended throughout the years and it easily can be yours too

the one year one outfit challenge is coming to an end participants who embraced the challenge last october were asked to make an outfit of three garments using only natural fibers and dyes sourced within a 250 mile radius of cleveland the organization sponsoring the challenge rust belt fibershed hopes it will encourage a regional network of farmers textile producers and makers and energize a local farm to closet sustainable fashion movement in this movement the alpaca undoubtedly would play a starring role ohio has 22 000 registered alpacas more than any other state in the nation and northeast ohio was where the industry got its start through the efforts of a now retired veterinarian named anthony stachowski anthony stachowski on his farm in mantua ohio stachowski was celebrating his 68th birthday on the day i visited he was the first farmer in ohio and one of the first in the united states to breed alpacas stachowski raises alpacas in mantua he and partner mary reed currently have about 250 at the height of the alpaca craze in the early 2000s the farm had as many as 800 stachowski started with 50 purchased from the very first herd imported into the u s from peru in 1984 so no private farmer owned alpacas until 1984 and i was the first to buy them from the importer it was february the seventh stachowski recalled he became ohio s first large alpaca breeder so i sold to the likes of steve wozniak from apple computers loyal mcmillan from nordstrom department stores and many others that wanted them as exotic pets since then they ve become domestic livestock and now we sell them to farmers said stachowski jess boeke was with me on this visit she and her sister are the founders of rust belt fibershed she was here to find out what stachowski and reed do with the fiber from their alpacas and was dismayed to find out more than a third of it is thrown away alpaca breeder mary reed left and jess boeke co founder of rust belt fibershed discuss alpaca economics at anthony stachowski s farm in mantua ohio well we don t have any buyers so we throw it all in the dumpster stachowski said and that s why you guys are here because otherwise people come in they want to buy fiber for very low prices reed made sounds of protestation as he said this she sends her best fiber to several mills for processing and sells yard in a little store at the farm she had samples of her yarn sitting in boxes on the back of a golf cart to show us mary reed sends her finest alpaca fiber to mini mills to get spun into yarn the alpaca registry recognizes sixteen colors including several shades of gray and fawn boeke turned to stachowski man that seems so unfortunate it s sad to see that happen it s such a resource she said is that recent i chimed in was there stachowski interrupted me it s been around for the last forty years he said we ve never had a fiber industry this is true and the story behind it shows why jess boeke s dream of a local fiber network may be difficult to realize and why it s a good time right now to try the national alpaca industry is small very small there are about 250 000 registered alpacas in the u s compared to 3 6 million in their native homeland of peru there s also no infrastructure to support the large scale processing of alpaca fiber like most of the fashion industry the work of textile spinning weaving and manufacturing has gone overseas there are mini mills that will take small batches of fiber clean it and spin it into yarn mary reed said it s labor intensive so we ve got this challenge in that it s a very long staple she said so you ve got to have the equipment that can deal with staple lengths of five to seven inches sheep s wool is what an inch and a half you have to deal with a fiber that s a range of microns or fineness if you will and alpacas come in more colors than any other livestock we show them in sixteen colors they primarily breed for white in peru because you can dye them in any color we have to sort and grade you got the color you got the length you got the micron it becomes very challenging it s not like the wool industry bags of fiber from mary reed s alpacas sit in a wooden storage unit on anthony stachowski s farm alpacas are shorn at least once a year each fleece produces about four pounds of fiber so how s peru done it then i asked knowing even before i opened my mouth what the answer would be women sit there and they sort through mounds and mounds and mounds of fiber in the same color all day long for less than a dollar an hour said reed that s how they do it boeke laughed so this is really a challenge to bring this to boeke didn t need to complete her thought reed knew what she meant yes yes that s why it s a cottage industry reed said it s a cottage industry that in many ways is still struggling to get off the ground even after forty years here s why the american alpaca industry wasn t created to sell fiber it was built around breeding the exotic animal in your own backyard and selling its adorable woolly offspring baby alpacas are called crias mary reed called this one baby baby until she could come up with an official registry name stachowski said his business model was never based on alpaca fiber my model was that you buy the the parents that they produce offspring and that the offspring on average are worth 50 percent of what you paid for your original stock so in three years you re clean he said you know when they first imported the importers were asking 10 12 15 000 an animal added reed and it was like investing in gold or silver it was an investment by the early 2000s alpaca females were averaging 70 000 at auction and males 30 000 unlikely people became alpaca farmers doctors retirees even famously former cleveland mayor michael white meanwhile alpacas only commodity its fiber was selling for 5 a pound richard sexton an agricultural economist out of the university of california davis ran the numbers and concluded farmers would need 47 a pound just to cover basic costs it was clear that the value of the fiber wasn t even commensurate with the cost of feeding and otherwise maintaining the alpaca so in economic parlance they re worthless sexton co authored an article in 2006 stating as much it was the pin that popped the alpaca industry s speculative bubble along with the great recession of 2008 there were thousands of them for free that s how you get rid of them remembered stachowski right now there s a price and the price is 500 for a little male who s not going to be a show animal it s not zero anymore now that prices have come down way down alpacas are gaining new fans membership in the alpaca owners association aoa is shifting away from retirees looking for an investment opportunity to millennials interested in homesteading said the aoa s executive director robin gifford the demographic is changing rapidly we have over 200 first time members since dec 1 we re seeing them more in their 30s 40s 50s i think covid had a lot to do with it gifford said it s individuals who are saying you know what i want something simpler i want to i ve seen what i can do at home and business is booming for those who process alpaca fiber sean riley s family owns and operates new england alpaca fiber pool in massachusetts like the name implies the company pools fiber from hundreds of farms and takes it to commercial mills that turn it into yarn or even hats socks and sweaters riley says their business has doubled every 18 months since 2013 when a lot of people that were in the industry for the wrong reasons were shooken out of it because they were saying hey i can t sell 50 000 animals when that happened it was actually the best thing for the fiber aspect of it said riley because it forced people in the industry to say i need to make an income off the fiber i produce to kinda help pay my farm bills so it was actually a blessing in disguise for us and it may be a blessing in disguise for rust belt fibershed s jess boeke who still believes despite anthony stachowski s skepticism that a bioregional natural fiber network can be restarted here with alpaca at the center when we think of assets alpacas are clearly on top of the list for the potential there boeke said so it seems there s gotta be a way a concerted effort something that can happen that can create a local industry out of this the adorable factor is part of alpacas appeal they are also easy to manage they don t take up a lot of space their padded feet don t tear up the ground like hooves do and they poop in one place yeah so anyway so i m glad you re here stachowski said by way of concluding our conversation because you may be the missing link like the sasquatch that kinda brings the actual farmer with the person that is interested in the fiber and we would love to have people come here and look at our fiber and pay a fair price for it that price may never be 47 a pound but perhaps with enough interest it will be high enough to keep farmers from throwing alpaca fiber into the dumpster copyright 2021 wcpn to see more visit wcpn

she saw an ad pop up on her instagram feed for a quad bike the 4wd quad bike touted in the ad featured a 449cc fuel injected engine and a lightweight aluminium chassis aussies share the strange items they have been sent by scammers view gallery keen to get a start on her christmas shopping ms coulstock bought the 150 bike for her kids everything was so cheap on that shop so i also ended up buying a hanging outdoor chair for us 59 and a tool chest with tools for us 39 she said a month later ms coulstock was puzzled to receive a small package in the mail from china i opened it and inside was a cheap gold necklace with a gold leaf i thought that s not what i ordered she said a photo of the tree marie armitage bought left and what arrived in the mail right marie armitage a few days later another tiny parcel arrived this time it contain a necklace with a heart shaped pendant a tracking number on one of the parcels matched that of the quad bike while the other necklace appeared to have been sent in place of the hanging chair and tool chest ms coulstock said it s just weird very weird she said adding that after lodging a complaint she managed to get refunds for the chair and tool bench from paypal but was still fighting to get her money back for the quad bike marissa hadland helps runs the popular facebook ad scambusters page on facebook which has more than 8000 members ms hadland said the same scams such as the christmas tree and sticker pairing had been cropping up over and over again for years there are billions of dollars in ads being bought by china based scam rings to rip off aussies and americans she said it s the worst kept secret on facebook and honestly we re hoping negative stories will finally stick in the news cycle the scammers use cheap prices to lure victims in getty the scammers often stole photos of items being sold by legitimate businesses to use in their ads then offered the products at ultra cheap prices as a way to lure customers in ms hadland said sending a cheap item rather than nothing at all tended to make it harder for victims to get refunds she added they do mostly send something because paypal tends to reject claims when there is real tracking ms hadland said the scammers are also able to gaslight people by sending a cheap copy telling people that is what they ordered western australia security guard paul bought a pallet load of what scammers claimed was returned or excess amazon stock only to receive the four items pictured on the right supplied often customers were told to post the item back to china at their own expense leading some people to give up ms hadland said the number of australians reporting bait and switch scams is growing the australian competition and consumer commission s scamwatch program received almost 1800 reports of online shopping scams originating on social media from the beginning of this year to october 24 with over 794 000 in losses during the same timeframe it received 119 reports where customers tried to purchase a particular product and were sent completely different goods of a lesser value some replacement items mentioned in the reports were face masks instead of kitchenware a notepad instead of an ipad and sunglasses instead of shoes perth security guard paul who asked for his surname to be withheld similarly fell victim when he bought an 80 tool bench advertised on facebook what came in the mail was a cheap toolkit worth about 5 he said an 80 rolling tool bench this is what western australia security guard paul got in the mail instead supplied since then paul has made something of a sport of trying to catch other scammers out ordering items and reporting them to paypal when the wrong product shows up paul said he also reported the sellers to the companies whose goods they purported to be selling paul said it was easy to spot the ads belonging to scammers they will often come up as sponsored ad and they usually offer outrageous discounts he said power tools and tool benches were popular items for scammers to tout paul said scammers often posted a video of a person using the item they were advertising sometimes the person s face was blurred he said one common scam involves advertisers selling pallet loads of goods the scammers fraudulently claim the pallets are made up of returned or excess stock from retail giant amazon often sold at dirt cheap prices the advertised pallets represent a bargain many find hard to resist looking to expose the scam paul bought a so called amazon pallet load of goods containing tools and

scammers using its platform personally i see facebook doing little to stop these fake sponsor adverts he said they should be held accountable under australian law as they are financially reaping the proceeds of crime and are responsible for the lack of content control on their platform when asked about the bait and switch scams a spokesperson for facebook which also owns instagram told 9news com au the social media giant took the problem seriously we do not allow scams on our services and we take swift action to remove them as soon as we become aware the spokesperson said we encourage people to report pages or profiles that violate these rules by promoting products services schemes or offers that are deceptive or misleading we work to get ahead of scammers and that includes making investments in our enforcement and putting in place real world consequences including taking legal action how the scam works and tips to protect yourself online shopping scams involve scammers pretending to be legitimate online sellers with fake websites fake ads on genuine retailer sites or through the use of social media platforms by creating fake stores or posting ads on social media if a product is too good to be true it probably is look out for sellers offering items at extremely low prices be suspicious of sellers that insist on immediate payment or payment via bank transfer only pay for items using a secure payment service look for a url starting with and a closed padlock symbol or a payment provider such as paypal if you ve bought something online and there is a problem you should try to contact the retailer as there may be a legitimate reason for the problem if you are not satisfied with the response and suspect you may have been scammed you may be able to arrange a charge back through your bank if you paid by credit card you can also report a scam to the accc through the scamwatch website tell your friends and family about the scam so you can help protect

these fast growing companies will provide longer term value to investors than the digital currency growth stocks have been traveled on an inexorable path higher since the end of the great recession in 2009 federal reserve policies of keeping lending rates artificially low while engaging in quantitative easing have created an ocean of cheap abundant capital allowing companies with fast paced growth stocks tohire innovate and acquire their way to new heights and greater profits yet even those pale in comparison to those made by cryptocurrency darling shiba inu shib 2 10 the dog faced token that has returned more than 13 million percent in a little over a year a 10 investment in august 2020 means you would be a millionaire today however with little utility outside of changing hands back and forth among traders there s a good chance shiba inu could crumble at any minute compared with growth stocks which have economic tailwinds behind them to continue outperforming the market even with the s p 500 regularly setting new all time highs the following growth stock duo has the capability to make you richer in november and most importantly well beyond barking up the right tree keith noonan if you find yourself drawn to the cuteness of the shiba inu token s mascot i can t blame you heck those dogs are pretty cute however there s a good chance that long term investors will be better served by putting their money behind chewy chwy 6 55 a pet focused company that s growing at a rapid clip and has a long runway for expansion chewy operates an online marketplace for pet focused products including food toys and a wide range of other supplies the company also recently launched a separate platform that s geared toward veterinarians increasingly dogs cats and other animals are viewed as parts of the family and people are spending more on their pets than ever before chewy s sales surged nearly 27 year over year last quarter to reach 2 16 billion and the company has shifted into profitability across the first half of the current fiscal year the company closed out the period with 20 1 million active customers up 21 over the prior year period even better it s clear that shoppers are doing an increasing amount of spending through chewy s platform at the end of q2 existing customers had increased their spending 13 5 over the trailing 12 month period the company has a sizable quickly expanding market to tap into and it s been rapidly gaining share in its industry the american pet products association estimates that people in the u s will spend 67 5 billion on pet food treats supplies over the counter medicine and other relevant categories in 2021 and chewy s midpoint target calls for 8 95 billion in sales this year good for a roughly 13 market share that s up dramatically from the 7 4 share of 47 3 billion in category revenue that it claimed in 2018 with a large and growing user base and customers increasing their shopping dollars through the platform chewy has a powerful growth engine that could drive its share price much higher the perfect getaway stock rich duprey airbnb investors might have made a ton more money on shiba coin in the past few months than if they d invested in airbnb abnb 3 21 but short term vacation rental company is a far better high growth stock that will undoubtedly outperform the crypto over the next five years while still regaining its sea legs from the pandemic storm airbnb has a massive runway of opportunity ahead of it not least because this niche of the travel and tourism industry is in its infancy airbnb s asset light business model means it doesn t have to pay for construction or maintenance expenses a competitive advantage over hotels motels and resorts but should give it better profit margins airbnb has only been publicly traded since last december and it s still generating losses a situation the pandemic didn t help but its financial condition is steadily improving there are more than 130 million households in the u s and around 1 billion globally airbnb now has more than 4 million homeowners offering their properties for rental on the platform and gross booking value or the fees it charges for the stay cleaning and similar costs hit 13 4 billion in the second quarter up 320 over last year but also 37 higher than the same period in 2019 wall street forecasts that revenue will grow from 3 4 billion last year to 13 85 billion in 2025 a 32 compound annual growth rate while adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization will turn from a 250 million loss in 2020 to a 1 5 billion profit next year yet despite producing losses airbnb is generating positive free cash flow or the money its operations have left over after paying all the bills it had more than 1 4 billion on a trailing 12 month basis after the second quarter and with the third quarter including the peak summer month vacationing season there s a good chance it could grow substantially with a total addressable market of 3 4 trillion of which airbnb has only a small slice the opportunity to run circles around shiba inu over the next five years and beyond is great

as pakistan passes through yet another episode of galloping inflation trite explanations from the imf bogey to external shocks abound to assuage public anger however there s more to inflationary dynamics in pakistan and we often bank on the wrong answers what follows is an attempt at a layman s explanation of this complex issue our story begins with the 16th century conquest of south america by spanish conquistadors like cortés and pizarro they literally hit gold vast quantities of gold in the possession of the inca and aztec rulers fell into their lap most of that plus silver flew back to spain to the delight of the rulers since money in those days was specie based gold silver copper etc gold was the most valuable form of money however both spain and the rest of europe went through a price revolution in the aftermath as prices rose precipitously we now move to three notable 20th century episodes in 1929 the new york stock market crash heralded the great depression the most cataclysmic economic shock in recorded human history which saw severe contractions in gdp six years earlier in weimar germany hyperinflation forced people to carry bags full of cash just to buy a loaf of bread in the early 1980s the us economy had to go through a painful period with surging unemployment but it ultimately led to ameliorating the galloping inflation that had gripped the us and global economies since the breakout of the 1973 arab israeli war what s common to all these episodes is the effect of money upon output gdp and prices large precious metal inflow heralded higher prices as money supply rose precipitously an observation that became the basis of the quantity theory of money friedman and schwartz documented that an initial contraction of money supply made the great depression far worse weimar germany learned the hard way as did zimbabwe and venezuela this century that printing too much money is a recipe for disaster tightening of money supply in the 1980s finally ameliorated high inflation in the us why is our aggregate supply inelastic one factor is government policies even politicians understand this link well ie money is purchasing power which explains their penchant for expanding the money supply to rev up the gdp engine since july 2018 money supply in pakistan has expanded considerably as khurram husain reported money in circulation stood at rs7 trillion by june 2021 up from rs4 7tr in july 2018 this is besides the deposits that have grown from rs11tr to 17tr in the same period that s a lot of money creation in three years editorial govt s arguments on inflation are a vain attempt to obfuscate reality shift responsibility onto others let s come to the other critical part of this puzzle aggregate supply can aggregate supply in a country respond well to a rise in purchasing power if not we would encounter a known troubling predicament money chasing the same or comparatively less amounts of goods and services which will push their prices higher aggregate supply in turn depends upon the aggregate productivity within an economy omer siddique our pide colleague found that aggregate productivity in pakistan has been declining total factor productivity and economic growth in pakistan a five decade overview the end result of all this growth in money supply against aggregate supply that is relatively inflexible is the inflationary push within the economy this is the primary reason for pakistan s inflationary woes the response of aggregate supply explains why rates of inflation are different around the globe despite shocks like the coronavirus pandemic affecting every country in pakistan external shocks eg oil prices and exchange rate changes only serve to exacerbate an already choked aggregate supply accelerating the higher price push for context inflation in pakistan has been rising since 2018 well before the pandemic struck in 2020 but why is pakistan s aggregate supply inelastic one overwhelming factor government policies especially heavy protection for domestic producers carmakers sell low quality stuff at ridiculously high prices because there is little external competition ensuring that the induced demand for cars is always ahead of supply romancing the car nadeem haq agricultural pakistan imports billions of dollars of farm commodities because more than 100 public sector agricultural research institutes have little if any bearing upon agricultural output a recipe for disaster given the runaway population figures power sector critical for aggregate output is in shambles due to the overwhelming government footprint read the stubborn inflation the full gamut of inflation s repercussions is beyond the scope of this article but a little primer can enlighten the reader first all the purchasing power generated may come to naught for a major portion of the population by the time a pay rise for the labour force is realised inflation has already eroded purchasing power to an extent that any raise would at best help sustain living standards rather than raise it a fact that is aptly reflected in pakistan s stagnant human development indicators in economics this result is neatly captured via monetary neutrality which posits that in the long run any advantage conferred by an expansion in money supply only serves to raise the aggregate price level thus nullifying any short run advantages not everybody fares badly though of the trillions in bank deposits more than half go towards funding government expenses eighty per cent of which are unproductive non development through buying riskless treasuries and bonds that give handsome returns largely compensating for loss in purchasing power depositors though get little moreover as fbr and the world bank have noted subsidies to pakistan s elite groups run in the trillions per year simply put since subsidies are based on taxpayer money pakistanis are paying through their nose to keep the purchasing power of a small portion of populace intact in fact improving it through a middleman ie their own government interesting isn t it this is one way of exacerbating income inequalities in an economy for taming inflation then it s time to move beyond subsidy packages which tend to be neutral in the larger scheme of things more than anything what is needed is an understanding of how demand and supply forces interact and how to improve aggregate productivity the writer is an economist and research fellow at pide shahid mohmand gmail com published in dawn november 8th 2021

arabella roden explores the appeal of australia and new zealand s local jewellery brands and how they can improve retailers stock mix in an increasingly globalised world it can be easy to lose sight of the unique characteristics that make local brands special yet special they certainly are uniquely developed for the australian and new zealand markets homegrown brands share a deep knowledge and understanding of local consumers as well as a pride and passion for supporting retailers across the jewellery industry many of these brands are part of independent family operated businesses another value they have in common with jewellery retail sams group australia ceo steve der bedrossian tells jeweller sams group australia represents the homegrown australian jewellery and watch brands such as classique pink kimberley and sapphire dreams above gerrim founded in 1967 as a family business classique watches had been servicing the australian watch industry for more than 50 years our luxury jewellery brands pink kimberley and blush pink had been operating for about 15 years sapphire dreams is our newly launched brand that came to life in 2021 he says indelible australian touches are evident throughout the brands with der bedrossian noting the identity of our brand revolves around working with australian gemstones the australian way is also reflected in our brand marketing and company values as all our products are ethically and responsibly sourced paterson fine jewellery pfj is another aussie brand with a long history paterson fine jewellery was originally established in 1935 and operated locally around melbourne says managing director david paterson grandson of founder keith paterson the business expanded nationally in 1959 when keith took the little gypsy range of earrings to wholesalers around australia and shortly afterwards we expanded internationally into the new zealand market today pfj manufactures several registered brands including my little angel firegem australian opal and babylinks as an australian owned business we pride ourselves on our customer service quality and authenticity of our products customer satisfaction and quality workmanship are at the heart of our business philosophy and underpin our reputation in the industry paterson says that commitment to customer satisfaction and quality is evident in modern jewellery brands too such as harper rowe also a family business which was established in south australia in 2010 and now counts retail stockists across australia and new zealand as a family business we take pride in the knowledge that our company has developed locally and organically says director virginia moody our jewellery is designed in our workshop in south australia with many of our pieces also handmade there we try to source local components and materials wherever possible for our products and love working with our amazing australian suppliers moody adds being a local company means we can work closely with our retailers to develop and supply designs that work best in their markets and many of our pieces have come to life from the close relationships we have developed with our customers to us being homegrown not only means creating a beautiful local product that sells well in the australasian market but also developing close ties with many small local businesses christine harold director of melbourne brand moore jewels which launched in 2007 echoes that sentiment uniquely developed for the australian and new zealand markets homegrown brands share a deep knowledge and understanding of local consumers as well as a pride and passion for supporting retailers being a local brand we are able to respond to our customers needs quickly she tells jeweller we are completely independent and are therefore able to treat any issues that may arise quickly and always to our customers satisfaction we work together with our manufacturers to produce the best quality product for our local market those same qualities are abundantly evident in brands founded across the ditch new zealand is small and our economy is made up of approximately 85 per cent small and medium enterprises smes many are like us family owned and operated says helen thompson carter director of fabuleux vous which was founded in 2014 having exported for more than 30 years across many industry sectors the one thing i can honestly say is that new zealand is proud of its people its product and its presentation to the world she adds we have a reputation globally for being a leader and having products that the world simply wants there is not only a strong sense of pride there is a camaraderie between business owners and a very special kind of admiration and support for each other nick hoogwerf brand manager of new zealand founded interchangeable jewellery brand kagi adds stocking home grown brands is vital to supporting local businesses customers love and appreciate a home grown success story and are happy to support a brand that offers good quality affordability as well as the ability to mix and match looks for any occasion l to r sapphire dreams kagi foundrae paterson fine jewellery above opal minded above pink kimberley above ikecho australia adapting to change perhaps the most important quality in a business particularly given the rapid pace of change in the retail environment is the owner s ability to adapt quickly shifting gears to meet challenges and increasingly high expectations of customers it s a quality that is embedded in the mentality of new zealanders according to thompson carter kiwis are well known globally for their innovation ability to adapt to change and with a number eight wire approach to things we are proud to be designing and producing beautiful world class products from this little corner of the world she says worth douglas has manufactured its namesake brand of wedding rings since 1953 and also manufactures jewellery brands karen walker lord of the rings and ziro being local allows us to offer flexibility in design take orders in a friendly way and deliver quality products in a timely manner says business development manager chris worth perhaps the most important quality in a business particularly given the rapid pace of change in the retail environment is the owner s ability to adapt quickly in practical terms paul hicks director of ellani collections which has been established in both the australian and new zealand markets since 2008 says local brands have an advantage when it comes to serving evolving consumer tastes being local allows you to react quickly to changing consumer demand for designs materials and price points he explains this allows the retailers representing your brand to be stocking a range with proven sales results and better retail margins harold has a similar perspective one of the benefits to the retailers is that most local suppliers carry stock we certainly do we know the local market and after working in the industry for more than 40 years i m very cognisant of regional variance and try to cater for most areas indeed while the australian and new zealand market shares some similarities with europe the us and the uk homegrown brands have an intimate knowledge of local consumer tastes and shopping behaviours as well as a natural affinity for relevant designs and materials over the past 50 plus years we have worked with many established australian retailers maintaining strong connections with australian businesses and our local community says der bedrossian noting that sams group s brands celebrate the nation s unique natural history in australia we have so many spectacular natural gemstones that we use to create our jewellery and watch designs for instance we were the first to create a single slice australian opal dial for our watches which remains the unique hallmark of classique to this day he explains adds thompson carter local people love a local story to be proud of jewellery can so easily tell a life story and sometimes that starts from where the jewellery came from and the inspiration behind the design homegrown brands also share a geographic advantage being located in similar time zones to their retail stockists and being able to tailor stock to local needs with fewer supply chain disruptions and close existing relationships with retailers homegrown brands were able to communicate and cater to their stockists needs throughout the past 18 months explains moody important economic and social influences are at play things like economy of shipping fast and efficient supply of stock dealing in the same language and currency combined with the ability to make special orders including bespoke designs also influences buying decisions she adds that the importance of doing business with people they know and enjoy dealing with and who understand their business and customer base cannot be underestimated by retailers paterson emphasises the customer service advantage enjoyed by retailers who stock a mix that includes australian and new zealand brands the biggest benefits are retailers can get real time answers on stock availability place custom orders with a fast turnaround and can access local repairs and quick returns plus we have state based agents who come in store to showcase new arrivals and can also take back stock that hasn t worked indeed new zealand brand kagi recently switched to a new australian based distributor pride brands in order to better serve its retailer base we can now offer super fast delivery and support to retailers of our 300 piece range as a result of our partnership with pride brands in australia says hoogwerf we are looking forward to australians again being able to wear and love our product through the convenience of a local distributor we have a great brand and history in both the new zealand and australian markets and now is the time to build upon this solid foundation while many overseas brands have found popularity in the australian and new zealand markets and developed loyal followings others have faltered leaving retailers and consumers disappointed says hicks sometimes what is selling in european markets does not resonate with our consumer base and distributors in our region followed by the retailer have little to no input in the designs for new release products due to the size of our market in comparison to the rest of the world l to r ikecho australia karen walker sapphire dreams ikecho australia above worth douglas above gerrim above couture kingdom pandemic challenges with fewer supply chain disruptions and close existing relationships with retailers homegrown brands were able to communicate and cater to their stockists needs throughout the past 18 months while the covid 19 pandemic raged we are manufacturers as well as wholesalers as a manufacturer we have the benefit of being able to scale up or scale down the business depending on demand paterson explains initially we scaled back production dramatically but once we realised the demand for jewellery was rising and retailers were struggling to attain stock from overseas we were able to scale up to full capacity in the factory as an australian owned business we pride ourselves on our customer service quality and authenticity of our products customer satisfaction and quality workmanship are at the heart of our business david paterson paterson fine jewellery at worth douglas it s been important to us to remain fresh and continue creating and designing so we have released new designs and collections in the past 18 months says worth during lockdowns we have continued to serve by offering marketing support online assets answer quotes and general enquiries and just be there to help where we can to navigate these unchartered territories together with our customers in new zealand fabuleux vous team got up got dressed and got on with it says thompson carter covid 19 gave a new appreciation to being local she continues we reached out to as many of our retailer partners as we could across australia and new zealand and kept in touch we supported them with payment plans so that they still had access to product ramped up our digital presence both business to business and business to consumer and we made sure our retailers had imagery and material to ramp up their digital performance thompson carter added we also brought fresh on trend products to market and we learnt more than anything that cash reserves cash management and conservative business thinking was the saviour a similar strategy was employed at harper rowe which moody describes as a hands on business that rolled with the punches during the pandemic over the years we have built excellent relationships with our customers which has held us in good stead during these turbulent times she explains like many other australian small businesses we needed to think outside of the square not just working differently but working smarter with the explosion in online shopping and the emergence of the lockdown look we launched our at home collection the designs in this collection included pieces which could be worn to complement a casual look or to elevate a professional look while attending online meetings we also focused on designing pieces which evoked sentimental feelings of love and affection for people to send to family members living in other places when individuals cannot see friends and family in person they want to be able to send them personal gifts which express their love at kagi hoogwerf notes the lockdowns have given our customers time to build upon their collection and be more creative in crafting their daily look it s been great to see so many of our customers find unique ways daily to bring out their personality with our interchangeable pieces over the past 50 plus years we have worked with many established australian retailers maintaining strong connections with australian businesses and our local community steve der bedrossian sams group australia he adds we ve seen a surge in demand particularly for our statement earrings everybody is looking to brighten up their look for zoom calls like retailers e commerce was a high priority for homegrown brands the emergence of covid 19 was not a time to panic it was a time to refocus our energies and to pinpoint what we perceived our rapidly changing marketplace was going to be the first thing we did was to put into place the rebuilding of our website to better showcase and streamline our jewellery collections and individual designs says moody sams group australia s digital infrastructure already in place pre pandemic proved a boon for the company according to der bedrossian frequent interstate travel and remote work had always been a big part of the job which enabled us to be digitally prepared many years before the pandemic happened he explains the functionality of our systems with the diversity and flexibility of the working arrangements we have in place ensured a smooth transition for us to work from home he adds once the pandemic hit we were ready to service the public with our online presence especially with the click and collect from your local stockist function i ve always been a big believer in investing into technology even though at the time i did not see the return on this investment it prepared me to face the challenges of the pandemic before it even began similarly pfj made investments into e commerce long before the pandemic and is in the process of launching a new and improved online store with many retailers unable to meet with sales agents the business also introduced a consignment box service for australian and new zealand customers with paterson explaining it s a contactless and covid safe delivery to their door our consignment boxes contain a selection of our latest arrivals and a variety of stock that we can tailor to request upon delivery retailers can review and keep the jewellery pieces they wish to stock we include a free return freight satchel should they wish to return any items to us he adds with nsw victoria the act and auckland beset by further extended lockdowns in 2021 homegrown brands have another benefit an ability to relate to the challenges faced by local retailers boy it s certainly been tough says harold being based in metropolitan melbourne we ve had over 230 days in lockdown during lockdowns we have continued to serve by offering marketing support online assets answer quotes and general enquiries and just be there to help where we can to navigate these unchartered territories together with our customers chris worth worth douglas we don t sell to the public and are therefore reliant on retailers exclusively for sales and it s been a very rough period as our lovely customers are also trying to cope with a greatly reduced cashflow furloughed staff and ongoing overheads and costs to their businesses three years on from the watershed year of 2018 when natural diamond juggernaut de beers introduced lightbox jewelry the lab created diamond category has gone from strength to strength she adds selling trips have had to be cancelled suddenly due to different states or regions being locked down so we haven t seen some of our customers for over a year and the states that have fared better with covid 19 cases have had very patchy tourist numbers resulting in less buying flow through retail ellani s hicks has also observed the uneven nature of the pandemic effect telling jeweller there are currently challenges for retailers in some states with covid 19 restrictions we are seeing states that do not have operating restrictions having strong demand like many in the jewellery industry hicks is optimistic with higher vaccination rates in the coming months we should see less operating restrictions and if the demand in the run towards christmas this year is anything like last year we will see incredibly good results he says this assertion is supported by a recent survey of 3 000 local consumers conducted by the australian retailers association ara in conjunction with market research firm roy morgan the survey found that gift buyers would spend an average of 726 each with 79 per cent of respondents saying they would spend the same or more than they did last year economists have also predicted a wave of revenge spending similar to the post lockdown spending bumps observed in 2020 remarking on the survey s results paul zahra ceo of the ara said the past few months have been a uniquely challenging time for most retailers in particular small businesses navigating extended state imposed lockdowns and restrictions that have limited their ability to trade despite this uncertainty the good news is that consumer sentiment is upbeat for christmas and retailers can look forward to healthy trading conditions over the busy festive season with a bumper season hopefully just around the corner jewellery retailers should consider the benefits of adding homegrown brands to their product mix both for the holidays and beyond going local consumer insights covid19 trends there is no doubt the ongoing covid 19 pandemic has influenced consumer tastes and behaviour to a large degree and to the advantage of homegrown brands there is a new passion to shop local confirms chris worth business development manager at worth douglas while many customers are unable to travel overseas due to border restrictions more are now shopping locally and choose to recognise and support local manufacturers and retailers consumers are also looking for bespoke pieces and want them now without having the long wait to have it made off shore virginia moody director harper rowe observes closed borders have meant that as a nation we are now reflecting inwards a lot more australian brand sentiment is very high at present as is social conscience and awareness of sustainability australians now recognise the importance of ensuring our industries at home are supported so it appears that covid 19 has expanded people s mindsets and that stocking local is an important part of ensuring this mindset endures when borders reopen helen thompson carter director fabuleux vous says local brands offer a point of difference for shoppers there is a famous new zealand tv fisherman who always said fish with your feet first meaning have a look around the waters that surround your feet before you look elsewhere i love this quote and i think it s right on the button for where we are at indeed the commbank consumer insights report published in may 2021 noted that a majority of consumers in eight of the 10 retail categories covered and half the patrons of personal care service providers say that since the pandemic it has become more important to them to have options to buy products manufactured in australia the report s authors also observed another apparent change in priorities uncovered by the research is the desire to support australian online retailers and manufacturers as well as local suburban shopping centres and neighbourhood stores and while covid 19 may have accelerated the online shopping trend analysis by retail media firm shopper recently found 36 per cent of australians spend 80 per cent or more of their discretionary income within 5km of their

if you ve been watching reruns of hgtv s income property and wondering if it s time to buy an investment property and become a landlord you re not alone between a recent jump in inflation historically low interest rates and the mood of millennials to rent instead of own buying rental property has been on an uptick in recent years in fact real estate is now americans favorite long term investment according to a recent bankrate study real estate investing has consistently ranked as one of the top choices since bankrate started the survey in 2012 should you take the plunge on a rental property experts offer a qualified yes provided you do your homework first here are 10 things to consider before diving into an investment property 1 determine if buying an investment rental property is right for you forget the tv sitcom stereotypes of clueless landlords to make the most of income property requires an accountant s eye for detail a lawyer s grasp of landlord tenant laws a fortune teller s foresight and should you choose to manage your rental property yourself a landlord s firm but friendly disposition where people who want to become landlords fall short is they don t realize how much work goes into it says diana george founder of dg design group so before you leap in you ll want to consider whether you have the time willingness and skill to put into managing a rental while rental property is considered a passive investment that doesn t mean you re fully passive in managing it over the long term real estate investments may compare favorably to other long term investments such as stocks but the results can vary significantly depending on the circumstances of the region and specific property you ll want to consider whether you think you can increase rent payments over time and why the economy surrounding the property would support that among other issues whether or not you finance the property and the terms of any financing can have a significant impact on the return you ultimately earn if managing an investment property sounds like too much but you re still interested in real estate you might consider owning a real estate investment trust or a reit reits are publicly traded securities that invest in real estate and typically pay a large percentage of their earnings back to investors in the form of dividends this may be a way to get exposure to real estate investing without the hassle of property management 2 buy or finance analyze which is better for you while some financial pundits insist you should never buy a rental unless you can pay cash for it jeremy kisner a senior wealth adviser at surevest wealth management in phoenix begs to differ leverage that is a mortgage typically magnifies returns on both the upside and downside says kisner who owns two rental properties in las vegas for example imagine a rental property purchased for 100 000 in cash the house yields a rent of 12 000 annually after all expenses such as maintenance and insurance and is taxed at 1 000 with a depreciation schedule of 27 5 years and an income tax rate of 20 percent an investor would earn just over 9 500 in cash annually so the investor s annual cash return is about 9 5 percent not bad here s how the investor using leverage performed assuming the same house this investor has a mortgage for 80 percent of the house which compounds at 4 percent after subtracting the operating expenses as well as additional interest expenses this investor earns almost 5 580 in cash annually with 20 000 invested the investor s annual cash return is about 27 9 percent in fact the situation for the leveraged owner is actually a little bit better than these numbers suggest that s because part of the rent goes to pay down the mortgage s principal so while the investor couldn t pocket the cash flow because it was used to pay the loan the investor still profited and paid tax on that money that s the power of leverage to swing an investor s return george concurs i definitely agree with going conventional mortgage it s a really good way to maximize your dollars if you do decide to finance the purchase keep in mind that you ll need to come up with a larger down payment than what is typically required for a residential mortgage most lenders require a down payment of at least 15 percent for an investment property you ll also need to have enough cash to cover closing costs homeowners insurance property taxes and maintenance issues that come up at the property 3 find the right location that old realtor mantra about the importance of location takes an interesting turn when applied to income property the best locations with the most appreciation are where you ll potentially have the worst cash flow with a rental kisner says why investors can earn a return in two ways cash flow and appreciation in some areas investors may want higher cash flow in order to compensate them for slower appreciation but if investors expect an area to appreciate substantially they may be willing to forgo some of the cash flow in order to enjoy that appreciation the result house appreciation outstrips the growth in rents and houses appreciate while yielding relatively low cash flow as a result the property has to appreciate more in order to compete as an investment with properties in less desirable areas kisner says his solution err on the side of appreciation that s what he s doing with his two rentals which in a good month barely break even but if i hold them until i turn 60 when they re paid off even after property taxes and insurance i ll double my social security income he says 4 success requires a long term outlook the unit kisner has held for 13 years has had two tenants and low maintenance while the other has had three tenants in four years the last one a costly eviction he s taking the same advice he gives his clients the way that people get in trouble with almost all investments is they just don t hold onto things long enough kisner says with rentals if you break even on a cash flow basis that s actually not too bad because you re paying down the principal and building equity that way then you hopefully also see some appreciation so if you re looking to make money in real estate you ll want to think long term as you pay down or eliminate principal over the years you should be able to grow your cash flow 5 make sure you re landlord material if you purchase a rental property should you be your own landlord or fork over 6 10 percent of your rental income to a management service while there s no right answer for everyone george and kisner prefer to subcontract the work they do the background check on your tenant make sure they sign the lease and pay their rent on time george says that frees you up to manage your money not your property and tenants kathy hertzog former president of erie pennsylvania based landlordassociation org says that there s a potentially steep downside to being your own landlord if you get too close to your tenants and the tenants have financial problems you can find yourself stuck because you don t want to evict them she says you have to be very professional about it because if somebody doesn t pay their rent they re stealing from you on top of this issue are you comfortable making the executive decisions that must be made in managing a property will you repair or end up replacing that failing air conditioner or leaky dishwasher you ll need to make the call as to what is the best course of action 6 budget for the unexpected failure to plan for the myriad expenses of owning a rental can become a fast track to disaster as a landlord you want to save about 20 percent to 30 percent of your rental income for upkeep maintenance and emergencies says hertzog you want to make sure you re not just living off that she says because then when something big happens you won t have any money to fix it and now you re stuck because you re a landlord with a property that needs to be repaired quickly and you don t have that money kisner couldn t agree more it s been my experience that you always underestimate all the different expenses that have a way of coming up and always overestimate just how positive the cash flow is going to be he says 7 remember to renew your leases if mom and pop landlords have one glaring blind spot it s the failure to renew tenant leases in a timely manner according to george you d be surprised how many landlords don t renew their leases every year so they re letting their tenants go on month to month leases she says what s wrong with that what s wrong is their whole thinking is that now if i want to get my tenant out i can t because now they re not strapped to a lease also they can t raise rent says george the only way you can change rent is if you have them sign a form changing the lease every year that s how you keep your tenants in check when you let it slide like that it can be really difficult to get your tenants back on track george says depending on the state county and city where the property is located landlords can give notice of eviction for a specified period in california where george is based the state requires landlords to give 60 days notice for tenants who have lived in the property for more than a year or 30 days for less than a year though the situation may be different in rent controlled cities the landlord also might offer a new lease contract at the same time 8 want long term tenants consider section 8 sudden tenant vacancy is the bane of every rental owner each month that a rental stands vacant you re having to pay mortgage utilities and maintenance out of your pocket so turnaround is one of the things you need to address really quickly hertzog says one popular solution give section 8 renters a try section 8 aka the department of housing and urban development s housing choice voucher program typically caps the rent for low income americans who qualify at 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income while some landlords are skeptical of the paperwork and potential upkeep problems presented by some section 8 renters hertzog views section 8 tenants favorably older populations and persons with disabilities are usually excellent tenants they take excellent care of the property because this is their home this is where they want to be plus if they don t pay their rent or ruin your home they risk losing their section 8 voucher she says one downside to section 8 renters is that it may be more difficult to increase rents over time which could impact your ability to offset rising costs with higher rental income 9 don t forget rental property at tax time there s a singular ray of sunshine that beams down upon income property owners each spring as they hunker down with their accountant to prepare their federal income tax return when you have your own home you can write off the interest and that s about it george says but when you own an investment property your schedule e tax form enables you to write off nearly everything under the sun from painting the home to changing the light bulbs so even though you have rental income to report you can show less income than you re actually collecting and write off your mortgage payment and interest while building equity at the same time george says it s that powerful combination of tax benefits and investing returns that helps keep investors interested in rental properties 10 understand how rental law works state and local landlord tenant laws can act like an open manhole cover for rental owners who ignore them according to hertzog case in point is tenant security deposits it s not as simple as collecting and holding the money there is definitely bookkeeping involved you need to have that account for each tenant and keep that money in that account and save it hertzog says security deposit laws govern how much time you have to return a security deposit when tenancy ends less any expenses for cleaning and repair all of which have to be itemized in some states if you don t turn that in the tenant can go after the landlord for double their security deposit for failing to return it within the specified time period she says of course this is only one aspect of the laws surrounding rental property and there are many others that landlords must know in order to avoid running afoul of them you ll want to be familiar with rules around eviction fair housing and other regulatory requirements bottom line rental property can be an excellent investment if you approach it in a business like way but you ll want to understand as much as possible what you re getting into before you lay down your money while the appeal of generating a passive monthly income with real estate is high it s important to remember that it often requires a lot of work to keep that income flowing visit bankrate online at bankrate com

but as a destination for investment tourism sports gastronomy and culture at best i can surmise it was no single thing but a congregation of leadership a clear understanding of the successes and failures in other economies and an agile level of execution that integrated proven technology as necessary in many ways it s the story of most successful businesses and something that dubai multi commodities centre s dmcc management constantly evaluates when assessing companies to work with when it comes to extending value to our growing community while making the free zone more attractive for companies seeking a secure and globally accessible place to conduct business as a centre for trade one of the key facilitators required for our day to day activities is clearing and while the function itself isn t necessarily complicated the evolution of the clearing industry has come a long way since its origins some 300 years ago today the largest clearing houses could be more aptly described as tech driven as opposed to financial particularly since the wider market began to migrate towards digitally based solutions in the early 2000s while not a household name akin to the likes of jeff bezos or elon musk jeff sprecher is indisputably as influential an entrepreneur within the global financial markets as either of the aforementioned in their respective fields having developed intercontinental exchange ice from humble beginnings in 1996 his business has a current market cap of around 66 billion and includes 10 exchanges including the new york stock exchange nyse and six clearing houses as an engineer by education sprecher s approach to expanding his empire through both acquisition of exchanges and infrastructure enablers has allowed him to maintain an objective view of what is good about these markets while getting on with fixing the parts that are broken a philosophy shared by the originator of clearing philip burlamachi born of italian heritage from the exiled descendants of the lucchese francesco burlamacchi in sedan france in 1575 philip burlamachi is most widely known for two things his role as the financial intermediary of king charles i of england and as the first documented proposer for a national clearing bank as a primary lender to the government a financier to the east india company and a representative of the city of london merchants burlamachi understood the importance of liquidity and reliability when it came to settling trades and conceived the notion of a clearing bank to act as an intermediary thereby guaranteeing trades to protect both buyer and seller while functioning as an enduring keeper of financial records unfortunately for burlamachi he was bankrupted by king charles in 1633 who was unable to pay the 70 000 loan extended to him during the anglo french war of 1627 29 however his legacy was ultimately upheld through the establishment of the bank of england in 1694 which functioned as the world s first clearing house precisely fifty years after his death from this point independent clearing houses began to open across europe s trading centres particularly for agri commodities such as grains and coffee however the next step towards a more sophisticated structure occurred at the chicago board of trade cbot where market pressures began to drive the evolution of risk controls not dissimilar from the ones in place today according to governor randall s kroszner the cbot recognised the importance of creating incentives for adherence to its rules including the contractual obligations of counterparties to contracts traded on the exchange initially the primary incentive was the threat that a member that defaulted on its obligations could be barred from the trading floor no doubt this consequence was a powerful incentive for solvent members to meet their obligations but an insolvent member might not have assigned significant value to the loss of trading privileges by 1873 the cbot recognised the importance of evaluating the solvency of its members and adopted a resolution stipulating that any member whose solvency was questioned must open its financial accounts to inspection and could be expelled if it refused to do so around the same time the exchange introduced initial and variation margin requirements for contracts traded on the exchange and set strict time limits for the posting of margin deposits failure to post margin deposits would be considered a default on the member s contracts by 1925 both new york and chicago had established dedicated central clearing houses that became the counterparty to all transactions on their respective exchanges from this stage clearing remained relatively unchanged until the arrival of more sophisticated otc derivatives which required the development of risk management techniques most notably through the 2010 dodd frank act to hedge against defaults and in relatively quick succession the dawn of the digital era and the arrival of ice established and grown almost tangentially with dmcc s timeline sprecher started ice in 1997 having bought a technology start up for 1 in the following three years he and eight colleagues developed the ice trading platform while meeting potential customers to better understand how to support the transition to electronic trading and in so doing designed the technology around their workflow which led to a lot of innovative features in the platform these included pre trade credit limits counterparty credit filters electronic trade confirmation and other features that are commonplace today but these were relatively new concepts then when we launched the company with our completed trading platform in may 2000 we gave it the name intercontinental exchange ice to reflect our ability to cross borders and to serve global markets using our innovative web based technology platform the result of that decision is that today more than 70 countries transact in ice s markets and we ve efficiently scaled our exchange and clearing infrastructure across the uk the netherlands singapore canada and the us equipped with an innovative tried and tested platform sprecher s ability to identify the positive aspects of existing exchanges and how they could be optimised while providing them with a truly global level of access made his offering a win for all concerned in 2001 the international petroleum exchange of london ipe was looking to evolve from floor trading to electronic additionally it was also a regional exchange that offered oil future contracts with less than a 25 per cent share in the global market after acquiring ipe which is today known as ice futures europe the team worked intensely on developing new cleared swap products while building out the electronic futures and options markets which not only moved the london crude oil business from floor to screen trading but expanded the share of traded oil futures transitioning it from regional to global as of 2016 ice futures europe reported 18 consecutive record years of trading activity and continues to serve as a centre for market innovation as well as being the launch pad from which ice clear europe and european credit default swaps cds were launched it is worth noting the former was the first new clearing house in the city of london for over a century from this point ice acquired and developed its offering to create six clearing houses including the new york board of trade nybot in 2006 which is today known as ice clear us and more recently ice clear netherlands for those of you who know me and the direction in which dubai s leadership has been heading you will have connected the dots as to why i m writing about this as a true centre for trade the incorporation of a sophisticated global clearing house that shares our outlook for accessibility and connectivity is not only a missing piece from our current infrastructure but also a value add for our 19 000 member companies and potential business owners seeking to establish a business in country beyond ice s capacity to deliver a highly effective clearing service in conjunction with the globally regulated clearing house dccc for our core commodities including dgcx for currencies metals hydrocarbons and equities and our ever expanding list of dedicated commodity centres including diamonds coffee tea cacao and crypto ice s infrastructure means the opportunity for smes to raise capital by listing without having to engage in the current high market entry points associated with the major exchanges similarly to that of the recently launched nasdaq dubai which was made available earlier this year for companies with a valuation less than 250 million having launched ice future abu dhabi ifad in 2019 with abu dhabi national oil company and nine of the world s largest energy traders ifad laid the foundations for a true oil benchmark in the middle east while launching the world s first murban crude future contract at just 90 minutes down the road it feels as though the timing is right for ice to continue its expansion to dubai and complete what many feel is a missing piece to the puzzle ultimately what makes dmcc unique isn t just its ability to create a globally centralised trade hub but that at one stage or another most if not all of the world s largest corporations have either registered or worked directly with a registered member company because of its ability to anticipate the needs of the market in this sense ice and dmcc have more in common than first meets the eye ahmed bin sulayem is executive chairman and chief executive officer dmcc
paris what if a simple pill could help heal from covid 19 us pharma giants merck and pfizer have announced encouraging results for oral drugs while an anti depressant has also shown promise in what could open up a new chapter in the fight against the pandemic advertisement what are these treatments they are pills taken orally as soon as the first symptoms of covid 19 appear to avoid serious forms of the illness and therefore hospitalization this form of treatment has been sought since the start of the global health crisis after months of research merck and pfizer say they have reached that elusive goal early october merck said it was seeking authorization in the united states for its pill molnupiravir and pfizer followed suit on friday with paxlovid they are both anti virals that act by reducing the virus s ability to replicate slowing down the disease both companies say clinical trials showed a strong reduction in the risk of hospitalization those who took molnupiravir saw that risk diminish by 50 percent and those who took paxlovid by nearly 90 percent although direct comparisons of these efficacy rates should be avoided because of the different study protocols advertisement an anti depressant which is already available to the public fluvoxamine has also shown encouraging results in preventing serious forms of covid 19 according to a study published in october by brazilian researchers in the lancet global health journal why are they important if the efficacy of these drugs is confirmed it will be a major step forward in the fight against covid 19 they would add to vaccines to bolster the world s therapeutic arsenal against the virus treatments already exist mostly in the form of synthetic antibodies but these drugs which usually target those who already have severe forms of the disease are injected and therefore more difficult to administer a pill can be quickly prescribed to a patient who will then take it easily at home merck and pfizer s treatments which so far have not shown many side effects would entail taking around 10 doses over five days the success of these antivirals potentially marks a new era in our ability to prevent the severe consequences of sars cov2 infection british virologist stephen griffin told the science media center what limitations it is difficult so far to properly evaluate merck and pfizer s treatments given both groups have only published statements and have not made the data of their clinical trials available french infectious diseases specialist karine lacombe warned in september that these types of announcements should be treated with caution until the studies can be scrutinized she pointed out that these treatments represent a potentially enormous market for pharmaceutical groups nevertheless some elements indicate that merck and pfizer are not making empty promises for one they both stopped their clinical trials earlier than expected as the results were so strong with the okay of independent monitoring committees where fluvoxamine is concerned the data is available but is not without criticism several researchers have complained that the authors did not just limit themselves to evaluating the frequency of hospitalizations but also assessed the frequency of prolonged emergency room stays this they say complicated the interpretation of data when and how much merck s molnupiravir has already been approved in the united kingdom where health authorities on thursday gave their green light to its use in patients at risk of developing a serious form of the illness such as the elderly obese people or those suffering from diabetes us and eu health authorities are also urgently reviewing the drug the european medicines agency promised on thursday to accelerate proceedings without giving a firm date several countries have already ordered stocks of molnupiravir such as the united states with 1 7 million courses of the drug the us order gives an idea of the steep price of the drug it comes to 1 2 billion which equates to around 700 for a five day course your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up as for pfizer while it has not outlined a price for paxlovid it has promised it will be affordable and subject to a tiered pricing approach based on the income level of countries

time the fort lauderdale international film festival is back this month with its 35th edition offering a unique mix of films in both virtual and in person form that s right not only are most of the features and docs available for streaming in florida through sunday november 22 but most screenings will also be taking place in person at fliff s venues savor cinema and cinema paradiso hollywood with over 200 films set to screen through its run the choices can be overwhelming luckily has a few recommendations to narrow down your choices watchingis not dissimilar to watching someone balancing and spinning numerous plates and waiting until the moment they all come crashing down as riveting as it is anxiety inducing emma seligman s feature debut takes place at a shiva where danielle rachel sennott must navigate every peril that comes with a family gathering if it s not her weight being commented on it s a reminder that she s an unaccomplished student with no post grad plans who just babysits and lives off the money of her deeply neurotic parents polly draper and fred melamed but seligman smartly doesn t limit it to that danielle is also a sugar baby whose daddy just so happens to be a married man danny deferrari with a new baby and a successful wife dianna agron present at the shiva and if that wasn t enough her ex girlfriend maya molly gordon is also in attendance and being celebrated for her law school success while everyone quietly talks around their sexuality every ounce ofis designed to make one dread what comes next while laughing about it its ensemble embodies the exact level of passive aggression one might expect from people who are as uncomfortable around each other as they are invested in their growth though it is sometimes a little too reliant on close ups to emphasize that sense of anxiety and it ties itself up a little too neatly for its own good especially after creating a sticky web of situational humor the film feels like something of an ideal capsule of what it s like to be a queer person unsure of their path in life there s an excitement that comes with ingesting a debut feature that feels like it s coming from a filmmaker with a concrete and unique vision takeshi kushida s exquisiteis one such example a deceptively simple but engrossing tale of a silent photographer hideki nagai and the wounded influencer itsuki otaki who fell out of a tree and into his life much of the wonder ofcomes from its ability to navigate the way photography and identity in particular are inextricably linked in many aspects from eroticism and body horror to subtle drama and offbeat humor kushida s work here is something of a direct descendent to david cronenberg he s just as fascinated with the intersection of technology and the body and explores it by offering as much grotesquerie as beauty nagai and otaki play off each other delightfully one as the silent prey and the other as the talkative predator kushida juxtaposes these performers not only with tchaikovsky sballet suite but with the recurring visual of a praying mantis devouring its meal the soundscape of the film shifts between dead silence and a cacophony of grating noises and the images it presents are constantly being retouched retooled and recreated with characters musing on what the perfect vision of beauty looks like where many contemporary features would instantly damn their figures for indulging in the digital shape shifting that turns them into something they re not kushida instead takes a playful but even handed approach to the allure of tailoring our image to what we believe others want in us just as humanity switches between masks on social media refuses to allow itself to be defined in any concrete way and that s precisely what makes it so exciting the debut feature from suzanne lindon is a quintessential francophone coming of age romance where 16 year old suzanne played by the 20 year old lindon becomes infatuated with raphaël a 35 year old theater actor played by arnaud valois what reads as a provocative premise is treated as a rather chaste romance the age of consent in france is 15 one might imagineenvisioned by sofia coppola or ponder what ifhad been written and directed by mariel hemingway instead of woody allen to explain the allure ofin french fashion suzanne and raphaël are drawn together by a shared sense of ennui with their current lives suzanne is a daydreamer out of touch with her young classmates and raphaël is numb to the repetition of his life in a theater lindon has found the intersection of coming of age and midlife crisis that infused a film such as unlike that previous film the writing seems more attuned to the female perspective this is both the film s strength and weakness as raphaël is underdeveloped as a character and his motivations are cloudy lindon s suzanne joins a long lineage of cinematic gamines her crisp white shirts and faded jeans convey a naturalistic and unpretentious her seemingly ethereal quality is matched with a concrete and grounded understanding of the world and her own situation that make her a compelling character to watch the direction and acting are assured lindon incorporates dance and movement to convey characters states of mind in an unconventional and inspired way to be fair is simple and slight but also enjoyable like a promenade on a parisian street however its portrayal of female adolescent longing outside of a patriarchal structure is quietly revolutionary and makes you fascinated to see what lindon makes next as an actress director or both if you ve ever suffered a trip to the museum with someone who spent the entire time looking at art and saying i could do that thenis the documentary for you this is a dense exploration of duchamp s intellectual philosophy and artistic works that is sometimes to a fault scant on biographical details you may not get the greatest sense of the man behind marcel duchamp but you do get an exhaustive exploration into his mind and its impact on the world in the 20th and 21st centuries director matthew taylor uses an impressive cast of academics curators practicing celebrity artists like jeff koons and marina abramovic and even an out of left field archival interview with david bowie to structure a chronological retrospective into the work of duchamp focused on specific works likeand and particular periods of creation the film interrogates the nexus of practice and thought firmly cements duchamp as the father of conceptual art and a provocateur who consistently questioned what is art from his experiments in painting to mixed media sculpture to readymades and replicas duchamp s work is revealed to be united in the assault on the absolutes and intentionality of aesthetic principles and subjective taste this is directed toward the top of the art history class and may require some additional research but it creates one of duchamp s greatest motivations questioning conventional thinking an amusing tangent that posits duchamp as the father of meme culture through the juxtaposition and recontextualization of image and text that will have you scrolling through your instagram feed in a new light it will most likely inspire a post pandemic trip to the philadelphia museum of art to see its impressive duchamp collection on display the cumbersome title of lili horvát s latest film conveys a sense of uncertainty that makes this noir ish romantic mystery so captivating as if some kind of pared down amalgamation between alfred hitchcock sand a douglas sirk melodrama the film investigates the collision of obsession and perception it is as cerebral as it is desperately passionate and the wounds it opens give a glimpse straight into the artery that connects the brain to the heart the film opens with márta vizy natasa stork a brilliant neurosurgeon returning to hungary from the united states waiting on a bridge the man she is supposed to meet does not appear and she seeks him out after meeting at a medical conference and having a torrid affair that was supposed to culminate in their bridge rendezvous upon seeking him out he says he has never met her and a bewildered marta faints what follows is a journey of obsessive love or at least what our protagonist perceives as love horvát smartly creates an insular world for márta the 35mm film stock lending every empty apartment and lonely hallway a haunting texture every aspect of the film s production down to its costuming and the color palette it offers creates the feeling of existing between fantasy and reality the script frequently forces the audience to question whether or not the woman they re watching is beyond the point of a nervous breakdown or being subtly gaslit what s most captivating aboutis natasa stork s performance the kind of layered role that only an actress of a certain caliber can manage it s as distant as it is inviting with horvát and stork humanizing a character that one could consider unfavorable in their actions and decisions but that navigation of ambiguity is precisely what makes for such a seductive viewing experience

illustration by serge bloch shutdown how covid shook the world s economy by adam tooze viking 2021 crashed adam tooze s seminal 2018 history of the global financial crisis and its aftermath ends with an air of foreboding can we achieve perpetual stability and peace asks tooze a historian at columbia university or must we rely on the balance of terror and the judgment of technicians and generals scarcely a year after the book s publication cases of a strange new respiratory virus began to appear in wuhan china the pandemic has likely killed more than 4 5 million people so far and it has undoubtedly subjected the world s political and economic institutions to the severest of tests and even though covid 19 is not yet done wreaking its havoc tooze has already produced shutdown how covid shook the world s economy an instant history that is essential reading for those trying to understand the past two years there is a certain peril to writing the history of an ongoing crisis time grants perspective and a greater awareness of which developments truly shifted the course of events tooze accepts this and plows ahead reckoning that there is value to sketching out a narrative identifying its key themes and highlighting the big questions raised by the world s initial response to covid 19 the gamble pays off in part because the relentless crush of the news cycle has permitted us little time to process what we ve been through shutdown the year s best business book on economics provides the considered recap we so badly need tooze s narrative is skillfully woven it extracts meaning from major episodes of the crisis even as it provides the reader with rich detail from the ins and outs of political summits to the ups and downs of financial markets shutdown reminds us that not all was well as the pandemic dawned in 2019 global growth slumped badly unrest racked parts of the emerging world while relations between china and the united states remained frosty the initial spread within china of what was then called the wuhan virus sparked global concern mostly because of the size and importance of the country s economy which seemed likely to weaken sharply as the country locked down once it became clear that the disease itself would be a serious global threat spasms engulfed markets including the deep and liquid market for the safest of assets us treasury bonds central banks slow off the blocks in dealing with market panic eventually found the resolve to act boldly and cooperatively policymakers dusted off playbooks written during the global financial crisis and got to work backstopping large segments of financial markets purchasing a huge array of assets and pumping the global economy full of cash tooze dwells on this financial effort because it was both radical and effective but also because it contrasts so sharply with other aspects of the global response the world s central bankers shared an understanding of what needed to be done to prevent a meltdown and strong leadership by the us federal reserve guided policy action that yielded benefits to rich and poor countries alike efforts to shore up real economies to protect the world s vulnerable against economic hardship and to deal with the overarching public health crisis never enjoyed anything like the same competent cooperative action there were glimpses from time to time of what might have been the spring of 2020 was a catastrophic one for europe between the horrible scenes of death and suffering in italy and the renewed fear that financial market havoc might tear the eurozone apart yet after staring into the abyss german chancellor angela merkel gave in to the entreaties of the french italian and spanish governments and agreed for the first time to the issuance of common euro area debt to be used to fund a program of stimulus and reconstruction if the germans were willing to agree to such things perhaps other miracles might also be possible the drive for a vaccine provided a similar view of a better world the trump administration threw billions of dollars at a crash vaccine development program called operation warp speed researchers from around the world collaborated to develop the world s first ever vaccines for a coronavirus in a stunningly short time and yet in the end tooze notes government policy was hamstrung by tightfistedness the international monetary fund its resources having been increased in the years after the global financial crisis did what it could to provide support to beleaguered emerging economies but plans for bolder programs were stymied by a us government in no mood to offer fiscal aid to other countries as vaccines moved closer to approval leaders of the g20 met to discuss how doses might be provided to the emerging world an imf analysis reckoned us 50 billion of spending on vaccine distribution a sum most individual g20 members could easily afford on their own would produce an estimated 9 trillion in economic benefits but when the time came to pony up merkel began the bidding with an offer of 500 million us 587 million a pitifully low contribution other nations were similarly miserly it seems likely now the pandemic s second year will end with most of the population of the emerging world still unvaccinated hanging over the narrative is the question of the evolution of the balance of geopolitical power although the pandemic began in china the year 2020 eventually came to look like the point at which the us officially lost its role as the world s steadying superpower china quickly brought its epidemic under control resumed strong economic growth indeed it was the only major economy to expand in 2020 and provided vaccines to poor countries when the west would not the us on the other hand seemed incapable of limiting the spread of disease or managing its internal conflicts deep racial fault lines were re exposed over the summer of 2020 in the first week of the new year amid a contested presidential succession a mob laid siege to the us capitol while more than 4 000 americans died each day of covid 19 in 2021 the balance has seemed to shift back ever so slightly thanks to a robust economic recovery in the united states yet the two powers relative strength may be less important than the fact of increasing tensions between them in 2020 tooze reminds us the us sought to block the use of chinese technology in its critical infrastructure and to deny the selling of essential technologies to china importantly a change in us leadership has not resulted in de escalation pandemic aside the world seems to be entering a dangerous new era and that above all is the message shutdown seeks to convey to survive this new era in which old orthodoxies have been thrown aside and new rules apply we will have to find a vision and a wisdom that has eluded us these past two years it will not be easy tooze closes his book once again in ominous fashion with the line we ain t seen nothing yet honorable mentions mission economy a moonshot guide to changing capitalism by mariana mazzucato harpercollins 2021 mariana mazzucato has long argued that the great technological leaps of the past owed as much to government encouragement as to entrepreneurial daring in a new book mission economy she says that government can play an important role in tackling the challenges of the present if only we can manage to think pragmatically rather than dogmatically the trick is for government to set clear and ambitious goals much as the united states did when it declared its intention to land people on the moon though the book may not convince ardent free marketers her approach seems to be gaining currency in washington bettering humanomics a new and old approach to economic science by deirdre nansen mccloskey university of chicago press 2021 bettering humanomics is a short book that ought really to be a little shorter but that nonetheless makes a rewarding read for those interested in economics the author deirdre nansen mccloskey is a classicist and economic historian who makes a compelling case that too many economists are doing bad science the assumption that humans are self interested automatons the dull homo economicus allows economists to engage in all sorts of fancy mathematical modeling that produces few real insights about how the world works but she writes only by acknowledging that humans are complicated creatures with rich inner lives and engaging gasp with the humanities and soft social sciences can economists make real progress in understanding big questions such as why some societies are rich and others poor

big bluefin biting again time to dust off the trout gear polaris supreme daughter father anglers riley and josh with their 310 pound bluefin tuna caught at tanner bank dock totals 10 31 11 6 1 776 anglers aboard 100 trips out of san diego landings this past week caught 548 bluefin tuna up to 310 pounds 83 bonito 654 calico bass 408 released 29 dorado 5 lingcod 148 lobster 106 released 11 rock crab 1 438 rockfish 35 sand bass 107 sculpin 154 sheephead 226 skipjack tuna 3 swordfish 406 whitefish 330 yellowfin tuna and 2 332 yellowtail saltwater after a lull in the bite following blustery conditions the bluefin tuna are back at it again on the outer banks west of san clemente island most of the fish caught this past week were between 30 and 80 pounds but there have been several boated that went over 200 pounds one cow 310 pounder hit the deck of the polaris supreme that will surely register high in the memories of the father daughter team that fought it to gaff it took her three laps around the boat but young riley outlasted the massive tuna as well as any seasoned angler could these fish are biting fly lined sardines and vertical jigs with the larger models showing up from sunset into the night sponsored sponsored it is a long 120 mile trip out to the tanner and cortez banks where the big bluefin seem to hang out every fall and into winter so if planning on getting in on the action 1 5 to 3 day trips are the best bet to get some time at the rail for a chance at a trophy tuna as the fish tend to school together in relative size a medium action 30 to 50 pound rig is recommended for the middleweights while a 60 to 100 pound set up is best for the larger units even with the right gear landing a bluefin tuna can be a challenge their migratory pattern begins in the spawning grounds in the western pacific near the nansei islands and the southwestern part of the sea of japan hatching from eggs the young tunas feed there until they reach one year of age or so then they travel across the pacific several thousand miles at about 100 miles per day and spend the next few years feeding off the coast of california and baja until they reach sexual maturity at about 5 years fish that reach maturity return across the pacific to spawn they are one of the most efficient swimmers can dive to 3 000 feet and are endothermic which means they retain the heat they produce as they swim and can handle cooler water than their more tropical cousins yellowfin and skipjack this warm blooded feature allows them to fight longer than most cold blooded fish that can tire relatively easily during a prolonged battle the bluefin tuna we catch off our coast are juveniles to young adults and can weigh as much as 400 pounds a potential california state record 395 pound bluefin was weighed at the san diego marlin club scale this september as they continue to grow and can live up to 30 years pacific bluefin tuna can reach a maximum size of nearly ten feet long and weigh a half ton the world record pacific bluefin tuna caught on rod and reel is 907 pounds and was caught off of new zealand our supercows aren t even halfway there but fighting and landing any bluefin over 200 pounds is a massive feat for anyone closer to home yellowfin skipjack and yellowtail continue to bite well off the coast from the corner at the border outside of mexican waters 12 mile zone and down the coast of baja a few dorado are still making the counts but as the water cools they are the first pelagic species to head back south for warmer tropical climes much of the action is 30 to 50 miles off the baja coast from outside the coronado islands south to the high spots west of ensenada as the bluefin bite has been off and on some 2 and 3 day trips are travelling south targeting yellowfin tuna dorado and yellowtail the first day then make the overnight 12 hour run northwest to tanner bank to finish out their trip for the large bluefin for the local half day fleet calico bass and rockfish are the main targets off point loma the 9 mile bank and la jolla with occasional yellowtail halibut or lingcod making the counts freshwater it s time to dust off the trout

david marshall williams the true history of carbine williams by sam jacobs america loves an outlaw some outlaws simply need to find their calling and david marshall williams is such a man a convicted murderer of a sheriff s deputy no less he turned his prison experience into a tale of personal redemption and revolutionized the field of semi automatic firearms for over a century the misspent youth of david marshall williams williams was one of a whopping 12 children born to james claude williams a wealthy and highly influential landowner inâ cumberland county north carolina his early life is pure americana expelled from school in eighth grade he apprenticed underneath a blacksmith finding this life lacking in adventure he lied about his age and enlisted in theâ united states navy â at 15 he didn t last long as a sailor as the navy quickly sussed out that he was too young for service he enrolled in theâ blackstone military academy â where he was quickly expelled for theft of government property several rifles and over 10 000 rounds of ammunition the enterprising young williams shipped the stocks to his home refusing to return them in 1918 williams married and settled down a little bit he found work as a manual laborer with theâ atlantic coast line railroad however he didn t last long there either he pulled a pistol shot at a bird and succeeded only in earning a pink slip two lives change forever finding that work a day life didn t much suit him williams turned to the booming and lucrative trade of moonshining july 22 1921 would change williams life forever on this day williams still was raided by local authorities under the command of the cumberland county sheriff like many moonshiners simply seeking to earn an honest living during the madness of national prohibition williams defended his property and his livelihood with lethal force while trying to escape â deputy sheriff alfred jackson pate â was shot twice he died at the scene williams curiously chose an insanity defense his first trial for first degree murder ended in a hung jury with one lone holdout maintaining that williams was not fit to stand trial not wanting to stand trial a second time williams copped a plea for second degree murder and narrowly avoided the death penalty it is lucky for firearms enthusiasts that he did the second act of his life is one of both redemption and genius he later admitted to the charge again in court defending one of his black still employees against charges of first degree murder williams received a sentence of 30 years hard labor to be served at theâ caledonia state prison farm â inâ halifax county north carolina but a man possessed of such genius as williams would not be crushed under the weight of such a sentence indeed this is where the coal of williams early life turned into the diamond that would be the rest birth of a gunsmith the prison s superintendent quickly took note of the young williams mechanical aptitude putting him to work not breaking rocks but in the machine shop it was here that williams demonstrated his toolmaking skills fashioning what the prison needed but did not have and could not afford to buy next he began servicing the weapons used by the prison s guards it was here that he began to think about self loading firearms and how he might make them better williams quickly gained the prisoner s ability to scrimp and save seemingly meaningless objects for future use he spent his nights drawing up plans for how he might improve self loading weaponry his mother gifted him a drafting set in addition to sending him paperwork to file for patents when all was said and done williams created four different semi automatic rifles that would revolutionize the field he did this by inventing the floating chamber and the short stroke piston both of which make modern semi automatic weapons possible the technicals details are complicated and more to the point irrelevant the important part is that every semi automatic weapon you own owes everything to two small but significant inventions made by a convicted murderer doing time you can view all of the original carbines handcrafted by williams at theâ north carolina museum of history williams and his talents unchained a massive campaign for clemency was launched by williams family they quickly gained the support of the sheriff williams surrendered to as well as the widow of the man he murdered the campaign was successful in 1927 north carolina governor angus mclean commuted williams sentence to 10 to 20 years on september 29 1929 williams walked free upon release williams was finally able to file for patents on his inventions america s major firearms manufacturers quickly took notice of his designs â colt â was the first company to snap up this still young man who was looking to use his genius to stay on the straight and narrow colt â put williams to work on redesigning theirâ 22 long rifle â training weapon theâ colt ace using his floating chamber williams came up with the colt service model ace williams also invented a conversion kit to transform aâ 45 acp â into aâ 22 rimfire â for training purposes perhaps more impressively the kit could likewise transform a standard colt ace into its new floating chambered version williams stayed at colt for two years before moving on to the u s ordnance department the war department had williams modify theirâ 30 caliber â browning â machine gun to add a floating chamber williams also chambered the weapon for 22s to improve the browning s utility as a training weapon after about four years with the u s ordnance department williams moved on again this time toâ remington remington rejected his design for a 22lr semi automatic rifle but used his floating chamber in the finished product of two other designers k lowe and c c loomis as a result the remington 550 hit the market in 1941 by this time williams reputation had come to precede him and in 1939 â winchester repeating arms â came knocking on his door he would remain withâ winchester â for the rest of his career winchester wanted to create a superior version of theâ m1 garand rifle the result was the g30r which later served as the basis of the winchester model 30 a commercial version chambered forâ 30 30 the prickly williams came into conflict with management and other winchester employees during the development of a prototype for the united states military s newest light carbine winchester allowed him to work on his own prototype which was not completed in time for trials photographs of his prototype can be viewed at theâ springfield armory museum â and the cody firearms museum at the buffalo bill historical center in cody wyoming hollywood fame for carbine williams after the war williams continued to work for winchester but hollywood had also taken an interest â carbine williams â was released in 1952 starring james stewart in the title role now williams would transition into the final phase of his life as a celebrity upon the film s release he began touring the nation making appearances and signing autographs and enjoying his newly found fame now david marshall williams was a household name under his new moniker carbine williams a name he would self apply for the rest of his days old age was not kind to carbine williams years of hard living had taken their toll and he had a number of health problems during his retirement he mostly stayed at home with his family donating his personal collection and workshop to the north carolina museum of history an exhibit dedicated to the life and work of williams debuted on june 22 1971 in 1972 david marshall williams moved to dorothea dix hospital in raleigh north carolina he would remain here for the rest of his days eventually passing away from cardiorespiratory arrest in 1975 you canâ go visit him â at the old bluff presbyterian church outside of wade north carolina williams innovations revolutionized the world of firearms forever a gift to the second amendment community we still hold and treasure today but more than this williams is a tale of one man s redemption through finding his purpose in life while always rough around the edges it is worth noting how all of williams legal troubles ended the second he found his purpose in gunsmithing while none of us are likely revolutionizing firearms for over a century anytime soon we can all take a bit of inspiration from williams transformation from roustabout and troublemaker to titan in his field sam jacobs is a writer forâ ammo com â where this
