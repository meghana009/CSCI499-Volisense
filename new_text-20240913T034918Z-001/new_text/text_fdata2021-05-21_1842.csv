it s been a rocky ride for investors in cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin the best known of these virtual assets is down nearly 40 since hitting a record of just under 65 000 in mid april so what s

schwab it was hard not to notice how much money was being funneled into the digital currencies it just feeds on itself she says so what s happening now as it turns out cryptocurrencies are not insulated from what has been a wider sell off in markets the stock market has been hit hard since last week as a surge in consumer prices sparked concerns about inflation investors are worried that

virtual assets will drop in value too in that sense moya argues it s not like gold widely seen as the ultimate hedge against inflation what about regulations that s another factor hitting cryptocurrencies many virtual currency adherents are deeply skeptical of the role governments and central banks play in the financial system the irony is that as investments in bitcoin and other assets become more widespread they will attract more regulatory scrutiny the treasury department on thursday announced that it would require businesses that undertake transfers of at least 10 000 worth of cryptocurrencies to report those to the irs gary gensler the new chairman of the securities and exchange commission has made it clear digital currencies are something his agency will focus on and this week china s central bank banned financial institutions from taking part in any transactions made up of cryptocurrencies and what about musk musk has become closely associated with bitcoin

in the virtual asset but musk stunned investors by announcing this month that tesla would stop accepting payments in bitcoin because of concerns about the impact on the environment in so doing he

the latest fomc minutes were dovish especially in light of the recent increase in inflation and elevated asset valuations what does it mean for yesterday the fomc published minutes from its last meeting in april they ve shown two things doing that first that some of the central bankers are worried about the inflation and elevated asset valuations and second that the fed is going to remain dovish despite all these concerns indeed some fomc participants noted that the demand for labor had started to put some upward pressure on wages moreover a number of them pointed out the protracted supply disruptions and the insufficient pre emptive hawkish reaction from the fed as potentially inflationary factors a number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and if so these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year they noted that in some industries supply chain disruptions appeared to be more persistent than originally anticipated and reportedly had led to higher input costs a couple of participants commented on the risks of inflation pressures building up to unwelcome levels before they become sufficiently evident to induce a policy reaction when it comes to financial stability and asset valuations several fomc members pointed out elevated risk appetite and very low credit spreads and certain participants noted dangers related to the low interest rates and excessive risk taking if the risk appetite fades the asset prices could decline with potentially harmful consequences for the financial sector and the economy regarding asset valuations several participants noted that risk appetite in capital markets was elevated as equity valuations had risen further ipo activity remained high and risk spreads on corporate bonds were at the bottom of their historical distribution a couple of participants remarked that should investor risk appetite fall an associated drop in asset prices coupled with high business and financial leverage could have adverse implications for the real economy a number of participants commented on valuation pressures being somewhat elevated in the housing market some participants mentioned the potential risks to the financial system stemming from the activities of hedge funds and other leveraged investors commenting on the limited visibility into the activities of these entities or on the prudential risk management practices of dealers prime brokerage businesses some participants highlighted potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the financial system including run prone investment funds in short term funding and credit markets various participants commented on the prolonged period of low interest rates and highly accommodative financial market conditions and the possibility for these conditions to lead to reach for yield behavior that could raise financial stability risks so given all these concerns about financial stability and higher inflation the fed should send some hawkish signals right not at all on the contrary the u s central bank reiterated its ultra dovish stance justifying that the economy was far from achieving full employment participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months job gains in the march employment report were strong and the unemployment rate fell to 6 0 even so participants judged that the economy was far from achieving the committee s broad based and inclusive maximum employment goal payroll employment was 8 4 million jobs below its pre pandemic level some participants noted that the labor market recovery continued to be uneven across demographic and income groups and across sectors after all higher inflation would only be transitory and when these short term factors fade inflation will decrease in their comments about inflation participants anticipated that inflation as measured by the 12 month change of the pce price index would move above 2 percent in the near term as very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation in addition increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices participants also noted that the expected surge in demand as the economy reopens further along with some transitory supply chain bottlenecks would contribute to pce price inflation temporarily running somewhat above 2 after the transitory effects of these factors fade participants generally expected measured inflation to ease looking further ahead participants expected inflation to be at levels consistent with achieving the committee s objectives over time despite the expected short run fluctuations in measured inflation many participants commented that various measures of longer term inflation expectations remained well anchored at levels broadly consistent with achieving the committee s longer run goals yeah sure but why should we believe the fed if it was surprised by the readings in april it anticipated inflation moving above 2 and meanwhile the cpi inflation surged above 4 as the chart below shows but at least inflation expectations remain well anchored don t they well not exactly as the chart below shows the market based expectations of inflation have significantly risen recently similarly the university of michigan s index that measures inflation expectations for the next five years rose from 2 7 in april to 3 1 in may it s the highest level in a decade interestingly even the fed staff doesn t believe in transitory inflation after all they forecast that the actual gdp would be above its potential until 2022 2023 with the boost to growth from continued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021 gdp growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023 however with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative the staff continued to anticipate that real gdp growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels economics 101 teaches us that when the economy operates above its potential it implies overheating and inflation that reflects more fundamental or lasting factors than base effects and short term supply disruptions implications for gold what do the recent fomc minutes imply for gold well the fed remaining dovish despite all the inflationary risks and elevated asset valuations many assets plunged yesterday especially cryptocurrencies is bullish for gold sure a few members became ready to start talking about tapering the quantitative easing and tightening the monetary policy a number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the policy setting committee s goals it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases however a number is not the majority so we shouldn t expect such a discussion in the mainstream anytime soon especially in light of the disappointing april nonfarm payrolls and recent declines in the stock market the price of gold rose yesterday approaching 1 900 it might have been due to the fomc minutes but also the sell off in cryptocurrencies and the following outflow of money from them into old good gold given these shifts in the marketplace it seems that fed s worries about fading risk appetite were justified if risk appetite wanes further gold should shine as a safe haven asset
it s been a rocky ride for investors in cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin the best known of these virtual assets is down nearly 40 since hitting a record of just under 65 000 in mid april so what s happening there are a handful of reasons why the value of digital currencies is plunging there is the sell off we are seeing on wall street over inflation fears that s spilling over there is also concern that regulators around the world including in the united states will crack down on these virtual assets and then there s tesla ceo elon musk whose comments continue to move cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin but perhaps the biggest reason is the simplest of them all these are risky and volatile investments and that s how they are behaving remember bitcoin is a young asset it has only been around for 13 years and you used to be able to buy it for a few bucks here s a closer look at cryptocurrencies wild ride weren t we just talking about a boom in bitcoin yes until recently we were during the pandemic novice and traditional investors started buying digital currencies in droves a case in point over a year ago bitcoin was trading at under 7 000 and then went on to peak at near 65 000 last month the same excitement that led amateur traders in robinhood s app to buy gamestop s shares fueled the frenzy over cryptocurrencies for months people were stuck at home with time on their hands and for a while at least it seemed like it was a sure thing prices kept going up and up ed moya senior market analyst at oanda called bitcoin an easy trade with a one way move over the last year many large institutional investors also started to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios and that gave them some added legitimacy according to liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab it was hard not to notice how much money was being funneled into the digital currencies it just feeds on itself she says so what s happening now as it turns out cryptocurrencies are not insulated from what has been a wider sell off in markets the stock market has been hit hard since last week as a surge in consumer prices sparked concerns about inflation investors are worried that prices will continue to rise and that the federal reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected but wasn t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation that was the argument by bitcoin enthusiasts though many analysts do not think that s actually the case moya from oanda notes that cryptocurrencies remain a speculative asset and when there is a market sell off bitcoin and fellow virtual assets will drop in value too in that sense moya argues it s not like gold widely seen as the ultimate hedge against inflation what about regulations that s another factor hitting cryptocurrencies many virtual currency adherents are deeply skeptical of the role governments and central banks play in the financial system the irony is that as investments in bitcoin and other assets become more widespread they will attract more regulatory scrutiny the treasury department on thursday announced that it would require businesses that undertake transfers of at least 10 000 worth of cryptocurrencies to report those to the irs gary gensler the new chairman of the securities and exchange commission has made it clear digital currencies are something his agency will focus on and this week china s central bank banned financial institutions from taking part in any transactions made up of cryptocurrencies and what about musk musk has become closely associated with bitcoin and other virtual currencies for example the billionaire promoted a virtual currency called dogecoin which started off as a joke that sparked a surge in prices but the currency then crashed after musk referred to it as a hustle when he hosted saturday night live this month but musk has been most closely associated with bitcoin he has been the biggest cheerleader for bitcoin moya says the market is still sensitive to these influencers musk sparked a rally in bitcoin after he announced in february that his car company tesla had bought 1 5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it would accept payments in the virtual asset but musk stunned investors by announcing this month that tesla would stop accepting payments in bitcoin because of concerns about the impact on the environment in so doing he brought attention to something that has dogged digital currencies since their inception that they require a lot of energy to mine so what about those environmental concerns the environmental impact is big uncovering bitcoin or mining involves big computers working to solve very complex math formulas yes it s complicated that requires enormous power and it s often done in countries such as china that rely on dirtier energy sources like coal researchers at the university of cambridge in the united kingdom for example estimated that mining for bitcoin consumes more energy annually than the whole of argentina several of bitcoin s competitors see this as a way to differentiate themselves from the digital currency and they are playing up their more environmentally friendly bona fides so finally what s the big takeaway a simple one that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are incredibly volatile investments it can go through head spinning rallies that are then followed by equally head spinning crashes sometimes in a single day markets experienced this firsthand on wednesday in the morning bitcoin fell over 30 only to turn around and surge more than 30 in the afternoon that s why most analysts caution amateur investors against cryptocurrencies though they say the assets can make sense if held as long term investments or for professional investors it s too volatile for most investors moya from oanda says but i think for longer term investors depending on when you got in you still might feel calm confident in your investment copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

still sensitive to these influencers musk sparked a rally in bitcoin after he announced in february that his car company tesla had bought 1 5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it would accept payments in the virtual asset but musk stunned investors by announcing this month that tesla would stop accepting payments in bitcoin because of concerns about the impact on the environment in so doing he brought attention to something that has dogged digital currencies since their inception that they require a lot of energy to mine so what about those environmental concerns the environmental impact is big uncovering bitcoin or mining involves big computers working to solve very complex math formulas yes it s complicated that requires enormous power and it s often done in countries such as china that rely on dirtier energy sources like coal researchers at the university of cambridge in the united kingdom for example estimated that mining for bitcoin consumes more energy annually than the whole of argentina several of bitcoin s competitors see this as a way to differentiate themselves from the digital currency and they are playing up their more environmentally friendly bona fides so finally what s the big takeaway a simple one that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are incredibly volatile investments it can go through head spinning rallies that are then followed by equally head spinning crashes sometimes in a single day markets experienced this firsthand on wednesday in the morning bitcoin fell over 30 only to turn around and surge more than 30 in the afternoon that s why most analysts caution amateur investors against cryptocurrencies though they say the assets can make sense if held as long term investments or for professional investors it s too volatile for most investors moya from oanda says but i think for longer term investors depending on when you got in you still might feel calm confident in your investment copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

canada has secured but will not need the humanitarian ngo noted the federal government has signed bilateral deals with vaccine makers to meet the country s needs five times over covax is short of

particular experience with covid the majority of the funding that went for finding this vaccine in the first place came from public funding conclusion it could be 2023 before much of the developing

researchers and financial market participants have long debated the origins of large stock market moves this goes back at least to keynes 1936 who argued that stock prices reflect investor expectations about the views of other investors rather than fundamentals later work by niederhoffer 1971 and cutler et al 1989 finds that many large stock market moves seem untethered to news about fundamental developments more recently von beschwitz et al 2015 show that journalistic sentiment matters for stock market behaviour above and beyond the information about fundamentals contained in news stories the many studies that focus on the role of government policy in driving stock market movements include bloom 2008 kelly et al 2014 breinlich et al 2018 and baker et al 2019 2020 coding the causes of stock market jumps in a recent paper baker et al 2021 we examine the proximate drivers of large daily stock market moves greatly expanding the scale and scope of earlier work we consider all daily us market moves of 2 5 or more up or down since 1900 yielding nearly 1 200 jumps we then systematically review next day articles about each jump in the wall street journal new york times los angeles times and other major newspapers to characterise each jump taking a similar approach we examine more than 5 000 jumps in national stock markets for 15 other countries and several hundred jumps in us and uk bond markets we use human readers to identify the primary reason for each jump according to the next day newspaper article and to classify that reason into one of 17 categories our readers also record the geographic origin of the market moving news which could be a country multiple countries or region of the world the readers receive training and pass a test before coding newspaper articles we meet with them frequently and supply a 150 page coding guide to serve as a reference manual for journalists observing the market in real time attribution to a clear causal trigger is easy for some jumps and hard for others to illustrate this point figure 1 plots intraday market values at one minute increments on four days with large jumps in the us market the top two panels depict sharp intraday moves that immediately follow the arrival of important economic news a surprise interest rate cut by the fed in the top left panel and a bad bls employment situation report in the top right the two lower panels show days that feature large jumps for no apparent reason a lack of clarity that is reflected in next day news accounts figure 1 intra day moves often but not always point to the jump reason notes each panel plots the s p 500 index at one minute intervals from market open to close on the indicated date the top two panels also report the specific event that according to newspaper accounts triggered the jump figure 2 reports the resulting distribution of us stock market jumps over our 17 policy and non policy categories policy categories pertain to factors controlled by the government e g tax policy monetary policy regulation and national security actions non policy categories include corporate earnings and macroeconomic news and outlook which is the most prevalent category of jumps for the us and other countries figure 2 distribution of jump reasons by era and category notes the horizontal axis units are the percent of jumps attributed to that category in the indicated period we order categories as follows i policy categories by descending values of 1946 2020 share ii non policy categories ordered the same way and iii unknown no explanation offered this figure uses next day articles in the wall street journal as the us economy developed the distribution of jumps over categories shifted for example the share of jumps attributed to news about commodities is much larger from 1900 to 1945 than from 1946 to 2020 which reflects a transition away from an agriculturally oriented economy the share of jumps attributed to monetary policy and central banking is greater in the post war period probably because the federal reserve has taken a more active role in stabilising economic fluctuations the share of jumps attributed to macroeconomic news also rose over time we think this pattern reflects improvements in the accuracy depth and timeliness of economic statistics see baker et al 2021 for a discussion of these developments there are also major differences in the jump by reason distribution across asset classes macroeconomic news and monetary policy account for a much larger share of jumps in bond markets than in equity markets it is natural to ask whether newspaper articles capture what really happened perhaps journalists simply pick a salient piece of news and rationalise its supposed impact danielsson 2018 while there is no authoritative source on what truly caused each market jump we perform several exercises that confirm the information value of our newspaper based classifications in one set of exercises we relate our jump classifications to information release events with known timing and content we find that jumps are more likely to be classified as macroeconomic news on release dates for employment and inflation reports more likely to be classified as monetary policy on fomc announcement dates and more likely to be classified as elections on the day after national elections the distinctive character of policy driven jumps our examination of stock market jumps uncovers several striking patterns for instance policy news mainly associated with monetary policy and government spending triggers a greater share of upward than downward jumps in all 16 countries that we cover figure 3 illustrates this result for the us from 1946 to 2020 the fraction of upward jumps triggered by policy related news is twice the fraction of downward jumps triggered by policy news the figure also highlights a related pattern the larger the upward jump the greater the likelihood that policy news drove it this pattern is stronger in recent decades as seen by comparing the left and right panels of figure 3 figure 3 policy news triggers a larger share of upward jumps especially since 1980 notes each plot is a binscatter n 20 of jump level policy scores against jump day stock returns where the policy score is the fraction of the codings for that jump attributed to policy related news one potential explanation for these patterns is that expansionary monetary and fiscal policy actions are more likely in the wake of bad economic news or poor macroeconomic performance our evidence supports this hypothesis in particular the share of upward jumps attributed to policy news rises as stock market performance worsens over the preceding three months in addition the share of downward jumps attributed to policy falls as recent stock market performance worsens this pattern of countercyclicality in jump inducing policy surprises is much stronger after wwii than before jumps triggered by monetary policy are also highly distinctive in another respect specifically they foreshadow lower levels of future stock market volatility than other jumps this effect is large volatility in the two weeks after a monetary policy jump is nearly one standard deviation lower than after other jumps even conditional on a battery of controls for jump size jump direction and past volatility one interpretation is that market moving news about monetary policy tends to resolve uncertainty for example the outcome of an fomc meeting may resolve uncertainty about whether the fed will ease or tighten monetary policy in contrast it appears that most other jump inducing news developments accentuate uncertainty and near term volatility the extraordinary role of us news in equity markets around the world the us dollar and fed monetary policy play an exceptional role in the international monetary and financial system e g frankel 2013 obstfeld 2015 boz et al 2017 maggiori et al 2019 gopinath and stein 2021 we show that news about us related economic and policy developments also plays an extraordinary role in stock market jumps around the world to make this point figure 4 considers stock market jumps for ten countries outside europe and the us the figure plots the yearly share of jumps that next day newspaper accounts attribute at least partly to developments that originate in or relate to the us remarkably leading newspapers in these third party countries attribute one third of the jumps in their own national stock markets to us related developments the same result holds if we expand the sample to include european countries figure 4 us news triggers a strikingly large share of stock market jumps in other countries notes this figure shows the yearly share of daily stock market jumps in australia canada china hk china shanghai japan new zealand saudi arabia singapore south africa and south korea that leading own country newspapers attribute to news about the us and europe dot size is proportional to the average number of jumps per country in that year news relating to europe including the ecb and other pan european institutions plays a far more modest role as a driver of stock market jumps in third party countries even though europe accounts for a greater share of global output since 1980 newspaper accounts attributed only 5 5 of stock market jumps in our third party countries to european related developments in this respect our results reinforce and deepen the results in ehrmann et al 2011 who find that spillovers from us bond equity and money markets to european financial markets are much larger than the other way around concluding remarks we extract information about the drivers of large daily jumps in national stock markets as reported in next day newspaper accounts while our jump days make up only 3 5 of all trading days they account for nearly half of squared daily return variation we find that policy driven jumps exhibit striking and distinctive patterns for instance policy news triggers a greater share of upward than downward jumps in all countries that we cover jumps attributed to monetary policy foreshadow much lower levels of future stock market volatility than other jumps we also find that leading newspapers attribute one third of jumps in their own national stock markets to developments that originate in or relate to the us the us role in this regard dwarfs that of europe and china references baker s r n bloom s j davis and k kost 2019 policy news and stock market volatility nber

after decades of incremental steps by congress to address national infrastructure needs the biden administration recently unveiled a 32 page 2 3 trillion plan that combines federal spending on traditional physical infrastructure with federal spending on workforce training and education research and development of new technologies as well as affordable housing senate republicans countered with a 2 page 568 billion plan that targets a narrower subset of physical infrastructure and does not include the broader elements of the biden plan negotiations are underway between the white house and congress about the scope of investment and the means of paying for it but the first bridge that negotiators may need to build could be across the chasm of differing ambition reaching a compromise on a spending level would be a significant accomplishment in and of itself but it may not be enough to ensure that the spending will produce results as intended congress and the administration will still have miles to go in thinking through large and consequential decisions how will projects be selected and implemented by whom will projects be paid for using existing mechanisms for funding and financing infrastructure or using newly created federal grant programs federal funds are not typically the main source of funding for infrastructure for example most transportation and water infrastructure decisions in the u s are actually made by state and local governments they set their own priorities and are responsible for the vast majority of costs of operation and maintenance o m of infrastructure once built providing a powerful incentive to not overbuild state and local governments accounted for 59 percent of capital spending and 90 percent of o m spending for transportation and water infrastructure in 2017 drawing on their own revenue base and borrowing capacity in the municipal bond market other infrastructure systems such as the electric power grid high speed broadband and freight rail are predominantly owned and operated by private firms who decide when and where to build and maintain their systems although most decisions about individual public projects happen at the state and local level congress can influence these decisions in many ways including through the proposed plans to target additional federal funding to specific aspects of u s infrastructure after a compromise has been reached about how much to spend congress will then need to decide how much of the proposed new funding will be pushed through existing federal programs and whether new rules and new programs will be necessary as one example under current law states receive an allocation of funding from the federal highway trust fund which they in turn apply to their priority list of highway and mass transit projects additional spending targeted at highways and mass transit projects would presumably flow through the existing federal highway program using general revenues unless the gas tax is raised or new fees generated through some other means conversely the federal government has been out of the business of major grantmaking for wastewater treatment plants for more than 30 years now and was never involved in funding local drinking water systems except for small rural communities epa would be the logical lead agency for managing new federal support for these systems but new staff and systems would need to be in place to administer big new programs hud s program for community development block grants possibly could be used as the funding mechanism but this would represent a major expansion of its responsibilities and require an expanded and trained workforce to oversee the distribution of funding finally congress will need to decide whether states and local authorities should put up funds of their own to gain access to the new federal dollars for example states are now required to provide 10 percent of the costs of most highway road and bridge projects cost sharing requirements help ensure funds are not wasted on projects that state and local governments do not feel are worthwhile however communities that may be most in need of the funding may not have sufficient resources to provide matching funds the same may be said for standard benefit cost analysis that implicitly places more weight on high value economic development than development in underserved communities with fewer physical assets of value achieving economic and racial equity in the distribution of new infrastructure funds without wasting funds on projects that do not achieve their intended objectives may require re thinking prevailing federal funding formulas and project selection criteria other questions remain about the timing of decisions and the timing of implementation largely centered on constraints in the construction workforce from engineers to laborers and the administrative capacities of states and local governments to plan design manage and oversee such a massive infusion of new capital the private sector is already struggling to hire new employees despite undesirably high unemployment rates in some areas and sectors widespread hiring demand from local and state governments might exacerbate that challenge how congress fills in the blanks of new federal spending could have a profound effect on state and local capital spending for years to come no one really knows how this unprecedented level of direct federal spending could upend state and local governments current patterns of financing and funding public infrastructure however one thing is certain change will only be possible with a transformational investment strategy debra knopman is a principal researcher at the nonprofit nonpartisan rand corporation benjamin miller is an economist at the rand corporation both are professors at the pardee rand graduate school

lewiston a plan that s been years in the making to reshape housing in the city was given the greenlight thursday after a multiyear process to plan and submit its application and later becoming a finalist lewiston will receive a 30 million grant from the u s department of housing and urban development to overhaul public housing and inject additional private investment into the tree streets neighborhood the announcement thursday came first from u s sen susan collins who earlier this year sent a letter to hud in support of lewiston s application u s sen angus king and congressman jared golden of lewiston who also sent letters of support later released a joint statement lewiston will be the first city of its size to receive both the choice neighborhoods planning and implementation grants making the announcement seem surreal to those who have been working on the grant application since 2018 misty parker lewiston economic development manager who has worked closely on the grant said staff was still processing this very exciting news on thursday in a small city like ours each dollar goes further in improving the lives of people who live and work in our community and this grant is going to result in over 100 million in private investment in our city so it s a significant achievement for us that we re just thrilled about parker said advertisement the city s application known as the transformation plan details a comprehensive effort to redevelop a significant swath of public housing in a downtown tree streets neighborhood that includes two of maine s poorest census tracts along with the state s highest concentration of childhood lead poisoning the proposal includes a 66 unit mixed use development on pine street along kennedy park and a 64 unit family oriented redevelopment along pine and bartlett streets a third site will redevelop housing on ash street but the plan also calls for expanded programs related to education workforce development health care and other resources to help families break cycles of poverty in all the project will redevelop and construct 185 mixed income units on three sites that will be controlled by the lewiston housing authority the funding will be transformative for our community mayor mark cayer said i m hoping it will stabilize our housing market both in the public and private sector reduce childhood lead poisoning and improve our overall community well being parker said lewiston s success in getting the grant is a testament to the work the community has done to develop such a comprehensive transformation plan the plan was drafted after a lengthy community led effort with several neighborhood residents involved in the healthy neighborhoods planning council working to engage their neighbors advertisement a group of neighborhood residents were celebrating the news thursday at an impromptu gathering at the pop up garden park on bartlett street ashley medina who served on the planning council told the sun journal the grant means everything medina grew up in the neighborhood and saw the consequences of lewiston s poor housing stock firsthand when her home burned in 2013 to see this happen and to see everybody s hard work manifest itself it s just everything she said craig saddlemire coordinator of raise op housing cooperative said the grant award is validation for all the hard work the neighborhood has done to make the transformation plan to assert a vision that s inclusive of the residents he said it shows a path forward for trying to improve housing conditions in the neighborhood lynnea hawkins healthy neighborhoods network coordinator and lewiston school committee member said the grant means we can finally start bringing our city back to where we want it to be she said that means a city with housing people want to live in and a neighborhood that people want to be out and about in advertisement parker said the community worked hard to submit a competitive proposal that would instill confidence with hud of our ability to do transformative redevelopment work the city s joint application with the lewiston housing authority was a finalist among applications from detroit michigan cleveland ohio camden new jersey and fort myers florida parker said once the city signs off on the grant agreement with hud the city and its stakeholders will work to establish detailed work plans actual construction could still be two years or more away she said while 70 of the funding is earmarked for the three redevelopment sites parker said the projects will still require financing that job will fall on the lewiston housing authority and its development partner avesta housing collins said thursday that she spoke directly with hud leaders about the monumental impact the project will have on the health safety and overall well being of mainers in 2019 she hosted then hud secretary ben carson in lewiston where they spoke with stakeholders about how the choice neighborhoods grant program could revitalize the neighborhood advertisement this 30 million project will transform a neighborhood with the highest concentration of childhood lead poisoning and families in poverty and maine s lowest performing schools into a lead free economically diverse and welcoming community she said the statement from king and golden said with this substantial investment from the federal government we can turn that plan into a reality that will remove dangerous lead hazards from housing address crime and improve health broadband access and educational opportunities for everyone living in lewiston later on thursday gov janet mills issued a statement congratulating lewiston the governor said she walked the tree streets neighborhood with cayer and other city officials earlier this week they told me about how hard the city and its people have been working to revitalize the neighborhood and ensure that all who call it home have a bright future defined by good schools safe housing and economic opportunity she said with this transformative federal funding in hand and with their hard work and ingenuity that future is on the horizon in 2019 grants were awarded to forth worth texas los angeles california philadelphia pennsylvania and winston salem north carolina the smallest city among the grantees winston salem with a population around 250 000 is still about five times larger than lewiston since the program was launched in 2009 the smallest city to receive an implementation grant is newport news virginia in 2018 the city has a population of about 180 000 being the first small city to receive something like this we have a lot to learn parker said i expect the next few months we ll be really getting everything in order to get this important work started send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
sir the transport secretary has told us to use common sense when considering booking overseas holidays but do we find that common sense in the government s policies the current arrangement risks precipitating the collapse of my industry the public and airlines need to start acting independently and applying individual and corporate risk assessments regardless of the confused messages coming from politicians airlines have lost billions and are burdened with crippling debt the mediterranean economies are on their knees and many destinations will simply not survive another cancelled summer this will mean destitution for the millions who can only dream of a multibillion pound furlough scheme the risk to the uk from vaccinated and or tested individuals travelling abroad is not zero but it is minimal the traffic light system is being overseen by a coterie of risk averse economically cocooned scientists and politicians who fear future opprobrium more than financial catastrophe for a critical industry captain al matthews cheltenham gloucestershire sir my wife and i are uk citizens in the united arab emirates currently on the red list we are both fully vaccinated are regularly tested and have not left the country in months the uae is the second most vaccinated country in the world with lower infection and mortality rates than the uk the reason for leaving it on the red list is that it is a travel hub but what does the government think frankfurt or charles de gaulle airports are why can t we return to the uk and quarantine at home mike de meyer dubai united arab emirates great british railways sir does british rail coming back under a new name report may 20 signal a return to those long gone days when trains were prompt and efficient and our services were the envy of

waiting lists sir the nhs continues to prove itself to be an organisation without a memory many years ago the nhs modernisation agency did a lot of sensible research into management of waiting lists it concluded that if you prioritised patients as urgent soon and routine then the routine patients would never be seen at all unless they got worse while waiting and changed categories this is why day case beds are ring fenced and segregated from the main body of hospital beds because otherwise no day case surgery ever gets done as the beds fill up with overspill from other wards we can discuss the level of service provision generally but we cannot change the number of skilled staff in the short term for now we need to manage the list of priority cases separately from the routine but continue to tend to both or we will find ourselves back where we were in the 1980s when patients needing non urgent surgery routinely died during the years they waited for treatment dr jenny jessop doncaster south yorkshire new kind of news sir like allister heath gb news will smash the bbc s biased left wing broadcasting hegemony comment may 20 i look forward to the launch of gb news as well as providing a more balanced view of the news than the current channels it also means we will see more of andrew neil on television there is no better political interviewer i just hope that our politicians find their way to the new channel to be questioned roger gentry weavering kent wine minefield sir the new normal is with us at last and we may look forward to the resumption of familiar social habits not least the dinner party this would surely be a good opportunity to discard the custom of wine swapping typically each guest arrives clutching a decorated gift bag containing a bottle of wine this puts the host in a quandary should they serve the wine and let the donor take the blame for a bad choice the host may have gone to some trouble to choose a wine to complement the menu so they put the bottle aside with grateful thanks and make a mental note to take it with them to the next dinner invitation this runs the risk of absent mindedly returning the bottle to the giver best to end the practice now and leave the host in charge donald mcintyre chester learning the law sir geraldine wills letters may 19 is spot on that more is learnt about the law and its application during articles than by doing a degree when i entered articles in 1971 after my degree i was paid the princely sum of 8 per week i was told think yourself lucky lad two years ago you would have paid me 8 a week but what an education i was given peter holt halifax west yorkshire sir i may be the last barrister still in full time practice not to have been to university to practise at the bar it was considered sufficient to have passed the exams thus showing adequate knowledge of the law a year as a pupil cemented the knowledge required for the exams and of practical matters etiquette at the bar drafting pleadings and conducting cases in court a good pupil master was worth his fee and the lessons learnt have stood me well i see no reason why a law degree is needed to practise the law a wider education

during an excavation near the small czech republic village of lány a graduate student discovered a section of a cow s rib bone that had some strange carved markings on its surface she didn t know what they were but she could tell they were man made alena slámová who is pursuing her archaeology degree at masaryk university in brno gave the curious item to her colleagues for further analysis they eventually confirmed that the carvings were german runic letters common to an alphabet that was used by germanic peoples in the second through seventh centuries ad while the runic letter cow bone discovery was remarkable the biggest surprise came after the radiocarbon testing results researchers dated the cow bone to 1 400 years in the past to approximately 600 ad this is more than two hundred years before the slavic descendants of modern day czechs were supposed to have begun using their own written alphabet a closeup of the cow rib bone showing the runic letters on it masaryk university german runic letters on cow bone could change history an international team of researchers from the czech republic austria switzerland and australia participated in the original excavation and the subsequent study of the cow bone and its runic letter carvings they published the results of their analysis in the march 2021 edition of the journal of archaeological science it was absolutely surprising for us lead author jiří macháček who runs the archaeology department at masaryk university in brno told radio free europe radio liberty macháček and his colleagues have two theories that might explain how the cow bone with runic letters on it was created the first is that the bone was carved by a person of germanic descent who was living in slavic territory in the seventh century the second theory which macháček seems to favor suggests the bone was inscribed by a slav who d learned the german runic letter alphabet and wanted to record it for posterity or to help others learn it either way macháček believes what his team has recovered represents a sign of friendly relations it shows that they were trying to communicate with each other and were not just fighting all the time dr macháček said in an interview with the new york times if this conclusion is true it would represent a significant departure from current theories on modern european history the slavic people were the subject of a ruthless extermination campaign at the hands of nazi germany that was a traumatic time for residents of the slavic countries and it created a rift between slavic peoples and germans that may take a long time to completely heal norse or viking runic letters known as elder futhark on red wooden discs and you can immediately recognize letters from our modern alphabet photochur adobe stock the official history now in need of revision the official creation story says that the first uniquely slavic alphabet was invented by saint cyril a greek monk who frequently represented the byzantine empire as a christian missionary in 863 ad cyril and his brother saint methodius were dispatched by the byzantine emperor michael iii to spread christianity throughout slavic lands to encourage more advanced religious study among his new recruits cyril decided to translate important christian literature into the local written language supposedly the slavs had no written language at the time so the ambitious monk created the glagolitic script which was meant to represent the spoken dialect of slavic tribes living under byzantine rule as the oldest form of slavic writing the glagolitic script acted as a foundation for the cyrillic script and alphabet which is still used to this day the cyrillic system which was created in bulgaria in the late ninth century mixed elements of the greek and glagolitic alphabets the cyrillic and glagolitic scripts were essentially rivals and it wasn t until the middle ages that the cyrillic alphabet fully replaced the glagolitic script in all slavic territories but the runic letters on the seventh century cow s rib bone bore no resemblance to ancient slavic script it was identified by university of vienna philologist robert nedoma as belonging to a type of runic writing known as elder futhark this runic system was widely used in northern europe up until the seventh century ad it was unquestionably germanic in origin having no connection with any known slavic style of writing there are 24 letters in the elder futhark runic letter system what was found carved on the bone was not a word or words formed from these letters but representations of the last seven letters of the elder futhark alphabet it is likely that the entire alphabet was originally inscribed on the bone the researchers explained in a press release issued by masaryk university the bone was not inscribed with a specific message instead it seems to be a learning aid an idea that the several mistakes in the inscription lend weight to if true this conclusion raises fascinating possibilities could an individual of germanic origin have been trying to teach the runic letter system to slavic students if so it could mean friendly relations did exist between at least some germans and their slavic neighbors in the long distant past codex runicus a vellum manuscript from approximately 1300 ad containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the scanian law is written entirely in runes asztalos gyula public domain alphabet diplomacy in first millennium central europe slavic and german peoples both have a history in central europe the ancestors of the slavic people arrived in the area in the first century ad and found germanic peoples occupying the territory at that time the official history says the slavs eventually drove the germans out displacing them as the dominant people in the region after the roman empire fell but perhaps relations between slavic emigrants and the original german inhabitants were not as hostile as previously believed some germans may have continued to reside presumably peacefully in germanic communities that remained untouched within the boundaries of slavic territory florin curta a professor of history and archaeology from the university of florida who was not involved in the cow bone study has stated that there can be no doubt that the marks on the artifact are germanic runic letters and that this is undoubtedly a very important discovery but he believes there is no way it could have been carved by a person of slavic descent it is much more likely he asserts that the creators of the artifact were locals who communicated in a germanic language if indeed surviving german communities were trying to teach their written alphabet to their slavic neighbors it seems their efforts did not meet with success as of now the cow bone featuring the mysterious runic letter markings is a singular and wholly unique discovery unless similar artifacts are unearthed in the future there is no good reason to dispute the official version of how the first ever slavic alphabet was created top image the fragment of a longer cow bone found by the czech grad student on which ancient runic letters were

it s been a rocky ride for investors in cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin the best known of these virtual assets is down nearly 40 since hitting a record of just under 65 000 in mid april so what s happening there are a handful of reasons why the value of digital currencies is plunging there is the sell off we are seeing on wall street over inflation fears that s spilling over there is also concern that regulators around the world including in the united states will crack down on these virtual assets and then there s tesla ceo elon musk whose comments continue to move cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin but perhaps the biggest reason is the simplest of them all these are risky and volatile investments and that s how they are behaving remember bitcoin is a young asset it has only been around for 13 years and you used to be able to buy it for a few bucks here s a closer look at cryptocurrencies wild ride weren t we just talking about a boom in bitcoin yes until recently we were during the pandemic novice and traditional investors started buying digital currencies in droves a case in point over a year ago bitcoin was trading at under 7 000 and then went on to peak at near 65 000 last month the same excitement that led amateur traders in robinhood s app to buy gamestop s shares fueled the frenzy over cryptocurrencies for months people were stuck at home with time on their hands and for a while at least it seemed like it was a sure thing prices kept going up and up ed moya senior market analyst at oanda called bitcoin an easy trade with a one way move over the last year many large institutional investors also started to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios and that gave them some added legitimacy according to liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab it was hard not to notice how much money was being funneled into the digital currencies it just feeds on itself she says so what s happening now as it turns out cryptocurrencies are not insulated from what has been a wider sell off in markets the stock market has been hit hard since last week as a surge in consumer prices sparked concerns about inflation investors are worried that prices will continue to rise and that the federal reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected but wasn t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation that was the argument by bitcoin enthusiasts though many analysts do not think that s actually the case moya from oanda notes that cryptocurrencies remain a speculative asset and when there is a market sell off bitcoin and fellow virtual assets will drop in value too in that sense moya argues it s not like gold widely seen as the ultimate hedge against inflation what about regulations that s another factor hitting cryptocurrencies many virtual currency adherents are deeply skeptical of the role governments and central banks play in the financial system the irony is that as investments in bitcoin and other assets become more widespread they will attract more regulatory scrutiny the treasury department on thursday announced that it would require businesses that undertake transfers of at least 10 000 worth of cryptocurrencies to report those to the irs gary gensler the new chairman of the securities and exchange commission has made it clear digital currencies are something his agency will focus on and this week china s central bank banned financial institutions from taking part in any transactions made up of cryptocurrencies and what about musk musk has become closely associated with bitcoin and other virtual currencies for example the billionaire promoted a virtual currency called dogecoin which started off as a joke that sparked a surge in prices but the currency then crashed after musk referred to it as a hustle when he hosted saturday night live this month but musk has been most closely associated with bitcoin he has been the biggest cheerleader for bitcoin moya says the market is still sensitive to these influencers musk sparked a rally in bitcoin after he announced in february that his car company tesla had bought 1 5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it would accept payments in the virtual asset but musk stunned investors by announcing this month that tesla would stop accepting payments in bitcoin because of concerns about the impact on the environment in so doing he brought attention to something that has dogged digital currencies since their inception that they require a lot of energy to mine so what about those environmental concerns the environmental impact is big uncovering bitcoin or mining involves big computers working to solve very complex math formulas yes it s complicated that requires enormous power and it s often done in countries such as china that rely on dirtier energy sources like coal researchers at the university of cambridge in the united kingdom for example estimated that mining for bitcoin consumes more energy annually than the whole of argentina several of bitcoin s competitors see this as a way to differentiate themselves from the digital currency and they are playing up their more environmentally friendly bona fides so finally what s the big takeaway a simple one that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are incredibly volatile investments it can go through head spinning rallies that are then followed by equally head spinning crashes sometimes in a single day markets experienced this firsthand on wednesday in the morning bitcoin fell over 30 only to turn around and surge more than 30 in the afternoon that s why most analysts caution amateur investors against cryptocurrencies though they say the assets can make sense if held as long term investments or for professional investors it s too volatile for most investors moya from oanda says but i think for longer term investors depending on when you got in you still might feel calm confident in your investment

the crisis of 2020 has created the greatest wealth gap in history the middle class capitalism and democracy are all under threat what went wrong and what can be done in a matter of decades the united states has gone from a largely benign form of capitalism to a neo feudal form that has created an ever widening gap in wealth and power in his 2013 bestseller capital in the 21st century french economist thomas piketty declared that the level of inequality in the us is probably higher than in any other society at any time in the past anywhere in the world in a 2014 podcast about the book bill moyers commented here s one of its extraordinary insights we are now really all headed into a future dominated by inherited wealth as capital is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands giving the very rich ever greater power over politics government and society patrimonial capitalism is the name for it and it has potentially terrifying consequences for democracy paul krugman maintained in the same podcast that the united states is becoming an oligarchy a society of inherited wealth the very system our founders revolted against while things have only gotten worse since then thanks to the economic crisis of 2020 it s worth retracing the history that brought us to this volatile moment not the vision of our founders the sort of capitalism on which the united states was originally built has been called mom and pop capitalism families owned their own farms and small shops and competed with each other on a more or less level playing field it was a form of capitalism that broke free of the feudalistic model and reflected the groundbreaking values set forth in the declaration of independence and bill of rights that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights including the rights to free speech a free press to worship and assemble and the right not to be deprived of life liberty or property without due process it was good in theory but there were glaring inhumane exceptions to this idealized template including the confiscation of the lands of indigenous populations and the slavery that then prevailed the slaves were emancipated by the us civil war but while they were freed in their persons they were not economically free they remained entrapped in economic serfdom although black and indigenous communities have been disproportionately oppressed poor people were all trapped in indentured servitude of sorts the obligation to serve in order to pay off debts e g the debts of irish workers to pay for passage to the united states and the debts of sharecroppers two thirds of whom were white who had to borrow from landlords at interest for land and equipment today s u s prison system has also been called a form of slavery in which free or cheap labor is extracted from poor people of color to the creditors economic captivity actually had certain advantages over chattel slavery ownership of humans as a property right according to an infamous document called the hazard circular circulated by british banking interests among their american banking counterparts during the american civil war slavery is likely to be abolished by the war power and chattel slavery destroyed this i and my european friends are glad of for slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care of the laborers while the european plan led by england is that capital shall control labor by controlling wages slaves had to be housed fed and cared for free men housed and fed themselves free men could be kept enslaved by debt by paying them wages that were insufficient to meet their costs of living from industrial capitalism to finance capitalism the economy crashed in the great depression when franklin d roosevelt s government revived it and rebuilt the country through a public financial institution called the reconstruction finance corporation after world war ii the us middle class thrived small businesses competed on a relatively level playing field similar to the mom and pop capitalism of the early pioneers meanwhile larger corporations engaged in industrial capitalism in which the goal was to produce real goods and services but the middle class considered the backbone of the economy has been progressively eroded since the 1970s the one two punch of the great recession and what the imf has called the great lockdown has again reduced much of the population to indentured servitude while industrial capitalism has largely been displaced by finance capitalism in which money makes money for those who have it in their sleep as economist michael hudson explains unearned income not productivity is the goal corporations take out cheap 1 loans not to invest in machinery and production but to buy their own stock earning 8 or 9 or to buy out smaller corporations eliminating competition and creating monopolies former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis explains that capital has been decoupled from productivity businesses can make money without making profits on their products as kevin cahill described the plight of people today in a book titled who owns the world these latter day pharaohs the planet owners the richest 5 allow the rest of us to pay day after day for the right to live on their planet and as we make them richer they buy yet more of the planet for themselves and use their wealth and power to fight amongst themselves over what each possesses though of course it s actually us who have to fight and die in their wars the 2020 knockout punch the final blow to the middle class came in 2020 nick hudson co founder of a data analytics firm called panda pandemics data and analysis argued in an interview following his keynote address at a march 2021 investment conference lockdowns are the most regressive strategy that has ever been invented the wealthy have become much wealthier trillions of dollars of wealth have been transferred to wealthy people not a single country did a cost benefit analysis before imposing these measures policymakers followed the recommendations of the world health organization based on predictive modeling by the imperial college london that subsequently proved to be wildly inaccurate later studies have now been done at least some of which have concluded that lockdowns have no significant effects on case numbers and that the costs of lockdowns substantially outweigh the benefits in terms not just of economic costs but of lives on the economic front global lockdowns eliminated competition from small and medium sized businesses allowing monopolies and oligopolies to grow the biggest loser from all this is the middle class wrote logan kane on seeking alpha by may 2020 about one in four americans had filed for unemployment with over 40 million americans filing jobless claims and 200 000 more businesses closed in 2020 than the historical annual average meanwhile us billionaires collectively increased their total net worth by 1 1 trillion during the last 10 months of 2020 and 46 people joined the billionaire class the number of centi billionaires individuals with a net worth of 100 billion or more also grew in the us they included jeff bezos soon to be former ceo of amazon whose net worth increased from 113 billion in march 2020 to 182 billion in march 2021 up by 70 billion for the year for the year elon musk ceo of tesla and spacex whose net worth increased from 25 billion in march 2020 to 164 billion in march 2021 up by 139 billion for the year and for the year and bill gates formerly ceo of microsoft and currently considered the global vaccine czar whose net worth increased to 124 billion in march 2021 up by 26 billion for the year two others are almost centi billionaires the net worth of mark zuckerberg ceo of facebook grew from 55 billion in march 2020 to 95 billion in march 2021 up by 40 billion for the year and for the year and the net worth of warren buffett of berkshire hathaway grew from 68 billion in march 2020 to 95 billion in march 2021 up by 27 6 billion for the year these five individuals collectively added 300 billion to their net worth just in 2020 for perspective that s enough to create 300 000 millionaires or to give 100 000 to 3 million people philanthrocapitalism the need to shield the multibillionaire class from taxes and to change their predatory corporate image has given rise to another form of capitalism called philanthrocapitalism wealth is transferred to foundations or limited liability corporations that are designated as having charitable purposes but remain under the ownership and control of the donors who can invest the funds in ways that serve their corporate interests as noted in the reporter magazine of the rochester institute of technology essentially what we are witnessing is the transfer of responsibility for public goods and services from democratic institutions to the wealthy to be administered by an executive class in the ceo society the exercise of social responsibilities is no longer debated in terms of whether corporations should or shouldn t be responsible for more than their own business interests instead it is about how philanthropy can be used to reinforce a politico economic system that enables such a small number of people to accumulate obscene amounts of wealth with 100 billion nearly anything can be bought not just land and resources but media and journalists political influence and legislation regulators university research departments and laboratories jeff bezos now owns the washington post bill gates is not only the largest funder of the world health organization and the imperial college london but the largest owner of agricultural land in the us and elon musk s aerospace manufacturer spacex has effectively privatized the sky astronomers and stargazers complain that the thousands of satellites it has already launched with many more in the works are blocking their ability to see the stars astronomy professor samantha lawler writes in a piece for the conversation public advocacy groups such as the cellular phone task force have also objected due to health concerns over increased electromagnetic radiation but the people have little say over public policy these days so concluded a study summarized in a january 2021 article in foreign affairs princeton professor and study co author martin gilens wrote rdinary citizens have virtually no influence over what their government does in the united states government policy making over the last few decades reflects the preferences of economic elites and of organized interests varoufakis calls our current economic scheme postcapitalism and techno feudalism as in the medieval feudal model assets are owned by the few he notes that the stock market and the businesses in it are essentially owned by three companies the giant exchange traded funds blackrock vanguard and state street under the highly controversial great reset envisioned by the world economic forum you will own nothing and be happy by implication everything will be owned by the techno feudal lords getting back on track the capitalist model has clearly gone off the rails how to get it back on track one obvious option is to tax the uber rich as chuck collins author of the wealth hoarders how billionaires pay millions to hide trillions 2021 writes in a march 2021 article a wealth tax would reverse more than a half century of tax cuts for the wealthiest households billionaires have seen their taxes decline roughly 79 percent as a percentage of their wealth since 1980 the effective rate on the billionaire class the actual percentage paid was 23 percent in 2018 lower than for most middle income taxpayers he notes that sen elizabeth warren d mass and co authors recently introduced legislation to levy a 2 percent annual tax on wealth starting at 50 million rising to 3 percent on fortunes of more than 1 billion the tax which would apply to fewer than 100 000 u s residents would raise an estimated 3 trillion over the next decade it would be paid entirely by multi millionaires and billionaires who have reaped the lion s share of wealth gains over the last four decades including during the pandemic varoufakis contends however that taxing wealth won t be enough the corporate model itself needs an overhaul to create a humanist capitalism he says democracy needs to be brought to the marketplace politically one adult gets one vote but in corporate elections votes are weighted according to financial investment the largest investors hold the largest number of voting shares varoufakis argues that the proper principle for reconfiguring the ownership of corporations for a market based society would be one employee one share not tradeable one vote on that basis he says we can imagine as an alternative to our post capitalist model a market based democratic society without capitalism another proposed solution is a land value tax restoring at least a portion of the land to the commons as michael hudson has observed there is one achilles heel in the globalists strategy an option that remains open to governments this option is a tax on the rental income the unearned income of land natural resources and monopoly takings reforming the banking system is another critical tool banks operated as a public utility could allocate credit for productive purposes serving the public interest other possibilities include enforcement of anti monopoly legislation and patent law reform perhaps however the flaw is in the competitive capitalist model itself the winners will inevitably capture and exploit the losers creating an ever growing gap in wealth and power studies of natural systems have shown that cooperative models are more efficient than competitive schemes that does not mean the sort of cooperation coerced through iron fisted totalitarian control at the top we need a set of rules that actually levels the playing field rewards productivity and maximizes benefit to society as a whole while preserving the individual rights guaranteed by the u s constitution

efforts to force the sale of central maine power and versant power s assets and create a so called consumer owned utility called pine tree power co reached a milestone thursday when the legislature held a public hearing on the proposal some aspects of the plan have created confusion and disagreement here are answers to some key questions the bill would require cmp and versant to sell assets such as substations trucks and power lines has there ever been a forced asset sale of an existing private utility in the united states on this scale no a forced sale of the assets of two investor owned utilities to form a statewide transmission and distribution company would be unprecedented the advocacy coalition behind the bill our power downplays the novelty by making it seem routine the group notes that there are roughly 2 000 consumer owned utilities in the country including nine cooperatives or municipal owned entities in maine some in other states have been converted from investor owned utilities supporters say top examples they cite are winter park florida and the long island power authority in new york but these comparisons omit some key distinctions advertisement maine s nine consumer owned utilities serve tiny populations the largest eastern maine electric cooperative has 10 400 home customers that s compared to cmp s 560 000 and more than 135 000 for versant power taken together cmp and versant serve 96 percent of maine homes according to the public utilities commission most of maine s consumer owned utilities were formed long ago as part of municipalities not takeovers of existing utilities eastern maine electric co op came to be as part of the country s rural electrification act in 1936 the houlton water co acquired by the town in 1902 also provides water and sewer service regarding modern day investor owned sales winter park broke from progress energy in 2005 residents were fed up with reliability problems and voted overwhelmingly to approve 43 million in revenue bonds to buy the assets winter park is currently burying its electric lines underground as a hedge against storm damage located near orlando winter park is a growing suburban city of 15 600 electricity customers within a 9 square mile service area by comparison cmp s service area is 11 000 square miles the long island power authority is more comparable in size with 1 1 million customers although its service area is much smaller 1 230 square miles lipa as it s known was formed by an act of the new york legislature in 1986 after a nuclear power plant being built by the local power company was canceled over cost and safety issues advertisement lipa issued 6 7 billion in bonds in 1998 largely to take over the failing company s distribution system at the time it was the largest municipal bond debt in u s history and is still being paid down estimates of the value of cmp and versant range from 5 billion to more than 13 billion why such a difference first off the bill states that fair market value would be negotiated or determined by a referred process but cmp and versant have made it clear they will fight what they consider a seizure of their private assets in court having said that market value is influenced by time each year the maine puc documents the net utility plant of cmp and versant based on their balance sheets the latest figures are 3 9 billion for cmp and 1 2 billion for versant for a total value of roughly 5 billion that s what our power considers the starting point but cmp says the total figure could reach 13 5 billion it s basing that on how long a hostile acquisition might be fought in court cmp estimated it could take up to 10 years our power says three to four years our power is relying on a study done last year for the puc and follow up calculations by an energy market expert they assume a start date of 2024 a consulting firm hired by cmp however said value would keep growing as the utilities continue to make capital investments to handle the new wave of clean energy generation advertisement the fact is no one really knows how long the process could take or what the value ultimately would be would the new company be government controlled as cmp repeatedly claims cmp is raising the specter of a state run power company it says the sale would be a seizure of private assets enabled by state government it s true that the legislature would enable the sale but the privately operated non profit authority would be controlled by an independent board of directors it would be made up of seven voting members representing five state senate districts elected to staggered terms by maine residents the board also would include four advisory experts the puc would have some oversight role including ratemaking our power s campaign says the board will be transparent and responsive to us meaning mainers but that doesn t mean the board will be free from influence supporters sometime point to nebraska as a good example of how a statewide consumer owned utility works but last year candidates for the 11 member nebraska public power district board took in record breaking campaign contributions money flowed from environmental groups industrial customers and others trying to influence clean energy decisions in the state advertisement who would actually operate and maintain the poles wires and substations our power s campaign says cmp and versant s existing workers will stay on and the board will put out a competitive bid for qualified private sector pros to run the facilities that s how long island s system operates but lipa s business model is unique according to fitch ratings it s the largest municipal electric distribution company in the country but system operation and maintenance is contracted to a subsidiary of public service enterprise group an investor owned diversified energy company based in new jersey that arrangement hasn t always assured satisfactory performance lipa was criticized for poor response to superstorm sandy in 2013 it also caught flak following tropical storm isaias last year leading to reports of communications and management failures and consideration of canceling its contract with public service proponents say the new company would be lower cost will my electricity bill be lower this is a confusing claim cmp and versant only distribute power they don t generate it the sale wouldn t affect power supply which accounts for roughly half the total bill home customers of those utilities pay our power says maine s existing consumer owned utilities charge home customers 58 percent less than cmp and versant but eastern maine electric co op has a higher delivery rate than cmp according to puc data and a higher total bill rate madison electric works has a low delivery rate but its standard offer power supply rate makes the total bill rate higher than cmp there s wide agreement however that any utility will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade the grid to accommodate maine s climate change and clean energy goals supporters say a consumer owned utility will be able to borrow money at a fraction of the cost of cmp or versant which has to compensate investors that could save 9 billion over 30 years according to one estimate and be passed on in lower rates regarding power supply a related bill was introduced last month to establish the maine generation authority it would authorize the sale of revenue bonds backed by electric ratepayers to finance and own renewable energy projects in maine that proposal has had a public hearing and is being considered in the energy utilities and technology committee send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

it s been a rocky ride for investors in cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin the best known of these virtual assets is down nearly 40 since hitting a record of just under 65 000 in mid april so what s happening there are a handful of reasons why the value of digital currencies is plunging there is the sell off we are seeing on wall street over inflation fears that s spilling over there is also concern that regulators around the world including in the united states will crack down on these virtual assets and then there s tesla ceo elon musk whose comments continue to move cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin but perhaps the biggest reason is the simplest of them all these are risky and volatile investments and that s how they are behaving remember bitcoin is a young asset it has only been around for 13 years and you used to be able to buy it for a few bucks here s a closer look at cryptocurrencies wild ride weren t we just talking about a boom in bitcoin yes until recently we were during the pandemic novice and traditional investors started buying digital currencies in droves a case in point over a year ago bitcoin was trading at under 7 000 and then went on to peak at near 65 000 last month the same excitement that led amateur traders in robinhood s app to buy gamestop s shares fueled the frenzy over cryptocurrencies for months people were stuck at home with time on their hands and for a while at least it seemed like it was a sure thing prices kept going up and up ed moya senior market analyst at oanda called bitcoin an easy trade with a one way move over the last year many large institutional investors also started to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios and that gave them some added legitimacy according to liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab it was hard not to notice how much money was being funneled into the digital currencies it just feeds on itself she says so what s happening now as it turns out cryptocurrencies are not insulated from what has been a wider sell off in markets the stock market has been hit hard since last week as a surge in consumer prices sparked concerns about inflation investors are worried that prices will continue to rise and that the federal reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected but wasn t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation that was the argument by bitcoin enthusiasts though many analysts do not think that s actually the case moya from oanda notes that cryptocurrencies remain a speculative asset and when there is a market sell off bitcoin and fellow virtual assets will drop in value too in that sense moya argues it s not like gold widely seen as the ultimate hedge against inflation what about regulations that s another factor hitting cryptocurrencies many virtual currency adherents are deeply skeptical of the role governments and central banks play in the financial system the irony is that as investments in bitcoin and other assets become more widespread they will attract more regulatory scrutiny the treasury department on thursday announced that it would require businesses that undertake transfers of at least 10 000 worth of cryptocurrencies to report those to the irs gary gensler the new chairman of the securities and exchange commission has made it clear digital currencies are something his agency will focus on and this week china s central bank banned financial institutions from taking part in any transactions made up of cryptocurrencies and what about musk musk has become closely associated with bitcoin and other virtual currencies for example the billionaire promoted a virtual currency called dogecoin which started off as a joke that sparked a surge in prices but the currency then crashed after musk referred to it as a hustle when he hosted saturday night live this month but musk has been most closely associated with bitcoin he has been the biggest cheerleader for bitcoin moya says the market is still sensitive to these influencers musk sparked a rally in bitcoin after he announced in february that his car company tesla had bought 1 5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it would accept payments in the virtual asset but musk stunned investors by announcing this month that tesla would stop accepting payments in bitcoin because of concerns about the impact on the environment in so doing he brought attention to something that has dogged digital currencies since their inception that they require a lot of energy to mine so what about those environmental concerns the environmental impact is big uncovering bitcoin or mining involves big computers working to solve very complex math formulas yes it s complicated that requires enormous power and it s often done in countries such as china that rely on dirtier energy sources like coal researchers at the university of cambridge in the united kingdom for example estimated that mining for bitcoin consumes more energy annually than the whole of argentina several of bitcoin s competitors see this as a way to differentiate themselves from the digital currency and they are playing up their more environmentally friendly bona fides so finally what s the big takeaway a simple one that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are incredibly volatile investments it can go through head spinning rallies that are then followed by equally head spinning crashes sometimes in a single day markets experienced this firsthand on wednesday in the morning bitcoin fell over 30 only to turn around and surge more than 30 in the afternoon that s why most analysts caution amateur investors against cryptocurrencies though they say the assets can make sense if held as long term investments or for professional investors it s too volatile for most investors moya from oanda says but i think for longer term investors depending on when you got in you still might feel calm confident in your investment copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
efforts to force the sale of central maine power and versant power s assets and create a so called consumer owned utility called pine tree power co reached a milestone thursday when the legislature held a public hearing on the proposal some aspects of the plan have created confusion and disagreement here are answers to some key questions the bill would require cmp and versant to sell assets such as substations trucks and power lines has there ever been a forced asset sale of an existing private utility in the united states on this scale no a forced sale of the assets of two investor owned utilities to form a statewide transmission and distribution company would be unprecedented the advocacy coalition behind the bill our power downplays the novelty by making it seem routine the group notes that there are roughly 2 000 consumer owned utilities in the country including nine cooperatives or municipal owned entities in maine some in other states have been converted from investor owned utilities supporters say top examples they cite are winter park florida and the long island power authority in new york but these comparisons omit some key distinctions advertisement maine s nine consumer owned utilities serve tiny populations the largest eastern maine electric cooperative has 10 400 home customers that s compared to cmp s 560 000 and more than 135 000 for versant power taken together cmp and versant serve 96 percent of maine homes according to the public utilities commission most of maine s consumer owned utilities were formed long ago as part of municipalities not takeovers of existing utilities eastern maine electric co op came to be as part of the country s rural electrification act in 1936 the houlton water co acquired by the town in 1902 also provides water and sewer service regarding modern day investor owned sales winter park broke from progress energy in 2005 residents were fed up with reliability problems and voted overwhelmingly to approve 43 million in revenue bonds to buy the assets winter park is currently burying its electric lines underground as a hedge against storm damage located near orlando winter park is a growing suburban city of 15 600 electricity customers within a 9 square mile service area by comparison cmp s service area is 11 000 square miles the long island power authority is more comparable in size with 1 1 million customers although its service area is much smaller 1 230 square miles lipa as it s known was formed by an act of the new york legislature in 1986 after a nuclear power plant being built by the local power company was canceled over cost and safety issues advertisement lipa issued 6 7 billion in bonds in 1998 largely to take over the failing company s distribution system at the time it was the largest municipal bond debt in u s history and is still being paid down estimates of the value of cmp and versant range from 5 billion to more than 13 billion why such a difference first off the bill states that fair market value would be negotiated or determined by a referred process but cmp and versant have made it clear they will fight what they consider a seizure of their private assets in court having said that market value is influenced by time each year the maine puc documents the net utility plant of cmp and versant based on their balance sheets the latest figures are 3 9 billion for cmp and 1 2 billion for versant for a total value of roughly 5 billion that s what our power considers the starting point but cmp says the total figure could reach 13 5 billion it s basing that on how long a hostile acquisition might be fought in court cmp estimated it could take up to 10 years our power says three to four years our power is relying on a study done last year for the puc and follow up calculations by an energy market expert they assume a start date of 2024 a consulting firm hired by cmp however said value would keep growing as the utilities continue to make capital investments to handle the new wave of clean energy generation advertisement the fact is no one really knows how long the process could take or what the value ultimately would be would the new company be government controlled as cmp repeatedly claims cmp is raising the specter of a state run power company it says the sale would be a seizure of private assets enabled by state government it s true that the legislature would enable the sale but the privately operated non profit authority would be controlled by an independent board of directors it would be made up of seven voting members representing five state senate districts elected to staggered terms by maine residents the board also would include four advisory experts the puc would have some oversight role including ratemaking our power s campaign says the board will be transparent and responsive to us meaning mainers but that doesn t mean the board will be free from influence supporters sometime point to nebraska as a good example of how a statewide consumer owned utility works but last year candidates for the 11 member nebraska public power district board took in record breaking campaign contributions money flowed from environmental groups industrial customers and others trying to influence clean energy decisions in the state advertisement who would actually operate and maintain the poles wires and substations our power s campaign says cmp and versant s existing workers will stay on and the board will put out a competitive bid for qualified private sector pros to run the facilities that s how long island s system operates but lipa s business model is unique according to fitch ratings it s the largest municipal electric distribution company in the country but system operation and maintenance is contracted to a subsidiary of public service enterprise group an investor owned diversified energy company based in new jersey that arrangement hasn t always assured satisfactory performance lipa was criticized for poor response to superstorm sandy in 2013 it also caught flak following tropical storm isaias last year leading to reports of communications and management failures and consideration of canceling its contract with public service proponents say the new company would be lower cost will my electricity bill be lower this is a confusing claim cmp and versant only distribute power they don t generate it the sale wouldn t affect power supply which accounts for roughly half the total bill home customers of those utilities pay our power says maine s existing consumer owned utilities charge home customers 58 percent less than cmp and versant but eastern maine electric co op has a higher delivery rate than cmp according to puc data and a higher total bill rate madison electric works has a low delivery rate but its standard offer power supply rate makes the total bill rate higher than cmp there s wide agreement however that any utility will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade the grid to accommodate maine s climate change and clean energy goals supporters say a consumer owned utility will be able to borrow money at a fraction of the cost of cmp or versant which has to compensate investors that could save 9 billion over 30 years according to one estimate and be passed on in lower rates regarding power supply a related bill was introduced last month to establish the maine generation authority it would authorize the sale of revenue bonds backed by electric ratepayers to finance and own renewable energy projects in maine that proposal has had a public hearing and is being considered in the energy utilities and technology committee send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

op ed views and opinions expressed are solely those of the author inflation impacts the price of hard assets as well as goods and services you can t push this amount of money into the system and not have that door swing back and hit you in the behind one of our analysts told me the other day that housing prices aren t going up the value of the dollar is falling that much wrap your head around that for a minute the reason it appears houses are going through the roof in value isn t that they are it s that the number of dollars needed to buy that house has gone up because the value of the dollar has fallen or is going to fall by that much if you leave your money in the bank it earns nothing and its value is plunging what it can buy is becoming less and less each day inflation is why a person retires with a pension of 4 000 a month in 1988 and it seemed like a decent monthly to live on and they re still here living their life and 4 000 a month is kind of thin if they have to pay rent and such our group of very experienced rogue traders and street professionals do macro research on the market and we deliver our real time trades to our subscribers we do technical chart analysis we put our commentary on those charts and we literally live inside this beautiful discounting machine we call the market every day what do we mean by that the market is an amazing animal that takes in all information and it digests it and makes a determination usually pretty quickly as to the impact it will have on stock prices and that decision on any topic such as future capital gains taxes or inflation shows up in prices when biden administration floated the ideas about a high capital gains tax the market digested it in a day and figured out that the odds of it actually occurring was basically zero and that anything that did get passed would be a nothing burger to most americans that s why the market rebounded and then went about its daily business on may 11th the dow dropped 473 points and on may 12th it dropped 681 points that s a two day drop of over 1 150 points they call this a repricing and they say it s due to inflation fears i call it a severe crack that you have to pay attention to and yes the market got it right again it is fears of inflation but it may be more than that let s tackle inflation first then i ll give you the other reasons why the market repriced it is likely that the price of everything is about to go up and not come back down we have had a long period in which the price of goods has stayed relatively sanguine and in many cases even dropped but that may be changing in the long term that means that for you to afford your current lifestyle and expenses you re going to need to make a lot more money maybe like 30 50 more than you re currently making there was a day when making 100 000 a year was a lot of money and now sadly if you live in a place like southern california boston massachusetts or new york 100 000 pretax barely makes it if you ve got a wife and any kids for sure rent in a nice neighborhood is easily over 3 000 for a two bedroom apartment or home after taxes in california for example that would mean that you would have around 2 000 a month for all your other expenses food car payments school stuff clothing gas forget saving for retirement it goes pretty fast why did this drop in the dow happen they call it inflation fears and they re right sort of you have had janet yellen and jerome powell running around for months saying they re not worried about inflation and that they re not going to raise rates and everything if fine but the market started to call bs on this narrative months ago when it spiked interest rates in the open market from under 1 to around 1 75 you see the market has a vote like my friend from the military says you can plan all you want but the enemy gets a vote too and in this case the market was voting that rates probably need to go up that was months ago now after all this stimulus has been shoved out into the economy to a level that we have never seen in history the consumer price report came out on may 12th and the truth was clear we had a massive increase in prices inflation is not coming its here and the market reacted dropping the dow 681 points and crushing the already bruised tech market the market was right inflation is here rates do need to rise perhaps so this narrative that yellen and powell are pushing out which is that rates won t have to be raised likely until sometime into 2022 is being called out big time by the market participants the market is saying you re going to have to raise rates sooner than you re talking about the thing that carnivore sees additionally underlying this drop in the market is the fact that the supply chain is messed up prices are high and that impacts profit margins availability of certain goods like cement and lumber are a problem home builders we feel are due for a fall in stock prices which we stated back around the first of may and the reason is there is no inventory there are no homes to sell it does not matter if you have great pricing if you have nothing to sell the point is the excitement about the reopening trade is great but now we re seeing that it may not be possible to produce revenue and profit figures that just a few months ago were assumed to be possible now that we see the challenges in the labor market and the supply chain at carnivore trading we have to take these macro issues into account when we decide where to trade in the stock market what sectors will win and which will lose in the last month we have been long lumber cement steel we went long the marine container shipping companies and they really rallied strongly for us as everyone around the world wants everything that makes everything and they want it now the issue is there are only so many ships so we saw that the guys with the ships would be able to charge whatever they wanted to charge and get it financials will do well in an increasing interest rate environment so we like small and regional banks that are leveraged to the spread between the fed funds rate and their loan portfolio finally as a part of the reopening trade we think that retailers will do very well going forward as the generation z crowd gets excited about going out again where do we see interest rates going putting a number on it is

u s treasury calls for crypto transfers over us 10 000 to be reported to irs mccreath crypto volatility proves you can lose money as quickly as you can make it the u s treasury said the biden administration s proposal to strengthen tax compliance includes a requirement for transfers of at least us 10 000 of cryptocurrency to be reported to the internal revenue service as with cash transactions businesses that receive cryptoassets with a fair market value of more than us 10 000 would also be reported on the treasury department said in a report on tax enforcement proposals released thursday the treasury said that comprehensive reporting is necessary to minimize the incentives and opportunity to shift income out of the new information reporting regime it noted that cryptocurrency is a small share of current business transactions bitcoin pared a daily advance after the irs announcement which shaved about us 3 000 from the token s price it was up 5 7 per cent at us 40 530 as of 4 23 p m in new york cryptocurrency linked stocks like coinbase and microstrategy also gave up some of their gains immediately after the news which had also prompted an outcry from some digital coin enthusiasts on twitter there was some major overreaction said kristin smith executive director of the blockchain association trade group for those of us that believe we should try to keep crypto on par with how cash is treated this does just that cash transactions in excess of us 10 000 are already subject to irs reporting requirements the irs in 2020 added a line about cryptocurrency on the form 1040 the individual tax return in an effort to gain more visibility into virtual currency transactions account reporting president joe biden s administration is also calling for banks to report on account flows to help boost tax payment compliance cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion the treasury said the treasury department had already been working prior to the start of the year on proposed regulations to require brokers to report information to the irs on their customers and the cryptocurrency sales they facilitate

it s been a rocky ride for investors in cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin the best known of these virtual assets is down nearly 40 since hitting a record of just under 65 000 in mid april so what s happening there are a handful of reasons why the value of digital currencies is plunging there is the sell off we are seeing on wall street over inflation fears that s spilling over there is also concern that regulators around the world including in the united states will crack down on these virtual assets and then there s tesla ceo elon musk whose comments continue to move cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin but perhaps the biggest reason is the simplest of them all these are risky and volatile investments and that s how they are behaving remember bitcoin is a young asset it has only been around for 13 years and you used to be able to buy it for a few bucks here s a closer look at cryptocurrencies wild ride weren t we just talking about a boom in bitcoin yes until recently we were during the pandemic novice and traditional investors started buying digital currencies in droves a case in point over a year ago bitcoin was trading at under 7 000 and then went on to peak at near 65 000 last month the same excitement that led amateur traders in robinhood s app to buy gamestop s shares fueled the frenzy over cryptocurrencies for months people were stuck at home with time on their hands and for a while at least it seemed like it was a sure thing prices kept going up and up ed moya senior market analyst at oanda called bitcoin an easy trade with a one way move over the last year many large institutional investors also started to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios and that gave them some added legitimacy according to liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab it was hard not to notice how much money was being funneled into the digital currencies it just feeds on itself she says so what s happening now as it turns out cryptocurrencies are not insulated from what has been a wider sell off in markets the stock market has been hit hard since last week as a surge in consumer prices sparked concerns about inflation investors are worried that prices will continue to rise and that the federal reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected but wasn t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation that was the argument by bitcoin enthusiasts though many analysts do not think that s actually the case moya from oanda notes that cryptocurrencies remain a speculative asset and when there is a market sell off bitcoin and fellow virtual assets will drop in value too in that sense moya argues it s not like gold widely seen as the ultimate hedge against inflation what about regulations that s another factor hitting cryptocurrencies many virtual currency adherents are deeply skeptical of the role governments and central banks play in the financial system the irony is that as investments in bitcoin and other assets become more widespread they will attract more regulatory scrutiny the treasury department on thursday announced that it would require businesses that undertake transfers of at least 10 000

and this week china s central bank banned financial institutions from taking part in any transactions made up of cryptocurrencies and what about musk musk has become closely associated with bitcoin

brought attention to something that has dogged digital currencies since their inception that they require a lot of energy to mine so what about those environmental concerns the environmental impact is big uncovering bitcoin or mining involves big computers working to solve very complex math formulas yes it s complicated that requires enormous power and it s often done in countries such as china

whole of argentina several of bitcoin s competitors see this as a way to differentiate themselves from the digital currency and they are playing up their more environmentally friendly bona fides so finally what s the big takeaway a simple one that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are incredibly volatile investments it can go through head spinning rallies that are then followed by equally head spinning crashes sometimes in a single day markets experienced this firsthand on wednesday in the morning bitcoin fell over 30 only to turn around and surge more than 30 in the afternoon that s why most analysts caution amateur investors against cryptocurrencies though they say the assets can make sense if held as long term investments or for professional investors it s too volatile for most investors moya from oanda says but i think for longer term investors depending on when you got in you still might feel calm confident in your investment copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
the eventual death of oil and thermal coal won t come from environmentalists or even directly from renewable energy it will come when big banks decide to stop financing it rendering it unbankable two years ago one of the biggest financiers of fossil fuels goldman sachs nyse gs made history after becoming the first big u s bank to rule out financing new oil exploration or drilling in the arctic as well as new thermal coal mines anywhere in the world gs environmental policy declared climate change as one of the most significant environmental challenges of the 21st century and pledged to help its clients manage climate impacts more effectively including through the sale of weather related catastrophe bonds the giant wall street bank also committed to invest 750 billion over the next decade into areas that focus on climate transition months later the world s largest asset manager blackrock inc nyse blk declared its intention to increase its esg environmental social and governance investments more than tenfold from 90 billion to a trillion dollars in the space of a decade blackrock followed that up last year issuing a chilling update on its approach to engaging with companies essentially saying it will abandon its traditional modus operandi of siding with boards of directors at companies but will instead start favoring shareholder resolutions but just in case investors thought these companies were playing their usual renewable energy lip service there s now solid evidence that they actually mean business for the first time ever the world s largest investment banks are backing renewable energy investments more than their fossil fuel brethren according to bloomberg data covering almost 140 financial service institutions worldwide at least 203 billion in bonds and loans have gone into renewable projects through may 14 compared with 189 billion to businesses focused on hydrocarbons that marks the first time in the history of modern fossil fuels that such a shift is occurring a powerful tipping point how significant is this development consider that in 2019 banks invested 737b in fossil fuels but only 238b in clean energy the trend remained unchanged in 2020 at the height of the pandemic with banks pumping 688b into fossil fuels but only 323b in renewables since 2015 when the world agreed to limit warming temperatures in the paris climate accord banks have poured more than 3 6 trillion into fossil fuel investments nearly 3x more than total bonds and loans that have gone into green projects as per bloomberg data cumulatively investment banks have pocketed 16 6 billion from arranging bonds and loans for energy companies since the paris agreement compared to just 7 4 billion garnered from green bonds and loans the latest development could very well be a new trend in the making with some clean energy buffs declaring that we have reached a powerful tipping point in the clean energy transition exxon slammed early this year u s oil giant exxon

it says something about us and therefore our media that yesterday s great jobs result got buried in less important albeit more sexy yarns about bitcoin i know because even i was a victim of the headline grabbing yarns such that i needed a phone call from the treasurer to make me have a harder look at something that had genuinely excited him and even today the newspapers are more firmly focused on the bad news out of the victorian horror budget for business than the unbelievable decimation of the once much hyped fiscal cliff gee wasn t that used to scare the pants off us a year ago i couldn t go out for a social outing without some friend or total stranger asking me about us all falling over that cliff i got so frustrated with so many people worried about what would happen when frydenberg takes away jobkeeper i started jokingly telling these people to stop watching the perennially negative abc aunty s selection of experts who had us tumbling into an economic abyss partly explained why many of my questioners were so nervous yes i hang out with abc fans and while i m a fan too i d joke with them unlike them i m not worried with over three decades of teaching and writing about economics i m actually qualified to watch the abc so why did i need a happy treasurer to remind me of how good yesterday s job numbers were well i did a speech to a group of financial advisers in the morning where i told them we have at least two years of great growth and a rising stock market albeit with a few downs and ups though more ups than downs in the afternoon i was on a conference panel discussing our economic and investing future then i did an interview for seven news on bitcoin because it s the speculative plaything of techies young investors and criminals after topping out around us60 000 bitcoin had slumped to below us33 000 one day on it s now us39 000 this is a far sexier story for business news but hell this economic rebound out of the worst recession since the great depression really underlines how we take good economic news for granted and worryingly there were many of us me not one of them who often lamented that millennials needed a good recession to teach them about the realities of the real world these poor blighters have not only been materially spoiled by parents like us had their brains and life captured by the internet and money makers who have mastered this new age medium they ve also lived through one the best aussie economies ever that didn t have a fair dinkum recession in close to 30 years in the modern economic context this is considered a world record so if our young people look at the worst economic crisis since the great depression and decide to invest in stocks to make up for low interest rates on bank deposits and try to get rich on something inexplicable like bitcoin who can blame them but it would be a good example if we as older and hopefully more life experienced elders reminded them just how lucky we are are we yep just look at how lucky we ve been with the coronavirus compared to indians brazilians italians brits and even americans this has delivered an economic dividend shown in this graph below that blue line shows how our economy rebounded out of the short sharp deep recession and when it dipped around july to august that s when victoria went into its second lockdown after a quarantine problem this shows how virus control and the economy are so interrelated that s an important lesson all australians not only recession unaffected millennials need to learn we re a lucky country even if the left and other whingers want to highlight our weaknesses all countries families and individuals have weaknesses but when working out someone s overall worth and good fortune it has to be a positives versus negatives analysis and on that criteria yes australia is a lucky country so let me get back to where i started the good job numbers the treasurer is happy about on first blush a 30 600 loss of jobs in april hardly looks champagne popping stuff but this is the full month reaction of the labour market after the end of jobkeeper so the fiscal cliff ends up being nothing more than a slight step down that wouldn t even force someone to trip let alone fall let s do a quick look at the numbers jobs down 30 600 in total but it was mainly a part time loss of 64 400 and many of them might ve gained one of the 33 800 jobs created over the month and get this employment is actually up 0 3 since february last year which was pre coronavirus also the unemployment rate fell from 5 6 to 5 5 you can only look at these numbers and find reasons to criticise them if you either failed to think how bad the fiscal cliff was portrayed 12 months ago or you look at these numbers with one eye whatever your politics this is a great result this is how amp capital s shane oliver saw the end of jobkeeper effect however the impact looks to have been minimal with the abs noting that its analysis did not identify a clear aggregate impact from the end of jobkeeper this is consistent with data showing a decline in people on unemployment benefits in april and government analysis of payroll data showing that only 16 000 to 40 000 people on the wage subsidy had lost their jobs up until april 11 this is minor compared to concerns that many jobs would be lost as one million jobs were still on jobkeeper prior to its ending wisely the morrison government has done a labor like thing and kept the spending to help the economy going for another year with a more than expected generous budget but unlike the misguided labor budget in victoria released yesterday the federal government hasn t raised taxes the victorian treasurer tim pallas is gambling with victoria s recovery and because it s the second biggest economy in australia he s risking our national recovery pallas should have waited a year before he raised payroll tax and slugged the property sector but the andrews government often looks out of touch with what might seem sensible for the sake of victorians i hope he gets away with it and doesn t derail the state s economic comeback because of the business negative effects of the lockdowns this is the one state that really needed a bigger spending labor like budget that really got the economy rocking and growing did i say the andrews government has a history of being unusual i really hope tim and dan don t create their own fiscal cliff

it s been a rocky ride for investors in cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin the best known of these virtual assets is down nearly 40 since hitting a record of just under 65 000 in mid april so what s happening there are a handful of reasons why the value of digital currencies is plunging there is the sell off we are seeing on wall street over inflation fears that s spilling over there is also concern that regulators around the world including in the united states will crack down on these virtual assets and then there s tesla ceo elon musk whose comments continue to move cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin but perhaps the biggest reason is the simplest of them all these are risky and volatile investments and that s how they are behaving remember bitcoin is a young asset it has only been around for 13 years and you used to be able to buy it for a few bucks here s a closer look at cryptocurrencies wild ride weren t we just talking about a boom in bitcoin yes until recently we were during the pandemic novice and traditional investors started buying digital currencies in droves a case in point over a year ago bitcoin was trading at under 7 000 and then went on to peak at near 65 000 last month the same excitement that led amateur traders in robinhood s app to buy gamestop s shares fueled the frenzy over cryptocurrencies for months people were stuck at home with time on their hands and for a while at least it seemed like it was a sure thing prices kept going up and up ed moya senior market analyst at oanda called bitcoin an easy trade with a one way move over the last year many large institutional investors also started to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios and that gave them some added legitimacy according to liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab it was hard not to notice how much money was being funneled into the digital currencies it just feeds on itself she says so what s happening now as it turns out cryptocurrencies are not insulated from what has been a wider sell off in markets the stock market has been hit hard since last week as a surge in consumer prices sparked concerns about inflation investors are worried that prices will continue to rise and that the federal reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected but wasn t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation that was the argument by bitcoin enthusiasts though many analysts do not think that s actually the case moya from oanda notes that cryptocurrencies remain a speculative asset and when there is a market sell off bitcoin and fellow virtual assets will drop in value too in that sense moya argues it s not like gold widely seen as the ultimate hedge against inflation what about regulations that s another factor hitting cryptocurrencies many virtual currency adherents are deeply skeptical of the role governments and central banks play in the financial system the irony is that as investments in bitcoin and other assets become more widespread they will attract more regulatory scrutiny the treasury department on thursday announced that it would require businesses that undertake transfers of at least 10 000 worth of cryptocurrencies to report those to the irs gary gensler the new chairman of the securities and exchange commission has made it clear digital currencies are something his agency will focus on and this week china s central bank banned financial institutions from taking part in any transactions made up of cryptocurrencies and what about musk musk has become closely associated with bitcoin and other virtual currencies for example the billionaire promoted a virtual currency called dogecoin which started off as a joke that sparked a surge in prices but the currency then crashed after musk referred to it as a hustle when he hosted saturday night live this month but musk has been most closely associated with bitcoin he has been the biggest cheerleader for bitcoin moya says the market is still sensitive to these influencers musk sparked a rally in bitcoin after he announced in february that his car company tesla had bought 1 5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it would accept payments in the virtual asset but musk stunned investors by announcing this month that tesla would stop accepting payments in bitcoin because of concerns about the impact on the environment in so doing he brought attention to something that has dogged digital currencies since their inception that they require a lot of energy to mine so what about those environmental concerns the environmental impact is big uncovering bitcoin or mining involves big computers working to solve very complex math formulas yes it s complicated that requires enormous power and it s often done in countries such as china that rely on dirtier energy sources like coal researchers at the university of cambridge in the united kingdom for example estimated that mining for bitcoin consumes more energy annually than the whole of argentina several of bitcoin s competitors see this as a way to differentiate themselves from the digital currency and they are playing up their more environmentally friendly bona fides so finally what s the big takeaway a simple one that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are incredibly volatile investments it can go through head spinning rallies that are then followed by equally head spinning crashes sometimes in a single day markets experienced this firsthand on wednesday in the morning bitcoin fell over 30 only to turn around and surge more than 30 in the afternoon that s why most analysts caution amateur investors against cryptocurrencies though they say the assets can make sense if held as long term investments or for professional investors it s too volatile for most investors moya from oanda says but i think for longer term investors depending on when you got in you still might feel calm confident in your investment copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

a second lawsuit has been filed to overturn a newly passed capital gains tax in washington the lawsuit by the opportunity for all coalition ofac which successfully fought seattle s high earners income tax in 2017 was filed thursday in douglas county superior court the plaintiffs include business owners and farmers who would potentially be subject to the new tax as well as the washington farm bureau last month the conservative freedom foundation filed a similar lawsuit in douglas county court on behalf of five high worth individuals and one couple both lawsuits which are likely to be consolidated contend the 7 percent tax on gains above 250 000 from the sale of such things as stocks and bonds violates both the state and federal constitutions it s unconstitutional it s unwanted by the citizens of the state and it s really unnecessary said collin hathaway a business owner who serves as president of ofac specifically the lawsuit says the capital gains tax is an illegal excise tax on income the plaintiffs also argue it runs afoul of the state constitution by imposing a non uniform tax on property and by exceeding the state s one percent cap on property taxes additionally the lawsuit alleges the tax violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution by taxing activity that happens outside of washington the state legislature is attempting to get around the rules for income taxes in our state by instead imposing an excise tax on capital gains income said republican former attorney general rob mckenna who filed the complaint on behalf of ofac and the plaintiffs the washington supreme court has consistently ruled since the 1930s that income is a form of property and therefore subject to both the uniformity clause and the one percent cap washington voters have also repeatedly rejected income tax proposals including as recently as 2010 when they soundly defeated a proposed high earners income tax while other states and the federal government treat capital gains as income supporters of the washington tax insist that it s an excise tax on the sale of certain capital assets like stocks and bonds we knew a legal challenge was possible but passed what we believe is a constitutional policy that will make our state a better place for us all said democratic state sen june robinson the prime sponsor of the tax bill in a statement it s widely expected the capital gains tax will end up before the state supreme court if that happens the court could potentially revisit its prior rulings that income is property however in an interview mckenna sketched out a different scenario based on what happened in the seattle income tax fight in that case he noted the supreme court declined to take the case on direct review after the tax was struck down by a king county superior court judge and the supreme court declined again to review the case after an appeals court upheld the lower court ruling that is a course of events that could unfold mckenna said majority democrats in the washington legislature passed the capital gains tax last month after years of proposing and discussing the idea they view it as a way to make the state s tax structure less regressive while raising new revenues from the state s wealthiest taxpayers the first 500 million raised would be dedicated to the state s education legacy trust account to expand access to early learning and child care while the capital gains tax includes exemptions for real estate and timberlands some farmers are concerned they could still end up paying the tax on the sale of farmlands the plaintiffs in the ofac lawsuit include farmers orchardists and the state s farm bureau the plaintiffs include april clayton who operates red apple orchards in orondo kevin and renee bouchey who are former co owners of s k d farms in richland and rosella and burr mosby who own mosby farms near auburn the other plaintiffs are christopher and catherine senske who are in the lawn and pest control business in kennewick matthew sonderen who is co president and part owner of sonderen packaging in spokane and joanna cable who previously worked in finance and investment banking all of the plaintiffs are members of the washington policy center a right of center pro business think tank which helped find the plaintiffs and provided the legal team with research ofac was founded in 2017 by matt mcilwain the managing director of madrona venture group in seattle the capital gains tax is scheduled to take effect on jan 1 2022 copyright 2021 northwest news network
on the surface everything was hunky dory in the summer of 1929 the total wealth of the united states had almost doubled during the roaring twenties fueled in part by stock market speculation eagerly undertaken by a wide swath of citizens ranging from fifth avenue dowagers to factory workers one midwestern woman a farmer made an overnight profit of 2 000 31 000 in today s dollars betting on a car manufacturer s stock when the bubble burst in spectacular fashion in october 1929 many economists including john kenneth galbraith author of the great crash 1929 blamed the worldwide decade long great depression that followed on all those reckless speculators most saw the banks as victims not culprits the reality is more complex sure without all that uncontrolled and irrational market speculation the 1930s might be recalled simply as a period when the economy and prosperity stalled but just why and how could those gamblers dominate the stock market and why did a crisis in the markets become a systemic decade long economic catastrophe during which unemployment skyrocketed to 25 percent and the cost of goods and services plunged by 1933 dozen eggs cost only 13 cents down from 50 cents in 1929 banks failed between a third and half of all u s financial institutions collapsed wiping out the lifetime savings of millions of americans the familiar narrative of the great depression places banks among the institutions that suffered fallout from the crisis in fact in the eyes of such luminaries as ben bernanke an economic historian and former head of the federal reserve the crisis was all about the banks from the central bank the fed itself down to the smallest savings institutions regarding the great depression we did it bernanke said in a 2002 speech referring primarily to the fed s role we re sorry here are four ways banks did it banks extended too much credit stock market crash of 1929 the runaway speculation that triggered the 1929 crash and the great depression that followed couldn t have taken place without the banks which fueled the 1920s credit boom new businesses making new products like automobiles radios and refrigerators borrowed to support non stop expansion in output they kept borrowing and spending even as business inventories soared 300 percent between 1928 and 1929 alone and americans wages stagnated the banks ignoring the warning signs kept subsidizing them the banks also funded the speculation itself providing the money that individual investors needed to buy stocks on margin that midwestern farmer might have borrowed up to 90 percent of the money she needed to make her overnight killing on the automobile stock financed by her local bank bank lenders discounted or downplayed growing signs that americans were overstretched farm incomes in particular plunged in the years leading up to 1929 and others found their wages stagnant their prosperity came solely from their stock market wealth which didn t last bettmann archive getty images people gathering in front of the new york stock exchange on october 29 1929 checking the hysterical shrinkage of stock market prices banks ignored the federal reserve the fed which serves as america s central bank did try to rein things in albeit too slowly and too late in the game it sent warning letters to the banks to which the fed itself provided credit warning them to take their collective feet off the gas pedals banks with their eyes firmly fixed on the easy profits to be earned by funding speculation paid little attention after all wasn t it a virtuous cycle the more investment profits their customers generated the more money they would have to spend on new homes or consumer goods why worry by the time the fed slammed on the brakes by raising interest rates in 1929 it was too late to stem the crash or the fallout on the banks history vault the titans that built america out of the ashes of world war i a new generation of titan rises pierre du pont walter chrysler j p morgan jr henry ford and william boeing watch now banks didn t maintain adequate reserves it sounds kind of geeky but one of the ways that banks contribute to the health of the economy and help avoid catastrophes like the great depression is to manage their cash reserves typically banks hold onto only a small percentage of all the money depositors entrust to them and lend out the rest in search of a profit that s how they make their money in ordinary times banks count on the ability to borrow from other financial institutions or from the federal reserve to cover any unexpected shortfall in reserves if their customers start showing up in droves and demanding their deposits back during the depression the pressure on those backup providers of capital proved unsustainable moreover large numbers of american banks hadn t joined the federal reserve system and so weren t able to tap its reserves to avoid collapse it wasn t until the stock market crashed and fearful americans flocked to banks to demand their cash so they could stow it under the mattress or use it to offset their massive stock market losses that banks realized what they d done they hadn t kept enough reserves on hand to address the growing risks associated with runaway credit and speculation ironically once banks started to try to correct their missteps they made the problem worse when banks sought to protect themselves they stopped lending money businesses couldn t get access to capital and closed their doors throwing millions of americans out of work those unemployed americans couldn t keep spending and the toxic downward spiral continued as bank after bank collapsed it wasn t just savings that were lost but information surviving institutions had no way to gauge which companies or individuals were good credit risks bettmann archive getty images shipment of gold coins valued into six figures at the time arriving from the depositors of the empire trust co it was part of the stream flowed back into the coffers of the federal reserve bank during the stock market crisis banks needed fixing if banks led to the crash and the subsequent economic crisis that extended into the great depression then they needed to be fixed in order for the economy to begin to recover by 1933 the wave of bank failures stemmed from the decision of the newly elected president franklin d roosevelt to declare a four day banking holiday while congress debated and passed the emergency banking act which formed the basis of the 1933 banking act or glass steagall act for their part legislators required banks to join the federal reserve system and approved the creation of deposit insurance so that future bank failures couldn t wreak havoc on family savings they also took steps to curb speculation by banning commercial lenders from dabbling in the stock market even before roosevelt signed the new measures into law americans began returning hoarded cash to surviving banks the banking system had been saved even though it would take years for the economy itself to climb out of the deep hole of the depression

in summary lawmakers shelve dozens of significant bills many opposed by special interests they include proposals on police reform housing health care and more lea este artículo en español forget about new protections for california kids cruising the internet there will be no new requirements for crime labs to process old rape kits and some households behind on their water bills won t get more time to pay them back before their pipes get shut off those were some of the more than 200 bills california lawmakers killed today in the rapid fire and often mysterious procedure known as the suspense file officially the procedure promotes fiscal responsibility allowing lawmakers to consider costly bills together and weigh their priorities but it s well known at the state capitol that the suspense file is also a political tool that allows the most powerful legislators to keep controversial bills from reaching the assembly or senate floor typically with no explanation and sometimes without a public vote it s driven by a hundred different factors some of which we can never explain and maybe the transparency is weak on said assemblymember lorena gonzalez the san diego democrat who chairs the appropriations committee but i ve never once had the speaker come to me and say this isn t politically feasible with more than 350 bills on the senate s suspense file and more than 500 on the assembly s the lobbying leading up to today is intense everybody but god himself has contacted me on a bill gonzalez said though she downplayed the role of politics one of her predecessors said the job is like being the speaker s henchman they can use the suspense file to prevent an idea they don t like from becoming law exact revenge on a fellow lawmaker or shield their colleagues from having to take a position on a controversial proposal you ve got to be prepared to take really tough decisions for the caucus former assemblymember mike gatto said on a recent podcast governors also try to bottle some things up in the suspense file gatto said adding that when he left office in 2016 then gov jerry brown thanked him for keeping legislation from reaching his desk the suspense file of course is not the only tool for slaying bills lawmakers can also kill them simply by doing nothing for the last two years the assembly has allowed policy committee chairpersons to decide whether to give bills a hearing that means they can silently snuff them just by not taking them up for a vote this is how democrats who control the legislature have killed some of the most progressive bills introduced this year including proposals to develop a single payer health care system ban fracking and levy a wealth tax it s also what doomed an attempt to repeal a ban on local soda taxes gov gavin newsom has said he will not sign tax increases this year with the state awash in covid 19 relief money from the federal government and taxes paid by wealthier residents benefiting from a booming stock market when you re enjoying a 76 plus billion and growing operating surplus i don t think it s the time to do tax increases newsom said last week as he presented his updated budget still one major tax increase survived the suspense file today a proposal to increase taxes on international corporations to fund homeless services here s a look at some key proposals that stalled in today s massive culling criminal justice a year after protests across the country over police accountability and racism lobbying by law enforcement groups effectively watered down or stopped a handful of bills aimed at policing the police a proposed requirement that background checks explore if law enforcement officers have been affiliated with hate groups in the past stalled amid opposition from the california correctional peace officers association a bill requiring police departments to pull in different agencies to investigate police shootings of armed people is on hold until next year the biggest police reform bill of the year which would allow the state to kick bad cops out of the profession for certain types of misconduct and make it easier for people to sue officers and departments for civil rights violations survived the suspense file but only after it was watered down the version that s moving ahead is more limited in when a person can sue the police a change the bill s author state sen steven bradford said was difficult to accept but the gardena democrat said in a statement compromise requires us to work together to find common ground for the second year in a row the appropriations committee killed a bill requiring law enforcement agencies to process their backlogged rape kits the california public defenders association argued the bill would take away resources to test other types of evidence byrhonda lyons and robert lewis housing an effort to streamline affordable housing funding by creating one place for developers to apply for tax credits bonds and subsidies is on hold until next year uc berkeley s terner center and the state auditor argued this approach would cut the cost and time it takes to build affordable housing but state treasurer fiona ma whose office would have given up some power called the overhaul risky assemblymember buffy wicks third attempt to create a registry making it easier to determine who owns rental housing died amid opposition from the california association of realtors which argued the registry would burden property owners the realtors a political powerhouse in sacramento spent nearly 350 000 on lobbying between january and march and also opposed a measure to curb evictions and another to help first time homebuyers by ending a mortgage interest deduction on second homes which died before they even got to the assembly appropriations committee manuela tobias poverty and inequality a proposal to shield more californians who are late on water bills from having their water shut off stalled in the face of opposition from municipal water agencies but hope is not lost for those late on water bills newsom wants to spend 1 billion to bail out consumers and providers crushed by water debt and another bill to create a water assistance program survived today s bloodbath a number of proposals aimed at using the tax system to help low income consumers also died including a bill to make parents without income eligible for california s tax credit for young children of as much as 1 000 a proposal to help low income workers maximize their tax refund by choosing from the last three years of income and a plan to create a state tax credit for employers who hire people who are disabled veterans on public assistance or formerly incarcerated for each legislative analysts questioned whether the benefits outweigh the cost to the state jackie botts health care insurance companies prevailed in killing a bill that would have allowed the state to require health plans to issue emergency payments to struggling health providers in public health crises the legislation was backed by doctors and dentists who said the pandemic left many medical and dental practices cash strapped because of fewer patient visits a bill to hire a chief school nurse at the state level also failed even though as calmatters reported last year california is one of only 10 states without someone in that position ana b ibarra and barbara feder ostrov environment an attempt to streamline permitting for residential solar systems died amid opposition from unions representing electrical workers environmental groups supported the bill that would have required cities and counties to establish online permitting and automated approvals for residential solar systems a response to the often sluggish permitting process and the associated costs that has caused consumers to cool toward adopting solar systems environmentalists also lost out with the stalling of a bill to require companies doing business in california with more than 1 billion in annual revenues to publicly report their greenhouse gas emissions from both direct sources such as manufacturing and indirect such as from their supply chain the bill s delay until next year shows just how much control corporate polluters still have in california the head of the california league of conservation voters said in a statement julie cart higher education legislation aimed at preventing universities from reducing students financial aid when they receive private scholarships is on hold until at least next year a bill that would have dedicated 20 million to expand mental health services to students attending the state s public colleges and universities also stalled but assemblymember kevin mccarty said he ll try to fund it through the state budget legislation to ensure support staff at california state university campuses get 5 merit raises failed amid opposition from university leaders another measure that stalled would have barred the university of california from entering into contracts with health providers that forbid uc medical staff from providing reproductive healthcare and gender affirming care for transgender patients it was pulled to give the uc until next year to establish its own policies said a spokesperson for the bill s author sen scott wiener of san francisco the proposal was also opposed by catholic hospitals which have partnerships with uc hospitals left to live another day is arguably the most consequential higher education bill a massive expansion of state financial aid felicia mello and mikhail zinshteyn broadband access and internet safety the pandemic induced shift to remote work and distance learning prompted a slate of proposals aimed at closing the digital divide two of them died today concern that kids can too easily drift into violent or inappropriate content online prompted a bill that would have prohibited features such as auto play videos and in app purchases unless parents opt in for their children but it died for a second year in a row even after being narrowed to address the tech industry s opposition to an earlier version jackie botts ben christopher and zayna syed calmatters reporters rachel becker nigel duara and jocelyn wiener contributed to this story for the record an earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that bills to increase transparency and accountability on nursing home ownership and to shorten the waiting period for end of life decisions had been killed also the story has been changed to say that a bill to require reporting of greenhouse gas emissions has been delayed a year the suspense files california bills vanish almost without a trace as befits a good murder plot california lawmakers target potential victims by placing the bills on what they call the suspense file
a second lawsuit has been filed to overturn a newly passed capital gains tax in washington the lawsuit by the opportunity for all coalition ofac which successfully fought seattle s high earners income tax in 2017 was filed thursday in douglas county superior court the plaintiffs include business owners and farmers who would potentially be subject to the new tax as well as the washington farm bureau last month the conservative freedom foundation filed a similar lawsuit in douglas county court on behalf of five high worth individuals and one couple both lawsuits which are likely to be consolidated contend the 7 percent tax on gains above 250 000 from the sale of such things as stocks and bonds violates both the state and federal constitutions it s unconstitutional it s unwanted by the citizens of the state and it s really unnecessary said collin hathaway a business owner who serves as president of ofac specifically the lawsuit says the capital gains tax is an illegal excise tax on income the plaintiffs also argue it runs afoul of the state constitution by imposing a non uniform tax on property and by exceeding the state s one percent cap on property taxes additionally the lawsuit alleges the tax violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution by taxing activity that happens outside of washington the state legislature is attempting to get around the rules for income taxes in our state by instead imposing an excise tax on capital gains income said republican former attorney general rob mckenna who filed the complaint on behalf of ofac and the plaintiffs the washington supreme court has consistently ruled since the 1930s that income is a form of property and therefore subject to both the uniformity clause and the one percent cap washington voters have also repeatedly rejected income tax proposals including as recently as 2010 when they soundly defeated a proposed high earners income tax while other states and the federal government treat capital gains as income supporters of the washington tax insist that it s an excise tax on the sale of certain capital assets like stocks and bonds we knew a legal challenge was possible but passed what we believe is a constitutional policy that will make our state a better place for us all said democratic state sen june robinson the prime sponsor of the tax bill in a statement it s widely expected the capital gains tax will end up before the state supreme court if that happens the court could potentially revisit its prior rulings that income is property however in an interview mckenna sketched out a different scenario based on what happened in the seattle income tax fight in that case he noted the supreme court declined to take the case on direct review after the tax was struck down by a king county superior court judge and the supreme court declined again to review the case after an appeals court upheld the lower court ruling that is a course of events that could unfold mckenna said majority democrats in the washington legislature passed the capital gains tax last month after years of proposing and discussing the idea they view it as a way to make the state s tax structure less regressive while raising new revenues from the state s wealthiest taxpayers the first 500 million raised would be dedicated to the state s education legacy trust account to expand access to early learning and child care while the capital gains tax includes exemptions for real estate and timberlands some farmers are concerned they could still end up paying the tax on the sale of farmlands the plaintiffs in the ofac lawsuit include farmers orchardists and the state s farm bureau the plaintiffs include april clayton who operates red apple orchards in orondo kevin and renee bouchey who are former co owners of s k d farms in richland and rosella and burr mosby who own mosby farms near auburn the other plaintiffs are christopher and catherine senske who are in the lawn and pest control business in kennewick matthew sonderen who is co president and part owner of sonderen packaging in spokane and joanna cable who previously worked in finance and investment banking all of the plaintiffs are members of the washington policy center a right of center pro business think tank which helped find the plaintiffs and provided the legal team with research ofac was founded in 2017 by matt mcilwain the managing director of madrona venture group in seattle the capital gains tax is scheduled to take effect on jan 1 2022
it s been a rocky ride for investors in cryptocurrencies lately bitcoin the best known of these virtual assets is down nearly 40 since hitting a record of just under 65 000 in mid april so what s happening there are a handful of reasons why the value of digital currencies is plunging there is the sell off we are seeing on wall street over inflation fears that s spilling over there is also concern that regulators around the world including in the united states will crack down on these virtual assets and then there s tesla ceo elon musk whose comments continue to move cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin but perhaps the biggest reason is the simplest of them all these are risky and volatile investments and that s how they are behaving remember bitcoin is a young asset it has only been around for 13 years and you used to be able to buy it for a few bucks here s a closer look at cryptocurrencies wild ride weren t we just talking about a boom in bitcoin yes until recently we were during the pandemic novice and traditional investors started buying digital currencies in droves a case in point over a year ago bitcoin was trading at under 7 000 and then went on to peak at near 65 000 last month the same excitement that led amateur traders in robinhood s app to buy gamestop s shares fueled the frenzy over cryptocurrencies for months people were stuck at home with time on their hands and for a while at least it seemed like it was a sure thing prices kept going up and up ed moya senior market analyst at oanda called bitcoin an easy trade with a one way move over the last year many large institutional investors also started to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios and that gave them some added legitimacy according to liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab it was hard not to notice how much money was being funneled into the digital currencies it just feeds on itself she says so what s happening now as it turns out cryptocurrencies are not insulated from what has been a wider sell off in markets the stock market has been hit hard since last week as a surge in consumer prices sparked concerns about inflation investors are worried that prices will continue to rise and that the federal reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected but wasn t bitcoin supposed to be a hedge against inflation that was the argument by bitcoin enthusiasts though many analysts do not think that s actually the case moya from oanda notes that cryptocurrencies remain a speculative asset and when there is a market sell off bitcoin and fellow virtual assets will drop in value too in that sense moya argues it s not like gold widely seen as the ultimate hedge against inflation what about regulations that s another factor hitting cryptocurrencies many virtual currency adherents are deeply skeptical of the role governments and central banks play in the financial system the irony is that as investments in bitcoin and other assets become more widespread they will attract more regulatory scrutiny the treasury department on thursday announced that it would require businesses that undertake transfers of at least 10 000 worth of cryptocurrencies to report those to the irs gary gensler the new chairman of the securities and exchange commission has made it clear digital currencies are something his agency will focus on and this week china s central bank banned financial institutions from taking part in any transactions made up of cryptocurrencies and what about musk musk has become closely associated with bitcoin and other virtual currencies for example the billionaire promoted a virtual currency called dogecoin which started off as a joke that sparked a surge in prices but the currency then crashed after musk referred to it as a hustle when he hosted saturday night live this month but musk has been most closely associated with bitcoin he has been the biggest cheerleader for bitcoin moya says the market is still sensitive to these influencers musk sparked a rally in bitcoin after he announced in february that his car company tesla had bought 1 5 billion worth of bitcoin and that it would accept payments in the virtual asset but musk stunned investors by announcing this month that tesla would stop accepting payments in bitcoin because of concerns about the impact on the environment in so doing he brought attention to something that has dogged digital currencies since their inception that they require a lot of energy to mine so what about those environmental concerns the environmental impact is big uncovering bitcoin or mining involves big computers working to solve very complex math formulas yes it s complicated that requires enormous power and it s often done in countries such as china that rely on dirtier energy sources like coal researchers at the university of cambridge in the united kingdom for example estimated that mining for bitcoin consumes more energy annually than the whole of argentina several of bitcoin s competitors see this as a way to differentiate themselves from the digital currency and they are playing up their more environmentally friendly bona fides so finally what s the big takeaway a simple one that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are incredibly volatile investments it can go through head spinning rallies that are then followed by equally head spinning crashes sometimes in a single day markets experienced this firsthand on wednesday in the morning bitcoin fell over 30 only to turn around and surge more than 30 in the afternoon that s why most analysts caution amateur investors against cryptocurrencies though they say the assets can make sense if held as long term investments or for professional investors it s too volatile for most investors moya from oanda says but i think for longer term investors depending on when you got in you still might feel calm confident in your investment copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

comparable store sales up a robust 13 versus 2019 as previously announced financial results and guidance throughout fiscal 21 will be compared against fiscal 2019 we believe the significant impact from the extended closure of our operations in the spring of 2020 and the disruptions caused by covid 19 throughout last year make this a more relevant basis for comparison for the first quarter home was the best performing major merchandise area while the midwest was the strongest region similar to ross dd s discounts business trend significantly improved during the quarter results were far above our expectations with outstanding sales gains and a rebound in operating profits for the period at quarter end consolidated inventories were down 6 versus 2019 packaway levels ended at 34 of the total compared to 44 for the same period in 2019 as we used a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead of planned sales average selling store inventories were down 1 relative to 2019 as noted in today s release our board authorized a new program to repurchase 1 5 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2022 with plans to buyback 650 million this year and 850 million in 2022 the reinstatement of our share repurchase program reflects the current strength of our balance sheet confidence in the company s ability to generate excess cash after funding growth and other capital needs of the business and our long standing commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return turning to store growth our 2021 expansion program is unchanged with plans to open approximately 20 total locations comprised of 40 ross and 20 dd s discounts as usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores as a reminder our conservative opening plans this year especially for the spring season were set in 2020 during the onset of the pandemic when it was impossible to predict when the health crisis would subside looking forward to 2022 we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 new stores now travis marquette will provide further details on our first quarter results second quarter guidance and outlook for the year travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you barbara as previously mentioned comparable store sales increased 13 in the quarter driven by a larger average basket while traffic was down slightly compared to 2019 it accelerated significantly relative to the fourth quarter operating margin was well above plan at 14 2 compared to 14 1 for the same period in 2019 cost of goods sold levered 35 basis points in the quarter merchandise margin was up 85 basis points and occupancy levered by 60 these improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs of 75 basis points mainly driven by the ongoing industrywide supply chain congestion in addition distribution expenses grew 25 basis points primarily due to higher wages while buying costs increased by 10 sg a for the quarter delevered by 25 basis points mainly due to the operating expenses associated with the pandemic and higher incentive costs given our better than expected first quarter results total net covid related expenses for the period were approximately 35 basis points the vast majority of which impacted sg a now let s discuss our guidance as barbara just mentioned our projections compared to the same period in 2019 for the 13 weeks ended july 31 2021 we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 5 to 7 earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in the range of 0 80 to 0 89 the operating statement assumptions that support our second quarter guidance include the following total sales are projected to grow 9 to 12 we are projecting operating margin to be 9 2 to 9 9 compared to 13 7 in 2019 this forecast reflects ongoing expense headwinds from increased freight costs and higher wages in addition covid related expenses are projected to negatively impact ebit margins by approximately 100 basis points in the period as we return to pre pandemic store operating standards while still maintaining many of the extra cleaning routines we expect to open 30 stores during the second quarter consisting of 22 ross and eight dd s discounts net interest expense is estimated to be about 19 million our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25 and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 355 million for the full year we are projecting annual comparable store sales gains of 7 to 9 versus 2019 and earnings per share of 3 93 to 4 20 operating statement assumptions that support our fiscal 2021 guidance include the following total sales are projected to grow 11 to 13 we project that operating margin for 2021 will be in the range of 10 7 to 11 2 compared to 13 4 in 2019 the forecasted decline again reflects our expectations for continued freight wage and covid cost headwinds through the balance of the year net interest expense is estimated to be about 75 million our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24 to 25 and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 354 million now i ll turn the call back to barbara for closing comments barbara rentler chief executive officer thank you travis to sum up we re optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year and hope to do better than our forecast this confidence is based on our recent results and ongoing improvements in the macroeconomic environment bolstered by vaccine rollouts and the easing of pandemic related restrictions that said it s difficult to predict the lasting impact from the factors that benefited our first quarter sales results especially the recent government stimulus payment as always we ll remain nimble to address the dynamic consumer and retail landscape while staying focused on delivering the great bargains our customer has come to expect from us longer term we remain confident about our opportunity to gain market share as we expect to benefit significantly from the favorable competitive climate given the large number of retail store closures and bankruptcies in recent years this along with the consumers heightened focus on value and convenience bodes well for our ability to achieve solid results into the future at this point we d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have questions and answers operator your first question comes from matthew boss from jpmorgan matthew boss jpmorgan analyst great thanks and congrats on the really strong improvement so barbara maybe could you speak to the cadence of business and any notable changes in traffic or category demand as the quarter progressed and then travis on gross margin i guess maybe just how best to think about the puts and takes in the second quarter that you re embedding relative to 2019 barbara rentler chief executive officer sure matthew so let s start with category demand there was really broad based acceleration across all merchandise areas with obviously home having very strong performance for us and for other people across the country but what we did see is a major improvement in apparel and as we feel as the economy starts to open up that apparel will continue to strengthen as time goes on with a lot of change in trends we re monitoring that we re flexing and moving the business around based on what the customer is telling us so we feel in totality we feel overall pretty good about the business going forward in terms of traffic travis you want to take the traffic piece travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah just let me break down comp a little bit i mentioned comp was 13 and it was driven by a larger average basket size that was partially offset by lower number of transactions traffic was down slightly compared to 2019 but it accelerated significantly compared to the fourth quarter the increase in the average basket was driven by items per transaction as average unit retail was up slightly and then i think your next question was around just the guidance operating margin guidance for q2 matthew boss jpmorgan analyst yeah just any puts and takes on the second quarter travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean second quarter again we the overall guidance reflects a couple of things one obviously the comp store gain is expected to be lower than what we saw in the first quarter and therefore we ll get a little bit less leverage on the business in addition on covid costs we expect to also be higher that will primarily impact sg a we also expect to see continued significant pressure on freight we saw that in the first quarter both in ocean freight as well as overall freight and we think that will those pressures will continue matthew boss jpmorgan analyst great best of luck operator your next question comes from mark altschwager from baird mark altschwager robert w baird analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my question i appreciate all the detailed guidance i guess overall if i have all the numbers down correctly i think the guide implies ebit margins down about 250 basis points this year versus 2019 could you characterize i mean how much of the step down is related to the covid costs which are hopefully temporary versus some of the more pressures on freight and wages that could persist moving forward just trying to think about how that ebit margin might progress as we move beyond this year thank you michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer mark it s michael hartshorn we re obviously optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year and we hope to do better than our sales and margin forecast we do expect expense headwinds through the balance of the year and if you break down the covid cost at some point those will not continue but we expect them to be in place our guidance assumes that they re in place throughout the year wage costs we would expect to persist and at some point freight we would expect to persist throughout the year and we ll see how that balances out over the coming years but overall the recovery to 2019 margin levels is highly dependent on strong sales performance and over time and again the persistence of the cost inflation we re seeing today especially in things like freight operator your next question comes from adrienne yih from barclays adrienne yih barclays analyst good afternoon let me add my congratulations on the top line improvement barbara my first question is for you on the merchandise margin of up 85 basis points i just want to make sure that that is separate and aside so you don t have inbound freight in that number because obviously we ve got a separate number for total freight so that s number one and then can you give us the components of aur versus auc on that i m imagining your aurs up meaningfully are you getting a relative pricing umbrella from frontline meaning that if you re 20 to 60 on frontline and frontline s clean that you re able to maybe clear at a higher price and lastly was mix from home versus apparel did home grow faster and was that an impact on the merchandise margin thank you so much travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is travis let me just take a couple of those that you mentioned one just in terms of what s included in merchandise margin when we say inbound freight ocean freight is included in that number and so that s embedded and we had mentioned previously that we expected meaningful headwinds promotion freight and we saw those and expect those to continue as we move through the year and then i think you also had a question about apparel versus non apparel and sort of the mix we saw broad based improvements across the store but non apparel home continue to be the strongest category but we definitely saw an improvement in apparel as well as we move through the quarter michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer and then adrienne on aur aur was up slightly during the quarter adrienne yih barclays analyst okay all right go ahead barbara rentler chief executive officer just relative the other part you re asking about is relative to department stores because they promoted lesser aurs reflecting the pricing umbrella yeah so our aur is up slightly but compared so that is just we just offered a greater value to department store pricing at this point in time the price value equation is the business that we re in the relativity to it but this at this moment our price values are actually stronger than they normally would be to department stores adrienne yih barclays analyst okay great and then if i may just on hourly payroll i don t really don t know how to ask but because i know these are sensitive numbers but if we really look at freight as a percent of sales and now i m talking about the outbound freight because now i know that the inbound freight is inside the merch margin that line that deleveraged 75 basis points versus the line item that is wage or hourly payroll what would be the sort of order of magnitude like is it is the payroll line 3 times as much as the freight line or something like that just so mentally i can understand like if one of them is moving materially higher than the other which has the bigger impact on the p l thank you very much michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer adrienne it s michael hartshorn again we wouldn t give you specifics other than what we provided in the guidance other than to say both freight and wages first on freight given the robust overall economic rebound there continues to be significant supply chain congestion and cost have increased versus our original expectations and so our current guidance assumes additional escalation as we move through the year on wages that also remains very dynamic we ve made market by market adjustments in our stores as we always have to attract talent warehousing labor is very competitive and we ve made additional adjustments in all of our distribution centers and that s also reflected in our guidance adrienne yih barclays analyst okay thank you very much operator your next question comes from kimberly greenberger from morgan stanley kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst okay great thank you so much barbara obviously the prudent planning for sales going forward a very conservative plan compared to the very robust first quarter that seems very very prudent to us i m wondering are you seeing any slowdown so far here in the second quarter that sort of underscoring your desire to plan more conservatively or are you just looking forward and saying ok there were some really sort of one time benefits as it were that happened here in the first quarter so it s just naturally prudent for us to plan more conservatively barbara rentler chief executive officer barbara rentler kimberly i think we re thinking more about the first quarter and the lasting impact from some of those factors the stimulus payments that were out there and what does that really mean as we go forward so we re comfortable with the number of where we sit today but that s really some of those pent up demand some of those things that we re not sure how that goes forward completely at this point kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst yeah i know it s a very uncertain path forward thank you for that michael you talked about you ve got a plan this year for covid cost to basically continue through the year so i m wondering if you can just sort of isolate the covid costs and based on what you experienced here in the first quarter and then whatever you ve got in your forecast for the second third and fourth quarter could you just give us a rough dollar amount of what you re budgeting this year for covid cost and would it be fair to assume that those costs would roll off in future years travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hi kimberly this is travis let me just kind of do a little bit of a reset remind folks kind of how we talk about covid costs we report covid costs as net which is to say that they include pandemic related increases in cost for things like personal protective equipment extra cleaning but there are offsets within that number as well for cost savings that we took for things like travel and when we closed our fitting rooms as the pandemic subsides apparels becoming more important we think it s important to take some actions including reopening our fitting rooms which is going to eliminate some of the cost savings that we had before and it drives up the overall covid cost number for q1 as we reported the covid costs were about 35 basis points on the quarter for q2 and going forward we re estimating those they will be around 100 basis points for the balance of the year again that assumes where we are today that we have not removed and we not built into the plan to remove any of the additional cleaning activities and protocols that we ve put into place having said that we will continue to monitor guidance from the cdc and other health experts we ll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and our customers but to the extent that that guidance changes then we could reevaluate some of those protocols and adjust those plans michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer and kimberly to answer your question on how long they last those costs are not permanent so as the pandemic resides though its cost would come back out of the business kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst fantastic thanks so much operator your next question comes from chuck grom from gordon haskett chuck grom gordon haskett analyst hey thanks good quarter my question is just on the first quarter you originally guided to comps down 1 to 5 and you far exceeded that up 13 just curious if you guys could just unpack the outperformance either by category how much you think was stimulus i just wanted to ask that question thanks matthew boss jpmorgan analyst go ahead barbara sorry barbara rentler chief executive officer okay so if you re talking about by merchandise category chuck grom gordon haskett analyst yeah barbara rentler chief executive officer so we ll start there so it was very broad based obviously home has accelerated for everyone and we still feel very good about home as we go forward but the additional acceleration really came out of apparel and that was also very broad based as a customer kind of came from just wearing activewear moving into more real what i would call real apparel even though casual but still broader classifications of product so and that was broad based and so that s why we feel good about apparel as we go forward michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer and then just overall in the quarter as barbara mentioned in her opening comments there are a number of factors that led to the increase obviously the stimulus very difficult to put a number on the 400 billion of stimulus to the consumer that continues we ll continue federal stimulus there is also states that have stimulus so that will continue through the second quarter if not throughout the year with some of the child credits there is the vaccine ramping up and so customers are becoming more and more confident returning to brick and mortar stores we expect that to continue as the vaccination rates increase if you look at our regional performance as we said in the commentary midwest was the top performing region of our biggest states california performance improved significantly versus the prior quarter as government restrictions eased and as comp was relatively similar to the chain average so there is a lot of different factors driving the comp in the first quarter chuck grom gordon haskett analyst great thanks so much operator your next question comes from lorraine hutchinson from bank of america lorraine hutchinson bank of america analyst thanks good afternoon barbara could you discuss availability of product in the better trending category and then do you think there s sufficient availability for you to start rebuilding your packaway balances into the back half barbara rentler chief executive officer sure availability in the better trending businesses yeah i would say overall the availability is there to chase we have a large merchant team and so they are out there looking for the goods constantly i think there s two things about it one is the trends are shifting in front of us so things are moving very very quickly so it should start with that and the trends toward just say like active apparel to other parts of sportswear are shifting quickly and so far i would say yes we have been able to chase the business get what we need get the availability that s out there it s more getting the combination of kind of getting ahead of the trend that is shifting in the outside world that we re shifting with it and that we get ahead of it but yeah so i feel comfortable that the availability is there in the businesses that the customer wants at this moment in time and then say it again lorraine what was the second question lorraine hutchinson bank of america analyst i was just wondering how you expected packaway to evolve over the coming quarters if there s sufficient availability for you to be able to rebuild that barbara rentler chief executive officer we think we ll build packaway over time closer to historical levels but i do think it will take time as we are very much chasing the business and if that chase were to continue i think it would take us a little bit of time the packaway fluctuates also it s not only that the availability is there it s the right product the right value the right we had to have all the right metrics to be going into packaway at the same time so i do think it will take a little bit of time but there is sufficient availability to be driving our business and to buy packaway and the total picture operator your next question comes from ike boruchow from wells fargo ike boruchow wells fargo securities analyst hey guys just a quick one for travis just on the freight headwind you gave us for q1 just curious should we assume that that should be run rated through the rest of the year or should that cost headwind that you have potentially moderate based on the contracts you guys have thanks michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer hi ike it s michael i ll take that first even the contracted rates were significantly higher than 2019 levels in addition like other retailers we re incurring higher costs to move freight really both internationally and domestically we re spending we have higher cost to land freight when expected so given the robust overall economic rebound as i said earlier in the call we expect freight costs to escalate for the remainder of the year and that s included in our guidance ike boruchow wells fargo securities analyst thanks operator your next question comes from michael binetti from credit suisse michael binetti credit suisse analyst hey guys thanks for taking our questions here i guess two quick ones we see the sales guidance i appreciate the conservatism i think it s been the right move through the year here and with the visibility where it is but if sales trends do remain strong as strong as they were in 1q relative to what you thought a pretty significant upside sales scenario can you tell us how to think about sales flow through in the model relative to the framework you ve told us about in the past and then barb just a comment you made earlier why not extend the relative value back up to the normal rate relative to the department stores why hold it lower if they re moving higher just so we can think alongside you on that barbara rentler chief executive officer sure listen department store didn t promote as much for the first time in a very long time and so i think we d have to see what that looks like because they promoted for years and years and years so we ve had one quarter under their belt where the aurs probably higher and they haven t promoted i think we have to see what happens in the future and also i think it s important while we can get great values to the customer price value is absolutely critical to our customer and so we are going to value the goods the way we think the customer expects them where the customer expects them to be and so raising the aur and changing your value equation is a very delicate thing and so i think having one quarter underneath our belt with lots of money stimulus and lots of things going on in there driving sales i think it s very very much remains to be seen and it is very important in off price and critical in our business model to offer that price value of the customers very savvy and shopping all the time so again not sustained yet in department stores don t know how that s really going to land and then with all the money in the stimulus out there i don t know how to take that as a go forward strategy has to read at this moment in time travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer this is travis in terms of the operating margin flow through on above sales above plan we continue to expect comp outperformance to drive increased operating margin flow through compared to the guidance that we provided but i don t think we would necessarily expect it to be quite as strong as we saw in q1 but we do expect operating margin improvements as comp exceeds our plan michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer and then the flow through on this guidance would look like it has historically michael binetti credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from marni shapiro from retail tracker marni shapiro retail tracker analyst hey guys congrats and barbara the department store as we all know where they re going they re going right back to promotions if you could give me a little bit of guidance around your traffic during the quarter and what you re seeing around things like schools reopened the easter holiday did you see a pop around when the stimulus checks pop came into hand or around mother s day just trying to get a feeling about the cadence of the traffic if it s an everyday or she s also being sparked to come into store by events travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is travis i can talk a bit about traffic again generally we don t provide sort of detailed traffic trends by month but given the timing of tax refunds and stimulus payments you can imagine that sales were stronger later in the quarter and then at the beginning in terms of traffic trends again traffic for us it s transactions that mirrors pretty close to our sales trends marni shapiro retail tracker analyst fantastic best of luck for the summer guys operator your next question comes from laura champine from loop capital laura champine loop capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my question to the previous point travis when you guys at the guidance for q2 sales did you just take the trend before the stimulus and extrapolate that there or how did you what was the basis of that q2 sales guide travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer the comp sales guide no again i think michael we ve talked about it there are a number of factors that drove that q1 performance be it stimulus pent up demand vaccine rollout etc and it s difficult to precisely predict how long some of those will last and so we took that into account and projected forward what we think is our current plan and best guess for q2 and we certainly hope to do better laura champine loop capital markets analyst got it in the back half related to that is there anything in your expectations for the benefit from the enhanced child tax credit and historically when this sort of stimulus has come through do you see it in your numbers michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer well i would say it s hard to say at this point we ve not seen this type of stimulus even in the first quarter in a very long time as travis said we set a baseline and we clearly hope we can do better than the guidance that we put out laura champine loop capital markets analyst understood thank you operator your next question comes from jay sole from ubs jay sole ubs analyst great thanks so much my question is about the full year guidance specifically about the fourth quarter when we get to the fourth quarter again in january we ll be lapping the stimulus that happened in january how are you thinking about what impact that might have on the business in fourth quarter in the fourth quarter and how might fourth quarter sales and gross margin compare to what we saw this past year travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we ll provide guidance as we move through the year right now we typically provide guidance quarter by quarter so we ll have more to say as we move through the year on the fourth quarter jay sole ubs analyst what do you think that the january sales will be down year over year travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer we wouldn t comment at this point jay sole ubs analyst got it okay well then maybe if i can ask one more are you still seeing right now the impacts of stimulus is there anyway to measure whether whatever you re seeing in may is sort of still a tailwind from the stimulus that was distributed in march and april or is now some other factor become a bigger driver here in may travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we wouldn t as barbara said at the beginning we don t comment on it s our practice not to comment on intra quarter trends i can tell you certainly in the first quarter we think stimulus had a significant impact among other factors that we called out earlier jay sole ubs analyst got it okay thank you so much operator your next question comes from paul trussell from deutsche bank krisztina katai deutsche bank analyst hi good afternoon this is krisztina katai on for paul i just wanted to add my congrats on a great quarter i just wanted to circle back to merchandise margin and the strength that has been there for the last three quarters how do you see the current environment evolving from just a buying perspective and can you just speak to the sustainability of the strength to potentially drive pre covid gross profit margins if you re essentially making these strong sales trends travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in terms of merchandise margin again the buying environment remains very dynamic margins will vary significantly based on our overall sales performance we ve talked over the last several quarters that the buying environment has been quite strong and we benefited from that obviously in the first quarter we also benefited from significant above planned sales which drove faster turns and fewer markdowns so those were all positive in terms of how long it sustains we ll see i mean we have our best guess built into the guidance and we obviously hope to do better and to the extent we do we d expect to see some further benefit krisztina katai deutsche bank analyst got it that s helpful and i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about more what you re seeing as it relates to just general consumer really enough to return to your stores if you have any data on this what portion of your pre pandemic shoppers have returned to shop with you regularly and are you seeing any demographic changes perhaps older consumers are returning to your stores vaccines are being rolled out here relatively quickly michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer on the consumer what we are seeing is the consumer we ve seen our consumer shop less but they are buying more during their shopping trips the demographics of our customer base did skew younger during the peak of the pandemic given older customers hesitancy to shop in brick and mortar stores we believe customers of all ages are returning to stores with the increased vaccination rates and that s especially true with older customers where the vaccination rates are much higher overall we know that she continues to prioritize value and convenience when deciding where to shop and with the large number of retail closures she obviously has fewer places to shop now krisztina katai deutsche bank analyst great best of luck operator your next question comes from paul lejuez from citi tracy kogan citigroup analyst hey thanks it s tracy kogan filling in for paul i had two questions i was hoping first you could talk about the marketing spend in the quarter and whether you leveraged that spend and what your expectations are for the year and then secondly can you talk about the rent deals that you saw i guess for the deals you signed last year for the openings this year and how that s trended as you re signing new deals right now thanks travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer sure on the leases the real estate market is good both from a supply standpoint and what we re seeing in leases i wouldn t say specifically on a call like this but the significant of the rent favorability given the number of leases across the whole chain would not be significant in an overall leverage for instance on sales on marketing for us marketing continues to be a good reminder to our customers overall our strategic investment here it has been to move to more digital i wouldn t provide more specifics on marketing on this call tracy kogan citigroup analyst just going back to the real estate any changes from what you were seeing last year versus this year in terms of favorability is it getting better travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer i d say the story is still developing tracy so we ll see how it develops over the next couple of years obviously the availability is good and we hope to take advantage of that given all the store closures tracy kogan citigroup analyst got it thanks very much guys operator your next question comes from dana telsey from telsey advisory group dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good afternoon everyone and nice to see the progress it was mentioned about dd s in the release so i think a little bit at the beginning what are you seeing in dd s it sounds like it took an upturn for the better both in terms of sales and operating profits and anything to note there on store openings of dd s versus ross and what you re seeing either in terms of favorability of leases and also productivity this year to last this year to loi thank you michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer dana i would say that the story is very similar for dd s we did see strong gains in sales and operating profits for the period versus our expectations i would also say that dd s has the similar wage freight and covid cost expense pressures that we re seeing in ross and i would say we feel really good about the dd s performance travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer in terms of new store productivity we don t break out dd s specifically but overall new store productivity continues to be in the 60 to 65 range that we ve talked about historically michael j hartshorn group president and chief operating officer on the real estate rollout we would expect to beyond this year dd s grow dd s at 20 to 25 stores per year dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst thank you operator your next question comes from andrea magotti from barclays andrea magotti barclays analyst hey thank you so much for taking the question i was hoping you could update us on your thoughts as to potentially continuing to bring down your debt balance given your where the cash balance currently stands and any further thoughts on improving the balance sheet thank you travis marquette executive vice president and chief financial officer sure our expectation is that we re going to pay down our existing debts so we re not going to refinance it the timing if it s economically advantageous to pay off early we would consider it but if not we would expect to pay off our existing debt at maturity andrea magotti barclays analyst thank you so much operator that was our last question i will turn the call over to barbara rentler for closing comments barbara rentler chief

the u s district court for the northern district of california applying california law has found that a single lawsuit contains multiple claims stem inc v scottsdale ins co 2021 wl 1736823 n d cal may 3 2021 the court concluded that no coverage was available for one claim because it constituted a claim first made prior to the policy period but coverage was available for a second claim that did not relate back to the first claim the insured a technology company sought coverage under its directors and officers policy for a shareholder lawsuit 2017 lawsuit based on a 2013 stock financing round 2013 stock financing and a 2017 loan to the company by a member of the board of directors 2017 loan the 2017 lawsuit also contained allegations concerning a 2010 employment dispute involving the termination of the insured s co founder 2010 employment dispute the insurer denied coverage for the 2017 lawsuit on several grounds including that the 2017 lawsuit was a claim first made prior to the policy period relating back to the 2010 employment dispute the court concluded that the 2017 lawsuit consisted of two claims the policy defined claim to include a written demand against any insured for monetary damages or non monetary or injunctive relief and a civil proceeding against any insured seeking monetary damages or non monetary or injunctive relief commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading the court reasoned that the 2017 lawsuit asserts causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty conspiracy and unjust enrichment based on allegations that the underlying defendants schemed to dilute the underlying plaintiffs shares through the and also asserts a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty based on allegations that the constituted impermissible self dealing accordingly the court concluded that the causes of action relating to the and the were separate demand for monetary damages and thus separate claims even though the policy also defined claim as a civil proceeding the court then concluded that the interrelated wrongful act exclusion barred coverage for the 2013 stock financing claim because it was interrelated to the 2010 employment dispute which was a claim made prior to the policy period the court also concluded that the prior and pending litigation breach of application and insured verses insured exclusions barred coverage for the 2013 stock financing claim the court found however that coverage was available for the 2017 loan claim because it did not relate back to the 2010 employment dispute and no other exclusion applied
washington ap the number of americans seeking unemployment aid fell last week to 444 000 a new pandemic low and a sign that the job market keeps strengthening as consumers spend freely again viral infections drop and business restrictions ease thursday s report from the labor department coincides with moves by nearly all the nation s republican governors to cut off a 300 a week federal unemployment benefit that they and many business executives blame for discouraging the unemployed from seeking jobs those cutoffs of federal jobless aid will begin in june jobless people have been able to receive the 300 weekly benefit on top of their regular state unemployment aid in addition to ending the federal benefit most of the same states are also withdrawing from programs that provided jobless aid to self employed or gig workers and to people who have been unemployed for more than six months twenty two states from texas and georgia to ohio and iowa will end the 300 federal payment starting in june according to an associated press analysis two more states florida and kansas are considering doing so those 24 states all have republican governors and state legislatures about 3 5 million people will see their benefits reduced in the coming months according to oxford economics in oklahoma republican gov kevin stitt said this week that the state will end the federal benefit on june 26 that was unhappy news for gilbert cruz and his wife marrissa enloe cruz whose graphic design company in tulsa has suffered a collapse in business since the pandemic struck both received jobless aid under the program for self employed but even with the 600 a week in federal aid between the two of them they had earned more from their business before the pandemic now they re unsure what they ll do especially because they re uneasy about sending their 7 year old son back to school before being vaccinated it s going to mean picking and choosing what bills to pay or getting behind on things enloe cruz said it will mean whether or not we re able to put food on the table thursday s data release showed that applications for unemployment benefits declined 34 000 from a revised 478 000 a week earlier the number of weekly jobless claims a rough measure of the pace of layoffs has declined steadily since the year began about 16 million people were receiving unemployment benefits during the week ending may 1 the latest period for which data is available the government said thursday that is down from 16 9 million in the previous week and it suggests that some americans who had been receiving aid have found jobs eliminating the 300 a week federal unemployment benefit is one of several measures that states have taken to restrict or eliminate jobless aid and press more recipients to seek work that trend gained momentum after the april jobs report released earlier this month showed that employers added far fewer jobs than expected in part because many couldn t find enough workers twenty one states say they will also cut off all benefits for the self employed and gig workers who became newly eligible for jobless aid under a relief package that was enacted in march last year they will also drop out of a federal program for those who have been out of work for more than six months those moves will end all benefits for approximately 3 6 million of the nearly 16 million people receiving aid or about one in four of current recipients according to the century foundation in addition 35 states have reinstated a requirement that jobless aid recipients search for work in order to keep receiving benefits that requirement had been suspended at the start of the pandemic when many businesses were closed and americans were encouraged to stay at home as the economy quickly recovers from the pandemic recession consumers are showing more confidence and spending at a healthy rate most economists think the economy could expand 7 this year which would amount to the fastest annual growth in more than 35 years yet the rapid reopening from the pandemic has created a wide range of supply shortages that have disrupted what economists had hoped would be a smooth rebound home building fell sharply in april for example as builders struggled with shortages of lumber and labor the shortages have caused a spike in inflation which led stock markets to tumble this week because investors worry that higher prices will force the federal reserve to prematurely cut back on its efforts to stimulate growth fed officials have stressed their belief that the accelerating price increases are temporary but the minutes of their april policy meeting released wednesday showed that some fed officials support a discussion at future meetings about dialing back their efforts copyright 2021 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed photo ap
it is generally recognized that a bankruptcy court has the power either equitable or statutory to recharacterize a purported debt as equity if the substance of the transaction belies the labels the parties have given it a ruling handed down by the u s bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york provides a textbook example of such a recharacterization in in re live primary llc 2021 wl 772248 bankr s d n y mar 1 2021 the court held that a purported loan made to a startup limited liability company by one of its members should be treated as a capital contribution because among other things the company was inadequately capitalized and the unsecured loan was not properly documented bore a de minimis interest rate and was repayable only upon the occurrence of a stock offering or a change of control recharacterization source of power to recharacterize debt as equity the power to treat a debt as if it were actually an equity interest is derived from principles of equity it emanates from the bankruptcy court s power to ignore the form of a transaction and give effect to its substance see pepper v litton 308 u s 295 305 1939 however because the bankruptcy code does not expressly empower a bankruptcy court to recharacterize debt as equity some courts disagree as to whether they have the authority to do so and if so the source of such authority every circuit court of appeals that has considered the issue has upheld the power of a bankruptcy court to recharacterize a claim as equity notwithstanding the parties characterization of a prepetition advance as a debt see generally collier on bankruptcy collier 510 02 16th ed 2021 citing cases some circuits have held that a bankruptcy court s power to recharacterize derives from the broad equitable powers set forth in section 105 a of the bankruptcy code which provides that he court may issue any order process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of see in re dornier aviation n am inc 453 f 3d 225 4th cir 2006 in re submicron sys corp 432 f 3d 448 3d cir 2006 in re hedged invs assocs inc 380 f 3d 1292 10th cir 2004 in re autostyle plastics inc 269 f 3d 726 6th cir 2001 in hedged investments the tenth circuit explained that if courts were bound by the parties own characterization of a transaction controlling equity owners of a troubled corporation could jump the line of the bankruptcy process and thwart the company s outside creditors and investors priority rights hedged investments 380 f 3d at 1298 the fifth and ninth circuits have taken a different approach holding instead that section 502 b 1 of the bankruptcy code which provides in relevant part that the court shall allow claim except to the extent that such claim is unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor under any agreement or applicable law is the proper statutory authority for recharacterization see in re lothian oil inc 650 f 3d 539 5th cir 2011 in re fitness holdings int l inc 714 f 3d 1141 9th cir 2013 the eleventh circuit has also recognized the legitimacy of the remedy but without specifying the source of the court s power to exercise it see in re n d props inc 799 f 2d 726 733 11th cir 1986 noting that shareholder loans may be deemed capital contributions where the trustee proves initial under capitalization or where the trustee proves that the loans were made when no other disinterested lender would have extended credit in in re airadigm communs inc 616 f 3d 642 653 7th cir 2010 the seventh circuit declined to decide whether recharacterization of a debt was appropriate although the bankruptcy court concluded below that it does not have the power to do so but noted that the overwhelming weight of authority supports the authority of bankruptcy courts to recharacterize loans as equity standard for recharacterization in autostyle the sixth circuit applied an 11 factor test derived for recharacterization from federal tax law among the enumerated factors are the labels given to the alleged debt the presence or absence of a fixed maturity date interest rate and schedule of payments whether the borrower is adequately capitalized any identity of interest between the creditor and the stockholders whether the loan is secured and the corporation s ability to obtain financing from outside lending institutions this and similar tests have been adopted by many other courts see e g dornier aviation 453 f 3d at 233 applying autostyle factors submicron sys corp 432 f 3d 448 seven factor test hedged investments 380 f 3d at 1298 13 factor test n d props 799 f 2d at 733 two factor test in re transcare corp 2020 wl 8021060 37 bankr s d n y july 6 2020 noting that ourts in this district have adopted the eleven factor analysis set forth in autostyle under the autostyle test no single factor is controlling instead each factor is to be considered in light of the particular circumstances of the case in lothian oil and fitness holdings the fifth and ninth circuits ruled that state law should determine whether a debt should be recharacterized as equity lothian oil 650 f 3d at 543 44 fitness holdings 714 f 3d at 1148 as explained by the court in in re adelphia commc ns corp 365 b r 24 74 bankr s d n y 2007 the paradigmatic recharacterization case involves a situation where the same individuals or entities or affiliates of such control both the transferor and the transferee and inferences can be drawn that funds were put into an enterprise with little or no expectation that they would be paid back along with other creditor claims distinction between recharacterization and equitable subordination a related but distinct remedy is equitable subordination which was developed under common law prior to the enactment of the current bankruptcy code to remedy misconduct that results in injury to creditors or shareholders it is expressly recognized in section 510 c of the bankruptcy code which provides that the bankruptcy court may under principles of equitable subordination subordinate for purposes of distribution all or part of an allowed claim to all or part of another allowed claim or all or part of an allowed interest to all or part of another allowed interest in in re mobile steel co 563 f 2d 692 5th cir 1977 the fifth circuit articulated what has become the most commonly accepted standard for equitable subordination of a claim under this standard a claim can be subordinated if the claimant engaged in some type of inequitable conduct that resulted in injury to creditors or conferred an unfair advantage on the claimant and if equitable subordination of the claim is consistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code courts have refined the mobile steel test to account for special circumstances for example many courts make a distinction between insiders e g corporate fiduciaries and non insiders in assessing the level of misconduct necessary to warrant subordination see generally collier at 510 05 as explained by the court in adelphia he recharacterization analyses focus on the substance of the transaction whereas equitable subordination analyses focus on the creditor s behavior adelphia 365 b r at 74 live primary live primary llc debtor was a shared office space company based in new york created in 2015 its members were lisa skye hain hain primary member llc pm and daniel orenstein orenstein pm was controlled by joel schreiber schreiber who was also the founder of real estate investment firm waterbridge capital waterbridge pursuant to the delaware law governed limited liability company agreement llc agreement the startup was to be funded by a 6 million loan from pm each tranche of the loan was to be evidenced by a promissory note and memorialized in a loan agreement however no loan agreement or promissory notes were ever executed the 6 million loan had no maturity date but was payable with accrued interest at the rate of 1 per annum upon the occurrence of a liquidity event e g a merger consolidation or sale of the debtor or an initial public offering ipo of the debtor s stock the llc agreement provided that if pm failed to make any required disbursement of the loan proceeds pm was obligated to pay the debtor a nonrefundable default fee pm s membership share would be diluted and the debtor was entitled to seek an alternative source of senior priority bridge financing the pm loan was to be repaid in full before any distribution to other members although pm was the nominal lender for the 6 million loan the advances were actually made by waterbridge the debtor s books and records reflected that the loan was owed to either pm or waterbridge the llc agreement was later amended to create class a units held equally by hain now the debtor s sole manager after orenstein resigned and pm and class b units held by orenstein the amended agreement provided that all transactions between the debtor managed by hain and any member or executive required the unanimous consent of the class a members hain and pm in 2019 an investor group led by david kirshenbaum kirshenbaum loaned the debtor 2 65 million the provision in the llc agreement governing member and executive transactions was then amended to require the unanimous consent of the class a members and kirshenbaum the debtor filed for chapter 11 protection in the southern district of new york on july 12 2020 pm filed a proof of claim in the case asserting a debt in the amount of approximately 6 4 million based on i the initial 6 million loan plus additional advances and accrued interest and ii 14 other loans the outstanding principal and interest of which amounted to approximately 81 000 according to pm those other loans were discussed orally but not formally documented instead they were evidenced by email correspondence among hain schreiber and waterbridge the debtor and certain of its noteholders objected to pm s claim arguing that i the claim lacked prima facie validity because it was not supported by any written documentation evidencing the loans ii the purported 6 million loan was in fact equity and should be recharacterized as such in accordance with autostyle iii the other loans which were disputed by the debtor were unauthorized loans made by waterbridge which did not file a proof of claim iv pm was not a creditor because all payments on the other loans were made to waterbridge and v pm s claim should be disallowed under section 502 d of the bankruptcy code because it received avoidable preferential transfers the bankruptcy court s ruling initially bankruptcy judge martin glenn ruled that even though pm s claim was not memorialized in a loan agreement or promissory notes the llc agreement the debtor s books and records the parties conduct and other extrinsic evidence provided prima facie evidence of the purported loans the court also held that pm had standing as a creditor to assert the claim for the loans because among other things the debtor treated pm and waterbridge interchangeably in addition judge glenn concluded that an adversary proceeding was not required to seek recharacterization because the remedy does not fall under one of the 10 exclusive categories identified in rule 7001 of the rules of bankruptcy procedure such as subordination of a claim or interest and the debtor also proposed to recharacterize pm s claim as equity under its chapter 11 plan turning to recharacterization judge glenn explained that the ultimate exercise in evaluating any recharacterization claim is to ascertain the intent of the parties quoting in re lyondell chem co 544 b r 75 102 bankr s d n y 2016 he rejected pm s argument that under delaware law the intent of the parties should be determined by reference to the terms of the llc agreement which clearly stated that the advances made by pm were loans instead judge glenn wrote it is the meticulous application of the eleven autostyle factors that reveals the actual intent of the parties examining those factors judge glenn noted that each of them supported a finding that the purported 6 million loan was in fact equity although the llc operating agreement and the debtor s books and records labeled pm s advances as loan this was not dispositive and the absence of any instruments evidencing a loan such as a master promissory note suggested otherwise the purported 6 million loan did not have a fixed maturity date the loan bore a de minimis interest rate which accrued rather than being payable periodically the only source of repayment of principal and accrued interest was the proceeds of an ipo or a liquidity event initial capital contributions under the llc operating agreement amounted to only 1 000 which was massively inadequate because the debtor was a startup in its early stages of formation pm was both a member of the debtor and the purported creditor and the structure of contributions with money from pm and contributions of sweat equity from orenstein and are indicative of equity under the llc operating agreement pm s membership interest would be reduced in proportion to the amount of the loan it failed to fund the purported 6 million loan was unsecured as a startup the debtor could not have obtained loans from other lenders that were remotely similar to the pm advances the purported 6 million loan was effectively subordinated to the claims of other creditors unless and until either an ipo or a liquidity event occurred the proceeds of the purported loan were used to acquire capital assets rather than to satisfy the debtor s daily operating needs there was no sinking fund a fund holding regular deposits that are accumulated with interest to pay off long term debt to provide for repayment of the purported loan judge glenn also held that pm s claim based on the other loans should not be disallowed as unauthorized loans because among other things the class a members approved the loans in writing as required by the llc operating agreement however he ruled that pm s claim based on the other loans must be disallowed under section 502 d because pm received and had not repaid a 40 000 avoidable transfer within 90 days of the bankruptcy petition date outlook in many respects live primary is a textbook example of the circumstances under which a bankruptcy court will conclude that a purported loan should be treated as equity the court found that every one of the 11 autostyle factors weighed in favor of recharacterizing the series of advances at issue as equity infusions many other cases are not so black and white and thus require that the court weigh various factors supporting recharacterization against those that do not in deciding whether the remedy is appropriate some of the key takeaways from live primary include i the bankruptcy court s power to disregard the labels given to a transaction and to ascertain its substance in keeping with the priority scheme underlying federal bankruptcy law and ii the fact intensive analysis required to determine whether recharacterization of a debt as equity is warranted

on may 3 2021 the california senate health committee approved sb 642 health care facilities medical privileges the bill is currently pending in the california senate ab 705 which is substantially similar to sb 642 is also pending in the california assembly if passed the law will curtail hospital governing bodies ability to make decisions about the medical services provided at the facility without medical staff approval impose new limitations on arrangements between management services organizations and professional corporations and add additional factors to the attorney general s review and approval of nonprofit health care facility transactions the author of the bills appears to be responding to the existence of ethical and religious directives erds that have been put into place by hospitals owned and operated by some religious institutions that among other things prohibit abortion in vitro fertilization medical aid in dying and the direct sterilization of either men or women unless their direct effect is the cure or alleviation of a present and serious pathology and a simpler treatment is not available while the primary goal seems to be ensuring access to treatment and procedures prohibited by erds the bill analysis further notes that ceos can impose policies that prohibit physicians from delivering evidence based medical services to patients even when their health facilities are equipped and staffed to deliver these services to maximize profits companies also often cut unprofitable medical procedures set billing quotas require internal referrals for medical services and pressure providers to perform unnecessary but lucrative procedure sb 642 takes aim at hospital control over the medical staff by prohibiting hospitals from requiring a physician or surgeon as a condition of obtaining or maintaining clinical privileges to agree to comply with criteria rules regulations or other policies or procedures that are not knowingly and explicitly ratified issued or promulgated by the medical staff that directly or indirectly prohibit limit or restrict the ability of the physician or surgeon to provide a particular medical treatment or service that falls within the scope of their privileges or from requiring a physician or surgeon to obtain permission from a non physician or non surgeon to perform a particular medical treatment or service for which consent has been obtained from the patient or the patient s representative unless an exception applies additionally health facility corporate bylaws policies rules contracts or other institutional requirements that conflict with the above prohibition may not be applied to directly or indirectly affect a physician s clinical privileges or rights or privileges of membership on the medical staff except as required by federal or state law finally sb 642 adds that the attorney general must consider these additional factors before consenting to certain nonprofit health facility transactions reducing or limiting the availability or accessibility of the full range of health care services to any group of individuals based on any characteristic listed or defined in the unruh civil rights act and resulting in undue interference in patients access to medical care due to improper or unlawful motives including but not limited to discrimination profit at the cost of patient care or unlawful or unfair competitive motives the above changes are already a significant departure from current law with respect to a hospital s ability to make decisions about the services it offers but sb 642 does not stop there management companies are also under fire and the management services organization mso friendly professional corporation pc model that has been utilized in california for decades could take a direct hit msos unlike pcs may be owned by non licensed individuals and provide administrative support services to a medical practice pursuant to a written services agreement generally msos can provide everything that does not involve the practice of medicine including space supplies equipment non professional staff accounting billing and collection and payables management in some cases msos offer a significant amount of technology and technical assistance for example in connection with telehealth services as currently used there are many potential benefits to this model from allowing physicians to focus on patients not paperwork to various financial benefits including providing a vehicle for investors who are not physicians the medical board of california board has issued a substantial amount of guidance in connection with what they consider to be inappropriate control over the practice of medicine and up until this point a carefully drafted arrangement between the mso and the pc could protect the interests of mso investors while ensuring that the pc maintained control over the practice of medicine it is unclear whether arrangements that have been carefully drafted in accordance with the board s corporate practice guidance will be permissible if sb 642 is enacted sb 642 adds section 2408 5 to the business and professions code as follows 2408 5 a the shareholders directors and officers of a medical corporation as set forth in section 2408 shall manage and have ultimate control over the assets and business operations of the medical corporation and shall not be replaced removed or otherwise controlled by any lay entity or individual including without limitation through stock transfer restriction agreements or other contractual agreements and arrangements b for purposes of this section ultimate control shall mean and be consistent with the definition provided by generally accepted accounting principles

kansas city southern is expected to ditch its merger agreement with canadian pacific railway ltd in favor of a competing proposal from canadian national railway co according to people familiar with the matter a dramatic turn with big implications for the shape of the u s rail industry the expected move follows a decision earlier thursday by canadian pacific to hold firm on the terms of its already agreed deal with kansas city southern after the u s railroad operator indicated it would favor a topping bid by canadian national the decision could be unveiled by friday there is no guarantee kansas city southern will terminate the canadian pacific deal as it could still change course and stick with it us rail industry defends safety record amid staffing cuts canadian pacific was betting recent setbacks for canadian national s higher offer would make sweetening its deal unnecessary but the expected development indicates kansas city southern views the gap between the two cash and stock bids as too substantial to ignore based on thursday s closing prices canadian national s bid was worth roughly 320 a share while canadian pacific s was at around 287 when the offers were unveiled they were worth about 30 billion and 25 billion respectively canadian pacific is now expected to wait and see if regulators ultimately reject a canadian national deal which would give it another opening preliminary approval canadian pacific already received from the u s surface transportation board would survive the termination ticker security last change change ksu n a n a n a n a cp canadian pacific kansas city 88 08 1 16 1 30 cni canadian national railway co 131 30 0 30 0 23 kansas city southern is the smallest of the major freight railroads in the u s it plays a big role in u s mexico trade with a network stretching across both countries which helps explain its desirability as an acquisition target of the two suitors canadian pacific is smaller and has less overlap with kansas city southern which could give it a leg up in winning antitrust approval get fox business on the go by clicking here should canadian national succeed in closing the deal it would become a bigger rival to industry heavyweights including union pacific corp with a network linking the u s mexico and canada canadian pacific had agreed in march to pay what was then worth 275 a share 0 489 of its shares and 90 in cash the exchange ratio was set before canadian pacific s recent five for one stock split canadian national subsequently offered 325 a share a proposal it later sweetened to comprise 200 in cash and 1 129 shares of its stock in sweetening its proposal canadian national agreed to add more stock and cover the 700 million breakup fee kansas city southern would owe canadian pacific for walking away from their existing agreement if an agreement with canadian national ultimately fails to get approval from regulators the canadian company would also owe kansas city southern a 1 billion reverse breakup fee click here to read more on fox business either deal would involve a two step process first a voting trust would acquire kansas city southern shares and assuming necessary approvals are received the companies would then merge both the use of a trust and a merger itself need approval from the stb which requires major railroad combinations to be in the public interest and enhance competition while the stb already approved a voting trust as part of canadian pacific s deal it said this week that it was denying canadian national s request for now without prejudice since no formal merger agreement had yet been filed language in that decision suggested that the board will be more cautious about granting a trust to canadian national

u s a ammoland com when eight house democrats announced a new gun control measure called the protecting our communities act as reported by the hill they left out one important component the text ammoland news checked for the language in h r 3299 and it hadn t been posted despite declarations from rep val demings d fla and colleagues that the bill is a package of common sense efforts to close obvious loopholes in america s gun laws prevent mass shootings and protect law enforcement officers and the public from high powered rapid firing and untraceable weapons that description of this legislation which at this writing consists of a title only void presumably to be filled shortly contains enough boilerplate hyperbole to delight any gun prohibitionist it also demonstrates the danger of title only bills it allows sponsors to make things up essentially on the fly there is a benefit to reading all of the pronouncements they allow an inside look at the mindset of anti gunners whose interests just might collide with the constitution here are some excerpts rep val demings fl 10 i call on congress to immediately advance and pass these common sense reforms to stop mass shooters slow the flow of untraceable weapons into our communities and protect law enforcement officers despite the lies and screeches from the scandal ridden nra the truth is that the vast majority of american agree that criminals shouldn t be able to buy a gun or download one that weapons which fire through police officers ballistic vests should be tightly and rightly controlled and that weapon modifications that allow shooters to fire hundreds of rounds a minute simply have no place on our streets i m proud to join with my colleagues on this commonsense legislation let s get this done and save lives rep sheila jackson lee tx 18 this bill is necessary to address urgent issues such as ghost guns individuals at extreme risk for committing gun violence and concealable assault weapons in addition i intend to focus on other firearms issues such as safe gun storage as we in congress take steps to pass additional gun violence prevention legislation rep peter defazio or 04 over the past two decades gun violence tragedies have grown exponentially devastating communities across this country including southwest oregon while i ve pushed for sensible solutions for years congress has failed to pass comprehensive gun violence prevention reforms to address this epidemic it s well past time for congress to finally enact common sense solutions to close dangerous loopholes help prevent mass shootings and protect our families friends neighbors and dedicated law enforcement officers so we can make our communities safer rep adriano espaillat ny 13 closing loopholes to ensure that people who should not have guns cannot get guns is common sense and will save lives ghost guns are guns plain and simple they pose a serious concern for communities around the nation as well as for law enforcement agencies who are often unable to trace these kits i am proud that my bill the ghost guns are guns act is part of this critical legislative gun violence prevention package i look forward to continuing my work with my colleagues to ensure we implement comprehensive change that would close these loopholes expand background checks and improve the overall safety of our communities by making it more difficult for these weapons to fall into the wrong hands rep joe neguse co 2 inaction on gun violence is simply not an option our communities in colorado and across the nation have felt the pain and grief of senseless acts of violence far too many times and these incidents demand a response the protecting our communities act combines several common sense urgently needed gun violence prevention measures to close existing loopholes protect our communities and save lives we ve lost far too many lives at the hands of mass shootings we must find the willpower and the urgency to act for our kids and for our future rep mike quigley il 5 i m pleased to have worked with my colleagues to introduce a gun reform package aimed at protecting our neighborhoods and ensuring that weapons stay out of the wrong hands my hope is that these reforms will save lives and prevent further gun violence i also want to thank my colleagues for including my bill in this package and i look forward to seeing it move through our democratic legislative process rep mike thompson ca 5 tackling the scourge of gun violence requires that the administration and congress work together to keep guns out of the hands of those who may be a danger to themselves or others that s why today i m proud to be an original coauthor of representative demings protecting our communities act an important bill that will crack down on unregulated ghost guns and dangerous concealable assault rifles like the one used in the recent shooting in boulder prohibit bump stocks by law and boost the background checks system to notify state and local law enforcement when felons and others prohibited from purchasing a gun try to buy one this is a critical bill in our work to keep our communities safe and i m proud to support it as chairman of the gun violence prevention task force rep ted deutch fl 22 it s been decades since congress passed any meaningful updates to our gun laws and existing enforcement regimes are failing to meet the challenges we re facing today law enforcement officers understand these challenges more than most we have no time to waste to pass focused reforms that can make a real difference in our communities and save lives these names should be remembered in november 2022 they make good sales pitches but will they be able to keep a single firearm out of the hands of a single criminal the history of gun control suggests they will not there was an additional name in the demings news release not a member of congress but from the gun prohibition lobby the inclusion of his comment is enough to erase any doubt about where the loyalties of capitol hill democrats lay nick suplina everytown s managing director of law and policy the common sense measures in this package address some of the most urgent threats to public safety vice chair demings has long been a champion for gun safety from helping lead the house gun violence prevention taskforce to introducing today s important legislation evidently concerns about missing text are premature everytown the billionaire backed gun control lobbying group will supply the wish list about dave workman dave workman is a senior editor at thegunmag com and liberty park press author of multiple books on the right to keep bear arms and formerly an nra certified firearms instructor
