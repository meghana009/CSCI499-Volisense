rockville md and suzhou china sept 4 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first participant has been successfully dosed in the higher dose cohort of a phase 2 clinical trial of mazdutide r d code ibi362 a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp 1r and glucagon receptor gcgr dual agonist in chinese adults with obesity this randomized double blinded placebo controlled study clinicaltrials gov nct04904913 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity results for the low dose cohorts 3 0 mg 4 5 mg and 6 0 mg were disclosed in june of this year and the primary endpoint was met at week 24 each dose of mazdutide showed significant efficacy on body weight loss compared with placebo in a dose dependent manner and brought multiple cardio metabolic benefits to participants meanwhile mazdutide was well tolerated and the overall safety profile was similar to other drugs of the same class in addition mazdutide titrated to 9 mg showed a good safety profile and a 12 week body weight loss of 11 7 in the phase 1b study clinicaltrials gov nct04440345 based on these results innovent will further evaluate the efficacy and safety for a higher dose 9 0 mg mazdutide in chinese patients with obesity bmi 30 kg m2 a total of 80 participants are planned to be enrolled and will be randomized in a 3 1 ratio to receive mazdutide 9 0 mg or placebo for 24 weeks the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in body weight at week 24 professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated obesity is associated with a variety of chronic non communicable diseases and is listed as one of the important risk factors affecting the disease burden the prevalence and growth rate of obesity in china rank first in the world and drugs that can achieve effective and safe weight loss are therefore urgently needed in the clinic clinical studies of mazdutide in overweight or obese population have demonstrated significant efficacy on body weight loss and comprehensive metabolic improvement treatment of mazdutide 6 0 mg for 6 months resulted in 11 6 body weight loss in participants in the low dose cohorts of the phase 2 study demonstrating its best in class potential i am confident that a 9 0 mg dose of mazdutide will show even more satisfactory efficacy on body weight loss and will offer a new treatment option for participant with moderate to severe obesity dr lei qian vice president of clinical development at innovent stated in the phase 2 study in chinese participants with overweight or obesity low dose mazdutide showed robust efficacy on body weight loss and multiple improvement in metabolic parameters reflecting the best in class potential of mazdutide among glp 1 receptor agonists and co agonists to further extend its clinical utility we will continue to explore the clinical benefit of mazdutide 9 0 mg in adults with obesity bmi 30 kg m2 the result of the phase 1 study suggests that mazdutide is the first single agent anti obesity molecule among all approved or under development that achieves a 12 week body weight loss by more than 11 5 we hope that the higher dose mazdutide will provide a safer bariatric surgery like and more accessible treatment option to patients with obesity about overweight and obesity china has the largest obese population in the world with obesity rate likely to increase obesity can lead to a range of complications or related diseases that impact life expectancy and deteriorate quality of life in more severely obese patients the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease diabetes and certain tumors increase significantly obesity is a chronic disease that requires long term management and there is a lack of long term effective and safe treatments lifestyle intervention is the first choice and basic treatment for patients with overweight or obesity however a considerable percentage of patients fail to achieve the desired weight loss goal upon lifestyle intervention due to various reasons and may require pharmacological intervention traditional anti obesity drugs have limited weight loss effects and are associated with safety issues about mazdutide innovent entered into a licensing agreement with eli lilly and company lilly for the development and potential commercialization of oxm3 also known as mazdutide a glp 1r and gcgr dual agonist in china in parallel lilly is developing oxm3 outside china mazdutide is a long acting synthetic peptide related to mammalian oxyntomodulin oxm which uses a fatty acid side chain to prolong the duration of action and allow once weekly administration mazdutide is thought to exert its biological effects by activating glp 1 receptor and glucagon receptor in human beings which improves glucose tolerance and induces weight loss mimicking the effects of endogenous oxyntomodulin in addition to the effects of glp 1 receptor agonists on promoting insulin secretion lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight mazdutide may also increase energy expenditure and improve hepatic fat metabolism through the activation of glucagon receptor the treatment of metabolic diseases by activating multiple metabolism related targets simultaneously is currently the

the portion of america s foreign assistance that is designated as security assistance is already supporting the nation s war on terrorism by strengthening u s allies this is particularly true for security assistance to friendly governments in regions like central asia the middle east and north africa that have been hotbeds for terrorist activity by law america may not provide development assistance to the seven states identified by the u s department of state as sponsors of terrorism cuba iran iraq libya north korea sudan and syria this is not the case for america s allies international financial institutions or international organizations all of which regularly disburse development assistance to state sponsors of terrorism development assistance should also be enlisted in america s strategy to combat terrorists to accomplish this america must deny governments of states that sponsor terrorism any u s security development and humanitarian assistance condition disbursement of development assistance to countries with foreign terrorist organizations within their borders on their cooperation with america s war on terrorism encourage america s allies to prohibit development assistance to any country sponsoring or harboring terrorists block funding from international financial institutions particularly the international monetary fund and the world bank to states that sponsor or harbor terrorists and require u s executive directors of international financial institutions particularly the international monetary fund and the world bank to demand official votes when financial institutions consider development assistance to terrorist sponsoring states state sponsorship of terrorism a key element in america s war against terrorism will be to cut off foreign terrorist organizations from their financial resources most attention thus far has focused on policing private markets as foreign terrorist organizations increasingly are funded independently from states it would be a mistake however to overlook the importance of assistance from the united states other nations and multilateral organizations or international financial institutions in the war on terrorism america s security assistance to states that oppose terrorist activities particularly to israel and moderate muslim governments is critical to winning this war recipients of u s security assistance often are natural allies in combating foreign terrorist organizations because they as much as the united states are targets of terrorists as noted by president george w bush in his september 20 speech before a joint session of congress want to overthrow existing governments in many muslim countries such as egypt saudi arabia and jordan they want to drive israel out of the middle east they want to drive christians and jews out of vast regions of asia and africa america therefore should continue to support its allies with security assistance of equal importance however is the need to block development assistance to states that sponsor terrorism before the advent of private financing of terrorist activities foreign terrorist organizations were funded predominantly by governments and these groups remain dependent on sympathetic governments for protection and bases from which to operate if america and her allies successfully curtail private financing of terrorism these groups may again turn to states for financial support therefore cutting off governments that support terrorism from development assistance is a logical complement to policing and curtailing private financing of terrorist activities because of the fungibility of money development assistance can support terrorism even if development assistance is not provided specifically to support terrorist activities it increases the overall amount of resources available to recipients if those recipients support foreign terrorist organizations increasing available funding enables them to increase their support of terrorism moreover providing development assistance to states that support or tolerate foreign terrorist organizations within their borders rewards them for their criminally negligent attitude toward combating terrorism there are two sources of development assistance individual countries that provide bilateral development assistance and international organizations that provide multilateral development assistance bilateral development assistance the largest source of development assistance for many countries is given bilaterally from individual donor nations individual nations of the development assistance committee dac disbursed 56 4 billion in development assistance in 1999 japan disbursed the most development assistance at 15 3 billion and france and germany were third and fourth at 5 6 billion and 5 5 billion respectively the united states was second in the total amount of development assistance disbursed at 9 2 billion in 1999 the secretary of state officially recognizes seven state sponsors of terrorism cuba iran iraq libya north korea sudan and syria that may not receive development assistance from the u s the u s appropriated 57 million for foreign assistance to those countries in 2001 but that aid was directed toward undermining the governments in those countries or directly aiding the people suffering under them see table 2 other donor governments are not subject to these restrictions for instance germany japan the united nations high commissioner for refugees austria and france are the top five donors of net official development assistance oda averaged from 1998 and 1999 to iran and germany norway the european commission the united kingdom and the netherlands are the top five donors to iraq all told the seven state sponsors of terrorism received 974 million in net oda average of 1998 and 1999 see table 1 the restriction on u s aid does not extend to countries that while not designated as terrorist sponsoring states have terrorist activities within their borders leaving aside greece japan and the basque region of northern spain and southwestern france which do not receive development assistance the united states was among the top five donors of net oda averaged from 1998 and 1999 to nine of the 15 states having active foreign terrorist organizations see table 1 the united states provided assistance of some sort development humanitarian or security to each of the 15 countries with active foreign terrorist organizations within their borders in 2001 see table 2 the largest source of development assistance for many countries is given bilaterally from individual donor nations individual nations of the development assistance committee dac disbursed 56 4 billion in development assistance in 1999 japan disbursed the most development assistance at 15 3 billion and france and germany were third and fourth at 5 6 billion and 5 5 billion respectively the united states was second in the total amount of development assistance disbursed at 9 2 billion in 1999 multilateral development assistance of the seven state sponsors of terrorism officially recognized by the united states all but cuba and north korea are members of the international monetary fund and the world bank iraq sudan and syria were ineligible for either imf sudan or world bank iraq sudan and syria assistance according to the institutions respective 2000 annual reports not for sponsoring terrorism but for their failure to meet their financial obligations to the institutions upon meeting their obligations or coming to an agreement with the institutions for repayment these countries would again be eligible for imf and world bank assistance four of the five terrorist sponsoring states that are members of the imf and the world bank with libya the sole exception have received funding from those institutions see table 3 within the past 20 years iran and syria received 625 million and 265 3 million respectively from the world bank and sudan received 1 8 billion from the imf and the world bank iran currently has six ongoing world bank projects moreover the imf and the world bank provide huge amounts of assistance to the 15 countries with active foreign terrorist organizations within their borders afghanistan which has been harboring osama bin laden is a member of the imf and the world bank and has received 20 world bank loans totaling over 230 million all told 11 of the 15 countries have received over 1 billion from the imf and the world bank see table 3 cutting off the money the first priority in fighting the financial front of the war on terrorism should be policing and curbing private financial transactions as they are currently the primary source of funding for terrorist activities as noted by the u s department of state state sponsorship has decreased over the past several decades as it decreases it becomes increasingly important for all countries to adopt a zero tolerance for terrorist activity within their borders terrorists will seek safe haven in those areas where they are able to avoid the rule of law and to travel prepare raise funds and operate while state sponsorship of terrorism has decreased in recent years it is reasonable to assume that such financing could rebound if private financing becomes more difficult moreover terrorists need nations to harbor them and such states should not be supported through development assistance therefore america should enlist development assistance in its war on terrorism if president bush is to fulfill his promise to starve terrorists of funding a comprehensive campaign to discourage countries from harboring terrorists and encourage them to provide information to aid america s search for terrorists should include the following steps expand prohibitions on u s assistance to governments supporting international terrorism any state sponsoring terrorism is an adversary of the u s in its current conflict and should not receive any succor current u s law prohibits economic development assistance the peace corps the export import bank and assistance provided for under the agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 to governments that have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism despite this prohibition the u s provided 57 million to support programs in the seven state sponsors of terrorism identified by the u s secretary of state although this assistance was not given to the governments of those seven sponsors the united states should make the current prohibition under law more explicit to prohibit all assistance development humanitarian and security to governments sponsoring terrorist activities if the u s decides to provide assistance to those countries it should be provided through non governmental organizations or other groups provided they have verifiable evidence that they are not working with or through the government of the state sponsor of terrorism or to groups working to overthrow the terrorist sponsoring regime any state sponsoring terrorism is an adversary of the u s in its current conflict and should not receive any succor current u s law prohibits economic development assistance the peace corps the export import bank and assistance provided for under the agricultural trade development and assistance act of 1954 to governments that have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism despite this prohibition the u s provided 57 million to support programs in the seven state sponsors of terrorism identified by the u s secretary of state demand that recipients of u s development assistance that have active foreign terrorist organizations within their borders cooperate in america s war on terrorism countries such as egypt israel and saudi arabia have individuals or groups within their territory that support or finance terrorism even though the governments do not themselves support terrorism and are valuable allies of the united states for instance prior to september 11 osama bin laden was receiving between 1 million and 2 million from saudi arabia per month from individual donations through mosques and other means cutting these countries off from u s assistance particularly security assistance would be counterproductive these governments particularly moderate governments in central asia the middle east and north africa are as much targets of radical terrorist attacks as the united states overt support for the u s in its war on terrorism such as allowing u s military bases in their territory or supplying troops to fight alongside of america s might make these governments greater targets for terrorist activities these nations can however provide valuable support for the war on terrorism by other means therefore the administration should demand that aid recipients support u s efforts to combat terrorism in other ways such as supporting the u s in international bodies like the united nations sharing intelligence on terrorist activities approving the use of airspace for strikes against foreign terrorist organizations and providing the right for temporary use of ground port or air facilities for use in the fight against terrorism obviously the conditions must be tailored to the country involved but the overall quid pro quo of cooperation in return for development assistance should be comprehensive the administration should reevaluate aid policy toward unhelpful nations countries such as egypt israel and saudi arabia have individuals or groups within their territory that support or finance terrorism even though the governments do not themselves support terrorism and are valuable allies of the united states for instance prior to september 11 osama bin laden was receiving between 1 million and 2 million from saudi arabia per month from individual donations through mosques and other means encourage other nations to prohibit development assistance to any country sponsoring or harboring terrorists although america is a major source of development assistance following only japan in the dollar amount of such aid disbursed annually restrictions on american development assistance alone will not significantly curtail the amount of development assistance given to terrorist sponsoring states or the amount given to states with active foreign terrorist organizations within their borders as illustrated in table 1 the european commission and individual donor nations provided billions in development assistance to terrorist sponsoring states and states that have active foreign terrorist organizations in 1999 therefore the administration must work with u s allies to ensure that they adopt restrictions on bilateral development assistance to terrorist sponsoring states that complement u s restrictions or at the very least do not undermine u s objectives by supporting states that sponsor terrorism although america is a major source of development assistance following only japan in the dollar amount of such aid disbursed annually restrictions on american development assistance alone will not significantly curtail the amount of development assistance given to terrorist sponsoring states or the amount given to states with active foreign terrorist organizations within their borders as illustrated in table 1 the european commission and individual donor nations provided billions in development assistance to terrorist sponsoring states and states that have active foreign terrorist organizations in 1999 build a coalition of allies to block funding from international financial institutions to states that sponsor or harbor terrorists international financial institutions like the international monetary fund and the world bank lend to states that support terrorism their articles of agreement do not allow those institutions to prohibit lending to countries that undermine international peace and stability by supporting foreign terrorist organizations this loophole must be closed to prevent multilateral funding for terrorist sponsoring states there are two options block approval of loans and grants to terrorist sponsoring states or amend the respective articles or charters governing individual institutions both strategies require the u s to assemble a coalition of member states with sufficient numbers and voting power to block loans to terrorist sponsoring states blocking a loan requires a majority of the voting stock which can be accomplished with the support of france germany japan the united kingdom and two to three voting blocs in the world bank and with the support of only nine other nations australia belgium canada france germany italy japan the netherlands and the united kingdom in the imf creating a coalition to block loans to terrorist sponsoring states is easier to accomplish than amending the articles or charters of multilateral organizations because it requires fewer countries and less voting stock and can likely be assembled with america s european allies and japan for instance amending the articles of the imf and the world bank requires the support of three fifths of the membership and 85 percent of the voting stock however blocking loans lacks the permanency of amending articles or charters if the members of these institutions refuse to prohibit lending to terrorist sponsoring states the u s should refuse to approve future quota increases for the imf replenishments for the international development association of the world bank or increased capital subscriptions for the international bank for reconstruction and development international financial institutions like the international monetary fund and the world bank lend to states that support terrorism their articles of agreement do not allow those institutions to prohibit lending to countries that undermine international peace and stability by supporting foreign terrorist organizations require u s executive directors to demand official votes when international financial institutions consider development assistance to terrorist sponsoring states as determined by the secretary of state the u s can take unilateral action to increase the likelihood of blocking loans to terrorist states by amending the voice and vote laws of the united states currently the law requires the secretary of the treasury to instruct the united states executive director of each international financial institution to use the voice and vote of the united states to oppose any loan or other use of funds of the respective institutions to or for a country for which the secretary of state has made a determination under section 2405 j of title 50 appendix or section 2371 of this title as former u s executive director to the imf karin lissakers has testified the imf voted on only about a dozen of over 2 000 financial and procedural decisions during her four year tenure in other words u s intentions were circumvented 99 4 percent of the time because the imf almost never votes the administration should demand that all votes involving loans or credits to countries sponsoring or harboring terrorists be official and released to the public a recorded vote would put u s allies on record a situation that should discourage votes in favor of loans for terrorist sponsoring states conclusion terrorists require governments to provide protection from international justice and military retribution president bush demonstrated his awareness of this fact in his september 20 speech before a joint session of congress by declaring that e will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism from this day forward any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the united states as a hostile regime it makes little sense for america to provide millions in development assistance to its adversaries to fulfill the president s promise to combat terrorism america and its allies in the war on terrorism must cut off foreign terrorist organizations and the countries that harbor them from international financial flows through greater oversight of and restrictions on official development assistance both bilateral and multilateral to terrorist sponsoring states brett d schaefer is jay kingham fellow in

rockville md and suzhou china sept 4 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first participant has been successfully dosed in the higher dose cohort of a phase 2 clinical trial of mazdutide r d code ibi362 a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp 1r and glucagon receptor gcgr dual agonist in chinese adults with obesity this randomized double blinded placebo controlled study clinicaltrials gov nct04904913 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity results for the low dose cohorts 3 0 mg 4 5 mg and 6 0 mg were disclosed in june of this year and the primary endpoint was met at week 24 each dose of mazdutide showed significant efficacy on body weight loss compared with placebo in a dose dependent manner and brought multiple cardio metabolic benefits to participants meanwhile mazdutide was well tolerated and the overall safety profile was similar to other drugs of the same class in addition mazdutide titrated to 9 mg showed a good safety profile and a 12 week body weight loss of 11 7 in the phase 1b study clinicaltrials gov nct04440345 based on these results innovent will further evaluate the efficacy and safety for a higher dose 9 0 mg mazdutide in chinese patients with obesity bmi 30 kg m2 a total of 80 participants are planned to be enrolled and will be randomized in a 3 1 ratio to receive mazdutide 9 0 mg or placebo for 24 weeks the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in body weight at week 24 professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated obesity is associated with a variety of chronic non communicable diseases and is listed as one of the important risk factors affecting the disease burden the prevalence and growth rate of obesity in china rank first in the world and drugs that can achieve effective and safe weight loss are therefore urgently needed in the clinic clinical studies of mazdutide in overweight or obese population have demonstrated significant efficacy on body weight loss and comprehensive metabolic improvement treatment of mazdutide 6 0 mg for 6 months resulted in 11 6 body weight loss in participants in the low dose cohorts of the phase 2 study demonstrating its best in class potential i am confident that a 9 0 mg dose of mazdutide will show even more satisfactory efficacy on body weight loss and will offer a new treatment option for participant with moderate to severe obesity dr lei qian vice president of clinical development at innovent stated in the phase 2 study in chinese participants with overweight or obesity low dose mazdutide showed robust efficacy on body weight loss and multiple improvement in metabolic parameters reflecting the best in class potential of mazdutide among glp 1 receptor agonists and co agonists to further extend its clinical utility we will continue to explore the clinical benefit of mazdutide 9 0 mg in adults with obesity bmi 30 kg m2 the result of the phase 1 study suggests that mazdutide is the first single agent anti obesity molecule among all approved or under development that achieves a 12 week body weight loss by more than 11 5 we hope that the higher dose mazdutide will provide a safer bariatric surgery like and more accessible treatment option to patients with obesity about overweight and obesity china has the largest obese population in the world with obesity rate likely to increase obesity can lead to a range of complications or related diseases that impact life expectancy and deteriorate quality of life in more severely obese patients the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease diabetes and certain tumors increase significantly obesity is a chronic disease that requires long term management and there is a lack of long term effective and safe treatments lifestyle intervention is the first choice and basic treatment for patients with overweight or obesity however a considerable percentage of patients fail to achieve the desired weight loss goal upon lifestyle intervention due to various reasons and may require pharmacological intervention traditional anti obesity drugs have limited weight loss effects and are associated with safety issues about mazdutide innovent entered into a licensing agreement with eli lilly and company lilly for the development and potential commercialization of oxm3 also known as mazdutide a glp 1r and gcgr dual agonist in china in parallel lilly is developing oxm3 outside china mazdutide is a long acting synthetic peptide related to mammalian oxyntomodulin oxm which uses a fatty acid side chain to prolong the duration of action and allow once weekly administration mazdutide is thought to exert its biological effects by activating glp 1 receptor and glucagon receptor in human beings which improves glucose tolerance and induces weight loss mimicking the effects of endogenous oxyntomodulin in addition to the effects of glp 1 receptor agonists on promoting insulin secretion lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight mazdutide may also increase energy expenditure and improve hepatic fat metabolism through the activation of glucagon receptor the treatment of metabolic diseases by activating multiple metabolism related targets simultaneously is currently the

via lifehacker although fears of a serious economic recession or worse have eased a little no one can agree on how healthy the u s economy actually is the numbers are all over the place the stock market is in a bear market inflation has gone down a bit but is still painfully high consumer spending is down but unemployment remains surprisingly low job growth is soaring and overall americans debt to savings ratio is pretty good while we re nowhere near the global economic crisis seen during the great depression there s no doubt that we re headed into some turbulent economic times that makes this a good moment to remember that our grandparents and great grandparents survived that depression and their experience has some evergreen financial lessons we can use today to get through whatever s coming for us everyone knows the basics like avoiding debt and socking away some savings for a rainy day but the folks who actually faced a worldwide financial collapse came away with some less common advice be prepared to move if necessary as the economy shrank in the 1930s a drought plagued the midwest resulting in what s known as the dust bowl farmers poured into the ranks of the desperate and insolvent prompting one of the largest population shifts in american history as desperate folks packed up and fled seeking work wherever they could find it the situation s different today with remote work being much more common but that doesn t mean you should necessarily stay where you are moving to a place with a lower cost of living will make your income go further and even with remote jobs growing in popularity the fact is large metropolitan areas still offer more job opportunities and more services finding the right balance between city rents and economic possibilities is a challenge but it could be well worth your time watch every penny if you had a grandparent who had a little change purse they carried around and who spent every single coin judiciously that was probably a great depression lesson spare change adds up and even tiny amounts of money can make a difference and today your spare change may be more powerful than you realize using tools and services from your bank or other apps like acorns you can have the change from purchases automatically invested apps like changed take your spare change and automatically apply it to your student loan debt the change from rounding up a transaction might only be a few pennies in the moment but when applied on a constant basis it can make a real difference in your financial life

rockville md and suzhou china sept 4 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first participant has been successfully dosed in the higher dose cohort of a phase 2 clinical trial of mazdutide r d code ibi362 a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp 1r and glucagon receptor gcgr dual agonist in chinese adults with obesity this randomized double blinded placebo controlled study clinicaltrials gov nct04904913 was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide in chinese participants with overweight or obesity results for the low dose cohorts 3 0 mg 4 5 mg and 6 0 mg were disclosed in june of this year and the primary endpoint was met at week 24 each dose of mazdutide showed significant efficacy on body weight loss compared with placebo in a dose dependent manner and brought multiple cardio metabolic benefits to participants meanwhile mazdutide was well tolerated and the overall safety profile was similar to other drugs of the same class in addition mazdutide titrated to 9 mg showed a good safety profile and a 12 week body weight loss of 11 7 in the phase 1b study clinicaltrials gov nct04440345 based on these results innovent will further evaluate the efficacy and safety for a higher dose 9 0 mg mazdutide in chinese patients with obesity bmi 30 kg m2 a total of 80 participants are planned to be enrolled and will be randomized in a 3 1 ratio to receive mazdutide 9 0 mg or placebo for 24 weeks the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in body weight at week 24 professor linong ji the principal investigator of the study peking university people s hospital stated obesity is associated with a variety of chronic non communicable diseases and is listed as one of the important risk factors affecting the disease burden the prevalence and growth rate of obesity in china rank first in the world and drugs that can achieve effective and safe weight loss are therefore urgently needed in the clinic clinical studies of mazdutide in overweight or obese population have demonstrated significant efficacy on body weight loss and comprehensive metabolic improvement treatment of mazdutide 6 0 mg for 6 months resulted in 11 6 body weight loss in participants in the low dose cohorts of the phase 2 study demonstrating its best in class potential i am confident that a 9 0 mg dose of mazdutide will show even more satisfactory efficacy on body weight loss and will offer a new treatment option for participant with moderate to severe obesity dr lei qian vice president of clinical development at innovent stated in the phase 2 study in chinese participants with overweight or obesity low dose mazdutide showed robust efficacy on body weight loss and multiple improvement in metabolic parameters reflecting the best in class potential of mazdutide among glp 1 receptor agonists and co agonists to further extend its clinical utility we will continue to explore the clinical benefit of mazdutide 9 0 mg in adults with obesity bmi 30 kg m2 the result of the phase 1 study suggests that mazdutide is the first single agent anti obesity molecule among all approved or under development that achieves a 12 week body weight loss by more than 11 5 we hope that the higher dose mazdutide will provide a safer bariatric surgery like and more accessible treatment option to patients with obesity about overweight and obesity china has the largest obese population in the world with obesity rate likely to increase obesity can lead to a range of complications or related diseases that impact life expectancy and deteriorate quality of life in more severely obese patients the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease diabetes and certain tumors increase significantly obesity is a chronic disease that requires long term management and there is a lack of long term effective and safe treatments lifestyle intervention is the first choice and basic treatment for patients with overweight or obesity however a considerable percentage of patients fail to achieve the desired weight loss goal upon lifestyle intervention due to various reasons and may require pharmacological intervention traditional anti obesity drugs have limited weight loss effects and are associated with safety issues about mazdutide innovent entered into a licensing agreement with eli lilly and company lilly for the development and potential commercialization of oxm3 also known as mazdutide a glp 1r and gcgr dual agonist in china in parallel lilly is developing oxm3 outside china mazdutide

to exert its biological effects by activating glp 1 receptor and glucagon receptor in human beings which improves glucose tolerance and induces weight loss mimicking the effects of endogenous oxyntomodulin in addition to the effects of glp 1 receptor agonists on promoting insulin secretion lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight mazdutide may also increase energy expenditure and

the work papers record the audit procedure tests gathered information and conclusions about the review according to the pcaob website it is not clear what level of highly sensitive information if any would be included in the work papers the ability of the u s to inspect those work papers for chinese companies listed in the u s has been a years long dispute u s political and legal developments in the last two years have sped up the threat that the chinese companies might need to delist from u s stock exchanges a turning point came in late august when the pcaob and china securities regulatory commission signed a cooperation agreement that laid the regulatory basis for allowing u s inspections of audit firms within china s borders that s according to statements from both government entities which also said china s ministry of finance signed the deal i see this as a big progress meaning that both sides were willing to take steps to move this forward said stephanie tang head of private

republican led us states such as texas and west virginia are piling pressure on firms including giant asset manager blackrock for supposedly boycotting oil and gas companies as part of responsible investment strategies but the companies say the fossil fuel boycott claims are false and rules barring states from dealing with major financial firms could potentially backfire on taxpayers basing investments partly on a company s environmental social and governance esg practices is a sign of an unacceptable ideological agenda says florida governor ron desantis who is seen as a potential 2024 republican presidential nominee late last month he ordered bankers managing the state s huge pension fund to ignore those criteria and instead prioritize the financial security of the people of florida over whimsical notions of a utopian tomorrow the state controller of texas has meanwhile published a list of companies including blackrock and several european banks deemed to be boycotting petroleum firms state officials were instructed to no longer sign contracts with firms on the list west virginia a smaller state but one rich in coal and natural gas similarly singled out not just blackrock but also such wall street pillars as jpmorgan chase wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley any institution with policies aimed at weakening our energy industries tax base and job market has a clear conflict of interest in handling taxpayer dollars that state s treasurer riley moore said in a statement the banks targeted however deny they are engaging in any such boycott while some of them have decided to stop financing oil exploration projects in the arctic for example they are continuing to lend money to the industry jp morgan decried west virginia s rule as shortsighted and disconnected from the facts blackrock the world s biggest asset manager says it has invested more than 108 billion in texas oil companies including exxonmobil referring to texas s new rule the wall street firm said in a statement that elected and appointed public officials have a duty to act in the best interests of the people they serve politicizing state pension funds restricting access to investments and impacting the financial returns of retirees is not consistent with that duty joshua lichtenstein whose law firm ropes gray tracks the way states are regulating esg investments said that the republican led attacks may be misguided the political rhetoric is addressing a world that doesn t exist he said the choice is not really between directing investment capital towards esg or investment capital towards returns lichtenstein told afp it s really more about investing towards funds that are using esg as part of a risk mitigation strategy and investors are pushed in that direction by a growing number of clients not only in democratic led us states but in europe and japan the northeastern state of maine in 2021 adopted a law requiring the state s pension system to divest itself of shares in fossil fuel companies the new rules in republican states could come at a cost to those states taxpayers said ben cushing a financial specialist with the environmental advocacy group the sierra club texas for example last year adopted a law banning its cities from signing new contracts with banks that limit investment in petroleum companies or gun manufacturers the result the number of establishments participating in municipal bond issues in texas has declined and negotiated rates have risen costing taxpayers millions in extra interest according to a june study by researchers at the university of pennsylvania and the us federal reserve lichtenstein said it is too early to know the broader impact of the republican campaign he said it would not necessarily threaten an already well established trend clients are increasingly sensitive to climate change for example and investment managers still must take all risks into account but the red states are probably the loudest lichtenstein added and if republican states such as florida actively enforce their new rules fund managers may seek to avoid conflict ultimately said the sierra club s cushing that could compel financial establishments to slow their esg efforts just as they belatedly are beginning to address the climate crisis and recognize the very real financial implications of climate change

in mid september shortly after which all audit work papers requested by the pcaob must be made available to them audit work papers differ from the actual information on companies gathered by accounting firms the work papers record the audit procedure tests gathered information and conclusions about the review according to the pcaob website it is not clear what level of highly sensitive information if any would be included in the work papers the ability of the u s to inspect those work papers for chinese companies listed in the u s has been a years long dispute u s political and legal developments in the last two years have sped up the threat that the chinese companies might need to delist from u s stock exchanges a turning point came in late august when the pcaob and china securities regulatory commission signed a cooperation agreement that laid the regulatory basis for allowing u s inspections of audit firms within china s borders that s according to statements from both government entities which also said china s ministry of finance signed the deal i see this as a big progress meaning that both sides were willing to take steps to move this forward said stephanie

avenue capital s liao is watching is whether u s president joe biden and chinese president xi jinping meet in person this fall for the first time under the biden administration that could speed up a final agreement on the audit dispute he said in the end resolving the audit work paper problem relies on political interaction between china and the u s liao said in chinese according to a cnbc

papers record the audit procedure tests gathered information and conclusions about the review according to the pcaob website it is not clear what level of highly sensitive information if any would be included in the work papers the ability of the u s to inspect those work papers for chinese companies listed in the u s has been a years long dispute u s political and legal developments in the last two years have sped up the threat that the chinese companies might need to delist from u s stock exchanges a turning point came in late august when the pcaob and china securities regulatory commission signed a cooperation agreement that laid the regulatory basis for allowing u s inspections of audit firms within china s borders that s according to statements from both government entities which also

social investment strategies under fire in republican led us states an oil field in odessa texas some republican led us states want to exclude financial firms that refuse to invest in petroleum companies new york republican led us states such as texas and west virginia are piling pressure on firms including giant asset manager blackrock for supposedly boycotting oil and gas companies as part of responsible investment strategies but the companies say the fossil fuel boycott claims are false and rules barring states from dealing with major financial firms could potentially backfire on taxpayers basing investments partly on a company s environmental social and governance esg practices is a sign of an unacceptable ideological agenda says florida governor ron desantis who is seen as a potential 2024 republican presidential nominee late last month he ordered bankers managing the state s huge pension fund to ignore those criteria and instead prioritize the financial security of the people of florida over whimsical notions of a utopian tomorrow the state controller of texas has meanwhile published a list of companies including blackrock and several european banks deemed to be boycotting petroleum firms state officials were instructed to no longer sign contracts with firms on the list west virginia a smaller state but one rich in coal and natural gas similarly singled out not just blackrock but also such wall street pillars as jpmorgan chase wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley any institution with policies aimed at weakening our energy industries tax base and job market has a clear conflict of interest in handling taxpayer dollars that state s treasurer riley moore said in a statement disconnected from reality the banks targeted however deny they are engaging in any such boycott while some of them have decided to stop financing oil exploration projects in the arctic for example they are continuing to lend money to the industry jp morgan decried west virginia s rule as shortsighted and disconnected from the facts blackrock the world s biggest asset manager says it has invested more than 108 billion in texas oil companies including exxonmobil referring to texas s new rule the wall street firm said in a statement that elected and appointed public officials have a duty to act in the best interests of the people they serve politicizing state pension funds restricting access to investments and impacting the financial returns of retirees is not consistent with that duty joshua lichtenstein whose law firm ropes gray tracks the way states are regulating esg investments said that the republican led attacks may be misguided the political rhetoric is addressing a world that doesn t exist he said the choice is not really between directing investment capital towards esg or investment capital towards returns lichtenstein told afp it s really more about investing towards funds that are using esg as part of a risk mitigation strategy and investors are pushed in that direction by a growing number of clients not only in democratic led us states but in europe and japan the northeastern state of maine in 2021 adopted a law requiring the state s pension system to divest itself of shares in fossil fuel companies a cost to taxpayers the new rules in republican states could come at a cost to those states taxpayers said ben cushing a financial specialist with the environmental advocacy group the sierra club texas for example last year adopted a law banning its cities from signing new contracts with banks that limit investment in petroleum companies or gun manufacturers the result the number of establishments participating in municipal bond issues in texas has declined and negotiated rates have risen costing taxpayers millions in extra interest according to a june study by researchers at the university of pennsylvania and the us federal reserve lichtenstein said it is too early to know the broader impact of the republican campaign he said it would not necessarily threaten an already well established trend clients are increasingly sensitive to climate change for example and investment managers still must take all risks into account but the red states are probably the loudest lichtenstein added and if republican states such as florida actively enforce their new rules fund managers may seek to avoid conflict ultimately said the sierra club s cushing that could compel financial establishments to slow their esg efforts just as they belatedly are beginning to address the climate crisis and recognize the very real financial implications of climate change

estimated that around 16 million working age americans 18 to 65 have long covid or about 8 percent of the total the brookings institution examined three reports to arrive at the number of workers who have left the workforce due as a consequence of their infection the first is from the federal reserve bank of minneapolis which recently conducted a survey that found almost one quarter of people who contracted covid 19 experienced symptoms for three months or more based on the official estimates of how many have been infected with covid this would mean that roughly 34 million working age americans have had long covid half of the respondents in the minneapolis survey reported they had recovered from long covid which leaves 17 million still affected roughly confirming the census bureau s estimate as for who among this group has left the labor market the minneapolis study reported that almost 26 percent had either reduced working hours at least 10 hours a week on a 40 hour week basis or quit altogether these estimates were echoed by a survey from the british trades union congress tuc that 20 percent of people with long covid were no longer working while another 16 percent said they were working fewer hours a third study was cited from the lancet on an international cohort found that 22 percent of long covid victims could no longer work due to poor health and another 45 percent had to reduce their hours finally given that three quarters of working age adults are active in the labor market or around 12 million of the 16 17 million with long covid brookings estimated that two to four million full time equivalent workers are out of the labor force due to long covid the range of the figure suggests that almost 2 percent of the labor force has been disabled this estimate has been substantiated by the bank of england which recently noted that labor force participation had dropped by 1 3 percent in the uk due to long term sickness i e long covid people wait in a long line to get a covid 19 test monday jan 3 2022 in north miami fla ap photo marta lavandier the pandemic has killed 260 000 working age adults in the us about one in 820 making it one of the leading causes of death in this age bracket these statistics however only tell part of the story another study published last week in the lancet public health which reviewed covid 19 and excess mortality among working age residents of california found that essential workers in agriculture manufacturing transportation logistics facilities and emergency services were dying of covid at twice the rate of all workers in the state meanwhile those in non essential sectors were dying at only half the rate or four times lower than their essential counterparts a study from late december 2021 published in the international journal of epidemiology found that socioeconomically disadvantaged regions in the us experienced a 31 percent heavier mortality burden as compared to more well off areas these findings are similar to those from a study conducted by the university of south florida s usf college of public health in the first year of the pandemic the usf researchers found that those in low socioeconomic levels died of covid at a rate five times higher than their more privileged counterparts their analysis found that 72 percent of the mortality difference was attributable to essential workers inability to participate in remote work given the socioeconomic disparities revealed in the covid pandemic the working class is bearing the brunt of the long covid pandemic the financial times estimated that about 100 million people worldwide have debilitating symptoms from long covid that linger for 12 weeks or more frequently leaving them unable to return to their previous working lives but many countries do not collect the necessary data or are reluctant to share it publicly additionally workers who fear losing their jobs if they tell their employers about their symptoms choose to conceal them the social cost of the pandemic s mass disabling event is now coming to light in addition to disabling millions long covid impacts on the lives of millions who must care for those afflicted with the disease those infected require multiple visits to doctors and hospitals if they have the resources to seek treatments as yet undiscovered clinical treatment thus remains largely guesswork meanwhile appropriate medical care has failed to keep pace with patient needs wait times for an appointment at long covid clinics can be months long if even available at all the promises to fund research have yet to materialize many who suffer from long covid lack paid sick leave or because of the nature of their work cannot accommodate their disabilities by working from home most disturbing has been the recent evidence that the injury from repeated covid infections is cumulative the fatigue breathlessness and mental drain are a product of a combination of persistent viable viruses immune dysfunction and injury to critical organs from micro clots that cause them to decline in function dr david strain a physician at the university of exeter in england s west country speaking with the financial times compared the mass covid infection as an inversion of the huge drop in respiratory illness that occurred in the 1980s when millions stopped or reduced smoking due to the recognition of its deleterious health consequences as to the impact covid has had he said the level of damage that s been done to population health it would be as if everybody suddenly decided to take up smoking in one go data from the uk has corroborated the study published by dr ziyad al aly based out of washington university in st louis analyzing databases at the us department of veterans affairs both have reported a significant rise in deaths from heart disease even among working age adults rates of heart failure diabetes and stroke are higher among those who have recovered from covid these are life long health complications that have suddenly been exacerbated by the infection and are being compounded by repeat infections as the financial times recently noted covid generated a kind of epidemiological aftershock by leaving people susceptible to a huge range of other conditions yet attempting to apply for social security disability insurance in the united states is a nightmarish bureaucratic challenge for long haulers the colloquial term for those with long covid to be approved for disability they must demonstrate objective evidence of their illness then they must prove the disease has been present for at least 12 months which is problematic as the definition and diagnosis remain opaque worse many don t know why they are sick or comprehend that they are eligible to apply for disability many of these long haulers suffer from severe fatigue shortness of breath and brain fog that precludes them from doing even simple tasks let alone analyzing data making plans and using careful judgment yet insurance companies are looking for solid evidence of unavailable tests or diagnostics as mark d debofsky a chicago lawyer who works for patients fighting for their benefits told the washington post a lot of times the insurance company is just looking at the physical requirements and saying you have a sedentary job and nothing precludes you from sitting at a desk all day in a march 2022 article titled long covid through a public health lens the authors provide a glimpse into the lives of these patients they wrote many reported functional restrictions that often require lifestyle changes changes in physical activity levels restricted social life and role limitations neurological cognitive and psychological symptoms such as anxiety or memory impairment strongly impact daily living and quality of life while routine activities such as driving and cooking can become very difficult or even impossible however for the financial oligarchs the names and faces of workers who toil to enrich their stock portfolios count for nothing compared to their day to day experiences at board meetings and luxury vacation getaways harvard economics professor david cutler who recently updated his study on the economic cost of long covid gives at least an approximate estimate in dollar terms of this new mass disability lost quality of life multiplies the years lost to long covid times an estimate that a year in good health is worth 100 000 assuming long covid lasts five years on average based on slow rates of recovery observed the implied cost is 2 2 trillion using assumptions for the number of people with long covid and those with severe symptoms having a 70 percent impairment in their labor force participation and this persisting for five years the net loss in income is 1 trillion finally the spending on medical care estimated at 8 731 for people with three or more symptoms and one third of that amount for those with less severe disease translates to an additional 528 billion the total cost reaches over 3 7 trillion over five years slightly less than the us military budget over the same period cutler wrote by another metric the cost of long covid rivals in aggregate the cost of the great recession because long covid is so new there is uncertainty about all of the numbers involved in the calculations still the costs here are conservative based on only cases to date the recent report on the continued decline in life expectancy in the us speaks volumes about the deeply rooted contradictions in capitalist relations that are most acute at the center of world capitalism the voracious greed that demands the extraction of ever more surplus value from the working class is draining them not only economically but in terms of life and happiness the cdc s primary role is said to be disease prevention but the agency fails to acknowledge the role socioeconomic factors play in the population s health and not once in their recent report on life expectancy during the covid pandemic do they address poverty and insufferable economic conditions as the root cause of the manifestation of the disease and its spread the health of every person is directly tied to the productive forces and social relations that constitute the basis of society throughout the history of capitalism social inequality and disease have been inextricably linked any genuine struggle to improve public health requires the mobilization of the working class against the capitalist system

the value proposition of these names goes well beyond the stock splits investors may remember 2022 as the year that stock splits came back after a relative lack of splits in recent years stocks with high nominal prices embraced the concept in increasing numbers this year splits change nothing financially one share at 1 000 holds the same value as 10 shares worth 100 each still the lower nominal price draws interest to the stock and makes it easier for small investors to buy whole shares such attributes can help boost the fortunes of amazon amzn 1 35 tesla tsla 5 59 and alphabet googl 1 82 goog 1 80 tech appears to lead this retailer s gains after the split will healy amazon amazon may have sparked a trend when it announced its 20 for 1 stock split in march this was its first split since 1999 and a few other companies followed its lead but despite that possible influence it seems the reasons not to buy amazon have moved to the forefront in the current inflationary environment consumers have lower buying power this does not help amazon as 84 of its revenue came from its north america and international segments each segment also reported negative operating income however the other 16 came from amazon web services aws amazon s cloud computing arm it grew revenue by 35 in the first six months of 2022 versus the same period in 2021 in comparison the overall company increased revenue by 7 over this same period moreover it generated 12 billion in operating income for the first two quarters of the year more than compensating for the 5 billion in operating losses for the other two segments during that time hence aws would have made the company profitable if not for valuation losses in equity securities and other noncore activities amazon has also recently begun publishing digital advertising figures given its performance it looks increasingly like a formidable competitor to alphabet and meta platforms in the first half of 2022 digital ads generated 17 billion in revenue a 20 increase from last year still even with such green shoots amazon has fallen 25 over the last year lagging the s p 500 this comes at a time when falling profits have taken its p e ratio to nearly 120 amazon s price to sales p s ratio stands at 3 after falling to multiyear lows early in the year this is less than emerging fulfillment rival shopify at an 8 p s ratio and cloud rival microsoft at 10 times sales as cloud and ad growth continue amid an increasingly challenging environment investors may consider taking advantage of amazon s lower split adjusted price tesla has strong financials and multiple long term growth opportunities justin pope tesla electric vehicle manufacturer tesla recently completed its latest split a 3 for 1 move that brings the stock s share price down to roughly 275 a more digestible figure for most investors tesla is one of the most successful investments of the past 15 years turning a 10 000 investment at its initial public offering into almost 2 million people were once skeptical of tesla s electric vehicle ambitions but today the company is widely considered the industry leader and carries a market cap of 870 billion more importantly tesla s increasing production volumes have pushed the business to profitability the company generated nearly 7 billion in free cash flow over the past year adding to a cash hoard of roughly 16 billion after subtracting debt despite tesla s success thus far its future remains bright the company produced roughly 258 000 vehicles in the second quarter of this year which projects to just over a million units for an entire year worldwide new vehicle sales total roughly 66 million units annually but just 10 of those were evs in 2021 tesla s global ev market share is currently about 14 so tesla s business could grow along with the ev category if people continue converting from gas to electric the stock is at a price to earnings ratio p e of just under 100 which seems expensive at roughly five times the valuation of the s p 500 until you consider the company s growth estimates analysts are calling for annual earnings per share eps growth of 31 over the next three to five years which means the company could grow into its lofty valuation over time tesla probably won t match the returns it created over the past 15 years but the ingredients are there for the company to compound your investment over the coming years ceo elon musk is among the most ambitious executives on earth he has a long list of projects that could each take the company to the next level including new vehicle models work in artificial intelligence and perhaps even walking robots alphabet s impressive revenue is driven by its significant share of the digital advertising market jake lerch alphabet on july 15 alphabet executed a 20 for 1 stock split which lowered the price of a single share from over 2 000 to just above 100 this stock split was great for several reasons first it s now easier for retail investors particularly those with smaller accounts to purchase shares of alphabet without delving into the sometimes confusing world of fractional shares second alphabet s stock split opens the door for the company to be added to price weighted indexes such as the dow jones industrial average setting aside the stock split catalysts alphabet remains a force to be reckoned with the company has generated 278 billion in revenue over the last 12 months and is on pace to generate more than 300 billion in 2023 the power behind alphabet is its large share of the digital advertising market thanks to its google search segment which places targeted ads within its search engine results despite alphabet s abundance of popular products such as youtube gmail and google cloud shares of the company

physics professor christopher barty says his latest company lumitron technologies inc is developing technology that could potentially change both the world of medicine and the world at large such technology is lumitron s hyperview an ultra high intensity laser based x ray machine it is designed to be capable of making 1 trillion x rays per second enabling 1 000 times higher fidelity at a 100 times lower dose of radiation than existing x rays the machine promises the ability to provide unprecedented imaging detail and cellular level treatment simultaneously according to a company statement in barty s words the technology marks the biggest clinical breakthrough since wilhelm röntgen the first nobel prize winner in physics first discovered x rays in 1895 lumitron founded in 2017 is developing the fourth generation of the hyperview prototype at its 21 000 square foot headquarters and r d facility at the uci research park we re making all of this stuff right here in this building barty lumitron s co founder and chief technology officer told the business journal i m kind of bullish on what we can do i couldn t have said that four years ago 220m 17 years barty holds three science degrees from north carolina state university and a ph d in applied physics from stanford university he has authored over 200 manuscripts and delivered over 200 lectures while he co founded lumitron with australian investor maurie stang in 2017 he doesn t consider their company a startup but rather a fledgling company whose proprietary technology is built upon 17 years and 220 million worth of r d its portfolio comprises 13 patents 10 of which barty is the sole inventor and the co inventor of the remaining three in 2020 the u s department of defense awarded lumitron an 11 6 million contract as part of its defense advanced research projects agency darpa program it has also been backed by general electric nyse ge since its inception to date lumitron has raised over 34 million of capital coming from investors vickers venture partners perennial value management and others after teaching at stanford for four years barty moved to san diego to run a private research organization at university of california san diego which focused on intense lasers and x rays in 2000 barty relocated to lawrence livermore national laboratory a federal research facility and nuclear weapons lab in the bay area where he served as chief technology officer of the lab s 3 2 billion laser directorate which houses the world s largest laser designed for nuclear fusion during his 17 years at livermore barty realized this laser technology could make significant impacts across industries and notably medicine bay area beginnings barty initially wanted to start lumitron in pleasanton where tech giants oracle and peoplesoft call home in hopes of attracting the right talent that all changed when university of california irvine provost enrique lavernia recruited him for a senior level faculty position as part of the school s 8 million convergence optical sciences initiative barty said he was awe stricken by the region s formidable medtech corridor and decided orange county would make for the most strategic location for lumitron s success today his company has a growing staff of 35 full time employees and 12 interns a mix of both bay area and local talent it s been relatively easy to recruit people from livermore to orange county it s a nice place he said also they come into work every day knowing they could be changing the world the hyperview assuming no more covid 19 and supply chain related interruptions barty is expecting the first prototype of the hyperview to come online this summer within the next few years lumitron will begin manufacturing dozens of the machines on an annual basis early recipients may include big names in the center of excellence market including the mayo clinic the university of texas md anderson cancer center and the uci medical center the lower levels of radiation used by the product offer users peace of mind along with better results according to barty there s a question about whether a mammogram causes or prevents breast cancer he said with our technology a woman must live 100 lifetimes to find out thus you ve completely eliminated this question the hyperview is also being designed to be roughly the size of a modern ct or mri machine at a fraction of the price and capable of both diagnosing and treating diseases like cancer if we do this right you ll never remove a breast or prostate again he said how valuable is curing cancer if you re the one with it you can t put a price tag on it barty believes this could possibly render the estimated 150 000 mris and cts installed around the globe obsolete these machines are like cars they will wear out and be replaced if we get diagnostics and therapy in the same machine who knows what we will do world domination in addition the products have also been envisioned for use in a variety of industries that have long struggled with next gen imaging needs the company says such as homeland security and 3d manufacturing
menafn afp republican led us states such as texas and west virginia are piling pressure on firms including giant asset manager blackrock for supposedly boycotting oil and gas companies as part of responsible investment strategies but the companies say the fossil fuel boycott claims are false and rules barring states from dealing with major financial firms could potentially backfire on taxpayers basing investments partly on a company s environmental social and governance esg practices is a sign of an unacceptable ideological agenda says florida governor ron desantis who is seen as a potential 2024 republican presidential nominee late last month he ordered bankers managing the state s huge pension fund to ignore those criteria and instead prioritize the financial security of the people of florida over whimsical notions of a utopian tomorrow the state controller of texas has meanwhile published a list of companies including blackrock and several european banks deemed to be boycotting petroleum firms state officials were instructed to no longer sign contracts with firms on the list west virginia a smaller state but one rich in coal and natural gas similarly singled out not just blackrock but also such wall street pillars as jpmorgan chase wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley any institution with policies aimed at weakening our energy industries tax base and job market has a clear conflict of interest in handling taxpayer dollars that state s treasurer riley moore said in a statement disconnected from reality the banks targeted however deny they are engaging in any such boycott while some of them have decided to stop financing oil exploration projects in the arctic for example they are continuing to lend money to the industry jp morgan decried west virginia s rule as shortsighted and disconnected from the facts blackrock the world s biggest asset manager says it has invested more than 108 billion in texas oil companies including exxonmobil referring to texas s new rule the wall street firm said in a statement that elected and appointed public officials have a duty to act in the best interests of the people they serve politicizing state pension funds restricting access to investments and impacting the financial returns of retirees is not consistent with that duty joshua lichtenstein whose law firm ropes gray tracks the way states are regulating esg investments said that the republican led attacks may be misguided the political rhetoric is addressing a world that doesn t exist he said the choice is not really between directing investment capital towards esg or investment capital towards returns lichtenstein told afp it s really more about investing towards funds that are using esg as part of a risk mitigation strategy and investors are pushed in that direction by a growing number of clients not only in democratic led us states but in europe and japan the northeastern state of maine in 2021 adopted a law requiring the state s pension system to divest itself of shares in fossil fuel companies a cost to taxpayers the new rules in republican states could come at a cost to those states taxpayers said ben cushing a financial specialist with the environmental advocacy group the sierra club texas for example last year adopted a law banning its cities from signing new contracts with banks that limit investment in petroleum companies or gun manufacturers the result the number of establishments participating in municipal bond issues in texas has declined and negotiated rates have risen costing taxpayers millions in extra interest according to a june study by researchers at the university of pennsylvania and the us federal reserve lichtenstein said it is too early to know the broader impact of the republican campaign he said it would not necessarily threaten an already well established trend clients are increasingly sensitive to climate change for example and investment managers still must take all risks into account but the red states are probably the loudest lichtenstein added and if republican states such as florida actively enforce their new rules fund managers may seek to avoid conflict ultimately said the sierra club s cushing that could compel financial establishments to slow their esg efforts just as they belatedly are beginning to address the climate crisis and recognize the very real financial implications of climate change

the irvine operations of terran orbital corp recently provided six small satellites for a pioneering mission into space in the latest sign of growth for the local aerospace company and another example of orange county s growing role in space related work the satellites blasted off on may 25 aboard elon musk s spacex falcon 9 rocket as part of what was called the transporter 5 mission in total 59 payloads were taken into space see story this page all six satellites from terran were deployed into low earth orbit terran says its satellites typically operate at around 450 kilometers 280 miles to 650 kilometers in altitude pretty much all of the work was done in irvine said terran chief technology officer austin williams williams emphasized that some of the components for the satellites were made by terran s subsidiary in turin italy terran nyse llap which has its headquarters in florida says its single brand name now covers all of the company s units including the former tyvak nano satellite systems inc in irvine terran significantly added to its local operations over the past year to meet the growing demand for small satellites both in terms of headcount and office and manufacturing space its manufacturing and office space now totals over 250 000 square feet while its headcount is more than 330 with much of that in oc march spac terran went public via a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company or spac in march in a deal that initially valued the company around 1 6 billion and provided it with nearly 500 million in new funds its shares trading at about 10 at the time the reverse merger was announced have fallen by more than 40 the last few months amid the general market slump and a lukewarm reception of late for spacs the company s valuation stood around 792 million as of last week terran last month reported about 13 1 million in revenue for the latest quarter up from 10 5 million from the year ago period it reported a net loss of 71 million for the latest quarter last quarter saw the company ink 162 million of new contracts it counted a record backlog of 222 million as of march 31 2022 up 200 from the end of 2021 it said global connectivity the terran orbital satellites launched from cape canaveral in florida include three for nasa demonstrations one for a company called fleet space of australia and two for the geooptics firm of pasadena the fleet space spacecraft is part of a constellation commissioned by the company to deliver global connectivity specifically designed for the energy exploration and resource industries the geooptics vehicles 1 and 2 are the first phase of a next generation satellite constellation to form a unified earth observatory allowing governments industry and individual stakeholders to monitor and prepare for the many impacts of climate change the spacecraft for nasa were designed built integrated tested here according to williams who is based in irvine integrated refers to the process of combining the mechanical and electrical elements into a single entity he said in irvine we designed and built the piece parts for the fleet space and geooptics vehicles three of the satellites were put together in irvine and for the other three the components were built here and assembled in italy by a terran subsidiary williams told the business journal on may 26 all of the technology was developed here in irvine according to williams the six satellites represent the most that we ve had on one launch parent company terran has a firm and growing presence in irvine last year it leased four floors of space in the 400 spectrum center tower the largest office lease for an area office tower announced since the onset of the pandemic terran expects to grow to between 400 and 500 employees working there on engineering design and development work for small satellites terran challenge what s unique in this launch is the variety of customers and missions that are being served williams said he added showing that you can very quickly develop spacecraft that are doing a variety of missions for both government and commercial customers design develop and integrate those quickly and get them on a rocket is a unique challenge that sets terran orbital apart terran co founder chairman and chief executive marc bell said the company looks forward to continue partnering with nasa geooptics and the others on future satellite missions terran had previously announced a significant expansion in manufacturing capabilities as well as contract awards from lockheed martin the space development agency and the defense advanced research projects agency tyvak the irvine based unit said in march it aims to deliver more than 1 000 satellites per year as prices come down and both defense and commercial uses grow earlier this year tyvak said it was awarded a contract to build 42 satellites for the pentagon to support global warfighter missions with a vast communications and surveillance network in outer space iceye s irvine work expanding satellite maker iceye whose persistent monitoring technology can be used for a variety of government and commercial uses said it successfully launched five new satellites on spacex s late may falcon 9 smallsat rideshare mission that also included offerings from terran orbital corp helsinki based iceye and its irvine based iceye us division have now deployed 21 satellites since 2018 including both commercial and dedicated customer missions the company s satellite constellation is designed to provide customers with reliable and frequent imagery enabling the rapid detection and tracking of changes on the earth s surface regardless of time of day or weather conditions according to the company this capability is vital for government and commercial uses in various sectors including insurance natural catastrophe response and recovery national security defense humanitarian relief and climate change monitoring the may 25 launch included the second and third satellites built licensed and operated by iceye us which established a satellite manufacturing facility early last year at its headquarters in irvine the newly launched satellites are licensed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and will be operated and controlled exclusively from the company s 24 7 mission operations center in irvine the company said expanding our fleet of u s built satellites is a critical step that expands our capability to support our customers across the u s government says jerry welsh ceo of iceye us we are seeing a shift in the u s and international government sector that is now looking to fully leverage and integrate commercial remote sensing technologies into their collection

by mwansa chalwe snr the international monetary fund imf has never been popular in zambia as it presided over the destruction of zambia s industrial base and social fabric from the 1980s to mid 2000s through its application of the washington consensus s structural adjustment programme sap and its flagship privatisation programme the current level of high unemployment high poverty levels and the huge informal sector comprising of about 85 of employment in zambia can all be mainly traced back and be attributed to the imf sap programme but the imf of the 1980s 90s and early 2000s is not the same imf of 2022 far from it and people should not be misled by people who do not read and research to update their knowledge because they packed their degrees after graduation zambia has been trying to get the international monetary fund imf deal for eight years since june 2014 under the late president michael sata as well as under former president edgar lungu who took over from him in 2015 the patriotic front pf failed to secure the imf programme because they were bad economic managers and not trusted by the financial markets including the imf i was a supporter of the imf program under the pf and i have also been a supporter of the program under the united party for national development upnd because my opinions are based on facts and rationale i am among non partisan and patriotic citizens the likes that any seating government should be seeking independent advice from in order to get an objective and fair view of issues on the ground read more on the 31st august 2022 the united party for national development upnd government led by former businessman and zambian president hakainde hichilema managed to secure the imf deal within one year which eluded the patriotic front for seven 7 years the fund released a statement announcing the approval of zambia s bail out the executive board of the international monetary fund imf approved a 38 month arrangement under the extended credit facility ecf in an amount equivalent to sdr 978 2 million around us 1 3 billion or 100 percent of quota the program is based on the authorities home grown economic reform plan that aims to restore macroeconomic stability and foster higher more resilient and more inclusive growth the imf said in statement announcing the bailout approval the authorities program supported by the ecf arrangement will advance the authorities home grown reform plan to restore debt sustainability create fiscal space for much needed social spending and strengthen economic governance i am one of the commentators who has written several articles on zambia s pursuit of the imf program for eight years including writing a book on zambia s ten year road to economic ruin under the patriotic front pf and the attendant result of the country turning into a battleground for the stealth economic war between china and the west before most experts could discern it the book is on amazon it is catalogued both in the usa library of congress and the united nations library and as well as their on line libraries read more china west battleground in africa debt ridden zambia why u s may lose geo economic competition to china on the basis of my knowledge of the zambian economy in recent times and how a country that was weaned off the dreaded imf went back cap in hand for assistance i decided to write a summarized educational piece on the expected impact of the imf program from both the technical angle and from an ordinary zambian s point of view i will also show how the imf is using zambia as a case study to promote its new brand i was motivated to write this piece because there is so much ignorance and lies flying around following the zambia imf deal technical benefits of the imf program economic experts have explained and justified the benefits of the imf program to be as follows facilitating debt restructuring of zambian foreign debts supporting balance of payments attracting foreign investments facilitating borrowing from concessionary sources such as multilateral and bilateral partners and attract grants funds reduction in domestic borrowing thus stopping government from overcrowding the private sector and lastly to make funds saved from debt repayments available to support social programs the majority of stakeholders agree that the imf is highly effective during a financial crisis it is also valued most for helping countries overcome financing difficulties and providing sound policy advice the imf has built its global reputation around these areas providing sound policy advice and technical assistance to member countries helping countries overcome financial crises but it has failed to meet its goal of promoting jobs there is no need to elaborate or expand on the above technical benefits because the targeted readership understand them very well the problem is the man on the street does not know the costs and benefits of the imf program and the lack of a communications strategy with a clearly laid out simple message has been the achilles heel of many african governments including the new dawn there is need for an aggressive communications strategy with simple messages in a language that the most important demographic the uneducated and non technical people understand i am going to provide free knowledge consultancy services to the current administration which foreign advisors who are out not in touch with ordinary zambians the voters cannot provide the advice herein should be the basis of how they should explain the imf program to the man on the street including villagers expected benefits to ordinary zambians of the imf program the impact and translation of the technical benefits alluded to above can be summarised as follows the cost of living and doing business is likely to go down due to the strength of the kwacha medicines in hospitals are likely to be available as there will more donor support and even the donors who had left may come back or resume their support more donor aid will flow in to support social programs due to perceived reduction or fight against corruption free education financing likely to be sustained fertilizers will be cheaper and more subsidies to deserving farmers is likely low interest rates for micro and small businesses mses as the cost of capital will go down because banks will be stuck with billions of cash since government will no longer be borrowing at same level as before standard chartered bank s recent reduction of interest rates is a good example and others are likely to follow the cheap money is likely to result in increased economic activities and some limited job creation but not the millions required which need extraordinary and innovative measures like the one i will suggest later in my conclusion there should be no dispute that zambia s social programs will be supported in the current imf deal the 21st century imf has gone on record and committed to supporting zambia s social programs spending on social protection is projected to more than double from 0 7 percent of gdp in 2020 to 1 6 percent by 2025 around the average for sub saharan african countries measures to support the most vulnerable include increasing the number of recipients of the social cash transfer to 994 000 an almost 50 percent increase over 2019 recipients and the monthly benefit increased from 90 to 110 kwacha with world bank support other social protection programs are also being expanded including programs to mitigate food security risks keep girls in school and help provide meals for students in schools the fund supported program incorporates providing access to free education for all and a much needed increase in spending on health and education including hiring over 41 000 additional health and education workers they stated on their website according to some studies imf programs have been correlated and credited with an increase in free and fairer elections free speech and the right to organize in countries that were under imf agreements in some countries therefore the imf has been said to be a blessing in disguise by their citizens in that it has helped them move from dictatorship to a democratic dispensation with good governance rule of law control of corruption freedom of the press strong and independent governance institutions the zambian opposition and those against the imf program should sometimes really think twice because most of the civil liberties that they are enjoying are courtesy of the imf program they should be thanking the imf for the civil liberties that they are enjoying currently because some of them could have been be in imprison by now serving huge sentences after trial in kangaroo courts this is a fact what are the possible conditions and negative impact of the current imf program the critics of the imf programs are predicting that zambians will experience hardships like in the past during the structural adjustments programmes sap the summarised standard sap conditions which zambians should be looking out for and use as the checklist of the current imf deal are as follows reduction in government spending and foreign borrowing encouraging privatization of state owned enterprises increasing taxes and enforcement removal of agriculture subsidies removal of free basic education reduction in funding for the health sector relentless fight against corruption good governance and human rights promotion lowering or eliminating tariffs on imported goods opening up the economy to foreign investors on advantageous terms at almost any cost on the basis of the aforementioned they can make a determination whether the imf has invoked these conditions in the current deal or not and whether some the above conditions are good for the country or not if the authorities are not disclosing the imf conditions the above check list should be enough for critics to provide the checks and balances they need read more in my reading i doubt whether ordinary zambians will be substantially badly affected by the imf deal than they are now by the feared austerity measures as in the past there are two main reasons for my view the first is that zambia has been on a de facto imf programme for about seven years because the patriotic front pf had implemented most of the prior actions that the imf normally demands zambians have been going through an effective austerity for quite a long time it has been spread out over a number of years without ordinary citizens knowing and realizing it and consequently attributing it to the imf program to illustrate this point is issue of power and fuel the prices of fuel and power have been progressively going up over the years as subsidies were being removed by both the pf and more recently the upnd the current high cost of living started some years ago and it can easily be attributable to the prior conditions that imf demanded under the four finance ministers felix mutati margret mwanakatwe bwalya ng andu and now situmbeko musokotwane the high cost of living has just continued in 2022 but likely to level off later this year or next year due to the improved kwacha exchange rate the second reason is that the imf of the 80s 90s and early 2000 is quite different from the current one this is due to the reforms the fund embarked on in 2009 when most countries started avoiding to borrow from them especially after 1998 asia financial crisis imf ended up getting stark with billions with no takers imf got resurrected by 2008 financial crisis caused by subprime mortgages in us there is some evidence in the zambian bail out deal of the new imf which can only denied by opposition politicians and their sympathisers is zambia a case study of the 21st century imf there was so much excitement after zambia s imf program was approved by the board of directors the program was approved unanimously and surprising enough the excitement extended to the imf management circles any curious observer could infer from the excitement that the fund could be using zambia as a benchmark case study in a number of respects and the imf managing director kristalina georgieva remarks seemed to give an inkling of that today s decision is also a major milestone for the g20 common framework successfully implementing this programme will unlock new growth potential for the zambian people and it shows others that the g20 common framework can deliver said georgieva in her comments on the deal there is also evidence in the zambian deal that imf may want to launder its past image and improve its brand by projecting an image of a responsible and caring lender who is sensitive to members social programs the fund has allowed president hh s administration to implement social programs that were unheard of before zambia has been allowed to increase the size of its civil service by the employment of teachers and health workers increase in the number and amount paid out as social cash transfers allowed increase in the constituency development fund as well as doubled the amount of the farmers input support program fisp in 2022 budget to k10billion from 2021 the standard imf conditions in the past have been reduction in the size of the civil service and elimination of subsidies and social programs this is clearly not happening in zambia at least not to the same degree as in the past this has shocked many people including former imf employee and zambia national broadcasting corporation director general chibamba kanyama this has disarmed and silenced many objective critics of imf we have seen the imf for the first time approving what they could not ordinarily approve how do you employ 40 000 civil servants within a given budget year imf would have resisted this they would have recommended the opposite that you retrench the civil service kanyama said to a nigerian tv station in an interview conclusion zambians should not be mistaken that the imf program will solve the country s economic problems if no serious economic transformational steps are taken by the new dawn government the imf deal is a pain killer like panadol and it cannot be expected to heal the diseases in our economy if the current structure of our economy is not changed we have an economy which is foreign owned dependent on one primary export which is copper import dependent without any manufacturing base an undiversified economic portfolio and 85 informal economy you cannot hope to develop with such an economic structure the new dawn should look on the above list and start addressing them as zambians we should not be necessarily celebrating clinching the deal from an institution that specializes in bailing out countries who find themselves in desperate financial stress because it is the third time that we have approached them botswana which is less endowed has never been bailed out by imf in 56 years of indpence but in fact lent imf funds at one time we should all be filled with a sense of shame about being such irresponsible managers of our economy and affairs we can of course give credit to president hh who is currently in charge to have brought back credibility and normalcy to zambia and one hopes that he starts listening more to those outside his inner circle his predecessor partly failed due to his arrogance and ignoring advice outside his inner circle including from this author he was so drunk with power that he publicly declared himself as the alpha and the omega the same way people feel ashamed to go to a micro lender read kaluba because often times it may reflect a serious lack of prudential discipline in my view is the same way zambians should actually be feeling a bit of shame instead of celebrating as if we are in victory this for me should have been a defining moment of deep self reflection for a 58 year old country during which we commit ourselves never again to mismanage our affairs into such shame by making sure that we begin to make practical changes to our governance systems to ensure that no government or politicians such as the ones who ruled us in the last 10 years ever get into leadership roles in the first place jeff mbizure an academic posted on the university whatsapp group of the pioneers most of them retired after distinguished careers of zambia s first business school in kitwe president hh launched the national development plan 8 ndp 8 on the september 1 2022 which is a very good document and plan but zambia s problem has not been the lack of plans but rather the absence of designing of innovative and practical programmes and projects to implement such plans it is this respect that i would like to publicly ask the president to engage me so that i can share my designed innovative and technology based programme to fast track the creation of hundreds of thousands youth jobs through the transformation of zambia s huge informal sector as part of implementing ndp 8 the initiative is based on three years of painstaking research to find solutions to youth unemployment and so it is not something to take lightly

father of the year and alleged president joe biden is busy trying to rile up his base of weirdos adjunct professors gender studies grads government timeservers sexually unsatisfied wine women and their sexually unsatisfying life partners that s why dork brandon pulled one of my favorites out of his big duffel bag o hack cliches the old your puny guns are no match against the awesome power of the us military which i will use to kill you for dissenting narrative advertisement okay fine let s go over this again for the knuckleheads who think that they prevail if they step outside the use your words paradigm they grew up with in their sissy private schools you lose if you idiots provoke a real civil conflict not the kind of low intensity urban conflict of the seventies where you cheered on the weathermen and cinque s sla and not the kind where a bunch of mutants riot under the protection of leftist municipal governments in leftist municipalities but a real one one where the people you want to crush under your birkenstocks fight back with ar 15s i discuss this in great detail in my new non fiction book we ll be back the fall and rise of america and not from the perspective of half wit daughter showering goofs but from the real down and dirty of how this terrible course of events would actually unspool and it would go poorly for a largely unarmed untrained urban centered population of smug geebos whose primary weapon system is a snarky tweet the doddering moron shared his tactical insights with his audience at a rally in pennsylvania for heart attack shrek he said thinking he was super clever for those brave right wing americans if you want to fight against the country you need an f 15 you need something little more than a gun hmmmm but do they really grandpa badfinger s premise is that all you tens of millions of semi fascists out there with your ar 15s would have no shot stopping the woke military which would eagerly crush you with their potent force package of f 15s and esoteric pronouns it is a flawed premise on more grounds than one column can cover hence my book but we need to focus and that means we will need to overlook some important questions these important questions include advertisement recommended why do you imagine your sorry band of socialist creeps who treat the constitution like jerry nadler treats his boxers constitutes the country the useless senior officer corps aside why do you believe the normals who make up the vast majority of america s combat forces will gleefully butcher their friends and family for the amusement of a bunch of chardonnay swilling blue checks have you ever heard of afghanistan let s focus on his key sound bite gun vs jets who ya got i m putting my money on the guns you dumb progressives can go for the jets and the points now let s start raising the kind of facts that tend to undermine the soundbite that launched a thousand msnbcgasms first up what does a gun do what does a fighter bomber do well a gun gives an individual soldier and that s what civilian freedom fighters would be the ability to dominate the space on the ground around them out to a couple hundred meters of open territory let s not argue about maximum effective ranges or the fact that civilians have a lot of weapons that outrange the 5 56mm weapons systems currently used by the military a weapon system whose bullets mr 10 off the top thinks fly five times as rapidly as a bullet shot out of any other gun in other words a gun controls space on the ground coincidentally the ground happens to be where people live advertisement a jet fighter dominates air space and keeps other planes away few people actually live in the air now a jet fighter bomber like the f 15 can drop bombs on the enemy which is according to crusty us freedom loving american citizens of course this kind of tactical employment works to support guys on the ground dominating terrain with guns planes don t hold territory they help soldiers hold territory so it s an apples and oranges thing at the threshold which is appropriate since the whole discussion slow joe began is pretty much fruit loops biden assumes he s got soldiers to support with his jets how many who knows some but lots of colonels and generals the kind who add he him or zip zap to their official signature blocks would salute and carry out order to kill other americans hey maybe they can win this war and finally get one in the win column after three decades they re due but the problem for them is quantity there are tens of millions of american patriots with guns ar 15s being only one color in the rainbow of freedom defending firearms real diversity is 5 56mm alongside 7 62mm and 30 06 and 12 gauge and 45 and others all firing together for a brighter tomorrow so there better be a lot of airplanes to balance out millions of patriots um how many fighter bombers do we have anyway well let s give america s greatest matlock superfan the benefit of the doubt and include all types of fighter bombers f 25s f 16s f 18s f 35s and even a 10s let s see there are about 1750 planes for the air force about 1100 planes for the navy and maybe 300 for the marines so call it 3150 aircraft okay where are they you have to have them here in america if you want to kill americans for refusing to obey so how many are in the continental united states and available for hunter s dad s open season on dissidents advertisement call it two thirds we have lots of planes forward deployed europe asia on ships he s got about 2000 aircraft to use to kill other americans that s what he was saying so we ll take him at his slurred semi coherent word add maybe another 400 combat drones in the usa now there s a thing called the or rate operational readiness that s the percentage of planes that are ready to go at a given time planes need maintenance they break and even routine use requires massive upkeep efforts and parts can be hard to get especially when you are spending all your money on woke nonsense what s the real or rate i don t know it s probably classified and as we know today exposing classified material is bad and we can t wait for it to go back to being a ok when hillary does it again or when someone leaks something classified to the nyt or wapo and they publish it let s assume 75 that loud laughing you just heard is military aviation professionals scoffing at a consistent 75 or rate this means president gumby has 1500 planes and 300 drones to suppress those millions of dissenters hey that s 36 aircraft a state that s still a lot of platforms and they can still do a lot of damage assuming there are enough bombs stored in our bunkers the hellfire missile stocks would vanish quickly and aren t those made in florida awkward can that fleet of aircraft do enough damage to deter and defeat a few million red rebels how does one say i am unconvinced in pashto advertisement to get a better result in america than in afghanistan the great unifier would have to dramatically increase the firepower used again on americans on american soil you can bet the rules of engagement on republicans would be a lot looser than the ones on the jihadis but he forgets that the guys with the ar 15s get a say regarding those f 15s wait how does an ar 15 defeat an f 15 you can t really shoot it down no but you can shoot it up on the ground and you can ambush its logistics and the pilots well the old irish republican army not the later communist one a century ago was getting clobbered by a bunch of scotland yard detectives in dublin sent over from london so they surveilled the coppers and one morning launched a coordinated operation to assassinate the whole lot of them remember pilots including drone jockeys do not grow on trees it s no secret except to dumb people that the weak point in a military machine is the meat sack in the driver s seat and don t imagine the people having bombs dropped on them are going to be nice to the guys dropping the bombs on them and their families or to biden s pilots families when you okay dropping jdams on civilians you don t get to dictate payback the enemy always gets a vote and biden just announced that his enemy is tens of millions of us patriotic citizens so in the great ar 15 vs f 15 hypothetical and pray it stays hypothetical despite the stupidity of our ruling caste the smart money is on the numbers but the truly smart course of action is to not to even go down this road to re embrace our constitution and to stop trying to be butch in order to get

in mid september shortly after which all audit work papers requested by the pcaob must be made available to them audit work papers differ from the actual information on companies gathered by accounting firms the work papers record the audit procedure tests gathered information and conclusions about the review according to the pcaob website it is not clear what level of highly sensitive information if any would be included in the work papers the ability of the u s to inspect those work papers for chinese companies listed in the u s has been a years long dispute u s political and legal developments in the last two years have sped up the threat that the chinese companies might need to delist from u s stock exchanges a turning point came in late august when the pcaob and china securities regulatory commission signed a cooperation agreement that laid the regulatory basis for allowing u s inspections of audit firms within china s borders that s according to statements from both government entities which also said china s ministry of finance signed the deal i see this as a big progress meaning that both sides were willing to take steps to move this forward said stephanie

pointing to a tight physical market platinum lease rates remain at almost record highs automotive jewellery and industrial sectors remain resilient despite strong headwinds total supply forecast down 8 in 2022 platinum etf holdings and exchange stocks fall as excess china imports rise london sept 5 2022 prnewswire the world platinum investment council wpic today publishes its platinum quarterly for the second quarter of 2022 with a revised full year forecast for 2022 despite resilience in the automotive jewellery and industrial sectors combined with reduced mining and recycling supply a reduction in etf holdings and exchange stocks saw a platinum surplus in q2 22 of 349 koz and the forecast 2022 surplus increase to 974 koz however despite the surplus physical market tightness continued throughout the second quarter and remains ongoing q2 22 saw the resurgence of exceptionally strong import volumes into china significantly above identified demand which were met largely by sizeable flows from platinum etfs and exchange stocks these excess imports into china which are not captured in published supply and demand data resulted in physical platinum market tightness this is evidenced by elevated lease rates that have remained high peaking at 10 in may higher even than those seen at the peak of the pandemic and significantly above the ten year average this physical market tightness also incentivised the movement of platinum held by exchanges into the spot market to help meet the china import volumes total supply forecast to decline 8 in 2022 total platinum supply in 2022 is forecast to decline 8 626 koz year on year to 7 514 koz mining supply in q2 22 was down 4 as an increase in russian output following a recovery from flooding in 2021 offset year on year declines in all other producing countries the issues in the second quarter combined with the depletion of semi finished inventory that boosted refined volumes in 2021 will see total mine supply in 2022 decline 7 409 koz year on year the recycling of platinum from spent autocatalysts fell by a noteworthy 20 year on year 82 koz in q2 22 with automotive recycling forecast to be down 15 210 koz in 2022 driving this was the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage and its impact on new car availability resulting in consumers being forced to run existing vehicles for longer thereby reducing the supply of scrapped autocatalysts resilience in automotive jewellery and industrial sectors automotive demand for platinum grew 8 50 koz year on year in q2 22 although the semi conductor shortage is ongoing it is easing and the year on year increase reflects higher vehicle production volumes higher platinum loadings on heavy duty vehicle hdv aftertreatment systems particularly in china and increased use of platinum in place of palladium in light duty gasoline vehicles in china however the strict lockdowns that endured during the first six weeks of the quarter weighed on vehicle production for full year 2022 platinum automotive demand is expected to increase by 14 376 koz to 3 015 koz jewellery demand improved by 5 26 koz in q2 22 with most markets aside from a covid impaired china continuing to grow this was bolstered in part by considerable demand in north america and europe due to more weddings and platinum s price remaining well below the price of gold platinum jewellery demand for 2022 is forecast to be 1 959koz a slight increase on 2021 industrial demand saw growth in the petroleum 17 7 koz medical 8 5 koz and other industrial 16 21 koz sectors during the quarter all of which are forecast to grow in 2022 as a whole the growth in these sectors is masked within the overall industrial demand forecast for 2022 15 375 koz as capacity expansions seen in 2021 in the glass and chemical sectors are not repeated this year mixed investment demand obscured by physical metal flows global bar and coin demand strengthened quarter on quarter to 70 koz in q2 22 driven by north american demand which is set to post a new post covid high in 2022 of 292 koz however in japan high yen denominated platinum prices continued to encourage profit taking among investors for the second consecutive quarter albeit at a lower level to the previous quarter full year total bar and coin investment is forecast to reduce by 14 47 koz for etf holdings recessionary fears rising interest rates and weaker commodity prices were visible this quarter mirroring the net sales trends seen in gold and silver etfs etf holdings contracted by 89 koz albeit significantly less than in the previous quarter following this trend etf holdings are expected to continue to fall in 2022 declining by a total of 550 koz meanwhile nymex and tocom warehouse stocks fell by a combined 123 koz over the quarter this reduction helped meet the flow of physical metal from western markets to china and compensate for the reduced availability of refined russian ingot due to key russian refineries loss of london good delivery status preventing its typical use exchange stocks are forecast to decline by 300 koz for the full year as the physical market tightness and resulting high lease rates seen in the second quarter are expected to persist for the rest of the year paul wilson ceo of the world platinum investment council commented the surplus we are forecasting for 2022 must be seen within the context of exceptionally strong imports of platinum into china which are well above identified chinese demand and were a feature once again in q2 22 importantly the definition of demand in our projections does not include speculative positions outside of bar and coin etfs and exchange stocks therefore this additional demand from china is not captured in our published demand data the details of the split for this material between speculative and other demand segments is still yet to become clear however we anticipate that this will become more apparent over the next 12 months significantly the sustained high platinum lease rates we have been seeing throughout 2022 the highest in ten years and higher even than those seen during the peak of the pandemic when moving materials was extremely challenging are a clear indication of shortages of physical metal in the market furthermore this already tight market is underpinned by constrained mine and recycle supply as shown in our published data despite considerable headwinds in 2022 pockets of platinum demand strength particularly in the automotive jewellery and industrial sectors are promising in both the near and long term platinum s role in unlocking hydrogen s crucial contribution to achieving global net zero targets is becoming widely known and offers an option to investors looking for exposure to this area the

michael hicks it has been two and a half years since the covid pandemic pushed the united states into recession the national economy remains burdened by the pandemic particularly in labor markets while the unemployment rate is low levels of total employment and labor force participation have failed to return to pre covid levels new data is beginning to offer a better understanding of why that is the case the u s is still about 1 0 percent below its pre covid participation rate which is simply the number of people working divided by the number of working age adults that works out to roughly 1 6 million fewer people employed or looking for work however that figure overstates the health of the recovery we also need to consider the growth of the available labor force by my calculations that should be another 2 million people altogether it seems something like 3 6 million fewer people are now in the labor force than should have been without covid i say like because there s enough seasonal variation and uncertainty about growth to suggest i am off by plus or minus half a million there are several competing hypotheses as to why this is happening looking purely at levels of participation by age group the big decline in labor force participation came among adults aged 55 or older this should be of little surprise because this age group saw the biggest loss of life during covid and experienced the most morbidity the reason this could be a reasonable explanation for the big loss of labor force participation is that baby boomers work past retirement age at much higher rates than do older generations so for the past two decades much of the increase in labor force participation came from baby boomers today about 70 percent of the total loss of workers post covid came from baby boomers who are not today 25 percent of the labor force so it is clear older workers either left work or retired early in pretty large numbers as a consequence of the disease again this could be due to risk but the astonishing rise in stock prices doubtless convinced many it was time to retire to understand other problems we must observe what state variation did to labor force participation there are several factors to consider death rates from covid varied remarkably by state florida for example had a death rate that was twice that of indiana s while florida had a higher share of adults aged 65 or older a little statistical modeling work reveals that the older age share of the population explains only a small share of the labor force decline labor markets could also be influenced by the type of state response to the pandemic too restrictive the business employee relationship might have been severed poorly executed state laws would result in higher disease incidence more death and morbidity again florida is a good place to consider particularly since florida s governor is thought by many to have responded well to the crisis florida s covid death rate was stunningly high compared to indiana s and their labor force participation rate today is a full 4 0 percentage points below that of indiana today the overall unemployment rates in both states are the same and both are still below their pre covid labor force perhaps there is something else at play on labor market outcomes oxford university has created a nice index of covid restrictions they call the severity index this is the list of restrictions placed on state and local governments by state leaders it is part of an international effort to understand the cost and benefits of public health measures on this scale indiana ranks 2nd nationwide as having the least restrictive covid rules florida isn t near indiana on that ranking doing no better than sixth place indiana had half the death rate with far less restrictive policies than did florida when it comes to the mix of governments restrictions indiana had what was arguably the best statewide response i believe this was largely due to respect for federalism which allowed local governments particularly schools to adjust their approach as local conditions warranted this is critical because prime working age deaths from covid were much larger than most americans think covid killed almost 3 000 prime working age hoosiers aged 20 to 59 and more than 10 000 floridians in the same age group florida s death rate among prime working age adults was more than 15 percent higher than indiana s or 1 500 extra deaths it must also be said that indiana s state response was almost wholly focused on the wellbeing of hoosiers in the decades to come historians and economists will study this in more detail i think it is early enough to conclude a few important things in what was clearly the biggest crisis to face any state since the civil war indiana s response was among the most effective in the nation covid also affected survivors of the disease a recent brookings study reports that about 1 6 million workers are out of work due to long term complications related to covid indiana s share of that would be about 1 500 more prime age workers whether or not this remains a problem will depend on the ongoing severity of individuals suffering from lengthy inability to work due to the disease finally the disease imposed huge costs on home caregivers school closures and the disease itself left many households with new duties at home women bore the brunt of this the labor force participation rate of women plummeted in the early days of covid and has failed to return to pre covid levels some of this may be due to choice to either remain home with children or to continue to provide care to an ill family member what isn t clear is how these outcomes affect families beyond the obvious negative effects of death and morbidity many of these changes are benign or positive a worker s choice to retire is just that a choice if a family wishes to forego some earnings to pursue home schooling or to stay at home with young children that is a choice having choice is the essence of a free market economy and the policy role lies primarily in expanding choice not deciding for folks the loss of older workers has also resulted in wage increases particularly at the bottom rungs of the income scale this is a rare moment when the demand for workers outstrips supply sufficiently to see it in the wage data that is a rare silver lining to a deep and saddening period in world history michael j hicks phd is the director of the center for business and economic research and the george and frances ball distinguished

representational image measured in dollar terms the size of the indian economy surpassed that of the united kingdom as per data from the last quarter of 2021 the calculation uses the current exchange rates between the rupee and british pound respectively and the us dollar the gdp data is as per the international monetary fund this makes india now the fifth largest economy in the world behind the united states china japan and germany as per the same data india s gdp is 3 2 trillion dollars now behind 4 2 trillion of germany if it grows at 7 per cent per annum and the german economy stands still then india will overtake germany in four years at 5 5 per cent growth it will take five years there is a catch however even if you assume that the german economy will be at zero growth that catch is exchange rates if the rupee dollar rate depreciates faster than the euro dollar exchange rate since germany s currency is the euro then it becomes harder to overtake germany quickly the gains of the gdp growth gap are partly undone by a depreciating currency if india s currency gets stronger vis à vis the dollar then of course its economy measured in dollars will grow faster however a strong currency may not be in india s favour since that may hurt our exports if the international comparisons are too sensitive to exchange rates the world bank has devised another method called purchasing power parity it adjusts exchange rates to reflect the true purchasing power of the respective currencies thus 80 rupees to the dollar makes the rupee look too weak actually one dollar in india gets you much more than one dollar in america after applying this correction factor india s gdp becomes the third largest in the world and has been so for at least for five years and china s economy in ppp terms is already bigger than america and due to their fast growth rates and huge population size the two asian giants will dominate the 21st century s economic picture this has been well known and there is a demographic inevitability to it no wonder the world s investors are looking at these two large consumer economies never mind the emerging tech cold war between the west and china hence whether india is ranked fifth or third and how soon will it attain the magical 5 trillion dollars size is not very interesting because it will certainly get there for the past 40 years except for the pandemic years the average growth rate of india s economy in real terms is 7 per cent and there has never been a year of contraction ie negative gdp growth since 1980 such is the strength of india s growth process the pertinent question to ask is how is this economy doing this means looking at the short term and examining prospects for output expansion job creation inflation control and fiscal and trade deficit sustainability when asked about the economy we can consult data numbers that are trotted out some daily like the stock market updates some monthly like the imports and exports or industrial production index some quarterly like gdp and some annually last week the national statistics office reported that india s gdp during the april to june quarter was 36 85 lakh crore this is real gdp stripping out the effect of inflation this number is 13 5 per cent higher than the real gdp for april to june quarter of last year this high growth rate called for celebratory thumping of chests however we need to see this data in the proper perspective last year we suffered from a devastating second wave of covid which had spread to rural areas and caused great hardships and large scale deaths there were lockdowns and constraints so business was down hence on that low base 13 5 per cent looks good and was in fact expected to be above 15 per cent by professional forecasters if you want to remove the effect of the last two pandemic affected years you need to compare the gdp data of april to june during 2019 that was 35 67 lakh crore which means that in three years quarterly gdp has inched up only by 3 3 per cent i e less than 1 1 per cent per year this is worrisome much of this slender growth has been fueled by fiscal expansion which was of course necessary another way of analysing the current data is to look at momentum ie how is gdp accelerating from quarter to quarter here too the data does not look promising as per a barclays report the quarter on quarter growth from january march to april june was a contraction of 3 3 ie negative growth of course some of this could be due to seasonal effects but the jan march quarter had seen a sequential expansion over the previous quarter which has festival spending like diwali and christmas as if by confirmation the international monetary fund and other analysts like crisil have revised their growth forecasts downward for india which will of course remain the fastest growing large economy in the world this is in sharp contrast to the recession in both america and europe and slowdown in china india s fate is affected by what is happening globally the reserve bank of india too is concerned that india is entering a phase of high inflation coupled with weakening economy their forecast is for a 4 per cent growth in the last quarter of this fiscal year and the rate tightening tight monetary policy is a further growth dampener but unavoidable in light of inflation the stock markets too are reflecting the sentiment and bracing themselves for some correction so the assessment for the fifth largest economy is that this is a slowing phase as growth drivers need to pick up along with investment sentiment there are some hopeful signs such as consistently high gst collection four months above 1 4 lakh crore and double digit growth in the industrial production index for may and june even bank credit growth as per the data this august is the highest in 11 years and keeping pace ahead of bank deposits that includes housing and retails loans too there is thus as always a case for cautious optimism in the medium term the writer is a noted economist

menafn afp cryptocurrency critics including economists and researchers will gather in london and online this week to get their message across to regulators about the booming but volatile sector a number of governments have expressed concerns over cryptocurrencies but those behind the first crypto policy symposium say they hope the event will prompt much more critical discourse of the sector there are so many crypto conferences but they are funded by the crypto industry said martin walker a co organiser the goal is to dispel some myths created by the crypto industry and to make policy makers start asking the right questions but walker a banking it expert is quick to reject claims that monday and tuesday s event is an anti crypto conference instead he says it is a chance to hear the critical voices of specialists in financial bubbles researchers who have evaluated the industry s carbon footprint and engineers who question the effectiveness of decentralised technologies we ve got regulators from all over the world he said about 1 000 people have signed up to watch the conference online and uk officials are expected to attend a live event in london on tuesday the conference comes as the price of bitcoin has plunged from a peak of nearly 69 000 last october to around 20 000 the risky nature of the ultra volatile and poorly regulated market for retail investors will be particularly highlighted uninformed users many central banks and financial market regulators have warned about the dangers posed by cryptocurrencies but in the absence of a clear legislative framework users are rarely informed when making their investments say crypto critics the collapse of cryptocurrency investment platform celsius left customers in despair and unable to recover investments that sometimes included life savings the firm faced mounting troubles until it froze withdrawals in mid june and a court filing showed it owed 4 7 billion to its users people didn t understand that their money wasn t secure and they still don t understand why they can t get it back said amy castor a respected freelance journalist who is among the most vocal of cryptocurrency critics we wanted to have our voices heard because it s important for regulators to understand the risks how crypto currencies work the scam inherent in it so that they can do more to protect retail investors and the public she said castor who used to work for cryptocurrency media outlets became known during the 2017 price surge and subsequent crash for her criticism of the so called stablecoin tether tether s price is pegged to the us dollar but its cash flow remains murky the problem is that crypto currency has become so big that now there is a lot of money going into lobbying to support politicians castor added critic not a hater in the united states some elected officials have proudly shown support for the sector especially at the local level the mayors of miami and new york have said they want to make their cities cryptocurrency capitals and there are municipality specific currency projects in various stages of development officials are making broad statements about the good of cryptocurrencies said tonantzin carmona a researcher at the brookings institution they focus on what good could come from that tech and they ignore the real risks in march carmona published a research paper on the potential danger posed by the mayors enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies she feared being attacked on social networks but instead says her arguments found favour with the small community of crypto sceptics who helped her see that she was not a lone voice there s a difference between being a hater and being critical she said
