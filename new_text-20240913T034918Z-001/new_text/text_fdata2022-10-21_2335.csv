los angeles ap the los angeles city council appears headed into a long power struggle that threatens an already strained government as two disgraced councilmen resist widespread calls for their resignation amid a racism scandal and state investigation the chaos worsened wednesday when one of the councilmen kevin de león disclosed in media interviews that he would not step down but wanted to take a leave from council meetings to attempt to restore his reputation city council president paul krekorian called it unacceptable the standoff is unfolding even as there seem to be few hard rules about personal conduct and consequence for public officials de león s prospects for holding his job remain unclear and he again was out of sight thursday the council already has stripped de león of much of his power in an effort to pressure him to resign but it has no authority to expel members those calling for his resignation for his involvement in a recorded meeting peppered with crude racial insults include president joe biden as well as other elected officials and council members who say they are unwilling to ever work with him again the problem for kevin de león is there is a tape it s race related in a city with difficult racial tensions said veteran republican consultant rob stutzman who advised former gov arnold schwarzenegger when the one time action star weathered accusations of sexual misconduct during his 2003 campaign for governor this one seems like it would be difficult to stick out stutzman added referring to the cascade of calls for his resignation and frayed racial relations to survive you have to come up with some type of coalition to support you in the next week or it starts to look pretty grim no such coalition has emerged disclosure of the recording has been followed by days of public outrage and protests a sign of more trouble came from two black developers working on a downtown project who said in a letter to the council that they could no longer work with de león whose district includes the project that would be anchored to two hotels the developers r donahue peebles and victor macfarlane called for his resignation and wrote that de león had been dismissive of their proposal meeting with them just once over two years the uproar began with the release nearly two weeks ago of a previously unknown recording of a 2021 private meeting involving de león two other council members and a powerful labor leader all latino democrats in which they schemed to protect their political clout in the redrawing of council districts during an hourlong conversation laced with bigoted comments within days then city council president nury martinez and the head of the los angeles county federation of labor ron hererra had resigned de león and councilman gil cedillo who also attended the meeting appear intent on keeping their jobs though cedillo has said little publicly about the tape and has not appeared at recent council meetings cedillo s term ends in december but de león also could face a recall election in recent decades americans generally have displayed a greater tolerance for bad personal judgment indiscretions or worse by public officials and candidates former president donald trump was accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct former president bill clinton had a sexual relationship with a white house intern but racial matters are different the language on the recording upended years of delicate relations between blacks and latinos in los angeles who often form coalitions to achieve political ends many said that trust was broken it is unforgiveable councilman curren price who is black said on twitter some of the looming unknowns include whether more tapes could surface no one knows who made the recording or why meanwhile the state is investigating how the districts were drawn and whether the process was rigged attorney general rob bonta a democrat has said his investigation could lead to civil liability or criminal charges depending on what is found democratic consultant steve maviglio said it s possible for de león to survive but he must make sincere apologies and win back his constituents trust that would start with small private meetings with business leaders or coffee with community groups any larger event would attract protests he pointed to former virginia gov ralph northam who survived calls for his resignation after a picture surfaced from his 1984 medical school yearbook showing a man in blackface standing next to someone in a ku klux klan hood and robe the democrat initially acknowledged he was in the photo and apologized then reversed course saying he was not in it de león s efforts to remain in office might have a financial motive disclosure forms filed with the state show he holds only modest investments tech stocks valued between 8 000 and 40 000 los angeles city council members are among the highest paid in the country with annual salaries of nearly 229 000 along with pension and medical benefits one person unlikely to lend a sympathetic ear to de león will be the state s most powerful democrat gov gavin newsom the governor and the councilman who was once a democratic leader in the state senate have had strained relations for years that worsened when de león embarked on a failed attempt to oust u s sen dianne feinstein in 2018 it s no secret gov newsom did not appreciate it when kevin ran against dianne feinstein it was viewed by newsom as a gesture of disrespect that was doomed from the beginning said newsom adviser nathan ballard kevin seemed to have thin skin in relation to all things newsom ballard added a rivalry with the governor existed only in kevin s mind copyright the associated press all rights reserved this

following a city sanctioned sweep of a new encampment near the intersection of massachusetts avenue and melnea cass boulevard wednesday morning mayor michelle wu announced additional efforts to tackle a long standing crisis of homelessness and drug use in the area home to several shelters and centers for addiction treatment unlike previous sweeps at mass and cass a team of city employees public health workers police officers and members of the newmarket business association worked together to clear 20 tents near the intersection and move people away from southampton street to atkinson street

centering the people at the heart of this crisis and the services that are necessary wu said at a press conference thursday at the same time last year the city counted 90 tents in the area wu said demonstrating a 70 reduction in encampments the number of individuals without housing in the area is now 173 down from 262 at this time last year according to wu the number of individuals gathering in the area has gone down although it is still a large number she said the number of tents that are there have gone down although we still see them popping up every day and work to take them down every day this progress wu said demonstrates the effectiveness of ongoing efforts in the area that began in earnest after a sweep of hundreds of tents last january through a needle exchange program with the group access harm reduction overdose prevention and education ahope the city has collected nearly three times the amount of syringes it has given out since january according to bisola ojikutu

recreation commissioner ryan woods the city is working on a complete renovation and redesign of the park and cleaning efforts will be increased in the area as a city we have a responsibility to care

have a responsibility to address the impacts that these challenges have on our communities our local businesses our residents and our kids we must mitigate the public health risks to families young

parks department headquarters joined by a number of city leaders and newmarket business association president sue sullivan who has fielded concerns from residents and business owners in the area for years if you talk to businesses down here if you talk to residents a lot of people will tell you that it s still bad and things are bad we ve still got people on the street and they re not wrong sullivan said but they are wrong if anybody says that there s not progress being made they re wrong and they ve got very short memories right after the closure of the long island shelter in 2014 there

london the united kingdom used to be synonymous with stable dependable if sometimes dull governance but the resignation thursday of prime minister liz truss after six weeks in office shows just how chaotic british politics has become in recent years truss is the fourth prime minister to resign since the brexit vote of 2016 that s the fastest turnover in a century no 10 downing street has effectively become a revolving door what s the matter with britain analysts here say it is a story of polarization populism a flawed political system and poor leadership that has at times put party and personal ambition above the good of the country a miscalculation of historic proportions it begins with former prime minister david cameron who called a referendum on leaving the european union cameron hoped the vote in 2016 would end a civil war inside his own conservative party on britain s relationship with europe and keep the party in power daniel leal olivas wpa pool getty images wpa pool getty images prime minister david cameron and chancellor of the exchequer george osborne deliver a speech on the potential economic impact to the u k of leaving the eu at a b q store support office on may 23 2016 in chandler s ford england it was a miscalculation of historic proportions the british people voted to leave the eu by a small but convincing margin the result not only highlighted britain s bitter divisions but also changed the course of the country s foreign economic and trade policies most political scientists and economists predicted that leaving the eu would make this island nation poorer and politically less relevant it immediately became clear that the architects of the brexit vote including its most effective campaigner boris johnson had no real plan for untangling decades of economic and legal ties with the eu political chaos followed cameron resigned after the referendum and theresa may became prime minister in another major miscalculation she called a snap election in 2017 only to lose her party s control of the house of commons stefan rousseau wpa pool getty images wpa pool getty images british prime minister theresa may holds a cabinet meeting to discuss department by department brexit action plans at the prime minister s country retreat chequers in ellesborough england on aug 31 2016 may repeatedly tried to drive a brexit deal through parliament only to be foiled in part by the anti european wing of her own party which wanted a clean divorce from europe brexit eventually brought may down as it had her predecessor the party then turned to johnson the charismatic if deeply flawed showman who had a track record of winning elections he campaigned to get brexit done johnson led the party to a landslide victory in 2019 the next year he completed the u k s departure from the eu and seemed poised to rule for years the fantasy scandinavian welfare at american tax levels then came the coronavirus pandemic which johnson underplayed until he ended up in an intensive care unit with the virus his government s slow response to covid led to more than 200 000 deaths the highest toll in europe and drew heavy criticism but what ended johnson s premiership was his lying christopher furlong getty images getty images family members pay their respects next to the body of a close relative who died from covid 19 during the

parties meanwhile most britons stuck to the rules even if it meant not saying goodbye to dying loved ones johnson insisted his government had adhered to lockdown regulations in fact it turned out he had attended two events he was forced to apologize and pay a fine politically johnson was finished leon neal getty images getty images british prime minister boris johnson delivers a farewell address before his official resignation at downing street in london on sept 6 truss replaced johnson in september promising to kick start the economy with tax cuts for corporations and the rich without reducing public spending amid 10 inflation here and rising energy prices because of the war in ukraine truss plan spooked financial markets crashed the pound and sent mortgage rates soaring tim bale a professor of politics at queen mary university in london says one reason tory prime ministers such as johnson and truss have flamed out is because they promised the public things they can t deliver in the case of johnson it was a cost and trouble free brexit and with truss unfunded tax cuts it s a fantasy that many brits are willing to believe that because of our supposedly glorious past we re also entitled to an equally glorious present or future says bale whose new book the conservative party after brexit comes out in march i think politicians continue to feed the myth that we can have scandinavian levels of welfare on american levels of taxation patrick dunleavy emeritus professor of political science and public policy at the london school of economics says flaws in the u k s system of government and the way the conservative party chooses its leaders have also contributed to the ongoing turmoil for instance prime ministers can freely appoint people to very important jobs without parliamentary oversight as you have say with senate confirmation hearings in the u s dunleavy says that permitted truss to appoint kwasi kwarteng a little known political ally to be chancellor of the exchequer britain s treasury secretary truss fired kwarteng on friday after their shared economic plan wreaked havoc with financial markets leon neal getty images getty images prime minister liz truss with husband hugh o leary following her keynote speech on the final day of the conservative party conference in birmingham u k on oct 5 dunleavy says another problem is party leadership is decided not by parliamentarians but party members who in the case of the tories tend to be whiter older and more conservative than the rest of the british population they are not very well informed or

end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

since the spring of 2020 dallas landlords have been subject to a covid 19 eviction ordinance that gave tenants more time to respond to eviction notices be that through paying back rent or finding a new place to live the apartment association of greater dallas says it s time to walk back the ordinance which was adopted in april 2020 at wednesday s city council briefing jason simon the organization s government affairs director told the council that dallas was one of the only cities in the state to still have a covid era eviction ordinance on the books he asked the city to consider ending it at the time the ordinance was adopted the unemployment rate was more than 12 percent there were no covid vaccines available there was no emergency rental assistance funding available he said adding that things have changed considerably since that time the original intent of the ordinance was to encourage communication between the property owner or manager and the renter in the hopes of negotiating payment plans for past due rent simon said that the federal coronavirus aid relief and economic security or cares act also requires a 30 day notice at any property that participates in federal housing programs or federally backed loans in addition to the 21 days the city requires he argued that this means some property owners are not receiving rental income for a minimum of two months and sometimes longer advocates say that the ordinance is still saving some families from eviction and that there s data to show that some sort of renter protection is still needed this is the needle dallas must thread we still know that many of our residents are still in a crisis situation when it comes to being able to retain their housing as well as being able to assert their rights in tenant proceedings assistant city manager liz cedillo pereira told the council wednesday simon said that while the covid era ordinance needed to end it doesn t signal the end of renter protections or further rental assistance funding that remains in place according to figures from the child poverty action lab from january 1 to september 30 there were nearly 20 000 evictions filed in the city of dallas a 126 percent increase from last year evictions were filed at a rate of 65 per 1 000 renters with the average renter being in arrears for not quite 2 500 according to the covid related ordinance currently on the books once a landlord gives a tenant notice of a potential eviction the tenant has 21 days to respond if the tenant doesn t the landlord can officially start the eviction process on the 22nd day with a notice to vacate from that point the tenant has three days to pay up or set up a plan to pay up if that doesn t happen the landlord can file an eviction petition in court on the 61st day from the first notice mark melton the attorney who co founded the pro bono dallas eviction advocacy center told the council that the 21 day delay was originally intended to provide tenants time to prove that they had a covid related issue that caused them to miss rental payments that doesn t happen so much anymore he said if tenants do show this proof they get a full 60 day period to respond to that eviction notice and find a way to pay their late rent they can either set up a payment plan get rental assistance or find some other way of coming up with the money if they can t the landlord can then issue the tenant a notice to vacate which would give them three days to pay or be evicted cedillo pereira said a draft for a permanent ordinance was in the works but that it wouldn t be ready for a vote until early next year that new ordinance would require some of what the covid ordinance does time for the tenant to respond and pay up for instance but would allow the landlord to evict as usual for other lease term violations before the briefing melton said that he felt a draft ordinance he helped create with the apartment association to sunset options for the covid ordinance should be scrapped since it was predicated on emergency rental assistance money that no longer exists instead we should maintain the status quo and move toward a permanent ordinance that offers reasonable protections to our most vulnerable residents as quickly as possible he wrote on facebook wednesday the city recently announced that so many people had applied for assistance that all the money was already allocated and applications were closed no one expected that to happen melton said the temporary ordinance was drafted to sunset once the rent assistance was no longer available so if this ordinance was passed as is it would effectively be dead on arrival its passage would immediately sunset this revised ordinance and the existing ordinance leaving tenants with no protections at all melton said he would rather see a permanent ordinance before the end of the year which would include landlord buy in as well as protections to vulnerable tenants the plan was always to follow up after this temporary revision was passed with a permanent ordinance crafted to address non pandemic related scenarios he said i m hopeful we can get this done by december councilman adam bazaldua also advocated for tenant protections until permanent measures could be codified saying it was absurd to sunset a measure that was protecting the most vulnerable dallasites but for us to allow this go off the books and sunset something that is protecting people and allow the most vulnerable to be on the streets and then be back here making decisions on how to put dollars to putting them into shelters or giving them resources as homeless residents is absurd he said we have the opportunity now to do the right thing councilwoman cara mendelsohn however wondered if tying up available affordable units with people who can t pay rent was also contributing to the affordability crisis in the city landlords are forced to raise rents at other properties to make up for shortfalls she argued which creates a new group of people that can t afford to pay their rent on a macro level i think we re actually causing more problems than we re fixing she said this is a covid ordinance we have to recognize that even the president is saying covid is over but melton and other advocates explained that the ordinance did a better job of evening the odds for the tenant than the eviction laws before the pandemic did these laws are supposed to protect the landlord and the tenant he told the council historically they have done a really good job of protecting the landlord but they didn t protect the tenant at all so now we can say you have to start over because the law provides a specific series of steps you ve got to take and if you don t you have to start over while nothing was hammered out on wednesday exactly it does seem that the council realizes two things a covid ordinance no matter how effective cannot go on forever but the city will need to figure out how to protect vulnerable residents through its housing policy plans sooner than later get the d brief newsletter dallas most important news stories of the week delivered to your inbox each sunday

london the united kingdom used to be synonymous with stable dependable if sometimes dull governance but the resignation thursday of prime minister liz truss after six weeks in office shows just how chaotic british politics has become in recent years truss is the fourth prime minister to resign since the brexit vote of 2016 that s the fastest turnover in a century no 10 downing street has effectively become a revolving door what s the matter with britain analysts here say it is a story of polarization populism a flawed political system and poor leadership that has at times put party and personal ambition above the good of the country a miscalculation of historic proportions it begins with former prime minister david cameron who called a referendum on leaving the european union

highlighted britain s bitter divisions but also changed the course of the country s foreign economic and trade policies most political scientists and economists predicted that leaving the eu would make this island nation poorer and politically less relevant it immediately became clear that the architects of the brexit vote including its most effective campaigner boris johnson had no real plan for untangling decades of economic and legal ties with the eu political chaos followed cameron resigned after the referendum and theresa may became prime minister in another major miscalculation she

next year he completed the u k s departure from the eu and seemed poised to rule for years the fantasy scandinavian welfare at american tax levels then came the coronavirus pandemic which johnson underplayed until he ended up in an intensive care unit with the virus his government s slow response to covid led to more than 200 000 deaths the highest toll in europe and drew heavy criticism but

reducing public spending amid 10 inflation here and rising energy prices because of the war in ukraine truss plan spooked financial markets crashed the pound and sent mortgage rates soaring tim bale a professor of politics at queen mary university in london says one reason tory prime ministers such as johnson and truss have flamed out is because they promised the public things they can t deliver in the case of johnson it was a cost and trouble free brexit and with truss unfunded tax cuts it s a fantasy that many brits are willing to believe that because of our supposedly glorious past we re also entitled to an equally glorious present or future says bale whose new book the conservative party after brexit comes out in march i think politicians continue to feed the myth that we can have scandinavian levels of welfare on american levels of taxation patrick dunleavy emeritus professor of political science and public policy at the london school of economics says flaws in the u k s system of government and the way the conservative party chooses its leaders have also contributed to the ongoing turmoil for instance prime ministers can freely appoint people to very important jobs without parliamentary oversight as you have say with senate confirmation hearings in the u s dunleavy says that permitted truss to appoint kwasi kwarteng a little known political ally to be chancellor

liz truss with husband hugh o leary following her keynote speech on the final day of the conservative party conference in birmingham u k on oct 5 dunleavy says another problem is party leadership is

just the job australia in september economists had forecast 25 000 it wasn t enough to move the off 3 5 nevertheless or the underemployment rate off 6 0 and participation remained steady it does show the labour market is now slowing in isolation this bad news should be good news for the stock market the rba had already decided to only hike by 25 points this month rather than an expected 50 not because inflation is peaking as the opposite is true and the latest food bowl floods are only going to make things worse but because it is concerned of the lag effect of higher rates which are already showing up clearly in the housing market the jobs result will perhaps not lead the rba to pause on cup day but it at least should mean only another 25 despite inflation and that should have been good news the problem is the fed is not of the same opinion regarding concern over lag effects with the fed remaining unforgiving wednesday night s weak auction of us treasuries had overall us bond rates jumping again we have little choice but to follow suit yesterday the aussie yield rose 11 points to be back over 4 at 4 05 the rose 12 points to be back at 3 50 and so the usual suspects copped another hiding fell 2 4 1 6 1 9 despite higher oil prices and 2 1 due to lower commodity prices fell 2 4 with miners particularly slammed bucked the trend so the session was to some extent saved by a 3 1 jump for aside from oil prices per se both woodside energy ltd asx and santos ltd asx reported record quarterly revenues yesterday played its typical role in only falling 0 4 but the surprise on the day were the banks the sector closed slightly to the upside this year surging yields have led the banks lower on loan loss and falling loan demand fears perhaps this was the one sector in which a weak jobs number implying the labour market has begun to turn and the rba can go easy had an impact against the tide the bad news is us yields are up again overnight our are down 25 this morning despite all this latest volatility the is still at the same level it was in early october no let up we are going to keep raising rates for a while given our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation i expect we will be well above 4 by the end of the year it had all been going so well the dow was up 400 points early in the session last night on more strong not too bad earnings results until the philadelphia fed president opened his mouth the us ten year yield shot up another 10 points to 4 23 and the two year 5 points to 4 61 that s a new high for the ten year highest since 2008 the fed funds futures rate which specifically reflects fed cash rate expectations hit 5 for mid 2023 the closed down 90 points earnings results are playing their part bringing some hope to an oversold market last night at t inc nyse dow and rose 7 7 which is a big move for the telco plodder another plodder is old world tech stock ibm nyse dow which rose 4 7 having in wednesday night s aftermarket it was not all so bright though with tesla inc nasdaq falling 6 7 after it too on wednesday night and it s not looking good tonight for social media stocks snap nyse has just in this morning s aftermarket and is down 26 having already been down 77 from its high going in it s all about advertising one of the first costs to be cut in a downturn snap s revenues growth is declining heading into the fourth quarter and visibility is too low for the company to offer any guidance while snap is not a tech biggie advertising is also key for the likes of meta google nasdaq and others whether earnings results can continue to come in better than feared on a net basis the reality is you can t fight the fed the fed wants to see financial conditions tighten this means two things wider credit spreads and a lower stock market wider credit spreads imply a higher cost of borrowing for corporates beyond that implied by fed rates hikes as an additional risk premium is included a weaker stock market reduces consumer demand on the wealth effect basis both are needed to lower inflation until the fed sees signs of lower inflation it s not going to stop hence while many on wall street believe we can see a rebound rally few if any believe we won t also later see a new low probably next year commodities global metal producers and buyers will gather in london next week to finalise their contracts for supplies for the year ahead traders are pushing the london metal exchange to stop accepting russian metal fearing its warehouses will become a stockpile for unwanted material that

the astonishing political demise of british prime minister liz truss shows what can happen when ambitious plans collide with a new financial market reality that places the fight against inflation above all else truss resigned thursday after just 45 days in office a casualty of the market turmoil triggered by her plans to increase government borrowing and cut taxes despite an annual inflation rate above 10 percent the truss implosion was fueled by distinctly british considerations but the market upheaval which at one point saw investors judge britain a worse credit risk than notoriously profligate italy ignited unexpected difficulties in british pension funds and started a search for the next financial domino that could topple as interest rates climb bond mutual funds pensions corporate debt and government finances all are being scrutinized for hidden weak spots analysts said as the federal reserve continues raising interest rates at the fastest pace in 40 years investors expect the central bank to lift rates several times in the coming months in a bid to cool off rising consumer prices including at its next meeting in november advertisement the fed will just keep hiking until something breaks said eric robertsen global head of research and chief strategist for standard chartered bank in dubai i think it s more likely that there will be a financial market crack before there s an economic crack after years of easy money policies the fed is leading central banks in tightening credit to battle painfully high inflation interest rates have moved sharply higher in the united states united kingdom europe canada and dozens of smaller countries in the broadest such campaign to hit the global economy in a quarter century bond market volatility this month hit its highest level since early march 2020 when the fed was forced to step in to buy 1 trillion in u s treasury securities sluggish trading in treasuries normally the most liquid market on earth now has treasury secretary janet l yellen considering buying back some government securities from traders to ease market functioning the markets grinding gears do not mean an imminent financial crisis analysts said but the friction illustrates the bumpy transition that the global economy is making from more than a decade of ultralow interest rates to an era of more costly credit with the fed promising months of additional interest rate hikes more market volatility is likely advertisement globally stocks have lost roughly 30 trillion in value so far this year while bonds have suffered one of their worst years ever the financial reset is occurring as international risks are multiplying with the war in ukraine and the souring of u s china relations roiling markets unpredictable linkages between finance and geopolitics have flared in earlier eras such as in 1998 when the hedge fund long term capital management collapsed during the russian financial crisis requiring a u s government led bailout there is a risk of a disorderly tightening of financial conditions that may be amplified by vulnerabilities built over the years the international monetary fund warned this month in a report which said financial stability risks had grown since april and are significantly skewed to the downside advertisement for more than a decade while interest rates were low and the fed actively purchased government and mortgage securities it was easy for investors to sell most assets now as the fed and other central banks tighten monetary policy normally liquid markets are becoming more congested investors who want to unload say a treasury bond encounter delays or wide gaps between their asking price and what buyers will pay since securities backed by the u s government are regarded as risk free their price is the key to determining the value of other financial assets so problems buying and selling treasuries can infect other markets liquidity has been papering over weaknesses in other markets and now we ll see what they are and we ll see it in a bunch of assets said megan greene global chief economist for the kroll institute in the united kingdom while truss took a beating for delivering a risky economic plan that had not been vetted by independent analysts british pension funds became the center of the crisis many fund managers had banked on a strategy called liability driven investing or ldi designed to allow pensions to earn higher returns during the low rate era that followed the 2007 2008 financial crisis with ldi fund managers basically would lend bonds in return for cash that they would reinvest to boost returns advertisement when yields spiked on british government bonds the funds were forced to quickly raise cash to make up the difference between the original value of the bonds they had pledged and their current lower price share this article share the fastest way to raise money was to sell government bonds but that set off a vicious cycle falling bond prices meant demands for more collateral which required more bond sales pushing prices down even more these are the sort of things we saw in the financial crisis and that s something to be worried about john waldron president and chief operating officer of goldman sachs told an industry group this month we don t know what the next risk is that will move the market indeed fresh trouble elsewhere could ricochet from market to market for example corporations with weak credit ratings could be downgraded to junk status which would force some portfolio managers to sell their bonds greene said advertisement as those corporate bonds sink in value other investors who bought them with borrowed money might face sudden demands for repayment to raise money to meet those margin calls they would sell other assets triggering a price decline there too corporations that are poor credit risks already are finding it harder to raise money in the bond market issuance of new high yield or junk bonds so far this year is down three quarters from the same period last year according to the securities industry and financial market association sifma but only 19 percent of the corporate debt that must be refinanced by the end of next year is junk according to torsten slok chief economist of apollo global management the amount to be refinanced is quite manageable the question is how long do interest rates stay at high levels slok said advertisement if rates stay high companies and governments alike would feel a serious pinch during previous episodes of market turmoil the fed often intervened to effectively stanch the bleeding in march 2020 as stock prices collapsed and trading in treasury securities seized up the fed cut its benchmark lending rate to near zero and added more than 4 trillion in securities to its balance sheet but with inflation now stubbornly high the fed will probably be unable or unwilling to cut rates or flood markets with cash analysts said we re in an unparalleled hiking cycle globally i m more nervous about the system breaking because the fed backstop is just not there said priya misra head of global rates strategy for td securities in the wake of the u k debacle higher interest rates are already shadowing government finances heavily indebted countries like italy despite rising energy costs may have to reduce their borrowing plans already 19 developing countries must pay 10 percentage points above the roughly 4 percent that the u s government now pays investors to borrow for 10 years according to the u n development program government bond markets may have become more vulnerable to shocks over the past decade according to a new report from the financial stability board a global advisory panel advertisement trading in the u s treasury market is less liquid than at any time since april 2020 according to one bloomberg gauge the market jam is the result of the sharp increase in the volume of government debt securities coupled with the impact of post financial crisis regulations intended to make banks safer but which also have made banks less willing to store treasuries on their own books while they look for a buyer the 23 7 trillion in treasuries outstanding is up more than 7 trillion since the end of 2019 according to the sifma reflecting the cost of fighting the pandemic and supporting the economy at the same time regulations enacted after the financial crisis require banks to hold more capital in reserve to cover potential losses on securities they own the fed also has stopped reinvesting the funds it receives from maturing securities which some investors say has hurt demand for treasuries treasury this month surveyed traders on whether they supported a potential program for the government to repurchase some securities and if so how it should be structured

follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow less defensible i d argue was biden s suggestion that americans shouldn t prepare for recession just in case while it s appropriate to project optimism particularly given the mixed economic signals around us it s valuable to encourage some financial prudence should the more optimistic scenario not materialize advertisement so what might preparing for recession look like if you re a consumer it might mean replenishing your rainy day funds consumers overall have spent down their savings quite a bit in the past year this is largely understandable with prices rising and wages not keeping pace some households have had to dip into savings to pay their bills spending down savings of course means less security in the event of job loss or a cutback in hours some common sense advice might be something like if you don t need to make a big expensive purchase today such as a new car house or upgraded fridge think carefully before you do it especially if the purchase would require financing interest rates are high or if you work in a field without much job security many workers have switched jobs in the past year often in pursuit of big raises but their new positions aren t necessarily secure there s been a lot of hiring in industries that tend to be sensitive to changes in the business cycle such as retail advertisement some businesses have begun pulling back investments and freezing hiring which might make their own finances safer but could also collectively expedite recession the same is true actually if consumers all simultaneously take my thrifty advice above the biggest worry is how little governments have done to gird for a downturn politicians in both parties have been scapegoating others for possibly precipitating a recession while doing little themselves to combat recession risks in some cases they have undertaken measures that actively worsen the economic outlook threatening to default on u s debt obligations as republican lawmakers are now doing injects needless uncertainty into financial markets other policies such as forgiving student loan debt or cutting state income and gas taxes are modestly inflationary this means the federal reserve will need to raise interest rates even more to offset that inflationary impact the resulting higher interest rates might kill the current economic recovery altogether advertisement frittering state budget surpluses on tax cuts rather than socking away those funds is short sighted for other reasons too states will need a financial cushion if their tax revenues drop they will also likely need to spend more on safety net services medicaid unemployment benefits etc if there are widespread job losses if republicans regain control of one or both houses of congress in the midterms federal aid to alleviate any state budget troubles is by no means guaranteed and state governments long ago should have fixed their decrepit unemployment insurance systems which massively failed in the last recession many haven t

2022 has been brutal for the online used car marketplace what happened shares of carvana cvna 6 88 dropped as much as 16 9 this week according to data from s p global market intelligence the online used car marketplace got an analyst downgrade and was negatively affected by an earnings report from ally financial as of the market close on thursday oct 20 the stock is down 15 5 this week so what on wednesday morning consumer bank and automotive lender ally financial reported its third quarter earnings the company disappointed investors across the board with earnings revenue and guidance coming in below expectations what does this have to do with carvana since ally is the largest used car lender in the united states its results can give a reading on the health of the used car market the two companies even have a partnership in which ally provides loans to buyers on carvana s marketplace ally s third quarter auto originations were 12 3 billion down 1 billion from the second quarter this could indicate that carvana is seeing worsening demand in its marketplace used car prices are also coming off their highs from the covid 19 supply crunch lower car prices mean that carvana might have to write down any of the car inventory it bought at higher prices on top of ally s report wedbush downgraded carvana s stock this week even with shares down over 90 this year wedbush says the business model is sputtering wall street hates carvana stock right now and it is no surprise to see the stock fall more than 15 again this week because of it now what with shares down in the gutter carvana s market cap is now just 2 87 billion for a company that generates 14 6 billion in revenue you might think this is a bargain and that it is time to buy the dip on carvana s stock but investors should be cautious with this company carvana burned over 750 million in free cash flow through the first six months of this year and only has 1 billion in cash on the balance sheet with close to 8 billion in total debt it will be tough for management to raise funds at any reasonable interest rate that means unless carvana can turn around its business soon the company will either file for bankruptcy or raise money through a stock offering if it does a stock offering this will cause massive dilution for existing shareholders at these prices no matter what happens current shareholders would likely be hurt

london the united kingdom used to be synonymous with stable dependable if sometimes dull governance but the resignation thursday of prime minister liz truss after six weeks in office shows just how chaotic british politics has become in recent years truss is the fourth prime minister to resign since the brexit vote of 2016 that s the fastest turnover in a century no 10 downing street has effectively become a revolving door what s the matter with britain analysts here say it is a story of polarization populism a flawed political system and poor leadership that has at times put party and personal ambition above the good of the country a miscalculation of historic proportions it begins with former prime minister david cameron who called a referendum on leaving the european union cameron hoped the vote in 2016 would end a civil war inside his own conservative party on britain s relationship with europe and keep the party in power daniel leal olivas wpa pool getty images wpa pool getty images prime minister david cameron and chancellor of the exchequer george osborne deliver a speech on the potential economic impact to the u k of leaving the eu at a b q store support office on may 23 2016 in chandler s ford england it was a miscalculation of historic proportions the british people voted to leave the eu by a small but convincing margin the result not only highlighted britain s bitter divisions but also changed the course of the country s foreign economic and trade policies most political scientists and economists predicted that leaving the eu would make this island nation poorer and politically less relevant it immediately became clear that the architects of the brexit vote including its most effective campaigner boris johnson had no real plan for untangling decades of economic and legal ties with the eu political chaos followed cameron resigned after the referendum and theresa may became prime minister in another major miscalculation she called a snap election in 2017 only to lose her party s control of the house of commons stefan rousseau wpa pool getty images wpa pool getty images british prime minister theresa may holds a cabinet

then turned to johnson the charismatic if deeply flawed showman who had a track record of winning elections he campaigned to get brexit done johnson led the party to a landslide victory in 2019 the next year he completed the u k s departure from the eu and seemed poised to rule for years the fantasy scandinavian welfare at american tax levels then came the coronavirus pandemic which johnson underplayed until he ended up in an intensive care unit with the virus his government s slow response to covid led to more than 200 000 deaths the highest toll in europe and drew heavy criticism but

had attended two events he was forced to apologize and pay a fine politically johnson was finished leon neal getty images getty images british prime minister boris johnson delivers a farewell address before his official resignation at downing street in london on sept 6 truss replaced johnson in september promising to kick start the economy with tax cuts for corporations and the rich without reducing public spending amid 10 inflation here and rising energy prices because of the war in ukraine truss plan spooked financial markets crashed the pound and sent mortgage rates soaring tim bale a professor of politics at queen mary university in london says one reason tory prime ministers such as johnson and truss have flamed out is because they promised the public things they can t deliver in the case of johnson it was a cost and trouble free brexit and with truss unfunded tax cuts it s a fantasy that many brits are willing to believe that because of our supposedly glorious past we re also entitled to an equally glorious present or future says bale whose new book the conservative party after brexit comes out in march i think politicians continue to feed the myth that we can have scandinavian levels of welfare on american levels of taxation patrick dunleavy emeritus professor of political science and public policy at the london school of economics says flaws in the u k s system of government and the way the conservative party chooses its leaders have also contributed to the ongoing turmoil for instance prime ministers can freely appoint people to very important jobs without parliamentary oversight as you have say with senate confirmation hearings in the u s dunleavy says that permitted truss to appoint kwasi kwarteng a little known political ally to be chancellor of the exchequer britain s treasury secretary truss fired kwarteng on friday after their shared economic plan wreaked havoc with financial markets leon neal getty images getty images prime minister liz truss with husband hugh o leary following her keynote speech on the final day of the conservative party conference in birmingham u k on oct 5 dunleavy says another problem is party leadership is decided not by parliamentarians but party members who in the case of the tories tend to be whiter older and more conservative than the rest of the british population they are not very well informed or critical as an electorate says dunleavy so they ve chosen badly really with boris johnson and liz truss npr london producer morgan ayre contributed to this story copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
british prime minister liz truss resigned thursday after just 44 days in office prompted by an economic plan that sent financial markets into a tailspin led to shake ups in her cabinet and divided her ruling conservative party she is the shortest serving prime minister in british history in comments delivered at a podium in front of the prime minister s residence at no 10 downing street in london truss said that while she set out a vision for a low tax high growth economy she recognized she could not deliver the mandate on which she was elected by the conservative party truss said she will serve until a replacement is selected graham brady chairman of the conservative party s special parliamentary body the 1922 committee told reporters that party leadership has indicated it could conduct a ballot and conclude an election as early as october 28 and possibly have a new prime minister in place by october 31 the 1922 committee is made up of conservative party members of parliament and has the power to force a prime minister from within the party to resign analysts suggest former treasury chief rishi sunak who lost to truss in the last leadership contest in august is the leading candidate to replace her in an interview opposition labor party leader keir starmer referred to the situation in the ruling conservative or tory party as a soap opera and called for an urgent general election so the public can make their minds up about this utter chaos in a statement issued by the white house u s president joe biden thanked truss for her partnership on a range of issues including holding russia accountable for its war against ukraine he later reiterated that point to reporters as he left the white house and expressed confidence the british are going to solve their problem truss succeeded boris johnson in september after he resigned following a series of scandals including holding gatherings in violation of his government s covid 19 restrictions some information for this report was provided by the associated press reuters and agence france presse

losses on the sale of other real estate owned gains on the sale of investment securities recognized origination fees earned from the paycheck protection program ppp and other non operating revenues and expenses the increase in current quarter pre tax pre provision operating income is primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans and investment securities for the nine month period

quarter and year to date ended september 30 2022 and while these results are attributable to our efforts in part to reposition our balance sheet from cash into higher yielding loans and investment securities the federal reserve bank s efforts to control inflation by raising short term interest rates has also played a role when the federal reserve makes changes to monetary policy it typically takes twelve to eighteen months for those actions to achieve the desired effects however the magnitude and speed with which interest rate have been increased will more than likely result in a recession creating potential head winds in housing and employment we will continue to pay close attention to signs that the economy is weakening and make prudent decisions to ensure we maintain a sound capital position paycheck protection program lending during 2020 and 2021 the company made 1 422 ppp loans totaling 110 4 million as of september 30 2022 there are two loans totaling 1 3 million

life of the loan if the loan is forgiven or repaid early the remaining unamortized portion is recognized as interest income in the month of repayment amounts recognized as interest income for the

the actions of the federal reserve open market committee fomc to combat inflation are anticipated to have a recessionary impact on both the national and local economy management is paying close

comparative period during a review of loan system parameters it was noted that payments collected and applied to loans charged off in prior periods were not properly accounted for as recoveries this issue was corrected in q2 2022 resulting in an addition to the alll of approximately 488 000 had this correction not occurred net charge offs for the current year period would have been 135 000 while we believe the current level of our alll is adequate there is no assurance that regulators increased risks in the loan portfolio or changes in economic conditions will not require additional adjustments to the alll net interest income net interest income for the current quarter is 10 5 million reflecting an increase of 644 000 compared to 9 9 million for the linked quarter and an increase

q2 2022 the company became aware of a loan system setting which affected the accounting for loan payments collected in prior years and applied to loans previously charged off and in non accrual status the setting adjustment resulted in the recognition of 291 000 in interest income as a result both the three month period ended june 30 2022 and the nine month period ended september 30 2022 include 291 000 of non recurring interest income net margin has been positively impacted by strong loan and investment securities growth a rising interest rate environment and our ability to control our cost of funds the company has experienced strong loan growth over the last nine months despite experiencing significant reductions in ppp loans pay downs on ppp loans over the past nine months have totaled 14 9 million during that time the loan portfolio has grown by 47 8 million therefore we have experienced a net increase of 62 7 million in new current market rate loans over the first nine months of the year for an annualized percentage increase of 13 the loan to deposit ratio has increased to 58 16 at september 30 2022 from 51 82 at december 31 2021 although significantly impacted by the unrealized loss on available for sale securities the amortized book value of the portfolio has increased by 38 9 million over the first nine months of 2022 the fomc began raising short term interest rates on march 17 2022 with a 25 basis points increase which moved the wall street journal wsj prime rate from 3 25 to 3 50 there have been four additional rate hikes the last of which occurred on september 21 2022 which has pushed the wsj prime to 6 25 the fomc has signaled that they plan to aggressively continue to push rates higher in order to curb inflation inflation is currently at 8 2 and is at the highest level in 40 years many economists believe we will see another 125 basis points in rate hikes prior to the end of the year this may move the wsj prime to a level of 7 50 we believe that a recession in 2023 is very likely and could have an impact on both future loan demand as well as asset quality finally we have been able to control our cost of funds through these interest rate increases but pressure is mounting and we would anticipate needing to increase interest rates on various deposit products this will eventually result in an increase in the company s overall cost of funds non interest income total non interest income is 3 0 million for the three month period ended september 30 2022 compared to 3 1 million for the linked quarter and 3 8 million for the prior year

compared to 463 000 for the quarter ended june 30 2022 and 1 1 million for the prior year quarter revenues from trust and brokerage activities comprise the largest components of other non interest

advertising and public relations other fraud losses and professional fees are partially offset by a decline in fdic insurance expense losses on the sale of oreo for the current and prior nine month

expense is 1 7 million with an effective rate of 16 27 compared to 1 6 million and 16 21 for the prior year nine month period balance sheet total assets are 1 2 billion at september 30 2022 compared to 1 3 billion at december 31 2021 the 121 2 million decrease represents a 9 decline since december 31 2021 the decline is due to using cash to fund a decrease in deposits and the repayment of subordinated debt originally issued in 2017 total assets was also impacted by the impact of rising interest rates on our available for sale investment portfolio total cash decreased by 142 6 million between december 31 2021 and september 30 2022 approximately 48 9 million in cash was used to fund a net decrease in total deposits and in january 2022 we redeemed 17 5 million of subordinated debt the loan and investment portfolios experienced net new loans and securities of 47 8 million and 38 9 million respectively due to the significant increase in interest rates since late march the investment portfolio shows a point to point decline of 36 2 million due to a gross unrealized loss of 75 1 million the unrealized loss on investment securities resulted in a 15 4 million increase in our deferred income tax asset as mentioned above total deposits decreased by 48 9 million or 4 from december 31 2021 money market accounts experienced the largest decline at 20 3 million followed by interest bearing demand at 14 9 million time deposits at 13 1 million and savings at 10 6 million these declines are partially offset by a 10 0 million increase in non interest bearing demand balances the increase in interest rates has played a role in the decline in our time deposit portfolio we pride ourselves on developing long term relationships and attempt to keep our time deposit rates at or above the peer average but there are several outlier banks in our markets that offer rates that cause customers to move deposits between the period february 28 2020 and december 31 2021 our deposits increased by 422 0 million or 54 the increase was the result of significant government stimulus in the form of direct payments to individuals and ppp loans additionally southwest louisiana was hit with two major hurricanes in the fall of 2020 and we experienced a large influx of insurance proceeds that we escrowed for borrowers to effectuate repairs due to supply chain and labor shortage issues many of those proceeds are just now being disbursed in 2022 other borrowings decreased by approximately 17 4 million since year end 2021 in january 2022 we redeemed a tranche of subordinated debt that

london the united kingdom used to be synonymous with stable dependable if sometimes dull governance but the resignation thursday of prime minister liz truss after six weeks in office shows just how chaotic british politics has become in recent years truss is the fourth prime minister to resign since the brexit vote of 2016 that s the fastest turnover in a century no 10 downing street has effectively become a revolving door what s the matter with britain analysts here say it is a story of polarization populism a flawed political system and poor leadership that has at times put party and personal ambition above the good of the country a miscalculation of historic proportions it begins with former prime minister david cameron who called a referendum on leaving the european union cameron hoped the vote in 2016 would end a civil war inside his own conservative party on britain s relationship with europe and keep the party in power daniel leal olivas wpa pool getty images wpa pool getty images prime minister david cameron and chancellor of the exchequer george osborne deliver a speech on the potential economic impact to the u k of leaving the eu at a b q store support office on may 23 2016 in chandler s ford england it was a miscalculation of historic proportions the british people voted to leave the eu by a small but convincing margin the result not only highlighted britain s bitter divisions but also changed the course of the country s foreign economic and trade policies most political scientists and economists predicted that leaving the eu would make this island nation poorer and politically less relevant it immediately became clear that the architects of the brexit vote including its most effective campaigner boris johnson had no real plan for untangling decades of economic and legal ties with the eu political chaos followed cameron resigned after the referendum and theresa may became prime minister in another major miscalculation she called a snap election in 2017 only to lose her party s control of the house of commons stefan rousseau wpa pool getty images wpa pool getty images british prime minister theresa may holds a cabinet meeting to discuss department by department brexit action plans at the prime minister s country retreat chequers in ellesborough england on aug 31 2016 may repeatedly tried to drive a brexit deal through parliament only to be foiled in part by the anti european wing of her own party which wanted a clean divorce from europe brexit eventually brought may down as it had her predecessor the party then turned to johnson the charismatic if deeply flawed showman who had a track record of winning elections he campaigned to get brexit done johnson led the party to a landslide victory in 2019 the next year he completed the u k s departure from the eu and seemed poised to rule for years the fantasy scandinavian welfare at american tax levels then came the coronavirus pandemic which johnson underplayed until he ended up in an intensive care unit with the virus his government s slow response to covid led to more than 200 000 deaths the highest toll in europe and drew heavy criticism but what ended johnson s premiership was his lying christopher furlong getty images getty images family members pay their respects next to the body of a close relative who died from covid 19 during the

had attended two events he was forced to apologize and pay a fine politically johnson was finished leon neal getty images getty images british prime minister boris johnson delivers a farewell address before his official resignation at downing street in london on sept 6 truss replaced johnson in september promising to kick start the economy with tax cuts for corporations and the rich without reducing public spending amid 10 inflation here and rising energy prices because of the war in ukraine truss plan spooked financial markets crashed the pound and sent mortgage rates soaring tim bale a professor of politics at queen mary university in london says one reason tory prime ministers such as johnson and truss have flamed out is because they promised the public things they can t deliver in the case of johnson it was a cost and trouble free brexit and with truss unfunded tax cuts it s a fantasy that many brits are willing to believe that because of our supposedly glorious past we re also entitled to an equally glorious present or future says bale whose new book the conservative party after brexit comes out in march i think politicians continue to feed the myth that we can have scandinavian levels of welfare on american levels of taxation patrick dunleavy emeritus professor of political science and public policy at the london school of economics says flaws in the u k s system of government and the way the conservative party chooses its leaders have also contributed to the ongoing turmoil for instance prime ministers can freely appoint people to very important jobs without parliamentary oversight as you have say with senate confirmation hearings in the u s dunleavy says that permitted truss to appoint kwasi kwarteng a little known political ally to be chancellor of the exchequer britain s treasury secretary truss fired kwarteng on friday after their shared economic plan wreaked havoc with financial markets leon neal getty images getty images prime minister liz truss with husband hugh o leary following her keynote speech on the final day of the conservative party conference in birmingham u k on oct 5 dunleavy says another problem is party leadership is decided not by parliamentarians but party members who in the case of the tories tend to be whiter older and more conservative than the rest of the british population they are not very well informed or

are provided to enhance the user s understanding of our historical and current financial performance and our prospects for the future management believes that these measures provide useful information in that they exclude amounts that are not indicative of our core operating results and ongoing operations and provide a more consistent basis for comparison between periods the following discussion explains the company s use of ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow cash available for use cash required for use in productions and gross margin ebitda is calculated based on earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is calculated based on ebitda before share based compensation unrealized foreign exchange gain loss and items of an unusual or one time nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations ebitda and adjusted ebitda are commonly reported and widely used by investors and lenders as an indicator of a company s operating performance and ability to incur and service debt and as a valuation metric ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not earnings measures recognized by ifrs and therefore do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs therefore ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers free cash flow fcf is calculated based on cash flows from operations purchase of property and equipment and net interim production financing fcf represents the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets cash available for use is defined as the total cash and cash equivalents of the company less cash required for use in productions cash available for use funds ongoing working capital requirements principal and interest payments on corporate demand loans as well as ongoing development and growth efforts and thus is an important liquidity measure that management uses to monitor the business on an ongoing basis cash required for use in productions is defined as cash required for the funding of productions from the development stage through to completion that is not considered by the company to be available for other uses the cash is not legally restricted and has not been classified as restricted cash on the consolidated statement of financial position this cash has been provided by buyers and third party intellectual property ip owners that have engaged the company to provide services as well as banks with whom the company has contracted to provide interim production financing management uses the amount of cash required for use in productions to determine the company s cash available for use gross margin is calculated based on revenue less direct operating costs gross margin is not an earnings measure recognized by ifrs and therefore does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs accordingly gross margin may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers gross margin is a useful measure of profitability before considering operating and other expenses and can be used to assess the company s ability to generate positive net earnings and cash flows view source

in the press finding the top financial advisor in the united states means choosing between thousands of options whether you re looking for help with retirement wealth management or tax planning the u s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please
