the bitcoin btc community is divided about whether the token s price is going to surge or crash in the year ahead a majority of analysts and technical indicators suggest it could bottom between 12 000 and 16 000 in the months to come this correlates with a volatile macroeconomic environment stock prices inflation federal reserve data and at least according to elon musk a possible recession that could last until 2024 on the other side influencers btc maximalists and a range of other fanatical shills maintain its price could skyrocket to 80 000 and beyond there is evidence to support both sides one issue is that they may be looking at different time horizons there s a strong case to be made that btc is likely to drop sharply in the months ahead but potentially rise in mid to late 2023 the case for a 2023 btc price increase bitcoin bull runs historically coincide with the four year market cycle which includes accumulation buying an uptrend distribution selling and a downtrend we would generally expect the accumulation part of this process to begin in 2023 though some believe it could be delayed until 2024 related what will the cryptocurrency market look like in 2027 here are 5 predictions nonetheless we will likely see valuations rise in mid 2023 and there is evidence to support this idea according to kevin svenson we could witness a bull market begin around april when the 80 week bear market finishes up the deflationary nature of bitcoin through its halving events also encourages these price increases over time halvings result in the reward for miners being cut in half the next one is scheduled to occur in april 2024 despite market turbulence bitcoin s deflationary nature results in price appreciation for long term investors but be wary of the hype influencers and markets are well aware that greed sells predictions that ether eth will rise by 10 times in 2023 should be viewed with skepticism and bitcoin is very unlikely to hit 100 000 or even close to it despite such claims pessimistic estimates have btc dropping to 3 500 other experts indicate that we won t see a surge anytime soon or even in 2023 gareth soloway of inthemoneystocks indicated that there is a small chance it could even plunge to 3 500 there will be a pivot in bitcoin as it matures as regulation helps people feel more confident i think in the near term we re going to see a little bit of a bounce then a wave down to 12 000 to 13 000 and then i do worry that you re going sub 10 000 to 8 000 maybe even worst case scenario 3 500 very small percentage but that would be the equivalent of amazon com collapse in the dot com era if btc plunges to 12 000 or below it may not be profitable for miners to run the ecosystem that would mean transactions no longer get processed a problem that could cripple the industry let s also remember that we haven t seen any strong correlation between cryptocurrency prices and mass adoption which is not a healthy pattern crypto prices have been a function of how much money through derivative contracts and other financial instruments that investors mainly whales and institutions throw at given assets changing times but bullish sentiment there are still other concerns to be addressed regarding btc price cycles some are suggesting that these four year cycles might no longer apply for various reasons one is that most btc is not the only kid on the block unlike previous cycles it s competing against a host of cryptocurrencies which are superior in most ways along with decentralized finance defi gamefi nonfungible tokens nfts decentralized autonomous organizations daos web3 startups and a number of far more lucrative investment mechanisms getting involved in web3 and defi requires purchasing eth not btc many assume that because people will become more interested in defi btc will rise this is unfounded however it s still one of the first coins institutions will gravitate toward when getting involved and a signature name in the world of cryptocurrency all things considered it s likely that the bitcoin price will surge in mid 2023 though we will see a drop in the coming months related the market isn t surging anytime soon so get used to dark times on oct 18 more than 38 000 btc worth 750 million was removed from crypto exchanges to private wallets a sign that whales are accumulating and storing for volatile times moves off of exchanges are typically interpreted as bullish indicators robert kiyosaki author of rich dad poor dad is bullish on btc due to interest from institutions and pension plans as he tweeted on oct 7 why buy gold silver bitcoin bank of england pivot means buy more gsbc when pensions nearly collapsed it exposed central banks cannot fix inflation pension funds have always

exposed central banks cannot fix inflation pension have always invested in g s pension funds now investing in bitcoin they know fake stocks bonds are toast robert kiyosaki therealkiyosaki october 7 2022 an end of world btc surge the ironic thing about btc maximalists is that they have a belief that a crash in existing systems and the united states dollar in particular would be beneficial for bitcoin and the wider decentralized community they claim that a crash in governments will necessitate a new financial system bitcoin being perfectly poised the idea is that there is a neatly inverted line between the collapse of the fiat infrastructure and a rise in the btc price where more volatility equates with more price increases when the world crashes the decentralized community will simply fill the void of course a collapse in oil usd would result in skyrocketing energy prices that would also mean a potentially unsustainable bitcoin ecosystem due to mining issues that s a problem ethereum addressed with its september merge which removed miners from the equation and resulted in a 99 99 reduction of its carbon footprint and a complete collapse would also mean that assessments of the usd are worthless if hyperinflation sets in what value would 1 million in btc hold if it couldn t be used to buy a loaf of bread volatility is usually bitcoin s friend but only to a certain point

constitute a significant expense because winters are usually brutal unfortunately this year could be the worst year ever for residents of the region hoping to adequately heat their homes not only are heating oil prices through the roof on anti fossil fuel president joe biden s watch but even for those who have the funds to stock up it doesn t really matter heating oil rationing is already taking place advertisement rationing like toilet paper and baby formula rationing why is all this rationing happening on biden s watch for the record we never once worried about rationing under former president donald trump but the worst part about this unfolding crisis is that it s not even winter according to a bombshell bloomberg report the us northeast is so short on heating oil that the fuel used to power home furnaces is being rationed even before the start of winter some wholesalers in connecticut are putting retailers on allocation meaning they can only get a limited amount of fuel

ration their customers bloomberg s data matches what former maine gov paul lepage a republican gubernatorial candidate told radio talk show host howie carr this week in that the heating oil shortage situation in the northeast is beyond frightening and a genuine cause for concern lepage essentially begged current democratic maine gov janet mills to do something anything to bring attention to the situation before it s too late and people start dying while also blaming biden for not properly addressing the issue today just about an hour ago we got information from a local oil dealer oil right now tonight at five o clock is 5 69 kerosene is 6 69 a gallon this is what we re facing right now lepage said during the interview friday advertisement he added earlier this week the president of the united states released 15 million barrels of crude oil you know from the reserves but he did not he did not release any northeast home heating oil reserve we have a shortage and prices going through the roof and the governor of the state of maine has yet to say a word about it lepage urged every listener to call gov mills office to leave their thoughts about the developing crisis saying mills needs to get on the ball and call president biden and tell him to release heating oil reserves for the northeast because we are gonna have a tough winter we have shortages they re predicting brownouts and blackouts we are in desperate need for help related remember when democrats blocked trump from filling the strategic oil reserve while gas was cheap lepage and carr discussed the reports of heating oil rationing taking place in connecticut lepage added that the same practice is already happening in maine and it s still nowhere near his state s coldest and most energy demanding time of year it s already started in maine lepage said of heating oil rationing if you order 100 gallons they ll deliver you 50 gallons if you order 200 gallons they ll deliver 100 gallons i ve had some dealers tell me they re forced to right now because they don t know and they re putting people on budgets because they know we re gonna have another crisis in a month or so advertisement according to the u s energy information administration eia residential heating oil in the new england area in march 2020 was about 2 87 per gallon it held in that range or lower for the bulk of trump s presidency not long after biden entered office the price began to climb as of october 17 the latest figure it s 5 70 per gallon as we enter home heating oil season diesel prices are nearing 6 per gallon this is a nothing short of a crisis for ct families to make things worse in 72 days the ct dems will begin taxing home heating fuel trucks for delivering your oil to you more inflationary pressure mike grant for state rep mikegrant262 october 20 2022 the math of what it s going to cost for residents of the region to heat their homes truly blew me away at current prices and keep in mind these prices are guaranteed to rise in the coming months as demand increases and supply decreases probably significantly the cost to fill the typical 275 gallon residential heating oil tank is about 1 567 that amount of heating oil according to shipley energy lasts the average home about 56 days less than two months but let s call it two months folks that s 783 per month for heating oil alone and that s at the current rate which will probably soon seem cheap and that s if you can find it advertisement oh and what happens in three months in the dead of winter when inflation is even higher unemployment is up and nobody can afford expensive heating oil bills some will inevitably have to decide whether to heat their home or buy groceries either sacrifice will undoubtedly cause this winter to be one of sickness and death just how biden likes it

samantha subin gina francolla u s dollar versus china s renminbi is a cause for concern not panic shah says the strength of the u s dollar against china s renminbi is not a cause for panic but is a concern according to seema shah chief global strategist at principal asset management the dollar has surged against other currencies as the federal reserve hikes interest rates to cool hot inflation with the people s bank of china pboc trying to keep monetary policy loose the yield differential between the u s and china has turned firmly in favor of the greenback shah said in a monday note china s continued restrictive covid policy has also significantly hurt confidence further reducing the relative attractiveness of the renminbi contributing to a 6 depreciation against the u s dollar in just the last three months and also prompting capital outflows still though the situation is concerning it is not dire or a cause for panic the renminbi has held steady against the currencies of china s major export rivals and trade flows have remained strong partially offsetting capital outflows policymakers are also deploying measures aimed at limiting further rmb depreciation said shah increasing onshore foreign currency liquidity and curbing currency speculation via increases to the risk reserve ratio jointly suggest a disorderly depreciation of the rmb is unlikely because of this the people s bank of china should be able to contend with currency weakness until the u s dollar peaks likely when the fed policy rates hit their highs next year nonetheless challenges could still emerge next year if shrinking global demand results in slowing export growth renewing downward pressure on the renminbi she added a storm cloud be forming on the horizon carmen reinicke treasury yields higher

harring sophie kiderlin absent a fed tack this latest stock market rally is unsustainable canaccord genuity says until the federal reserve changes its messaging ie pivots this latest little stock market boomlet is unsustainable in the eyes of canaccord genuity chief market strategist tony dwyer the success of the rally ultimately depends on rates money supply and the relative tightness of financial conditions dwyer wrote in monday note to clients unfortunately for bulls the two year treasury yield made a new high last week meaning that the recent low in the s p 500 is probably not the ultimate bottom dwyer noted that at prior turning points the economy was weak enough to allow the fed to clearly signal a pivot which causes rates to drop enough to allow investors to look through the worsening economic data obviously that is not currently the case in our view for a sustainable rally it will take very aggressive signaling from the fed to reverse rates enough to cause a significant recovery in money availability this fed pivot typically comes from a significant deterioration in the economic data and or a market event that is perceived as systemic risk we have not seen either only then will investors be able to look through the coming economic weakness in 1h 2023 for now we continue to expect an oversold ramp but don t anticipate a sustainable bottom until there is a clear signaling change from the fed that sparks a significant improvement in money availability scott schnipper analysts bullish ahead of disney earnings analysts from ubs and wells fargo are bullish on

sen murkowski says she met with the two siberians recently but didn t provide more details about exactly when or where the meeting took place example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video anchorage alaska two russian indigenous siberians were so scared of having to fight the war in ukraine they chanced everything to take a small boat across the treacherous bering sea to reach american soil alaska s senior u s senator said after talking with the two the two identified as males by a resident landed earlier this month near gambell on alaska s st lawrence island in the bering strait where they asked for asylum they feared for their lives because of russia who is targeting minority populations for conscription into service in ukraine republican u s sen lisa murkowski said saturday during a candidate forum at the alaska federation of natives conference in anchorage it is very clear to me that these individuals were in fear so much in fear of their own government that they risked their lives and took a 15 foot skiff across those open waters murkowski said when answering a question about arctic policy it is clear that russian president vladimir putin is focused on a military conquest at the expense of his own people murkowski said he s got one hand on ukraine and he s got the other on the arctic so we have to be eyes wide open on the arctic murkowski said she met with the two siberians recently but didn t provide more details about exactly when or where the meeting took place or where their asylum process stood she was not available after the forum for follow up questions murkowski s office on oct 6 announced their request for asylum saying the men reportedly fled one of the coastal communities on russia s east coast a village elder in gambell 87 year old bruce boolowon is believed to be the last living alaska national guard member who helped rescue 11 u s navy men who were in a plane that was shot down by russian migs over the bering sea in 1955 the plane crash landed on st lawrence island gambell an alaska native community of about 600 people is about 36 miles 58 kilometers from russia s chukotka peninsula in siberia even though one of the russians spoke english pretty well two russian born women from gambell were brought in to translate both women married local men and became naturalized u s citizens said boolowon who is siberian yupik russians landing in gambell during the cold war was commonplace but the visits were not nefarious boolowon said since st lawrence island is so close to russia people routinely traveled back and forth to visit relatives but these two men seeking asylum were unknown to the people of gambell they were foreigners and didn t have any passports so they put them in jail he told the associated press last week the two men spent the night in the jailhouse but townspeople in gambell brought them food both alaska native dishes and items bought at a grocery store they were pretty full they ate a lot boolowon said the next day a coast guard c 130 with some officials came and picked them up he said adding that was the last he heard about the russians since then officials have been tight lipped the individuals were transported to anchorage for inspection which includes a screening and vetting process and then subsequently processed in accordance with applicable u s immigration laws under the immigration and nationality act was all a department of homeland security spokesman said in an email this past week when asked for an update on the asylum process and if and where the men were being held margaret stock an immigration attorney in anchorage said it s very unlikely information about the russians will ever be released the u s government is supposed to keep all of this confidential so i don t know why they would be telling anybody anything she told the ap instead it would be up to the two russians to publicize their situation which could put their families in russia at risk i don t know why they would want to do that stock said thousands of russian men fled the country after putin in september announced a mobilization to call up about 300 000 men with past military experience to bolster forces in ukraine

there are numerous important issues on new mexicans ballots as early voting kicks off on oct 22 amendment 2 has not received the same attention as amendment 1 which relates to pre k and early childhood spending but voters will be asked to vote on this important issue also amendment 2 would if adopted further weaken new mexico s anti donation clause by allowing the legislature to appropriate state funds for infrastructure that provides services primarily for residential use such as internet electric natural gas water and wastewater the anti donation clause goes back to new mexico s founding at that time and throughout the decades leading up to it railroads were among the dominant economic interests in the nation before adoption of anti donation clauses government bonds were often given to railroads these often failed leaving states and municipalities in debt while enriching the railroad robber barons of the day those days are behind us but special interest groups are always finding new ways to fleece taxpayers of more of their hard earned money while infrastructure includes the aforementioned infrastructure items as with all constitutional amendments the legislature will finalize the text of the law if it passes muster with voters allowing taxpayer funding for private gain could create problems especially leading to what most new mexicans would call corruption in 2005 the santa fe new mexican reported that a state senator slipped 50 000 into that year s christmas tree capital outlay bill to pave a private road in pecos where his friend a registered lobbyist happened to live san miguel county and the village of pecos did not request the appropriation and protested that using public dollars to pave a private road is illegal that kind of shady deal won t be illegal anymore if amendment 2 passes rather because the legislature and people of the state will have expressed support for it this kind of activity could spread rapidly throughout new mexico government rather than further weakening new mexico s anti donation clause we d like to see it strengthened and restored over the years the effectiveness of the clause has been undermined by bipartisan advocates of corporate welfare specifically the legislature allowed local governments to provide land buildings or infrastructure for facilities to support new or expanding businesses while the theory behind corporate welfare that is giving businesses special benefits to get them to come to new mexico may seem like a good way to bring businesses to the state the economists of all political stripes agree that such efforts ultimately harm taxpayers lead to corruption of government officials and are inefficient and thus prone to failure new mexico has a long history of failed corporate welfare efforts remember eclipse aviation which received 100 million of your tax dollars under bill richardson only to go bust spaceport america was built for the express benefit of billionaire richard branson s virgin galactic and received 250 million in taxpayer subsidies the facility has been open for 11 years now and has yet to launch a single paid space tourism flight when given the chance voters often oppose corporate welfare last november albuquerque voters rightly saw the proposed new mexico united stadium as nothing short of corporate welfare and overwhelmingly rejected taxpayer financing for it at the ballot box now the team is moving toward building its own stadium likely with private financing new mexico s anti donation clause is an important protection for new mexico taxpayers against the unholy alliance of powerful special interests and big government government already has plenty of tools available to generate economic development including adopting better tax and regulatory policies for all amendment 2 would take new mexico in the wrong direction more from paul j gessing paul j gessing is president of new mexico s rio grande foundation this article originally appeared on las cruces sun news gessing new mexico should strengthen not weaken anti donation clause

samantha subin gina francolla u s dollar versus china s renminbi is a cause for concern not panic shah says the strength of the u s dollar against china s renminbi is not a cause for panic but is a concern according to seema shah chief global strategist at principal asset management the dollar has surged against other currencies as the federal reserve hikes interest rates to cool hot inflation with the people s bank of china pboc trying to keep monetary policy loose the yield differential between the u s and china has turned firmly in favor of the greenback shah said in a monday note china s continued restrictive covid policy has also significantly hurt confidence further reducing the relative attractiveness of the renminbi contributing to a 6 depreciation against the u s dollar in just the last three months and also prompting capital outflows still though the situation is concerning it is not dire or a cause for panic the renminbi has held steady against the currencies of china s major export rivals and trade flows have remained strong partially offsetting capital outflows policymakers are also deploying measures aimed at limiting further rmb depreciation said shah increasing onshore foreign currency liquidity and curbing currency speculation via increases to the risk reserve ratio jointly suggest a disorderly depreciation of the rmb is unlikely because of this the people s bank of china should be able to contend with currency weakness until the u s dollar peaks likely when the fed policy rates hit their highs next year nonetheless challenges could still emerge next year if shrinking global demand results in slowing export growth renewing downward pressure on the renminbi she added a storm cloud be forming on the horizon carmen reinicke treasury yields higher

harring sophie kiderlin absent a fed tack this latest stock market rally is unsustainable canaccord genuity says until the federal reserve changes its messaging ie pivots this latest little stock market boomlet is unsustainable in the eyes of canaccord genuity chief market strategist tony dwyer the success of the rally ultimately depends on rates money supply and the relative tightness of financial conditions dwyer wrote in monday note to clients unfortunately for bulls the two year treasury yield made a new high last week meaning that the recent low in the s p 500 is probably not the ultimate bottom dwyer noted that at prior turning points the economy was weak enough to allow the fed to clearly signal a pivot which causes rates to drop enough to allow investors to look through the worsening economic data obviously that is not currently the case in our view for a sustainable rally it will take very aggressive signaling from the fed to reverse rates enough to cause a significant recovery in money availability this fed pivot typically comes from a significant deterioration in the economic data and or a market event that is perceived as systemic risk we have not seen either only then will investors be able to look through the coming economic weakness in 1h 2023 for now we continue to expect an oversold ramp but don t anticipate a sustainable bottom until there is a clear signaling change from the fed that sparks a significant improvement in money availability scott schnipper analysts bullish ahead of disney earnings analysts from ubs and wells fargo are bullish on

samantha subin gina francolla u s dollar versus china s renminbi is a cause for concern not panic shah says the strength of the u s dollar against china s renminbi is not a cause for panic but is a concern according to seema shah chief global strategist at principal asset management the dollar has surged against other currencies as the federal reserve hikes interest rates to cool hot inflation with the people s bank of china pboc trying to keep monetary policy loose the yield differential between the u s and china has turned firmly in favor of the greenback shah said in a monday note china s continued restrictive covid policy has also significantly hurt confidence further reducing the relative attractiveness of the renminbi contributing to a 6 depreciation against the u s dollar in just the last three months and also prompting capital outflows still though the situation is concerning it is not dire or a cause for panic the renminbi has held steady against the currencies of china s major export rivals and trade flows have remained strong partially offsetting capital outflows policymakers are also deploying measures aimed at limiting further rmb depreciation said shah increasing onshore foreign currency liquidity and curbing currency speculation via increases to the risk reserve ratio jointly suggest a disorderly depreciation of the rmb is unlikely because of this the people s bank of china should be able to contend with currency weakness until the u s dollar peaks likely when the fed policy rates hit their highs next year nonetheless challenges could still emerge next year if shrinking global demand results in slowing export growth renewing downward pressure on the renminbi she added a storm cloud be forming on the horizon carmen reinicke treasury yields higher

harring sophie kiderlin absent a fed tack this latest stock market rally is unsustainable canaccord genuity says until the federal reserve changes its messaging ie pivots this latest little stock market boomlet is unsustainable in the eyes of canaccord genuity chief market strategist tony dwyer the success of the rally ultimately depends on rates money supply and the relative tightness of financial conditions dwyer wrote in monday note to clients unfortunately for bulls the two year treasury yield made a new high last week meaning that the recent low in the s p 500 is probably not the ultimate bottom dwyer noted that at prior turning points the economy was weak enough to allow the fed to clearly signal a pivot which causes rates to drop enough to allow investors to look through the worsening economic data obviously that is not currently the case in our view for a sustainable rally it will take very aggressive signaling from the fed to reverse rates enough to cause a significant recovery in money availability this fed pivot typically comes from a significant deterioration in the economic data and or a market event that is perceived as systemic risk we have not seen either only then will investors be able to look through the coming economic weakness in 1h 2023 for now we continue to expect an oversold ramp but don t anticipate a sustainable bottom until there is a clear signaling change from the fed that sparks a significant improvement in money availability scott schnipper analysts bullish ahead of disney earnings analysts from ubs and wells fargo are bullish on

former british prime minister boris johnson announced sunday he will not run to lead the conservative party ending a short lived attempt to return to the prime minister s job he was ousted from little more than three months ago his withdrawal leaves former treasury chief rishi sunak the strong favorite to be britain s next prime minister he could win the contest as soon as monday johnson who was ousted in july amid ethics scandals has been widely expected to run to replace liz truss who quit last week after her tax cutting economic package caused turmoil in financial markets and obliterated her authority inside the governing party johnson spent the weekend trying to gain support from fellow conservative lawmakers after flying back from a caribbean vacation and held talks with the two other contenders sunak and house of commons leader penny mordaunt we re making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter the 4front sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox late sunday he said he had amassed the backing of 102 colleagues more than the threshold of 100 needed to make a ballot of lawmakers on monday but he was far behind sunak in support and said he had concluded that you can t govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament the prospect of a return by johnson had thrown the already divided conservative party into further turmoil he led the party to a thumping election victory in 2019 but his premiership was clouded by scandals over money and ethics that eventually became too much for the party to bear in his sunday statement johnson insisted he was well placed to deliver a conservative victory in the next national election due by 2024 and he said that he likely would have won a ballot of conservative party members against either of his rivals but in the course of the last days i have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do he said therefore i am afraid the best thing is that i do not allow my nomination to go forward and commit my support to whoever succeeds but he hinted he might be back saying i believe i have much to offer but i am afraid that this is simply not the right time after truss quit on thursday the conservative party hastily ordered a contest that aims to finalize nominations monday and install a new prime minister its third this year within a week the clear favorite now is sunak who has support from more than 140 lawmakers according to unofficial tallies mordaunt is backed by fewer than 30 if both make the ballot the 357 conservative lawmakers will hold an indicative vote on monday to show their preference before the choice goes to the 172 000 party members around the country if mordaunt does not reach 100 nominations sunak will win by acclamation sunak 42 was runner up after truss in this summer s tory leadership race to replace johnson on sunday he confirmed he was running again in the latest leadership contest there will be integrity professionalism and accountability at every level of the government i lead and i will work day in and day out to get the job done sunak said in a statement johnson s exit came only hours after allies insisted he would run business secretary jacob rees mogg told the bbc on sunday that he spoke with johnson and clearly he s going to stand after flying back to london saturday from a vacation in the dominican republic but northern ireland minister steve baker a former backer of johnson and an influential politician within the conservative party warned a johnson comeback would be a guaranteed disaster baker noted that johnson still faces an investigation into whether he lied to parliament while in office about breaking his government s own coronavirus restrictions during parties at downing street if found guilty johnson could be suspended as a lawmaker this isn t the time for boris and his style baker told sky news on sunday what we can t do is have him as prime minister in circumstances where he s bound to implode taking down the whole government and we just can t do that again truss quit thursday after a turbulent 45 days conceding that she could not deliver on her botched tax cutting economic package which she was forced to abandon after it sparked fury within her party and weeks of turmoil in financial markets sunak who was treasury chief from 2020 until this summer steered britain s slumping economy through the coronavirus pandemic he quit in july in protest at johnson s leadership in the summer contest to replace johnson sunak called promises by truss and other rivals to immediately slash taxes reckless fairy tales and argued that soaring inflation must be controlled first tory voters backed truss over sunak but he was proved right when truss unfunded tax cutting package triggered chaos in the markets in september now the task of stabilizing britain s wobbling economy is likely to fall to him british prime minister boris johnson resigned thursday but said he would remain as prime minister until the party chooses his successor
former british prime minister boris johnson announced sunday he will not run to lead the conservative party ending a short lived attempt to return to the prime minister s job he was ousted from little more than three months ago his withdrawal leaves former treasury chief rishi sunak the strong favorite to be britain s next prime minister he could win the contest as soon as monday johnson who was ousted in july amid ethics scandals has been widely expected to run to replace liz truss who quit last week after her tax cutting economic package caused turmoil in financial markets and obliterated her authority inside the governing party johnson spent the weekend trying to gain support from fellow conservative lawmakers after flying back from a caribbean vacation and held talks with the two other contenders sunak and house of commons leader penny mordaunt get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters late sunday he said he had amassed the backing of 102 colleagues more than the threshold of 100 needed to make a ballot of lawmakers on monday but he was far behind sunak in support and said he had concluded that you can t govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament the prospect of a return by johnson had thrown the already divided conservative party into further turmoil he led the party to a thumping election victory in 2019 but his premiership was clouded by scandals over money and ethics that eventually became too much for the party to bear in his sunday statement johnson insisted he was well placed to deliver a conservative victory in the next national election due by 2024 and he said that he likely would have won a ballot of conservative party members against either of his rivals but in the course of the last days i have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do he said therefore i am afraid the best thing is that i do not allow my nomination to go forward and commit my support to whoever succeeds but he hinted he might be back saying i believe i have much to offer but i am afraid that this is simply not the right time after truss quit on thursday the conservative party hastily ordered a contest that aims to finalize nominations monday and install a new prime minister its third this year within a week the clear favorite now is sunak who has support from more than 140 lawmakers according to unofficial tallies mordaunt is backed by fewer than 30 if both make the ballot the 357 conservative lawmakers will hold an indicative vote on monday to show their preference before the choice goes to the 172 000 party members around the country if mordaunt does not reach 100 nominations sunak will win by acclamation sunak 42 was runner up after truss in this summer s tory leadership race to replace johnson on sunday he confirmed he was running again in the latest leadership contest there will be integrity professionalism and accountability at every level of the government i lead and i will work day in and day out to get the job done sunak said in a statement johnson s exit came only hours after allies insisted he would run business secretary jacob rees mogg told the bbc on sunday that he spoke with johnson and clearly he s going to stand after flying back to london saturday from a vacation in the dominican republic but northern ireland minister steve baker a former backer of johnson and an influential politician within the conservative party warned a johnson comeback would be a guaranteed disaster baker noted that johnson still faces an investigation into whether he lied to parliament while in office about breaking his government s own coronavirus restrictions during parties at downing street if found guilty johnson could be suspended as a lawmaker this isn t the time for boris and his style baker told sky news on sunday what we can t do is have him as prime minister in circumstances where he s bound to implode taking down the whole government and we just can t do that again truss quit thursday after a turbulent 45 days conceding that she could not deliver on her botched tax cutting economic package which she was forced to abandon after it sparked fury within her party and weeks of turmoil in financial markets sunak who was treasury chief from 2020 until this summer steered britain s slumping economy through the coronavirus pandemic he quit in july in protest at johnson s leadership in the summer contest to replace johnson sunak called promises by truss and other rivals to immediately slash taxes reckless fairy tales and argued that soaring inflation must be controlled first tory voters backed truss over sunak but he was proved right when truss unfunded tax cutting package triggered chaos in the markets in september now the task of stabilizing britain s wobbling economy is likely to fall to him british prime minister boris johnson resigned

samantha subin gina francolla u s dollar versus china s renminbi is a cause for concern not panic shah says the strength of the u s dollar against china s renminbi is not a cause for panic but is a concern according to seema shah chief global strategist at principal asset management the dollar has surged against other currencies as the federal reserve hikes interest rates to cool hot inflation with the people s bank of china pboc trying to keep monetary policy loose the yield differential between the u s and china has turned firmly in favor of the greenback shah said in a monday note china s continued restrictive covid policy has also significantly hurt confidence further reducing the relative attractiveness of the renminbi contributing to a 6 depreciation against the u s dollar in just the last three months and also prompting capital outflows still though the situation is concerning it is not dire or a cause for panic the renminbi has held steady against the currencies of china s major export rivals and trade flows have remained strong partially offsetting capital outflows policymakers are also deploying measures aimed at limiting further rmb depreciation said shah increasing onshore foreign currency liquidity and curbing currency speculation via increases to the risk reserve ratio jointly suggest a disorderly depreciation of the rmb is unlikely because of this the people s bank of china should be able to contend with currency weakness until the u s dollar peaks likely when the fed policy rates hit their highs next year nonetheless challenges could still emerge next year if shrinking global demand results in slowing export growth renewing downward pressure on the renminbi she added a storm cloud be forming on the horizon carmen reinicke treasury yields higher

highs the yield on the 10 year treasury yield was down by multiple basis points to 4 183 that marks a turn from friday when it hit a 14 year high at 4 337 before the wall street journal reported that some federal reserve officials were growing concerned about raising interest rates too far the policy sensitive 2 year treasury yield was also down by less than a basis point to 4 487 after hitting a high also not seen since the late 2000s monday data on flash manufacturing and purchasing management could provide a jolt yields and prices move in opposite directions one basis point equals 0 01 alex harring sophie kiderlin absent a fed tack this latest stock market rally is unsustainable canaccord genuity says until the federal reserve changes its messaging ie pivots this latest little stock market boomlet is unsustainable in the eyes of canaccord genuity chief market strategist tony dwyer the success of the rally ultimately depends on rates money supply and the relative tightness of financial conditions dwyer wrote in monday note to clients unfortunately for bulls the two year treasury yield made a new high last week meaning that the recent low in the s p 500 is probably not the ultimate bottom dwyer noted that at prior turning points the economy was weak enough to allow the fed to clearly signal a pivot which causes rates to drop enough to allow investors to look through the worsening economic data obviously that is not currently the case in our view for a sustainable rally it will take very aggressive signaling from the fed to reverse rates enough to cause a significant recovery in money availability this fed pivot typically comes from a significant deterioration in the economic data and or a market event that is perceived as systemic risk we have not seen either only then will investors be able to look through the coming economic weakness in 1h 2023 for now we continue to expect an oversold ramp but don t anticipate a sustainable bottom until there is a clear signaling change from the fed that sparks a significant improvement in money availability scott schnipper analysts bullish ahead of disney earnings analysts from ubs and wells fargo are bullish on

the fed is not out of line as it battles inflation through interest rates and he said a recession as a result would be a necessary evil when people say the fed is too hawkish i disagree pinto said in an interview with cnbc that sentiment is a break from a growing group of business and economic leaders who argue the fed is not giving enough time for what they see as lagging indicators to reflect mitigating inflation i think putting inflation back in a box is very important he added if it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time that is the price we have to pay pinto predicted

i nflation is wreaking havoc with invested wealth except for commodities all major asset classes ranging from u s leveraged loans to emerging market equities have lost money so far this year investors are scrambling to protect their assets against the ravages of rising prices they will have to restructure their portfolios to adapt to this change of regime the trouble is that even traditional inflation hedges have proved disappointing for more than a quarter of a century investors benefited from low and stable inflation price stability meant more predictable corporate earnings lower interest rates fed through to higher equity and bond valuations it s no secret that fixed income securities perform poorly when inflation is rising rapidly so called bond vigilantes demand extra compensation for holding these obligations so yields rise and prices come down by the end of the so called great inflation of the 1970s u s treasury bonds had lost so much money in real terms they were dubbed certificates of guaranteed confiscation equities which are claims on real assets provide protection from inflation over the long run but in shorter time frames stock market valuations tend to decline as bond yields rise when inflation last took off between 1966 and 1981 the ratio of price to earnings of u s equities halved for the past couple of decades conventional investment portfolios benefited from the fact that bonds and stocks moved in opposite directions over short periods when the stock market declined long term interest rates would fall thereby boosting bond prices a benchmark investment portfolio with 60 percent allocated to equities and a 40 percent weighting in bonds delivered fabulous returns but when inflation takes off stocks and bonds become positively correlated rising and falling together in the first half of the 1970s a classic 60 40 portfolio in uk stocks and bonds lost more than half of its value in real terms in the first six months of this year the same portfolio declined 16 percent in nominal terms the failure of bonds and stocks to deliver protection when inflation spikes has forced investors to seek other hedges property is the ultimate real asset but the value of bricks and mortar doesn t always increase in line with prices in hard times governments often impose rent controls while landlords face higher mortgage costs this year residential property markets around the world are suffering as interest rates rise u s real estate investment trusts were down 19 in the first six months of the year gold has been a store of wealth for millennia during the decade of the great inflation the yellow metal appreciated by around 1 400 for most of that time the price of gold moved inversely with the stock market providing investors with the diversification that bonds no longer afforded this year however the barbarous relic has fallen around 10 in dollar terms gold bugs are not too dismayed the recent poor performance is largely a consequence of the steep rise of the greenback gold has delivered positive returns when measured in euros yen and british pounds still many investors won t touch gold because it generates no income and is difficult to value besides it s proven to be an extremely volatile inflation hedge in the past forming bubbles when investors lose confidence in paper assets and collapsing in value when the inflation cycle turns down industrial commodities are another alternative to paper assets but they are also volatile and exposed to industrial downturns copper went through two boom bust cycles in the 1970s history is repeating itself last year copper rose 26 percent as inflation picked up but so far this year it has given back all its gains by the end of the 1970s after a decade of dismal performance from bonds and equities there was no shortage of advice on how to hedge investments the authors of inflation proofing your investments published in 1981 recommended that portfolios have 40 percent in gold and silver and just 5 percent in long dated bonds and 15 percent in stock market investments this turned out to be terrible advice over the next few decades stocks and bonds soared while gold entered a long bear market each attempted inflation hedge has its particular attractions risks and shortcomings wrote the journalist henry hazlitt in 1978 that s true of real estate gold and commodities but inflation protected bonds whose principal and interest are linked to an index of prices weren t around at the time the uk government introduced index linked gilts in 1981 while the united states first offered treasury inflation protected securities tips in 1997 in theory these securities should protect investors from rising prices this year however index linked bonds have proved one of the worst inflation hedges some long dated uk index linked gilts have crashed and even 10 year tips are down more than 10 so far this year these losses occurred because bond yields adjusted to the new world of higher interest rates from a starting point of extreme overvaluation the real yield on 10 year tips has climbed from minus 1 percent in january to around 1 6 percent today that yield is now roughly in line with recent growth in u s productivity a loose proxy for the tips fair value by contrast the real yield on conventional 10 year treasuries is currently minus 4 percent investors expect inflation will average 2 5 percent over the next decade only a little above the federal reserve s target hazlitt wrote that the only reliable inflation hedge is to end

egypt to grow by 5 4 for the current fiscal year and 5 for 2023 2024 egypt has a lot of growth potential given its demographics because the country has a large population whose incomes could rise significantly if the country continues its development over time according to the world bank egypt has a population of over 104 million people with the average gdp per capita for egyptians of 3 876 4 in 2021 egypt s population is also relatively young with around 60 of the population under 30 with a young population egypt will have a large workforce for a long time suez canal another advantage for

25 years ago us china summit jiang zemin on october 26 1997 the us china summit began demonstrating the falsity of two of the most time worn myths of the twentieth century that the american ruling class stood for democracy and that the chinese stalinist regime had anything to do with socialism president jiang zemin was the first chinese leader to visit the united states since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre jiang headed one of the world s most brutal and repressive regimes accordingly he received public lectures on human rights at a joint press conference with us president clinton and a breakfast meeting with congressional republicans and democrats but these exchanges were only a fig leaf for the real business of his visit deepening beijing s economic ties with corporate america congressmen and journalists politely asked him whether his government harvested the organs of political prisoners after shooting them and then corporate ceos queued up to sign lucrative contracts cashing in on the low wage exploitation of the chinese working class in new york jiang zemin rang the bell to begin trading on the new york stock exchange visited the headquarters of ibm where chairman louis v gerstner greeted him in mandarin then hosted a dinner at the waldorf astoria for a guest list of 200 corporate executives in los angeles he was toasted by california governor pete wilson mayor richard riordan and an array of west coast capitalists in the balance of american ruling class politics the torrent of corporate money easily outweighed all the hypocritical rhetoric about human rights jiang zemin announced 3 billion in orders for boeing the biggest us exporter and agreed to cut tariffs on another 1 8 billion in us exports of computer and telecommunications equipment the chinese government also announced that it would end nuclear cooperation with iran a diplomatic gesture which allowed the clinton administration to lift a ban on commercial nuclear power contracts with china which had been in effect since 1985 american companies like westinghouse general electric and combustion engineering stood to benefit the most as they placed bids on an estimated 60 billion in chinese contracts jiang zemin s enthusiasm as he toured citadels of capitalism like the new york stock exchange was not just a diplomatic display one of the principal subjects of discussion at the white house was beijing s efforts to stave off a collapse of the hong kong stock market for which it was then directly responsible after the handover of control of the former british colony the previous july 50 years ago yemen peace treaty and unification pact signed in cairo map depicting the yemen arab republic north yemen in orange and the people s democratic republic of yemen south yemen in blue yemen occupies the lower portion of the arabian peninsula astride the strategic bab al mandab strait on october 28 1972 representatives from the yemen arab republic known as north yemen and the people s democratic republic of yemen south yemen met in cairo to sign a treaty to end a border war between the two countries that had broken out three weeks earlier the treaty would bring about an unsteady ceasefire while also stating an intent to work towards reunification tensions between the two yemens had been ongoing since the british seized the southern portion around aden from the ottoman empire in the 19th century in 1962 coinciding with the wave of arab nationalist revolutions throughout the middle east civil war erupted in north yemen between monarchists backed by saudi arabia britain and other imperialist countries and arab nationalists backed by egypt and the soviet union simultaneously an arab nationalist formation in the british controlled south the national liberation front began a guerilla struggle against the colonial government in 1967 the british army withdrew and the nlf assumed power forming the people s democratic republic of yemen in the south the north yemen war meanwhile spiraled into a drawn out proxy war between egypt armed with warplanes from the soviet union and saudi arabia which received major arms and funds from britain and the us the egyptian army withdrew its troops from yemen in 1967 after brokering an agreement with saudi arabia to end its support of the monarchist faction the war ended with the victory of the arab nationalists and the establishment of the yemen arab republic in yemen as was proven time and again throughout the arab world nationalism offered no solution to the basic democratic task of uniting the arab masses over the boundaries imposed by colonialism in september 1972 the new government in north yemen the yemen arab republic backed by imperialism launched an attack on the south people s democratic republic of yemen the south using soviet built weaponry repelled the invasion 75 years ago first india pakistan war begins over control of kashmir on october 27 1947 the newly established indian state airlifted troops to the princely state of jammu and kashmir sending them into battle against forces aligned with pakistan the move initiated the first of four india pakistan wars under conditions of the mass devastation caused by the partition of the indian subcontinent only months before in august 1947 the indian and pakistani states had been formed they emerged out of the formal decolonization of the subcontinent by british imperialism the british authorities ensured that india remained within the framework of global imperialism they promoted the communalism of the native ruling elite in a bid to divide the masses along ethnic and religious lines and to ensure the stability of capitalist rule the partition immediately resulted in widespread displacement and violence in jammu and kashmir uprisings and guerilla warfare rapidly developed against the state government while its population was majority muslim it was ruled by a hindu monarchical regime creating conditions for communal conflict maharaja hari singh initially declared that his state would remain independent of india and pakistan islamic forces launched a rebellion in the poonch area which singh s forces would quickly lose control of those involved in the fighting included pakistani army servicemen on leave rebellious state troops and tribal bands singh issued a request to the indian state for military assistance it responded by insisting that this was contingent on the transfer of kashmir to direct indian control singh complied and troops were dispatched the war would rage over the following 14 months with a series of offensives and counter offensives the regular pakistani army would increasingly become involved in the conflict on the side of the rebel forces fighting the indian divisions the conflict would claim an estimated 20 000 military casualties that included the deaths of 1 103 indian troops and almost 2 000 local forces loyal to singh pakistani deaths are estimated at 6 000 with some 12 000 injuries more broadly it set the pattern for decades of ongoing hostilities between the pakistani and indian states which have erupted in three subsequent wars and eventually became a potential flashpoint for nuclear conflict 100 years ago fascists seize power in italy mussolini second from left in naples during the march on rome on october 30 1922 over 30 000 members of fascist squadristi fighting groups entered the italian capital of rome in a triumphant march as their leader benito mussolini assumed the powers of state the fascists had massed outside of the city on october 28 after mussolini had declared at the fascist congress in naples on october 24 our program is simple we want to rule italy mussolini had already made several public declarations that he would attempt to seize power the international press had been broadcasting these threats for weeks the acting prime minister luigi facta had declared a state of siege but the king victor emmanuel iii had refused to sign the order that would have mobilized troops on october 29 the king asked mussolini to form a government in the coming months mussolini would brutally suppress democratic rights and drive working class organizations underground in december fascists would massacre as many as 24 left wing workers in turin mussolini would prepare italian imperialism for a bloody intervention in ethiopia and ultimately in the second world war on the side of german imperialism the ascension of the fascists to power in their notorious march on rome was a defeat for the working class not only in italy but internationally the revolutionary momentum that had been built up in the working class in the two red years of 1919 20 when workers seized factories and formed self defense militias had been dissipated by the trade unions and the socialist party handing over the initiative to the fascists in his speech of october 20 1922 to the moscow organization of the russian communist party leon trotsky made the following analysis in september 1920 the working class of italy had in effect gained control of the state of society of factories plants and enterprises what was lacking a trifle was lacking a party was lacking which would resting upon the insurrectionary working class have engaged in an open struggle with the bourgeoisie for those remnants of material forces still in the latter s hands destroying these forces seizing power and thus consummating the victory of the working class in essence the working class had already conquered or virtually conquered but there was no organization capable of definitively consolidating this victory and so the working class found itself hurled back the party split into segments the proletariat was smashed and since then throughout 1921 and 1922 we have been witnessing the most frightful political retreat of the working class in italy under the blows of consolidated bourgeois and petty bourgeois gangs known as the fascists

declines throughout the year the indexes have caught down this year sonders said with all three major averages in bear market territory that could mean that the market has now priced in a full recession but uncertainty around inflation and interest rates might break the pattern sonders said in the short term the market has become very reactionary and that has a lot to do with the fed

quarter evercore isi s mark mahaney says amazon s third quarter estimates are likely beatable but downside risks loom in the fourth quarter as the e commerce giant grapples with foreign exchange headwinds based on intra quarter data points and our model sensitivity analysis we believe amzn s q3 estimates are largely reasonable mahaney said in a note to clients sunday as it relates to q4 we view the street s revenue growth assumption 22 q q as having some downside risk primarily due to rising fx headwinds and we see some downside risk to the street s q4 operating income estimate evercore

bounce according to deutsche bank analyst sidney ho said in a note on sunday evening that apple s upcoming earnings report may not feature a large beat but the risk reward profile is attractive

gross margins looking ahead to that quarter mohan s focus will be on the trajectory of demand not counting the extra week as that will determine what happens in march and june quarters which is where they see the most risk to estimates an inline dec guide would imply a weaker cycle overall said mohan bank of america maintained its neutral rating on apple and in particular the risk versus reward

samantha subin gina francolla u s dollar versus china s renminbi is a cause for concern not panic shah says the strength of the u s dollar against china s renminbi is not a cause for panic but is a concern according to seema shah chief global strategist at principal asset management the dollar has surged against other currencies as the federal reserve hikes interest rates to cool hot inflation with the people s bank of china pboc trying to keep monetary policy loose the yield differential between the u s and china has turned firmly in favor of the greenback shah said in a monday note china s continued restrictive covid policy has also significantly hurt confidence further reducing the relative attractiveness of the renminbi contributing to a 6 depreciation against the u s dollar in just the last three months and also prompting capital outflows still though the situation is concerning it is not dire or a cause for panic the renminbi has held steady against the currencies of china s major export rivals and trade flows have remained strong partially offsetting capital outflows policymakers are also deploying measures aimed at limiting further rmb depreciation said shah increasing onshore foreign currency liquidity and curbing currency speculation via increases to the risk reserve ratio jointly suggest a disorderly depreciation of the rmb is unlikely because of this the people s bank of china should be able to contend with currency weakness until the u s dollar peaks likely when the fed policy rates hit their highs next year nonetheless challenges could still emerge next year if shrinking global demand results in slowing export growth renewing downward pressure on the renminbi she added a storm cloud be forming on the horizon carmen reinicke treasury yields higher even after weaker pmi data the 10 year treasury yield was at about 4 25 monday after weaker u s pmi data and as the next leader of the u k government became more clear the benchmark yield touched a 14 year high of 4 33 friday before retreating sharply to the 4 20 area that yield is key since it impacts mortgages and is widely watched by stock investors yields move opposite price the yield touched an overnight low monday just below 4 13 overnight but was as high as 4 26 in morning trading the yield dipped initially but was back at 4 25 after both s p global manufacturing and services pmis were weaker than expected the flash reading of manufacturing pmi was at 49 9 below a reading of 50 shows contraction and the consensus was 51 8 according to dow jones services pmi was at 46 6 while the dow jones consensus was at 49 7 strategists said the yield seems to have reached a near term high on friday it s rocketed up over the last couple of weeks said wells fargo s michael schumacher we thought it was overdone i think that it s a near term peak is about right he said the fact that britain is moving ahead with a new prime minister has helped calm the market somewhat rishi sunak is set to replace liz truss who resigned last week schumacher said the 10 year yield could run higher again before the end of the year as investors price in a terminal rate for the fed funds rate traders in the futures market are now betting the fed funds rate reaches about 4 90 down from just over 5 friday the terminal rate is the rate where federal reserve officials stop raising interest rates schumacher said it would not be surprising if the 10 year reaches 5 later this year patti domm stifel says the s p 500 can rally 15 over the next 6 months stifel s chief equity strategist barry bannister says the s p 500 could rally as much as 15 over the next six months and hit 4 300 by april 2023 the setup requires a peak in inflation and the federal reserve s hawkishness which the firm believes have likely already occurred bannister also provided insight into the firm s outlook for the benchmark index through 2031 noting that commodities and the commodity index play an integral role in where the s p goes from here cnbc pro subscribers can read more on stifel s s p call here samantha subin mohamed el erian says don t cheer this rally mohamed el erian allianz and gramercy advisor said the federal reserve is dealing with a trilemma growth inflation and financial stability and it could be forced to slow down tightening for financial stability concerns inflation hasn t turned around core cpi continues to go up this is because of financial stability this massive front loading of rate hikes will break something in the financial markets el erian said so if the fed does slow it is because

highs the yield on the 10 year treasury yield was down by multiple basis points to 4 183 that marks a turn from friday when it hit a 14 year high at 4 337 before the wall street journal reported that some federal reserve officials were growing concerned about raising interest rates too far the policy sensitive 2 year treasury yield was also down by less than a basis point to 4 487 after hitting a

harring sophie kiderlin absent a fed tack this latest stock market rally is unsustainable canaccord genuity says until the federal reserve changes its messaging ie pivots this latest little stock market boomlet is unsustainable in the eyes of canaccord genuity chief market strategist tony dwyer the success of the rally ultimately depends on rates money supply and the relative tightness of financial conditions dwyer wrote in monday note to clients unfortunately for bulls the two year treasury yield made a new high last week meaning that the recent low in the s p 500 is probably not the ultimate bottom dwyer noted that at prior turning points the economy was weak enough to allow the fed to clearly signal a pivot which causes rates to drop enough to allow investors to look through the worsening economic data obviously that is not currently the case in our view for a sustainable rally it will take very aggressive signaling from the fed to reverse rates enough to cause a significant recovery in money availability this fed pivot typically comes from a significant deterioration in the economic data and or a market event that is perceived as systemic risk we have not seen either only then will investors be able to look through the coming economic weakness in 1h 2023 for now we continue to expect an oversold ramp but don t anticipate a sustainable bottom until there is a clear signaling change from the fed that sparks a significant improvement in money availability scott schnipper analysts bullish ahead of disney earnings analysts from ubs and wells fargo are bullish on

the fed is not out of line as it battles inflation through interest rates and he said a recession as a result would be a necessary evil when people say the fed is too hawkish i disagree pinto said in an interview with cnbc that sentiment is a break from a growing group of business and economic leaders who argue the fed is not giving enough time for what they see as lagging indicators to reflect mitigating inflation i think putting inflation back in a box is very important he added if it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time that is the price we have to pay pinto predicted the fed funds rate will likely peak around 5 in the interview with cnbc he recounted his experience growing up in argentina where food and gas prices were recalculated multiple times per day due to

view the full image south tahoe high climate crew at a recent campus clean up the south tahoe high climate crew club and key club asked questions of this year s candidates for south lake tahoe city council not all candidates replied and there are no responses from brad jacobson tamara wallace or sherry eddy due to the length of the questions and answers there are seven of them they will be split up over the next few days this is the third day of answers with two more questions answered below 4 do you believe south lake tahoe suffers from a lack of affordable housing if so what policies do you support or plan to implement in order to address this issue scott robbins we are deep into the worst housing crisis in the history of lake tahoe a crisis about which our city council has made much fuss but far less concrete action housing is the single most critical resource in the tahoe basin today today some 600 locals live in converted motel rooms and many locals have themselves or know someone else who has faced eviction as their rental was sold out from under them in the last twenty years our community has increased the total number of housing units by 20 but in that same time we ve lost 10 of our local population and 36 of our school enrollment second homes which sit empty most of the year account for over 50 of all residential units in tahoe nearly 8000 mostly empty homes we ve built vacation homes and lost locals and families this is not a healthy path we re short on housing but we re not short on homes my solution is a vacancy tax a fee charged to the owners of second homes that sit empty and which are not rented to local residents vancouver had a very similar problem of vacant second homes mostly used as investments and instituted a vacancy tax of 5 of the property s value as a result 30 of their empty 2nd homes were converted into rentals just this year the city of oakland here in california started a similar fee a flat rate of 6000 per empty 2nd home if we can replicate vancouver s success here in tahoe using the same system as oakland that would add 2 400 new housing units on the local market overnight without needing massive and extremely slow construction projects it would also raise some 33 million dollars annually nearly doubling the cities general funds budget this would allow the city to aggressively purchase the several derelict motels along highway 50 and renovate them into affordable workforce housing given the environmental issues here in the basin it is vastly easier and faster to renovate existing buildings than it is to build new construction david jinkens yes it is a serious problem for our work force and our economy the city can and must address our share of the affordable housing shortage in the south shore county government and our friends in nevada must do the same we can t solve all of their affordable housing they need to help in the city we need to take a hard look at vacant and non environmentally sensitive lands to see if they can support quality work force housing large employers must also contribute to the solution by either providing housing for employees or helping their employees afford housing existing workforce housing in old motels should be preserved and upgraded using federal and state funds and grants and loans and remain available to our workforce city government must also ensure that trpa is working with and supporting our efforts to see that affordable housing is provided nicole ramirez thomas short answer yes there is a lack of affordable housing everywhere and south lake tahoe is not resistant to this strain on locals but there are many things being done about it here creating dignified housing takes time a dedicated funding source for housing is needed to really make headway on this challenge yes there is 100 a lack of affordable housing in south lake tahoe i also know that there is a lot underway to address housing from the city level on october 19th the groundbreaking for sugar pine will occur this was a big lift for city staff and the council to get underway please consider attending this event the primary things that are needed are time and money money above all a funding study is being conducted to determine how to create a steady funding source for housing because that is what is needed to tackle the issue i know that the city is currently exploring every possible avenue for creating housing or helping people find housing it is important to keep in mind that everyone deserves goodhousing not just any housing recently people have commented that hotels should serve as housing things like camps and converted hotels should only be a temporary solution to housing we want dignity in housing also converting hotels for temporary housing takes time and money other measures aside from building new houses are how to use existing housing stock the lease to locals program is one way that the city is trying to get locals into vacant houses or rooms a tax or fee on vacant houses has been discussed but not brought forward people have mixed feelings about this but it is common in other places another possibility is rent control these are some of the ideas and options being explored i have spoken little about housing because we need to look at housing as an economic issue people often forget that housing is closely linked to the economy diversification of our economy and support for the existing economy which is primarily tourism are important to creating economic stability a lack of housing is one element but affordability condition and quality of housing are another building houses or creating places for people to live is one way to diversify economy we should aim to look for stability in both housing and the economy there are many approaches to working toward this goal as with all things but especially with housing good policy that provides dignified living situations is important housing should not be a transitional space it should be a place of security housing security is a major issue as well one might be able to find housing but how long they can stay there is another question moving is incredibly expensive not having housing for workers in south lake tahoe substantially increases the cost of living for people that have to move out off of the mountain not being able to find a house or afford to rent or buy a house near where one lives increases other costs such as gas time for commuting stress getting to work all of these things decrease someone s quality of life we want people to have dignified living situations that foster quality of life we need to keep this in mind when we consider what types of housing we are trying to create and how we implement policies it also costs business money too when they cannot find people to work or people are leaving because of the cost of living or no housing housing is a big issue everywhere right now best practices are currently being done at the city level and more avenues to help with housing are being explored money is the number one challenge so a steady revenue stream is needed joby cefalu one of the greatest challenges we face is affordable and workforce housing from a city perspective we need to look at our area plans and find the right areas within the city to incentivize developers by allowing a greater number of units to be built on specific properties and locations and streamline the planning and development process for both new and existing projects to get them done as quickly as possible while still protecting our environment in real estate the term highest and best use is what drives development until the city can develop streamline planning and development and incentivize developers to build workforce and affordable housing we will continue to see luxury homes and condos rather than our greatest need of housing for our workforce kevin brunner i don t believe in lack of affordable housing i live it as do many of our local residents i think we can use currently available properties and create fast options for housing such as getting developers to renovate and rework empty motels into family housing there are federal and state grants and even partnerships with noon profits we can pursue to buy up abandoned properties and create units there i d also like to see these options fast tracked and at the top of the priority list we need housing yesterday wouldn t it be great if we could partner with someone like habitat for humanity and build energy efficient houses in a couple of months nick speal overwhelmingly yes the fallout from our housing shortage touches every aspect of our community and economy we stopped building housing in the 80s and in recent years the shortage has driven prices through the roof 80 of our homes were built before 1980 while only 1 of them were built in the past decade kids grow up and can t find a place of their own over 5000 people commute for work into the basin the tahoe prosperity center identifies a need for over 3000 new homes on the south shore in the next 5 years there is no one solution to this problem there are many we need to work with the trpa to cut back the red tape that has been holding back new housing we can increase the allowable density near transit so that new residents won t need to drive as much and can waste less heat in modern multifamily buildings the city can partner with state agencies just as we did for sugar pine village to subsidize affordable housing for low income residents and we need to tap into better utilization of the roughly 50 of existing houses that aren t being used as full time homes i m considering a vacancy tax like they have in oakland and vancouver to discourage distant investors from hoarding unused houses and i want to hear from members of the community about what they d like to see to vote for a measure like this chantelle schelliing absolutely there is an affordable housing crisis throughout our nation including our own city people who work in the hospitality and service industries as well as our firefighters simply cannot afford to live in the same city that they work in this is an issue that is currently being addressed by projects like the sugar pine village but we need additional supplemental solutions to lower the cost of living increase diverse housing options and maintain a local workforce as a city council member and as mentioned before i would review current housing projects evaluate trends and data on housing availability and housing need and of course i would survey the community on their concerns and supplemental solutions to address the housing crisis some potential solutions could include short term re establishing first time home buyer programs and creating an easy pipeline for locals to purchase their own homes including partnership with ltcc to develop skills gain more education for higher paying jobs establishing a program for first responders to own their own home in the city they serve and protect and increasing their wages rezoning for diverse housing options including expansion of existing smaller apartment complexes creation of new housing and better regulation of updates to distressed housing exploring a reduction of taxes on locals to offset the high cost of living and enable more savings for housing mid term requiring hospitality and large recreation corporations the ones who benefit most from our workforce to designate part of their living spaces or separate facilities to house local workers repurposing vacant distressed residential houses buildings for low middle income families and multi family housing evaluate and expand eligibility qualifications for sugar pine village residents constructing additional dwelling units adus that could be designated solely for the local workforce construction of adus also helps to satisfy the regional housing needs allocation rhna long term developing a local workforce pipeline program with the community college for students in on campus housing completing of sugar pine village exploring additional federal and state funding for more affordable housing projects cody bass yes housing is a serious crisis in our city i don t believe that we want our local workforce living in old motels that were not designed for permanent living as we may need to have this type of housing for some of the more transient people that need a new start or a place to sleep so they re not left in the cold our local workforce deserves much better we need to partner with developers employers and nonprofits to create ownership opportunities that are affordable our professional skilled workforce must have the opportunity to own as we also must develop affordable rentable housing i have learned of projects that deed restrict brand new housing units but actually allow for the ownership of the home at a very reasonable price we must take this on with multiple solutions all working together we must implement solutions that can create housing in the near term while setting goals for the long term that will have lasting effects for generations to come 5 what do you believe is the most significant environmental threat to the lake tahoe basin and what policies do you believe could be beneficial in counteracting this threat scott robbins in the short term the exploitation of our local environment from relentless over tourism is visible everywhere from the overflowing trash on our beaches and trails to the endless miles of traffic choking our air and roads we should increase the tourism occupancy taxes the tax on hotels and airbnb s this will raise more revenue per tourist while reducing the overall number of visitors and their accompanying environmental impacts the city currently collects and spends some 3 million every year on tourism advertising this money should be diverted for actual local needs including public transit and trash mitigation it is difficult to take our city s talk about leadership on the problem of long term climate change seriously when we simultaneously encourage visor traffic that results in jams that can stretch into sacramento and a serious problem it is we already face summers so hot and dry that caldor level wildfires have become the norm not the exception and we will soon begin to see winters too warm for consistent snow if we do nothing if we cannot demonstrate leadership if we cannot be taken seriously then the children learning to ski in tahoe today will be the parents of the last generation to ski in tahoe and our jewel in the sierras will be lost for future generations of locals it was disappointing then to see the new recreation center will nonetheless receive a significant amount of its heat through the burning of fossil fuels rather than using electric heat pumps in a building that was originally budgeted for 40 million but for which the city recently issued a bond that will with interest cost 84 million this was apparently deemed wasteful spending this is short term thinking about long term infrastructure that will last at least a generation the state of california has recently mandated that all new vehicles sold by the year 2035 will be fully electric we must make real efforts in improving both the reliability and capacity of our electric grid undergrounding utilities and increasing clean and reliable generation capacity to sustain an electrified future these are achievable goals they will require sustained focus and effort but they can be done we can move our public transit towards electrified bus service support electrified school buses along with improved capacity for public charging infrastructure lake tahoe unified school district recently chose to replace several of their old school buses with new diesel buses despite strong local efforts in support of electric options this was another missed opportunity at the local level we can also support local clean generation with a mix of incentives and requirements to install solar generation above our many large open parking lots such systems have the secondary benefit of shielding parked cars from the sun and inclement weather and have become common in new developments as costs decrease and demand for clean generation has increased solar panels are quite warm and can melt and shed snow loads while many of our houses and homes are highly shaded we are all familiar with how hot our parking lots can get in the summer the problem is not too large to solve but there is an enormous amount of work to be done in a thousand little places many small changes can add to a large scale shift in the way we interact with and extract resources from our environment david jinkens catastrophic fire radiation from unprotected and above ground cell towers and pollution from lead and microplastics in our environment and lake the solution is not easy but it must be done make federal and state lands more fire safe we need to start in the city of south lake tahoe place cell facilities underground as they were originally intended to be and not allow major pollution of deteriorating plastic limbs on cell tower monopines from polluting our environment we can do all these things if we have the political will to do so trpa must be motivated to see that our basin is free of all pollutants and not cave to powerful and wealthy special interests nicole ramirez thomas short answer i think the biggest environmental threat to the lake tahoe basin is drought extreme drought is crippling the basin it contributes to fires algae blooms bark beetle and much more it also contributes to a decrease in clarity of the lake it is part of the climate change cycle and drought has been present in the western united states for a long time now i think that policy wise there needs to be some water policies created that help with conservation of this precious resource some things such as not watering lawns have been mandated but there are other things to explore educating people on water usage is important things as small as restaurants only serving water by request and restricting the types of vegetation that can be planted are among water mitigation measures other cities have implemented that make an impact there are many options to look at in the vein of water conservation in the basin joby cefalu i believe at this current juncture storm drainage is one of our greatest threats to big blue currently like in the movie finding nemo all drainage leads to the lake this is a big one as the cost and sustainability are challenging but filtration in drains and diversion to the sewer system are critical to our delicate ecosystem we have had some great projects in the past that have helped but unlike bmp s this would eliminate and control the largest pollution source as well leading the way in reducing our carbon footprint through available sources that are already at a point of technology that work tahoe should lead the world but putting in place regulations based upon desire rather than practical and sustainable technology does nothing we are close on many concepts but once again lake tahoe is a unique area of which has drastic swings from summer to winter weather so placing unsustainable restrictions will only hurt our working class and multi cultural population negatively and drive more locals away with unrealistic constraints kevin brunner as much as drought and fire will continue to be a serious challenge in the future i think our biggest threat is unsustainable tourism the number of visitors has exploded in recent years especially day trippers who come here to get away from the heat in the valleys we need to do more to educate and encourage our visitors to be more mindful of our ecosystems and wildlife things like the ban on single use plastic bottles is a good step but we need more psa s are fine but how do we motivate people to pick up their trash and slow down for wildlife i think we can have conversations with other agencies and look at whether we can expand ticketing for litter offenses while also making more trash cans available and emptying them more often changing human behavior isn t easy but we have to take a stand and protect this place we love nick speal lake tahoe is the jewel of the sierra and we have a duty to protect our beautiful and unique environment from pollution of all sorts as an economy that benefits from tourism we need to protect the lake from visitors short term local impacts especially trash and micro plastics i support bans on plastic water bottles and grocery bags and styrofoam that splinters into pieces and ends up in the lake but the biggest threat is climate change and it affects us right here at home last year we saw the snowiest december ever followed by the longest dry spell on record if we don t cut our emissions in time these extremes are only going to get worse this is why sustainability is at the core of my platform i m proud of the city s pledge to transition to 100 renewable electricity by 2030 and now the next city council will be the ones in charge of the implementation to actually get us there i ll expand our sustainability department to leverage external grants and collaborate with utility companies we need major investment in clean energy generation and storage in order to eliminate fossil fuels 24 hours a day we need electrical capacity upgrades and local redundancy for reliability through increasingly intense and frequent natural disasters i ll support homeowners to upgrade insulation dramatically reducing winter energy bills and we can lead by example with city facilities chantelle schelliing it is hard to determine whether wildfires or pollution air and litter are the most significant environmental threat to the lake tahoe basin i believe i answered for both in my previous responses however i would add on by noting the need to install more waste receptacles proportionate to foot traffic and incentivize the hospitality industry to play active roles to reduce their carbon and waste footprint cody bass i believe climate change is the largest threat to the planet on the local level i believe the number of vehicles entering and leaving the basin is our largest local threat we must begin planning transportation projects that will bring people to lake tahoe without a vehicle to do that we must have reliable transit when they arrive in most high alpine environments across the world that have tourism as we do passenger rail is generally the preferred travel for tourists as many of them live in the flat land and really should not be driving in the mountains i have asked why a rail project using the existing pavement of spooner summit is not in our 25 year transportation plan i even voted no on approving the plan because i believe we must be planning for the future and vehicles will only increase if we don t make a plan as high speed rail will be upgraded between san francisco and reno bringing the trip to around 2 hours we need to begin planning for a high speed rail between reno and carson and eventually a line up spooner that would get folks from the bay area and sacramento to tahoe faster by rail than car this can happen in our lifetime but the planning must start now

financially times are tough for many but that hasn t stopped well heeled gamers from rushing out to buy nvidia s rtx 4090 in fact their popularity has led to a global shortage and we re all too familiar with those newegg in the usa overclockers in the uk and mwave in australia show one single model in stock between them at the time of writing you d think at 1 599 1 699 au 2 959 nvidia would be rushing to make as many ad102 gpus as it can can to meet demand but that might not be the case as a new rumor suggests that nvidia is reallocating its tsmc capacity over to much higher margin h100 hopper enterprise gpus the report comes from mydrivers via tom s hardware the rtx 4090 is a high margin product at 1 499 but compared to hopper products the profit nvidia makes for a single 4090 is a relative pittance a fully enabled h100 gpu with 80gb of hbm3 sells for tens of thousands and if tech companies wants to build exascale supercomputers with h100s nvidia will be happy to accommodate them as nvidia s ada lovelace and hopper series both make use of tsmc s 4n node it s relatively easy for tsmc to switch production from one gpu to another although the h100 s packaging is a lot more complex next are the pending restrictions on china s access to advanced computing technologies big tech in china including the likes of alibaba and baidu have an insatiable appetite for high performance computing products and nvidia has reportedly ordered super hot runs of its most lucrative chips before the final implementation of the ban what does this mean for us it means finding an rtx 4090 might be difficult in the short term the 4090 is a low volume product as is hopper at least compared to the ad103 and ad104 based rtx 4080 16gb and rtx 4080 12gb sorry rtx 4070 production of those chips will be taking up a big chunk of nvidia s wafer starts when they launch they ll be in higher demand than the 4090 and nvidia will be wanting to have stocks to satisfy global demand into the peak christmas buying season so if you re after a 4090 you might want to get a pre order in i can t imagine we ll be facing anything like the scarcity and price gouging induced by mining demand at its peak but if nvidia has to choose between making 10 000 4090s or 10 000 h100s it can sell at 10x the price or more the choice is a logical and understandable one even if its not great for us

cbn goes tough on inflation recalcitrant debtors to save economy the central bank of nigeria cbn has adopted an aggressive two pronged attack on inflation by increasing both the interest rate the cash reserve ratio for banks as if that is not enough the cbn has gone after state governments businesses and individuals owing it in order to mop up liquidity in the system assistant editor nduka chiejina reports on the cbn s latest move to tame inflation for many keen watchers in the country s volatile economic firmament it was not unexpected that the central bank of nigeria cbn increased interest rate at its 287th monetary policy committee mpc meeting of september 2022 what was shocking however was the aggressiveness deployed by the cbn in increasing the rate for almost two years between may and september 2022 the cbn raised the monetary policy rate mpr three times from to 13 0 per cent to 14 0 per cent and now 15 5 per cent all with a view to rein in inflation addressing the press at the end of the meeting cbn governor godwin emefiele said the focus of the mpc was on the aggressive acceleration of inflation globally and how this had begun to retard growth in both advanced and emerging market economies and global economy was progressively weakening due to the various headwinds confronting the recovery in nigeria he said output growth had been sustained as a result of the combination of development finance interventions by the cbn and fiscal stimulus by the federal government noting that in the last three years the cbn has injected over n9 trillion into the economy in addition to offering two year moratorium for 10 year long term loan facilities what this means is that both fiscal and monetary authorities have jointly pumped n9 trillion into the economy to sustain growth emefiele believes that these interventions have significantly helped engendered growth not to be undone however inflation persisted rising to 20 52 per cent in august this development has forced the mpc to mandate the cbn to maintain a close watch on the inflationary implications of the interventions in other words the mpc suspected that the n9 trillion pumped into the system to address the effects of covid 19 and other economic headwinds may be pushing inflation to undesirable levels another reason for the interest rate hike was the need to hold on to and attract foreign investment according to emefiele the mpc noted the moderate downturn in the equities market attributing it to a continued outflow of portfolio capital as investors re assigned their portfolios to more attractive us dollar denominated fixed income securities the committee however called on the federal government to continue to improve the ease of doing business in nigeria to retain the current patronage of foreign investors through sustained investor confidence in the nigerian economy most importantly the mpc was concerned that within a four month period inflation had accelerated aggressively by 280 basis point from 17 71 per cent in may 2022 to 20 52 per cent in august 2022 the committee was thus of the view that given the primacy of its price and monetary stability mandate it was expedient that significant focus must be given to taming inflation given these reasons the mpc was of the view that holding on to the old rate or loosening it by reducing the rate were options not to be considered according emefiele this is because a loosening will further widen the negative real interest rate gap and worsen the financial market conditions as savings mobilisation and investment inflows would decline further the mpc was also of the view that with the aggressive policy normalisation in advanced economies loosening the stance of policy would result in a sharp depreciation of exchange rate leading to further hike in capital outflows however to pursue a hold decision would mean a continuous deterioration in real earnings of fixed income earners and the livelihood of middle and low income households as a result the mpc noted that a tight policy stance increasing rate would help consolidate the impact of the last two policy rate hikes which is already reflecting in the slowing growth rate of money supply in the economy the mpc also felt that an aggressive rate hike would slow capital outflows and likely attract capital emefiele said what next after the hike and effect of interest rate hike on banks by increasing interest rate to 15 5 per cent the minimum interest rate on borrowing that lending institutions can charge will go up to 15 5 per cent from 14 per cent and the minimum that banks will keep as liquidity is 32 5 per cent of their total deposits speaking on the development emefiele argued that as long as we see inflation going upward mpc cannot give any assurance that we will not continue to raise rates because we have seen rates move up very aggressively the mpc also needed to move in aggressively to rein in inflation i cannot assure that we will not raise rate as long as inflation continues to trend upward the easiest way to tame inflationary pressure is to raise interest rate this is the right way to go you have to try as much as possible to raise your rates to a level that is equal or higher than inflation however he lamented that with inflation rate higher than interest rate what nigeria is currently grappling with is a case of negative interest rate which in itself is a disincentive to investment it is therefore imperative that you must raise rate to rein in inflation the cbn governor admitted that the latest interest rate hike might retard growth and make the cost of borrowing more expensive it is important you know that the level of rate is what will help you to slow down the rate of inflation you raise rate or not what will happen is that consumption and investment will be affected because purchasing power of the consumer will derail or completely dissipate you don t have a choice but to raise rates this is the best option at this time we believe it will rein in inflation he said adding his voice to the increase in interest rate cbn s director of banking supervision mr haruna mustapha said we should be very optimistic in terms of the forecast for interest rate we talk about effective interest and if there is a lag whether we continue to raise those rates to keep pace with inflation well that is up in the air for now we are very optimistic that some of the measures that have been taken will yield desired outcomes whether it will get to 40 per cent is very speculative at this point in time but for now what i think we should focus on is to see how we bring inflation down and achieve our policy objectives mustapha added that in terms of impact on bank loans and incomes clearly you have an impact but it is going to be a bitter sweet experience and this is what is going to happen firstly by the rate hike banks will expectedly reprice their loans so you expect to see interest rate on bank loans go up because that is their traditional function they would expect some impact on their bottom line secondly customers will be at the other end they will take the heat but again customers of banks will have their loans even though at a higher cost but at least it is not going to be too significant that it will really impact their own bottom line as well but ultimately what we are a expecting to see like i said is to bring the inflation down and the banking system is a veritable channel for the transmission of monetary policy as a result of the current rate hike banks will get more income in terms of interest income and indeed based on the numbers that we have shared interest income have continued to go up for understandable reasons and this will have a positive impact on banks bottom line interest on government securities and so on will go up which will also add to bank s non interest income which is also another important income line in a nutshell mustapha insists that there will be an impact on the banking system like increase in bank s interest income increase in non interest income especially other arears that banks get their money from and there will be impact on bank debtors because banks will raise their interest on loans and that will also add to the cost of borrowing however there are other complimentary measures that would moderate the negative or adverse impact on bank customers but the bottom line is we see this as a very important and inevitable decision that will help us to achieve our policy goals which is to rein in inflation with regards to the 32 5 percent minimum cash reserve ratio decision of the mpc emefiele said that what it means is that we expect that all the banks in nigeria must fund their accounts by thursday in 48 hours because we will debit them for crr we will take their crr to a minimum of 32 5 percent which means we are going to take liquidity out of their vaults by thursday if any bank fails to meet up with this expectation the decision of the mpc is that we may need to preclude those banks from foreign exchange market on friday and onward until they meet this 32 5 per cent read also borrowing funds for development not a crime says cbn as earlier pointed out the mpc had expressed concerns over the apex bank s n9 trillion intervention to boost the economy two episodes of recession covid 19 and global economic downturn have battered the nigerian economy leaving the cbn with little or no choice than to bailout the economy it is now time to apply the brakes on most of the development finance interventions in order to tackle inflation in this regard cbn s director of development finance mr yusuf philip yila disclosed that the cbn will now aggressively pursue beneficiaries of its interventions whose facilities have fallen due already n3 7 trillion of the n9 trillion has so far been recovered while over n5 trillion are still under moratorium especially in manufacturing the manufacturing sector is holding about 31 per cent of the cbn s loan portfolio overtaking agriculture most of the loans extended to the manufacturing sector are not mature for recovery or repayment because lending to manufacturing takes a long time to mature you have to order the equipment put it in place assemble them it takes a long time in the last two to three years that we ve lent out quite a significant sum to manufacturing you will begin to see the net effect of all those investment in a few months time this was yila s explanation for the delay in recovering some facilities given to some beneficiaries of the cbn intervention yila assured that most of the interventions are quite securitised around the msmes and then the anchor borrowers programme while the best performing interventions is the commercial agric credit scheme of which we lent around n800 billion for recalcitrant debtors especially those under the anchor borrowers programme abp for which n1 trillion has been released and about n400 billion recovered even from smallholder farmers every single person who is taking that small holder farmer loan is going to pay we have their bvn in fact we have started what you call the global standing instruction gsi we will continue to probe the account in the bank that they lent through the reason for this aggressive drive to recover due facilities is part of the cbn s efforts to mop up liquidity in the system and check inflation yila also disclosed that those the cbn is targeting are state governments that accessed credit facilities from cbn development finance interventions defaulting state governments will be debited every month for six months directly from the faac account to liquidate their debt according to yila we ve started recovering loans from state governments we have been doing a loan workout programme with them and we are debiting their monthly federation account allocation committee faac accruals directly for the loans yila stated that if a state government has taken n1 billion and is already in default over a six month period we are going to be debiting them n150 million every month so we ve started that programme every single loan that has been given out through any of our intervention programmes must be paid back there is absolutely no mercy we have started we are in recovery mode at the development finance department we have begun to recover the loans he said message for the banks it is not all rosy for the banks too the cash reserve ratio crr which is maximum amount of liquidity a commercial bank can hold in relation to its deposits has been increased to 32 5 per cent the cbn expects that all the banks in nigeria must fund their accounts 48 hours after the decision was made because we will debit them for crr we will take their crr to a minimum of 32 5 per cent which means we are going to take liquidity out of their vaults if any bank fails to meet up with this expectation the decision of the mpc is that we may need to preclude those banks from foreign exchange market until they meet this 32 5 per cent emefiele said this message he said is meant to underscore the fact that this very aggressive decision to rein in inflation must yield result we do not want to face nigerians in the next few months and begin to take the blame for not being able to rein in inflation in spite of all the rates we have raised so we have decided to adopt a two pronged approach increase mpr and crr going up because we must mop liquidity effectively out of the vaults of the banks in his analysis mr gbolade idakolo managing director ceo sd d capital management limited said the increase of the crr by the cbn from 27 5 per cent to 32 5 per cent is a move directed at the curbing inflation that has not abated for over four months under normal circumstances these measures are expected to tame inflation however there are concerns about its effects on the overall economy the banks whom this measure is targeted will pass the cost to their customers which will see instant increases in interest rate for both existing and new loan request companies that use bank loans to carry out their activities will definitely pass the extra cost to their customers as well as the consumers of goods and services this will likely result into spending more to buy less the effect of this new policy could also affect foreign exchange sourcing which is in short supply the measure could lead to further devaluation of the naira if there is limited supply of fx to intervene by the cbn and the 2023 election circle has started and politicians will put pressure on the availability of fx because that is what they typically use for their campaigns prof uche uwaleke on his part believes that the decision by the mpc to further tighten monetary policy is justified by the need to tame inflationary and forex pressures and possibly stem capital outflows on account of the hike in policy rates in developed economies especially in the united states and united kingdom the primary mandate of the cbn is to maintain price stability but it has grave implications for cost of capital for firms cost of borrowing by the government stock market performance and output growth in general it may also affect the asset quality of banks as they reprice their loans in response to the hike in mpr

the logic of such a rally is pretty simple investor sentiment is low positioning is light that is investors are underweight equities in a way not seen since the global financial crisis and the bad news has largely been priced in including a 0 75 percentage point rate increase from the us federal reserve in november and a mild recession so any bit of good news particularly hints that the fed may be about to slow the pace of rate rises or company earnings holding up should give stocks a nice nudge the narrative gained steam late last week on both counts factset data shows that while we are early in the us september quarter profit season just 20 per cent of companies have reported actual earnings per share have come in above forecasts 72 per cent of the time that s below the long term average beat rate of 77 per cent but the latest numbers hardly indicate an earnings recession more importantly the fed also seems to be tilting towards caution with a slew of speakers late last week suggesting the pace of rate rises will eventually slow albeit fed officials want definitive proof inflation is falling and with that markets rose with wall street s benchmark s p 500 index up 2 4 per cent on friday night and the asx 200 up 1 7 per cent on monday advertisement investor positioning suggests the momentum could continue for a while the release in the us on friday of the latest national association of active investment managers exposure index showed a sharp tilt to stock purchases in the past two weeks while bank of america reported us9 2 billion 14 5 billion of inflows into global equities last week options trading in the us also suggests investors are getting less bearish with bloomberg reporting the relative cost of contracts that pay off if the s p 500 falls another 10 per cent has collapsed to the lowest since 2017 but are the grinches right what s particularly fascinating is how the santa rally narrative has gone from hopeful to consensus over the course of a few weeks grinch like investors with a bearish view should take note a sense of fomo could develop here particularly among institutional investors who would be loath to miss out on a year end rally that would make their 2022 performance numbers look a bit less bad but this santa rally should be treated with some scepticism and not just because everyone suddenly believes in it advertisement to this columnist hopes about a fed pause of slowdown and earnings resilience seem contradictory the fed will only pivot once it s sure the economy is slowing and resilient earnings say the opposite the focus on the fed is not misplaced the central bank clearly decides where markets go next but it s hard to name a piece of data from the real economy that says the fed or the reserve bank of australia for that matter should change its trajectory and pivot or pause when core inflation is still rising consumer spending is running hot wages are rising and corporate profit margins haven t started rolling over from near record levels santa may well come for investors this year but how long any festive season joy lasts is another question entirely
summers warns on deficit doom loop risk oil price spike that would be a real mistake to conclude that other countries wouldn t end up confronting similar challenges summers told bloomberg television s wall street week with david westin the first lesson from the uk is that things can change extraordinarily fast governments need to pay increasing attention to their budgets with mounting deficits alongside surging borrowing costs having the potential for shaking confidence he said in the us student loan forgiveness emergency funding for hurricane ian and rising defense spending needs suggest that fiscal debates will need to be back on the table he said if your deficit projection starts to get out of control and your real interest rates start to rise rapidly you can get into a kind of doom loop said summers a harvard university professor and paid contributor to bloomberg television we re going to need to be watching our own fiscal projections in the united states very carefully outgoing uk prime minister liz truss abandoned a program of unfunded tax cuts after its unveiling prompted a destabilizing selloff in uk government bonds yellen on friday recognized the importance of having a credible fiscal policy and to make sure the debt is sustainable over time and argued that our budgets have done that she hailed fresh data showing an historic drop in the deficit yellen s take i do see our debt as being on a responsible path yellen said in answering questions from reporters summers said that a further risk stemming from government debt markets is the concern with deteriorating trading conditions he endorsed treasury secretary janet yellen s recent expression of concern over a loss of adequate liquidity in us treasuries read more yellen worries over loss of adequate liquidity in treasuries while rising borrowing costs are escalating the risks summers cautioned that it would be unwise for the federal reserve to be dissuaded from continuing with its plans for aggressive interest rate hikes failing to follow through would mean stagflation with high inflation making an economic downturn all the worse inflation is at risk of getting fresh impetus from a spike in oil prices the former treasury chief also said he worried over us confrontation with what he described as a russian saudi axis the biden administration has blasted saudi arabia s recent push to reduce oil production while it s also pursuing an oil price cap on russian crude this is going to be a very complex time and i hope that we get through it while avoiding oil price spikes he said but my guess is that that s going to happen he added downside wildcard a renewed spike in oil is a major downside wildcard from here both with respect to inflation and with respect to recession once the us does enter a recession washington will need to be careful with regard to deploying any fiscal support package summers also said given the danger of a negative response in the bond market it s one consequence of having rapidly run up government borrowing in recent years he said unfortunately i think we fired the fiscal cannon so strongly that there s going to be limited room for discretionary fiscal policy if we have another recession he said with assistance by christopher condon bloomberg

menafn afp the european central bank is expected to set aside recession worries and deliver another jumbo interest rate hike this week to cool inflation as russia s war on ukraine sends energy prices soaring inflation in the 19 nation eurozone climbed to an all time high of nearly 10 percent in september five times the ecb s target of two percent the ecb s governing council last month raised its key interest rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points and many observers expect it to repeat the move at thursday s meeting households and businesses are bracing for a grim winter as russia continues to squeeze gas supplies to europe raising fears of energy shortages and eye wateringly high electricity and heating bills the war has also pushed up food costs while pandemic era supply chain snarls combined with higher manufacturing costs have added to price pressures on a range of goods those who thought inflation was dead now know better said joachim nagel the head of germany s bundesbank central bank now the beast has woken up from its slumber it s up to monetary policymakers to tame it again he recently told students at harvard university like other central banks the ecb is using a series of rate hikes to bring inflation under control at the risk of slowing economic activity to such an extent that it triggers a downturn the 75 basis point rate hike looks like a done deal said ing economist carsten brzeski the ecb has turned a blind eye on recession risks he added analysts from capital economics said they saw the ecb going even bigger predicting a 100 basis point jump followed by smaller hikes over the coming months not painless in the united states where inflation is running at a 40 year high the federal reserve recently said there was no painless way to combat runaway prices a slowdown of economic growth and the us job market will be required to bring down inflation said the fed which has hiked rates faster and more aggressively than the ecb ecb president christine lagarde has warned that the euro area was also facing a significant slowdown if russia completely cuts off gas flows to europe the eurozone economy could shrink by nearly one percent in 2023 ecb vice president luis de guindos added it s a scenario that has become more likely after russia in late august halted gas flows through the crucial nord stream 1 pipeline to europe s biggest economy germany government spending the german economy whose energy hungry industries relied heavily on russian gas before the war is now forecast to shrink by 0 4 percent in 2023 chancellor olaf scholz has unveiled a 200 billion euro 197 billion energy fund to help citizens cope with price shocks irking european neighbours who can t afford the same fiscal largesse with other eurozone countries such as france and spain also rolling out support measures the ecb has warned governments not to fall into the trap of spending so much that they boost inflation germany s hawkish finance minister christian lindner agreed saying last week that fiscal policy must not counter the measures of central banks by strengthening demand the ecb is also expected to use this week s meeting to discuss bringing other monetary policy levers in line with its inflation busting efforts policymakers are likely to consider changes to the super cheap long term loans tltros offered to banks in recent years to help the eurozone through several crises sometimes at negative rates as a consequence of the ecb s rapid rate hikes since july lenders can now make a profit by parking their excess tltro cash at the central bank and pocketing the new higher deposit rate leaving the ecb looking for ways to incentivise early repayment of the loans the ecb may also ponder how best to shrink its multi trillion euro balance sheet after years of hoovering up government and corporate bonds to drive up stubbornly low inflation but given the uncertain outlook and the risk of rattling financial markets analysts say the start of any quantitative tightening is some way off

menafn afp most asian markets rose monday after a surge on wall street fuelled by hopes the federal reserve could begin to slow its pace of interest rate hikes however the bright start to the week was overshadowed by a plunge in hong kong and shanghai after xi jinping was handed a third term as leader and put in place a team who back his economically damaging zero covid strategy the yen fluctuated against the dollar as speculation swirled that japanese authorities had stepped into forex markets again to support their currency for a second time in as many sessions tokyo sydney seoul and taipei led gains after a strong performance in new york that was sparked by a report the fed could begin to take its foot off the pedal in its rate hike campaign the wall street journal article said some officials were keen to discuss a slowdown when they meet next month markets have been hammered this year by fears that moves by the fed and other central banks to fight decades high inflation will spark a recession officials had been expected to lift rates 75 basis points for a fourth successive time next month while bets were increasing on another such move in december the mere suggestion of the fed stepping down from 75 basis points to a 50 basis point incremental rate hike in december produced a fierce rally in us equities partial reversal of the recent surge in us treasury yields and smart about turn in the us dollar said national australia bank s ray attrill however while most equity markets across the region were well up chinese markets were being hammered by the reshuffle at the top of government hong kong shed more than four percent and shanghai almost one percent zero covid worries xi who was at the weekend given a third five year term as leader handed key positions to loyalists who back his strategy of fighting covid outbreaks with lockdowns and other strict measures the policy has been blamed for the sharp drop in growth in the world s number two economy and while data showed monday that it expanded more than forecast in the third quarter traders remain on edge on currency markets the yen was hovering around 149 to the dollar having strengthened to 145 65 earlier amid talk that authorities had intervened to support the unit for a second time in as many sessions observers said officials likely stepped in on friday after the dollar soared to a fresh 32 year high of 151 93 yen that came after warnings from the finance ministry that it was keeping tabs on movements and follows a similar move last month whilst the finance ministry has since declined to comment on whether they intervened such action has not come without multiple warnings from officials said matt simpson at city index the mof last week said they will deal with speculators severely and the strong price reaction on friday suggests they did just that price action has also been erratic in monday s asian session which points to another probable intervention the pound rose after former uk prime minister boris johnson said he would not stand for the conservative leadership again after the resignation of liz truss last week his decision leaves his former finance minister rishi sunak the favourite to take the reins and become the country s third premier this year the choice of the less controversial sunak could provide a little stability in westminster after weeks of turmoil sparked by truss s debt fuelled mini budget that hammered the pound and sent shivers through markets key figures around 0230 gmt tokyo nikkei 225 up 1 0 percent at 27 156 95 break hong kong hang seng index down 4 4 percent at 15 497 13 shanghai composite down 0 9 percent at 3 010 37 pound dollar up at 1 1318 from 1 1258 on friday dollar yen up at 148 92 yen from 147 65 yen euro dollar down at 0 9840 from 0 9863 euro pound down at 86 93 pence from 87 26 pence west texas intermediate flat at 85 05 per barrel brent north sea crude flat at 93 47 per barrel new york dow up 2 5 percent at 31 082 56 close london ftse 100 up 0 4 percent at 6 969 73 close
markets may be turning i m writing the td notes on sunday afternoon this week i left my desk last thursday morning flew to calgary to attend joseph schachter s fantastic annual energy conference more on that below and got home sunday afternoon the notes will have to be shorter this week i ll comment on several different charts but my main message is that i think the markets made a turn this week that could have legs currencies the fed s relentless determination to bring down inflation by raising short term interest rates and by shrinking its balance sheet now down 200b since april has probably been the key consideration across markets for the past several months stock markets have been trending lower while the us dollar and interest rates have soared markets have been hunting for peak fed for several months without success last week in the on my radar section i wondered if the soaring us dollar might be the dark horse that would set off a chain of events something breaks because of the super strong usd leading to a fed pause or pivot since the january 6 2021 inflection point i ve generally been bullish on the usd but recently i ve been anticipating an end to the rally the us dollar index hit a 20 year high in late september and has turned lower friday s price action created a daily and weekly key reversal it looks toppy the japanese yen fell 33 from last year s highs to friday s lows it hit a 32 year low early friday before intervention caused a spike higher the intervention happened during the north american day session i don t know if the intervention was solely from the japanese or if other countries also participated but the intervention caused a significant spike in the yen and kicked off the friday rally in other currencies gold and the stock market given the recent news from the united kingdom people who don t trade currencies might imagine that the british pound was hitting record lows but the gbp hit 37 year lows last month and then bounced back 10 the swiss franc has weakened against the euro for the past four weeks after hitting an all time high against the euro in september the swiss national bank has been drawing down billions of usd from the fed s currency swap line facility are there banking problems in switzerland the canadian dollar fell more than five cents in five weeks beginning in mid september as the looney moved in virtual lock step with the weakness in the american stock indices still the cad registered a daily key reversal higher on friday closing at its best level since october 5 the market is expecting the boc to raise interest rates by at least 50bps on wednesday october 26 credit the 10 year treasury yield hit a new 15 year high of 4 3 early friday morning before the japanese yen intervention and before nick timiraos comments in the wsj and comments from the fed s mary daly caused traders to think that the fed may be contemplating a slowdown in the pace of their interest rate increases as early as the december 13 14 fomc meeting the 10 year hit an all time low yield of 0 50 in august 2020 and was as low as 2 5 in early august prices on the 10 year futures contract have closed lower for 11 of the past 12 weeks equity indices the leading american stock indices hit their lowest levels in nearly two years on october 13 following the stronger than expected cpi report still they have rallied since then in a very volatile fashion with the dow futures closing friday up 2 500 points from the october 13 lows metals gold hit a 30 month low early friday morning but surged 40 higher as the usd tumbled copper rallied nearly 20 cents on thursday friday energy wti futures were within two dollars of making a new low for the year on september 26 the day the nordstream pipelines damage was discovered but instead wti began to rally on the anticipation and subsequently the reality of opec announcing cuts to production quotes at their october 5 meeting the two week rally saw prices rise 17 but then prices fell 11 over the next seven trading days crude oil prices are volatile natural gas volatility makes crude oil look tranquil these are huge price swings my short term trading i ve been buying the stock index futures for the past two weeks looking for a short term bounce i ve been trading small sizes and using tight stops this past week i gave back most of the profits i made the previous week when the market rallied off the october 13 lows i was stopped for a slight loss on thursday when flying to calgary and i missed the big friday rally i was flat at the end of the week on my radar as i mentioned at the top of this blog i think the financial markets stocks interest rates and especially currencies may be turning and i ll look for trades that fit with that idea the barney report barney had his first ever stay at a lovely dog kennel this weekend my wife had a girls weekend in tofino while i was in calgary i picked him up sunday around noon and he was happy to see me the ladies who run the kennel told me that barney had a great time playing with the other dogs when we got home i took him for a one hour walk a chance for me to relax after four days in calgary and for barney to chill after being in a kennel with two dozen other dogs he had his own room but it was a noisy hotel when we got home after the walk he stretched out on the hall carpet and fell asleep the josef schachter energy conference in calgary the conference was a massive success in that it was sold out with a long waiting list and attendees were treated to genuinely dynamic presentations from about thirty different energy companies i was very impressed with the quality of the corporate presentations and the sophistication of the questions from the audience i was also blown away by the technological innovations used by today s energy companies i m glad i went and i look forward to returning next year listen to victor talk about markets i ve had a regular

the rappi union in colombia already enjoys union immunity what benefits can you achieve it is one of the challenges that president gustavo petro will have photo reuters latinamerican post luisa fernanda sánchez escucha este artículo your browser does not support the audio tag four years ago the union of platform workers unidapp was born in colombia it is the first digital function union in the country for the domiciliaries of the rappi delivery application who seek among other things to obtain decent working conditions in the public space and demand rights guarantees from the platform through a statement to public opinion the union assured that unidapp was born from the nonconformity of thousands of platform workers who are precarious unfairly blocked from applications and discarded today with their trade union immunity already established and backed by the central unitaria de trabajadores cut the rappitenderos seek to create more opportunities for productive work that produces a decent income with medical coverage and social protection as well as unidapp trade unions such as the front of digital platform workers in ecuador frenapp the platform personnel association of argentina app and the national union of application and distribution workers of mexico unta have the same mission to be recognized as workers and not as collaborators self employed or independent workers what do the digital platforms say in colombia and in the world digital platforms have argued that they only fulfill their role as intermediaries between an offer that is the services of the delivery person or driver and a demand in this case the user in which the provider of the services autonomously manages its schedule and work times although these applications have defended their operating model fedesarrollo assures in its most recent study that colombia is lagging behind in the labor development goals for 2030 due to growing unemployment and informality the model of unions in latin american countries and the world union models for digital platform workers in european countries do not operate in the same way as in latin america an example of them is the home delivery union movement in spain called united distributors which emerged in 2021 when the discussion about the so called riders law was just beginning adopted by that country in may of that same year the objective of the measure is the defense improvement and projection of the collaborative model of autonomous work proposing improvements that come from the delivery people themselves and wanting to make social dialogue effective in other words this reform of the labor code immediately grants the formalization and status of salaried employees to home delivery people from platforms such as deliveroo ubereats and glovo the questions did not wait members of deliverers united raised their voices in protest and stated that with this law they can lose their autonomy decrease their income and harm those who are in an irregular administrative situation without a residence permit or asylum seekers although the riders law is still in force the union organization has mobilized on several occasions so that delivery men on digital platforms are recognized as independent workers recently the labor inspectorate imposed a fine of 78 9 million euros on the home delivery company glovo for having more than 10 000 workers as false self employed in barcelona and valencia in other words the platform decided to continue operating with external collaborators without having formalized them in other parts of the world the situation is far from different in 2021 california held a plebiscite where it was defined that the drivers and delivery men of a well known application would be considered self employed contractors after a lobbying campaign by the companies something similar happened in great britain where the supreme court ruled that the employees of a distribution application could not be considered self employed and are currently in a transition process to adapt to the regulations however in countries like peru bolivia and venezuela the delivery platforms have not given their approval to reach an agreement with the delivery men and colombia is no exception many of the workers question the obstacles in the process of formalizing them while others demand guarantees of sufficient safe and healthy spaces for workers in this sector unidapp assures that the situation of the delivery men is one of absolute job insecurity and that no progress will be made as long as the delivery companies do not recognize the task of home delivery as work for now it is expected that in the coming weeks several proposals will be presented to president gustavo petro and the ministry of labor to seek solutions that help make the formalization of digital platform workers a reality in colombia

ncdc confirms 10 745 cases 256 deaths in 31 states reports 42 increase in september cases compared with august unicef more than 1 5 million children at risk nigeria at extreme high risk of climate change impacts ranks second out of 163 countries who forced to ration vaccine as cholera cases surge worldwide flooding terrorism related activities civil unrest lack of proper environmental sanitation others blamed for increase there are concerns that more nigerians are going to get infected and many more may die from nationwide cholera outbreak fuelled by flooding terrorism related activities civil unrest lack of proper environmental sanitation as well as shortage of vaccines this is as united nations children s fund unicef at the weekend raised the alarm that more than 2 5 million people in nigeria are in need of humanitarian assistance 60 per cent of whom are children and are at increased risk of waterborne diseases drowning and malnutrition due to the most severe flooding in the past decade the floods which have affected 34 out of 36 states in the country have displaced 1 3 million people over 600 people have lost their lives and over 200 000 houses have either been partially or fully damaged cases of diarrhoea and water borne diseases respiratory infection and skin diseases have already been on the rise in the northeastern states of borno adamawa and yobe alone a total of 7 485 cases of cholera and 319 associated deaths were reported as of october 12 unicef representative in nigeria cristian munduate said children and adolescents in flood affected areas are in an extremely vulnerable situation they are particularly at risk of waterborne diseases and emotional and psychological distress unicef is working closely with government and other partners to provide life saving assistance to those who are most in need according to unicef s children s climate risk index ccri nigeria is considered at extremely high risk of the impacts of climate change ranking second out of 163 countries children in extremely high risk countries face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks combined with high levels of underlying child vulnerability due to inadequate essential services such as water and sanitation healthcare and education also raising the alarm bell is the international rescue committee irc which said at the weekend that it is already scaling up its response as well as sanitation hygiene and health programmes to stop the spread of cholera and save lives nigeria country director at irc babatunde anthony ojei said nigeria has not seen flooding like this in more than a decade at least 13 states are experiencing a deadly cholera outbreak with more than 6 000 cases and a four five per cent case fatality ratio the irc needs more resources to scale up our health work to treat cholera patients and our water and sanitation programming to help us stop the spread having contributed less than one percent of the world s global emissions yet ranked in the bottom 20 per cent of countries equipped to respond to the impacts of climate change nigeria is increasingly bearing the brunt of a crisis it did not cause more than one million children in the northeast are expected to suffer from acute food insecurity this year making them more susceptible to succumbing to diseases like cholera the world especially countries contributing the most to climate change must step up and help countries suffering its consequences with more rains expected over the coming months irc called for better coordination between nigeria and cameroon on excess water releases and appropriate mitigation plans for communities that are in the line of impact if nothing is done more children and women may die from preventable diseases the international community must step up to support those in need of life saving care in nigeria he added already the united states has donated 1 million through the united states agency for humanitarian development usaid while signposting adamawa yobe and borno states as epicentres of cholera outbreak the u s said that the warning followed the outbreak of the disease in august and september where at least 7 750 cases were recorded a statement by the embassy in abuja also expressed concern that the current flooding disaster may worsen the situation also expressing fears about outbreak of cholera and other infectious diseases is chioma ezenyimulu head of anambra state primary healthcare development agency who said flood has ravaged seven of the 21 councils of the state latest figures from the nigeria centre for disease control ncdc suggest that a total of 10 745 suspected cases including 256 deaths with case fatality ratio of 2 4 per cent have been reported from 31 states in 2022 according to cholera situation report monthly epidemiological report 8 published by ncdc the 31 states are abia adamawa akwa ibom anambra bauchi bayelsa benue borno cross river delta ekiti gombe imo jigawa kaduna kano katsina kebbi kwara lagos nasarawa niger ondo osun oyo plateau rivers sokoto taraba yobe and zamfara the ncdc said there was 42 per cent increase in the number of new suspected cases in september 4 153 compared with august also the world health organisation who at the weekend said 29 countries have reported cholera cases this year including haiti malawi and syria which are facing large scale outbreaks the tally shows a clear uptick on previous five years when fewer than 20 countries on average reported outbreaks who has said it is particularly concerned about the fatality rate which this year was almost three times the rate of the past five years the organisation also said dire shortage of cholera vaccines amid an unprecedented rise in global cases has forced health officials to halve the number of doses given to people in outbreak hotspots adding that the exceptional decision to reduce the number of doses from two to one would allow for the vaccines to be eked out until the end of the year and given to more people in more countries executive director for who s health emergencies programme mike ryan said the decision marked a sad day we shouldn t have to do it and it is purely based on the availability globally of vaccines cholera is a waterborne disease and is easily treatable if responded to in a timely fashion but can kill within hours if not the international coordinating group icg the body that manages emergency stocks of vaccines had taken the decision because of the extremely limited supply who said in a statement reiterating previous calls for urgent action to boost global vaccine production of the total 36 million doses forecast to be produced this year 24 million have already been shipped and eight million more have been earmarked for emergency vaccination campaigns leaving just four million doses in the global stockpile speaking in geneva switzerland the director general of the who dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said the move was clearly less than ideal rationing must only be a temporary solution ghebreyesus said in the long term we need a plan to scale up vaccine production as part of a holistic strategy to prevent and stop cholera outbreaks this scarcity will only be exacerbated by a key manufacturer s decision revealed by the guardian last week to discontinue production of one of the two oral cholera vaccines used in humanitarian emergencies as vaccine manufacturers are producing at their maximum current capacity there is no short term solution to increase production who said meanwhile a study published in eurasian journal of medicine and titled analysis of factors contributing to the spread of cholera in developing countries noted the findings of this study identified some factors that play a significant role in causing the cholera epidemic in the country these factors include but are not limited to terrorism related activities and civil unrest which prevents people from access to clean water and lack of proper environmental sanitation another factor that causes cholera epidemic is flooding due to heavy rainfall which is prevalent in the areas covered by the case study because of inadequate drainage system this problem usually contaminates the rivers and streams which is the source of water for most people in the area with dirty items particles and human and animal waste similarly lack of proper sewage disposal has been identified as another causative factor because people sell and buy food closer to the bins which in turn contaminates the food and water around the area a cholera epidemic can occur when people consume the infected foods and water another causative factor identified by the study includes the unhygienic environment findings from the study also revealed that people who were infected did not bother to get appropriate treatment as a result of the fear of intimidation or victimisation others did not get treatment due to financial incapability and poor support from the government the study findings identified some key lessons that are essential for enhancing the prevention and control of cholera firstly although the seasonal distribution of cholera infection does not apply in nigeria the time of outbreaks and geographical distribution is however predictable secondly there exists substantial evidence on the menace and protective dynamics of the transmission of cholera taking into cognisance inhibiting factors such as consumption of contaminated water unhygienic environment and inappropriate disposal of waste products which are all possible routes for the transmission of cholera thirdly the proper and adequate availability of information and awareness of the people regarding the mode and pattern of cholera transmission can help reduce the occurrence of cholera infection and death

m suhail since its founding in 1976 the home depot nyse hd has grown to be one of the most reliable companies in the united states selling everything one might need for home improvement construction renovations and more while the company s fundamentals and overall performance is unquestioned there may be an issue with its debt load as we head into an environment where we may see interest rates go higher and stay there for a while prompting the company s interest expense to hurt the company s eps growth let s dive in home depot is doing fine when it comes to the company s fundamentals and neutral long term prospects it s as solid as it gets the company is projected to grow earnings per share at between 3 and 7 over the next decade with sales growth by 2 to 3 over the same period this puts the company just ahead of where overall us gdp is projected to be at over the same time period and in line with where most companies will be on top of that they pay a dividend yielding 2 75 which currently stands at a roughly 45 payout ratio a highly sustainable point with the company s solid top and bottom line growth projections beyond that decade the prospects of automation should clear some of the company s manufacturing processing and warehouse operations which should help increase their margins to overcome the inflation we re expected to see over the next decade so what s the

revenues of 155 billion annually and operating income of over 24 billion per year this amount of debt shouldn t be all that bad overall as the company can handle this debt in a neutral environment however with interest rates heading up to over 4 with an expected further rise in the coming months and a dot plot which projects rates to remain over 2 5 for quite some time the company can face an increasing interest expense bill fed dot plot bloomberg bloomberg terminal this has resulted in home depot s interest expense increasing over the past few quarters and i expect it to continue at a faster rate than they boost debt i expect that the company will pay around 1 6 billion in interest expense for the year which i believe will rise by 15 in the year after to 1 8 billion while this doesn t seem to be much at all for a company which rakes in about 24 billion each year in operating income it does matter at a time where the us and global economies are expecting some form of slowdown or recession what if a conservative estimation in theory having a higher debt load in a neutral or growing economy doesn t mean all that much as long as you can service that debt without hurting your operational efficiency home depot is certainly in that category but with several high profile economist projecting some form of a recession in the coming quarters the company is actually one of the more vulnerable ones to a recession type event this is because home improvement is a luxury in most cases and in case of a recession you have both more people who become unemployed and cannot afford to do these home renovations as well as people who rely on several jobs to make their annual income losing one of them or reducing their hours resulting in lower wages and lower spending power overall if the company was not increasing their debt load and paying more in interest expense weathering a recession shouldn t be an issue they are still likely to maintain a significant percentage of their current sales and they do have over 1 2 billion in cash and equivalents which they can use as needed but with an increased debt load the company s leverage increases and they face tougher multiples as fair value and while a recession should lead to lower interest rates it s unclear how fast the federal reserve will act this means i believe that we may see a year or two with still high interest rates there s something else market share loss while companies like home depot and lowe s low its main major competitor are going to continue to dominate the industry i see trouble brewing over the next 2 3 years beyond the aforementioned debt load and interest rate risk market share according to industry research the home improvement market is expected to grow at a cagr of about 4 6 through 2025 with home depot s revenue growth projected at just 2 to 3 over that time period i believe it s indicative of a loss of market share while lowe s is projected to report even lower growth than home depot it may be the mom and pop hardware stores in smaller towns as well as companies like amazon amzn offering an avenue for much smaller outfits to sell their products and enjoy the prime free shipping and the likes if you add this to the overall thesis and assume that while the company will remain stable on paper that it can lead to some market share loss it adds to the risk portfolio of the company by raising the question of can it get it back so what does this mean while this by no means indicates that the company will report significant declines which will place it in long term trouble i do think that since it used the previously low interest rates to load up on debt that hd is highly likely to underperform the broader market in the case of an economic downturn since i do expect an economic downturn to take effect in the coming quarters i believe that home depot is highly likely to underperform other companies and the broader market and have therefore turned neutral on the company s 2 3 year prospects
