economic data juxtaposed with concerns about the potential for the fed to over tighten monetary policy and push the economy into a recession he wrote in a note to clients friday that tug of war will likely continue in the first quarter of 2023 unless and until the fed gets to their terminal fed funds rate investors should expect a bumpy ride within the first few months of the year as the central bank grinds toward its terminal fed funds rate weaker economic trends will likely form heading into 2023 as the fed battles inflation but a mild recession may help set stocks up for a better second half of the year he said given this backdrop hogan recommends a barbell investing approach with a focus on energy staples and healthcare on the other end investors should look for well priced growth

economic data juxtaposed with concerns about the potential for the fed to over tighten monetary policy and push the economy into a recession he wrote in a note to clients friday that tug of war will likely continue in the first quarter of 2023 unless and until the fed gets to their terminal fed funds rate investors should expect a bumpy ride within the first few months of the year as the central bank grinds toward its terminal fed funds rate weaker economic trends will likely form heading into 2023 as the fed battles inflation but a mild recession may help set stocks up for a better second half of the year he said given this backdrop hogan recommends a barbell investing approach with a focus on energy staples and healthcare on the other end investors should look for well priced growth

economic data juxtaposed with concerns about the potential for the fed to over tighten monetary policy and push the economy into a recession he wrote in a note to clients friday that tug of war will likely continue in the first quarter of 2023 unless and until the fed gets to their terminal fed funds rate investors should expect a bumpy ride within the first few months of the year as the central bank grinds toward its terminal fed funds rate weaker economic trends will likely form heading into 2023 as the fed battles inflation but a mild recession may help set stocks up for a better second half of the year he said given this backdrop hogan recommends a barbell investing approach with a focus on energy staples and healthcare on the other end investors should look for well priced growth

markets us stocks sold off big again on friday as investors demonstrated a peculiar reaction to another deceleration in cpi inflation a rate hike downshift from the fed and a modest weekly decline in 10 year treasury yields all highlighting how challenging it may be to produce results in this recession tail risked environment this past week brought a triplex of high risk market impact data points which appeared to be market friendly enough but the reaction from investors looked anything but cordial with economic data undershooting expectations it s not a stretch to think investors may shift their focus from inflation and the fed to the growing impact that the fed s actions are likely to have on the economy in 2023 so the market s risk off head for the holiday bunker reaction is informational of how investors may position against the devolving backdrop through the lens of falling growth and whether the global economy will tip into recession in the space of a few hours last week the world s two biggest central banks the fed and ecb provided a no punches pulled message financial conditions must stay tight the signal for 2023 seems clear central banks will push back on higher risky assets until the labour market starts to turn the fed and ecb seem determined to leave a lump of coal in everyone s stockings this holiday season oil oil markets had an expectedly rough close on friday catalyzed by ecb and fed explicitly shifting focus from cpi to the labour market implying that supply side improvements in the goods side are not enough to declare the mission accomplished on the inflation front put another way risky assets now fall under the fed s hawkish purview oil traders are certainly spooked by the fed taking direct aim at main street especially in the wake of an unexpectedly sharp fall in us retail sales which could be a telltale of demand destruction coming to a petrol station near you and with us hard economic catching down to the sentiment indexes oil could be in for a rough ride against the backdrop of the covid surge in beijing foreshadowing what is in store for the rest of china however with the united states beginning to refill the spr the price slide should come to a halt if not oil bulls could be in for a world of hurt forex as we saw by the euro reaction into the weekend overtly hawkish forward guidance is not necessarily currency positive from an economic growth perspective even more so with the broader market focusing on growth over inflation with the latter on the downswing with the two dominant central banks fed ecb climbing the mountain into restrictive territory slowdown fears will be the dominant driver and on the surface it looks like a poor environment for equity betas and commodity currencies into year end media reports suggest that china s fast tracked exit from its zero covid policy is anything but smooth with health experts predicting 60 of the population could be infected with omicron over the winter one would expect this reality check to pour some ice water on asia fx this week not to mention the global recovery story especially with traders in risk management rather than risk taking mode while most fx participants believe the us dollar peak is in the cards and we are unlikely to revisit sub par on eurusd primarily due to the downswing in us inflation for a significant broad dollar downtrend we need an inflection point in the growth cycle where global growth picks up steam with the market still reeling fed officials will take some time off after last week s fomc meeting and let the data do most of the talking as we head into the holidays despite nascent progress on inflation the central bank s hawkish message was motivated by the fight against financial conditions that have refused to tighten sufficiently and a still highly tight labour market with substantial momentum while most of this week s data docket will inform the current quarter growth outlook friday s latest reading on core pce inflation will likely be the main focus particularly in light of the fed s surprisingly strong forecast for core pce in the newest summary of economic projections

the hourly chart of the spyder trust spy shows that it traded as high as 410 49 in the first hour of trading tuesday in reaction to the better than expected cpi report by friday s unadjusted close it was down 6 from the early tuesday high likely most of these late buyers are still long but they must be wondering if they should get out markets tom aspray viper report com the stock market rally on monday cushioned the decline but the nasdaq 100 was still down another 2 8 for the week and is now down 31 1 year to date ytd the s p 500 was not too far behind for the week as it was down 2 1 and even the dow jones industrial average dropped 1 7 but is only down 9 4 ytd because of its strong relative performance analysis the dow jones transportation average and ishares russell 2000 only had minor losses but both had dropped over 5 the prior week the dow jones utility average was down 1 1 and has moved further into negative territory ytd the spdr gold trust had a minor loss for the week and has a key seasonal turning point in early 2023 spy weekly tom aspray viper report com at the of start the week there were clear technical warnings as a majority of the weekly a d lines were all negative the weekly chart of the spyder trust spy shows a negative close below the prior four week lows there is some support at 379 380 with much stronger in the 367 370 area the weekly starc band is at 356 70 the pre covid high was 333 34 which now is long term support the weekly s p 500 advance decline line did turn negative last week by dropping below its wma it would take a move above the resistance at line c to turn the weekly a d outlook positive qqq weekly tom aspray viper report com the invesco qqq trust qqq reached its downtrend line a last week before turning sharply lower a drop below the minor uptrend in the 267 area will suggest a decline to the weekly starc band at 249 the worst case scenario right now would be a decline to the lower support at line b which is close to the pre covid high at 236 21 the weekly nasdaq 100 a d line has dropped further below its wma and still has long term resistance at line c all of the daily advance decline lines are negative and continue to favor a further market decline growth value tom aspray viperreport com it was another positive week for value over growth as the s p value ivx was down 1 6 while the s p growth igx was down 2 6 for the week this chart is a ratio of igx to ivx that first appeared to be topping in november 2021 the bull market that began in 2003 and ended in 2007 was led by value stocks the positive trend since 2009 represents how growth did lead value for most of the bull market the november top was suggested by the bearish divergences in the macds and macd his lines b and c that was confirmed in april 2022 by the drop below the low at 1 880 the ratio is now back inside the trading channel which increases the odds that growth might see a rebound in the first half of 2023 apple weekly tom aspray viperreport com one of the market s key growth stocks apple inc aapl is unlikely to support the major averages as it has done for much of the last six months aapl makes up 6 6 of the s p 500 and 13 of

friday s close a break of this support level would then target the longer term support at 116 27 line b the volume increased last week which turned the volconf negative the ja aspray insight measures the relative performance rs and it turned negative on october 3rd indicating that appl was no longer leading the s p in a declining market those stocks or etfs with weak rs generally drop more than the s p 500 dia weekly tom aspray viperreport com over the past three months the spdr dow jones industrial average etf dia is up 6 8 while the qqq is down 5 2 and the spy is about flat the clue to the stronger performance came from the rs analysis as the downtrend line a was broken in september as dia was making its lows in october the rs was still rising on friday dia along with spy and qqq did drop below their daily starc bands this is a sign that prices are starting to get stretched on the downside so a rebound ior some stabilization is likely dia has almost reached its 38 2 fibonacci support at 324 69 with the 50 level at 317 42 the rs is now in a trading range but the weekly rs favors dia over spy last week s technical warnings were followed by a clear increase in selling investors and traders now appear to be more worried about a recession and weaker earnings than inflation or the fed though a sharp rally is always possible before the end of the year the negative technical readings indicate the market will decline into early 2023

likely continue in the first quarter of 2023 unless and until the fed gets to their terminal fed funds rate investors should expect a bumpy ride within the first few months of the year as the central bank grinds toward its terminal fed funds rate weaker economic trends will likely form heading into 2023 as the fed battles inflation but a mild recession may help set stocks up for a better second half of the year he said given this backdrop hogan recommends a barbell investing approach with a focus on energy staples and healthcare on the other end investors should look for well priced growth

in the first quarter of 2023 unless and until the fed gets to their terminal fed funds rate investors should expect a bumpy ride within the first few months of the year as the central bank grinds toward its terminal fed funds rate weaker economic trends will likely form heading into 2023 as the fed battles inflation but a mild recession may help set stocks up for a better second half of the year he said given this backdrop hogan recommends a barbell investing approach with a focus on energy staples and healthcare on the other end investors should look for well priced growth companies

much like floating off of our chairs hawaiian airlines chief operating officer jon snook said such turbulence is isolated and unusual noting the airline had not experienced anything like it in recent history three flight attendants were among the injured he said jazmin bitanga who was also traveling home for the holidays said there were two drops in altitude including one that was so strong it sent her boyfriend s water bottle into the plane s ceiling just all around me there were people crying she told hawaii news now there was some internal damage to the aircraft during the turbulence snook said the fasten seat belts sign was on at the time though some of those injured were not wearing them he said the airline was aware of the forecast for thunderstorms and unstable air and weather conditions but had no warning that the particular patch of air where the turbulence occurred was in any way dangerous snook said he did not know how much altitude the plane lost during the turbulence saying that would be part of an investigation involving the national transportation safety board the plane s flight data recorder would provide those details he said the investigation would also address precisely what the passengers and crew were doing at the time he said the airbus a330 200 began its descent immediately after the turbulence snook said the crew declared an emergency because of the number of injuries on board and air traffic controllers gave the flight priority to land the aircraft will undergo a thorough inspection and maintenance mostly to fix components in the cabin snook said snook said he could only speculate whether some passengers hit their heads but that was likely based on the injuries and the damage to cabin paneling if you don t have your seat belt on you stay where you are as the aircraft goes down and that s how those injuries occur snook said the investigation will examine what other measures were taken aside from turning on the fasten seat belt sign to ensure passengers were buckled in he said a high wind warning and flood watch were in effect monday for hawaii as a strong front moves across the islands according to the national weather service on monday severe turbulence hit a united airlines flight traveling from rio de janeiro to houston the airline said two passengers and three crew members suffered minor injuries and were taken to a hospital shortly after the flight landed at george bush intercontinental airport in houston the airline did not describe the nature of the injuries in 2019 37 passengers and flight crew members were injured when an air canada flight from vancouver to sydney hit intense turbulence about two hours past hawaii the boeing 777 200 was diverted to honolulu where the injured received treatment thirty people were taken to hospitals and nine had serious injuries over the atlantic a 2017 american airlines flight from athens hit severe turbulence along the new york coastline seven crew members and three passengers were injured most people associate turbulence with heavy storms but the most dangerous type is so called clear air turbulence the wind shear phenomenon can occur in wispy cirrus clouds or even clear air near thunderstorms as differences in temperature and pressure create powerful currents of fast moving air
federal reserve policymakers may need to lift u s borrowing costs above the peak 5 1 they penciled in just this week and keep them there perhaps into 2024 to squeeze high inflation out of the economy three of them signaled on friday the hawkish messages delivered in separate appearances by new york fed president john williams san francisco fed president mary daly and cleveland fed president loretta mester underscore the u s central bank s determination to do what it takes to ease price pressures that erode wages and strain household budgets despite what analysts say could be a million or more jobs lost in the process they also stand in stark contrast with expectations expressed in financial markets traders on friday leaned into bets that the fed policy rate will peak below 5 and the fed will start cutting rates in the second half of 2023 to cushion what the new york fed s own internal model suggests will be an economic downturn new york fed chief williams said he s not expecting a recession but told bloomberg tv we re going to have to do what s necessary to get inflation back to the fed s 2 target adding that the peak rate could be higher than what we ve written down the fed this year has raised rates from near zero in march to a range of 4 25 4 5 in the steepest round of rate hikes since the 1980s the last time it battled fast rising prices inflation by the fed s preferred measure is currently running at 6 three times its 2 target earlier this week as policymakers delivered the latest rate hike they also published projections that signaled nearly all of them see the need to lift rates still further to at least a 5 5 25 range in coming months that view surprised investors who earlier in the week had been heartened by data showing a second straight month of cooling inflation that some took to suggest the fed s round of rate hikes was near being done on friday the broad s p 500 stock market index closed down about 2 on the week as the fed s more hawkish stance sunk in bond traders meanwhile appear to be quite convinced the fed will indeed beat inflation fed policymakers have welcomed inflation s recent deceleration driven by easing supply chain problems and higher interest rates restraining the housing market but they are also uneasily eyeing the strong labor market as a source of persistent price pressure u s employers have added hundreds of thousands of jobs each month and the unemployment rate is at a low 3 7 workers are in short supply particularly after millions retired early on in the pandemic and wage growth is running well beyond what the economy can sustain policymakers say i don t quite know why markets are so optimistic about inflation san francisco fed s daly said adding that it may be because markets are pricing in an ideal scenario central bankers she said are positioning policy for what she said were still upside risks to the inflation outlook central bankers have become increasingly blunt that bringing inflation down will require a labor market slowdown that they will not try to offset with interest rate cuts until they are confident they have beaten back inflation over the past several rate hiking cycles the fed raised rates and kept them there for an average of 11 months before cutting them i think 11 months is a starting point is a reasonable starting point but i m prepared to do more if more is required daly said adding that exactly how long will depend on the data she said her own forecast for rates is in line with the 5 1 peak rate expected by the majority of her colleagues the fed has signaled ongoing rate hikes ahead and daly s remarks suggests she sees rates staying high into the first couple of months of 2024 even as the fed predicts the unemployment rate will rise to 4 6 an increase that analysts say could mean the loss of 1 5 million or more jobs as of last month central bank staff economists viewed the risks of recession against continued growth as roughly even minutes from the fed s november policy meeting show meanwhile on thursday the new york fed said its internal economic model sees a 0 3 decline in overall activity next year and flat growth in 2024 with a return to positive growth the year after fed policymakers this week forecast gdp growing about a half a percent next year while not a recession per se such slow growth means an unexpected shock could easily trigger an outright contraction for a couple of quarters cleveland fed s mester told bloomberg tv she identified herself as one of seven of the fed s 19 fed policymakers who see rates needing to rise even higher than the 5 1 median in the fed s projections published this week in his news conference after the end of the dec 13 14 policy meeting fed chair jerome powell nodded to the challenges that higher unemployment if not necessarily a recession would pose i wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability he said there isn t and this is the best we can do source reuters

like many economists vanguard s joe davis thinks the united states will experience a recession in 2023 and like many of his colleagues he does not think it will be a serious one he has tentatively dubbed it the zoom recession in effect a readjustment from the excesses of the pandemic with tech and a handful of industries in the crosshairs as people reset how they use their time and money but with many industries skirting trouble it is getting back to normal he said the u s federal reserve in new economic projections this week did not explicitly jump into the recession camp and fed chair jerome powell said he feels the country can maintain modest growth and sees only a modest increase in unemployment even as the fed deliberately tries to slow things down to cool inflation i don t think it would qualify as a recession powell said of the growth rate penciled in by policymakers still the fed s outlook is mighty weak a half percent growth next year and a rise in unemployment that would be the equivalent of about 1 6 million more people out of work by this time next year outcomes that look recessionary it may turn out different this time but only if the fed is able to buck history a flashback to recessions in the united states have come in many flavors deep or shallow short or long the last two have spanned extremes the pandemic caused an acute shock that pushed the unemployment rate to nearly 15 and saw the economy contract from april through june of 2020 at a depression like annual rate of 30 but gdp grew 35 in the following quarter within two years the unemployment rate had fully recovered and the recession was judged to have lasted two months by contrast the downturn caused by a collapsing housing market and a broader financial crisis lasted a year and a half from december 2007 to june 2009 a span during which gdp shrank during five of six quarters payroll employment continued dropping for eight months after the recession ended and took six and a half years to regain its prior peak if a recession does develop next year no one expects it to look like either of those households and firms are far less leveraged than they were back in 2007 with modest debt service payments in relation to income and a financial sector that due to post financial crisis regulations is better capitalized all of those factors lower the risk of a financial crisis and the deeper sort of recession associated with it u s household warchests a closer analogy davis suggests may be the period from march 2001 to november 2001 those months were declared a recession by the national bureau of economic research s business cycle dating committee and add some context to the fed s latest projections gross domestic product did shrink in the first and third quarters of 2001 but grew in the second and fourth and for the year overall expanded by 1 that s twice the annual growth the fed says the united states will have experienced in 2022 and what it foresees through 2023 the rise in the unemployment rate then was more than the fed currently anticipates for next year from 3 9 in december 2000 the jobless rate rose to 5 7 a year later and the estimated number of unemployed rose by more than 2 5 million in a much smaller labor force the fed sees unemployment rising from 3 7 now to 4 6 in 2023 and remaining almost unchanged for two years after that in contrast to the jobless recovery that bedeviled the united states after the 2007 downturn the projections that powell and his colleagues are sketching might evolve into a job ful recession a downturn that passes without any deep scar to the labor market but on its own the rise in the unemployment rate seen by the fed would be consistent with a recession and one feature of the u s economy is that once the unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point it usually rises a lot more from there there is no such thing as a light recession said lindsay nyse lnn owen executive director of the groundwork collaborative a group that works on issues around economic equality and jobs and argues that the fed is putting workers too much at risk in its inflation fight if a million more people are unemployed they will be disproportionately black brown older the consequences will be stark even if wall street comes out the other side though the focus is often on gdp growth the macroeconomists on the nber committee look at the factors that ultimately comprise output not the gdp number itself among some of those central indicators the economy still looks like it has momentum even if there are some signs of weakness on the plus side is jobs there has never been a recession declared without an outright decline in employment so far that keeps growing job loss and recession personal income less government transfer programs is another measure the committee watches since consumer spending accounts for so much of u s economic activity and declines in household earnings can drive it lower even adjusted for inflation it has so far remained steady recession and personal income industrial production is another metric that dependably turns lower ahead of recession and is one of the data points that does appear to have peaked marking the sort of moment that may register with the nber if it continues lower source reuters

first of two parts for many years now the whole world has been struggling with how to deal with the twin evils of inequality and exclusion these two evils have led to worldwide poverty and hunger and many other dehumanizing ills of society in countries big or small developed or underdeveloped autocracies or democracies in his apostolic exhortation the joy of the gospel pope francis had this to say about these twin evils today we also have to say thou shall not to the economy of inequality and exclusion such an economy kills how can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly person dies of exposure but is news when the stock market loses two points some people continue to defend trickle down theories which assume that economic growth encouraged by a free market will inevitably succeed bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world this opinion which has never been confirmed by the facts expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the secularized workings of the prevailing economic system meanwhile the excluded are still waiting advertisement this exhortation followed the pope s earlier encyclical laudato si where he lamented that never have we so hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last 200 years the world must hear both the cry of the earth and of the poor how serious are these two global problems on inequality we read that the 10 richest men in the world own more wealth than the 40 percent 3 1 billion people of humanity the richest 1 percent have 22 percent of global income in the philippines the wealthiest 1 percent has 17 percent of national income while the bottom 50 percent earns only 14 percent our gini coefficient which is a measure of inequality in a country is at 42 3 percent the worst in association of southeast asian nations asean and one of the worst in east asia based on the latest world bank report we also have the distinction of having the worst poverty ratio in asean which due to covid had even worsened from 16 7 percent to 23 7 percent all the other asean countries have single digit poverty ratios on exclusion there are still glass if not brick ceilings for women in the professions even in boardrooms in some family owned and controlled companies there are limits to professional growth of nonfamily members in hiring some companies prefer graduates of elite schools as some discriminate against older people if not people with disabilities many financial institutions continue to require more stringent requirements for farmers and small entrepreneurs and banks would rather pay penalties for not complying with loan level requirements for the agri agra sector which deprives this sector of up to p600 billion of financing annually other examples of exclusion are ostracizing the unwilling targets of sexual harassment exclusion due to religion and economic status and many more what can be done to combat these twin evils the world bank prescribes

doctors have issued warnings to parents that they should be very careful when giving smaller doses of adult painkiller and anti fever medication to children amid reports of shortages of tylenol and other drugs it s probably a very dangerous maneuver number one because children and infants are dosed very differently than adults dr jay schauben of the florida poison information center told news4jax over the weekend and just by cutting tablets in half you may not be giving them the correct dose you may be overdosing them or you may be underdosing them he added barry power a pharmacist and editor in chief of the canadian pharmacists association told globalnews that adult advil or tylenol can be given to children but that parents must ensure that a proper dose is given so as to avoid potentially harmful side effects or an overdose it s easy to give the wrong amount he said parents who are considering giving a portion of an adult dose to a child should consult an expert first power said acetaminophen often used to lower fevers is one of the most commonly overused and overdosed medications and health officials say too much of the painkiller can cause liver failure in many cases people overdose on the drug by taking something like tylenol in addition to administering cough and cold medications which can also contain acetaminophen it s absolutely critical that if you are going to go down the path of cutting up tablets that you talk to a pharmacist or your physician to find out the appropriate dose he said and it s something that you need to think about very carefully it s easy to give the wrong amount he said the main problem with acetaminophen poisoning is that it s often asymptomatic or there s no signs of symptoms until it s very advanced and in quite a difficult situation the pharmacist said canada has reported a shortage of children s tylenol and other medications in recent months amid a surge in influenza and other respiratory viruses there have been sporadic reports of shortages of tylenol in parts of the united states although there have been shortages of other drugs including tamiflu amoxicillin and others another official margaret thompson told the toronto star that her poison center hotline has taken more and more calls from patients who attempted to make adult pain medication into kids dosages and had problems directions on its website the food and drug administration fda these would be calls from caregivers parents etc where they had realized after they had given a dose or two or three of an adult preparation to their child because they hadn t been able to source pediatric preparations that they were worried or had been giving more than what was recommended based on weight based dosing thompson said on its website the food and drug administration fda urges parents to give the right medicine in the right amount to your child not all medicines are right for an infant or a child a sign for the u s food and drug administration outside of the headquarters in white oak md on july 20 2020 sarah silbiger getty images the fda also states medicines with the same brand name can be sold in many different strengths such as infant children and adult formulas the amount and directions are also different for children of different ages or weights always use the right medicine and follow the directions exactly never use more medicine than directed even if your child seems sicker than the last time according to johnson johnson the maker of tylenol children should likely not take adult versions of the drug young children should not take adult medication the firm says all parents and caregivers should follow the dosing instructions outlined on the label if you have questions please consult your pediatrician or health care provider if not taking too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage or even failure severe liver damage could occur if an individual takes more than 4 000 mg of acetaminophen within 24 hours says tylenol s website the pharmaceutical giant told npr in early december that demand for children s tylenol is currently elevated but there is no u s wide shortage the epoch times has contacted j j for comment consumer demand for pediatric pain relievers in the u s is high johnson johnson said but there are no supply chain issues and we do not have an overall shortage in the u s children s tylenol products have been out of stock for about one month across canada according to the health canada government website

economic data juxtaposed with concerns about the potential for the fed to over tighten monetary policy and push the economy into a recession he wrote in a note to clients friday that tug of war will likely continue in the first quarter of 2023 unless and until the fed gets to their terminal fed funds rate investors should expect a bumpy ride within the first few months of the year as the central bank grinds toward its terminal fed funds rate weaker economic trends will likely form heading into 2023 as the fed battles inflation but a mild recession may help set stocks up for a better second half of the year he said given this backdrop hogan recommends a barbell investing approach with a focus on energy staples and healthcare on the other end investors should look for well priced growth

with us interest rates rising a portion of twitter s debt funding floating rate and an existing interest bill of more than us1 billion a year for a company that lost us221 million last year before the advertisers started fleeing the funding clearly needs restructuring the us33 5 billion of equity in the original structure was mostly provided by musk himself external investors provided just over us7 billion and musk the rest his latest sale of tesla shares suggests his commitment will rise and that he might even have to sell more of his shrinking tesla holdings if the attempt to raise more external equity fails there are also reports that musk s bankers are themselves trying to restructure the loans which they were unable to syndicate and can t get off their balance sheets without incurring multi billion dollar losses according to bloomberg they re considering a swap of some of the more expensive debt in their package for margin loans backed by musk s remaining unencumbered tesla stock tesla s securities and exchange commission filings have shown that about half his remaining shares had been pledged for an existing margin loan putting up more of his tesla shares as collateral would be a high risk move for musk given that tesla s shares have plummeted this year since the twitter bid was announced tesla s market capitalisation has fallen from us1 2 trillion to us474 billion that s a fall of about 60 per cent to put that decline into perspective the tech heavy nasdaq index has fallen about 29 per cent over the same period and the new york fang index which includes tesla and other mega tech stocks like apple amazon and facebook 35 per cent loading tesla shareholders are angry that musk their chief executive is essentially living in twitter s headquarters and devoting his time and attention to twitter rather than their company which has been experiencing difficulties in a flat lining covid impacted china and a rapidly slowing us auto market with a forward price earnings multiple of more than 30 tesla s share price remains vulnerable and the tie musk has created with a floundering twitter won t help tesla shareholders there is now a twitter shadow over tesla that includes an over hang in the market from the liens on musk s shareholdings and the potential for margin calls and or further sales the chaotic and frenetic management style musk has demonstrated at twitter would be unsettling for his bankers and tesla shareholders concerned about his financial and mental stability he fired half twitter s employees at once and then discovering he actually needed some tried without much success to rehire some of them he has installed beds in twitter s offices for the hardcore workers who remain and also threatened not to pay redundancies musk isn t paying twitter s rent and is seemingly managing the company through an incessant and erratic stream of tweets but there s a glimmer of light defying some predictions that were based on the mass exodus of twitter s engineers the platform hasn t broken down and the volume of posts on twitter seem to have increased significantly the flip side of that is the return of anti semitic material and the far right which with the demolition of the teams and processes responsible for twitter s content moderation data security and privacy protections and musk s own arbitrary banning and shadow banning of users has caught the attention of regulators the european union has already warned him that it could ban twitter in europe or fine it six per cent of its global revenues if it doesn t have mechanisms for identifying and removing illegal or harmful content the eu s digital services act that came into force last month has very strict data protection rules and standards that target hate speech and disinformation elon musk s libertarian ambition of turning twitter into a digital town square has run into trouble credit ap musk may see himself as a free speech purist but if he wants to retain access to europeans he might have to re hire a lot of the content moderators he s sacked the committee on foreign investment in the us is also scrutinising the outside investors in musk s bid structure to see whether there is any risk to national security and congress is investigating twitter and other social media platforms for their handling of user s data and their role in spreading misinformation and disinformation there are also cases before the us supreme court that could make platforms liable for promoting illegal or harmful content musk s libertarian ambition of turning twitter into a digital town square governed by the principle of free speech absolutism is destined to collide with the ambition of lawmakers to protect users privacy suppress hate speech and other harmful content and stamp out disinformation in the real world if not in musk s mind freedom of expression has some limits
the federal reserve s strategy to hike interest rates may continue making it difficult for the crypto industry to bounce back for crypto assets to become the hedge against inflation the industry needs to explore ways to decouple crypto from traditional markets decentralized finance defi can perhaps offer a way out by breaking away from legacy financial models how federal reserve policies are affecting crypto in the 1980s paul volcker the chairman of the federal reserve board introduced the interest hiking policy to control inflation volcker raised interest rates to over 20 forcing the economy into a recession by reducing people s purchasing capacity the strategy worked and the consumer price index cpi went down from 14 85 to 2 5 even now the federal reserve continues to use the same methodology to bring down high inflation rates in 2022 core u s inflation reached a 40 year high making the federal reserve consistently hike interest rates throughout the year this has negatively hit the crypto market mike mcglone the senior commodity strategist at bloomberg intelligence explained that the fed s sledgehammer has been pressuring crypto this year mcglone believes that the fed s policies could lead to a crash that is worse than the 2008 financial crisis market data shows a clear pattern where the federal reserve s interest rate hikes correspond to significant drops in cryptocurrency prices for example bitcoin btc prices declined on may 6 after the fed s meeting on may 3 and 4 to increase interest by 0 5 similarly bitcoin fell to 17 500 after the fed meeting on june 14 and 15 where they raised interest rates by 0 75 the rate hike in june was a significant factor for cryptocurrencies like btc and ether eth to fall 70 since their all time highs as the price charts demonstrate the federal reserve s policies have a direct correlation with crypto market volatility this uncertainty hampers the crypto industry from making a definitive comeback since cryptocurrencies are a risky asset class investors are reducing their exposure to crypto due to rising interest rates and recession fears the federal reserve implemented another 0 75 hike in interest rates in november the fed said it was trying to bring down inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the long run the fed committee will continue to hike federal fund rates to 3 4 it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 over time related jerome powell is prolonging our economic agony as inflation remains high there s no reason to believe that the federal reserve will stop hiking interest rates anytime soon unfortunately this isn t good news for risk assets like cryptocurrencies the future trajectory of fed policies in all probability the federal reserve will continue with its interest rate hikes in accordance with market data feedback bank of america wrote the fed will stress data dependence they will get two more nfp and cpi prints before the meeting if they stay hot another 75 bps is in the cards if not a deceleration to 50 bps is possible the strategists added the fed isn t done hiking until the data says so echoing the sentiment barclays s credit research team said the fed needs to see inflation turning before turning meaningfully dovish so there s a high chance that even if the federal reserve reduces the hike percentage they ll keep raising interest rates depending on inflation figures the fed might slow down its liquidity tightening measures from december but won t stop with its inflation mitigation strategies immediately thus investors need to brace for a long period of crypto market volatility related the market isn t surging anytime soon so get used to dark times the federal reserve intends to create a reverse wealth effect so that investors reassess their crypto portfolio they want to create a precarious market situation by slowing down demand but also be careful to avoid any chaos despite the u s gdp contracting for two consecutive quarters the fed is eager to evaluate and implement painful policies so the crypto industry needs to find alternative methods to tackle the fed challenge the current market scenario demonstrates that crypto asset prices are entwined with the equity and stock markets investors still consider them to be high risk assets and get skeptical about investing during high inflation periods so it is imperative for the crypto sector to distance itself from other traditional risky asset classes fortunately a u s central bank report suggests that risk perception towards crypto is gradually changing according to a federal reserve bank of new york report cryptocurrencies are no longer in the top 10 most cited as potential risks for the u s economy this reveals an important change in the investor mindset demonstrating that crypto will eventually become a non risky asset class but that won t happen if crypto continues to follow the legacy financial model to beat inflation and offset fed policies the crypto industry must embrace decentralized finance

after exhibiting in new york and beyond throughout the 60s lee bontecou 1931 2022 receded from the art world s view by the early 70s she moved out of the city left the prestigious leo castelli gallery and showed her work far less frequently reviewing bontecou s highly anticipated retrospective at the ucla hammer museum for artforum s january 2004 issue the curator elisabeth sussman concludes that the show makes a strong case for bontecou s taking a major place in a much needed historical reevaluation of the history of late twentieth century american art presenting the sculptures that had first made her reputation alongside rarely seen sculptural works and drawings the ucla exhibition was for many the first opportunity to take in her singular oeuvre as a whole like j g ballard and david cronenberg other great artists of the postwar technological society sussman writes bontecou projects simultaneously a critique of power and an expression of its seductive beauty this week on artforum com poet tony towle writes a remembrance of bontecou who died in november from 1960 to 1971 lee bontecou showed consistently at leo castelli gallery in new york where her large scale wall reliefs were admired by critics and collectors alike during this period she also had several european museum shows and was included in documenta 3 and she was often photographed most famously by ugo mulas and hans namuth but also by diane arbus despite these and other sanctions by the 70s bontecou decided for reasons that are not entirely known to stop exhibiting her work she left castelli moved out of new york city and it turns out kept right on working so the retrospective that opened at the hammer museum in october organized by elizabeth a t smith in association with ann philbin was greatly anticipated not only because it would provide the opportunity to revisit bontecou s celebrated sculpture of the early and mid 60s but also because it would reveal what in fact she has been doing for the last thirty odd years rumors circulated that her later work which had been seen by only a few in isolated gallery shows mostly in los angeles was very interesting isn t it ironic then that since the show opened so many critical responses in the press have focused on the very same early work so often praised in the past further and more surprising most criticism has continued to dismiss what to my mind are bontecou s other great bodies of work the drawings and particularly the exceedingly strange sculpture of the late 60s and early 70s these critics are missing the forest for the trees while as problematizing as ever the sculpture is astonishingly attuned to recent art it might even be posited as a starting point in a lineage that leads to work as diverse as that of sarah sze and roxy paine i don t in any way intend to demean the unparalleled power of bontecou s jutting wall reliefs her most famous works this exhibition provides an unprecedented chance to become immersed in their evolution and variations to revel in their metaphors and their tactility as is well known the reliefs made between 1959 and 1966 are built on welded steel armatures that support wire sewn patchworks of old and soot stained canvas in spite of the grim references in the most evolved reliefs to war machines and the detritus of the military industrial complex some are fabricated out of army surplus stock they are rich with the material pleasure of deteriorated things like j g ballard and david cronenberg other great artists of the postwar technological society bontecou projects simultaneously a critique of power and an expression of its seductive beauty while her reliefs are often hulking and aggressive they also possess paradoxically wonderful handmade qualities such as the tense little twists of bright copper wire that beautifully join the patchwork pieces because bontecou is known primarily as a sculptor her drawings interspersed among objects throughout the hammer galleries are a major revelation indeed drawings seem to be among the artist s primary occupations their vast numbers here ranging from sheets covered with preparatory sketches to highly finished meticulously detailed reveries and it is in the works on paper that bontecou s ability to lift the observation of nature to a visionary level shines by 1961 she was covering the drawing sheet with small graphite or soot sketches of circles mouths with teeth craters gas masks or simply black holes that echo the voids in her reliefs in a drawing from 1964 concentric ovoids emerge fantastically from a soot blackened background the forms recalling an enormous relief bontecou made for the lobby of the new york state theater at lincoln center too large to travel to the west coast this piece can nonetheless be glimpsed here in other reliefs from the period accompanied by drawings that foreground these lighter works resemblance to billowing sails or kites or to natural elements like shells snails insects and crustaceans one is reminded of a 1963 photograph of bontecou in her studio on wooster street in which she peers into one of several fish tanks she kept filled with crayfish toads salamanders and tropical fish but none of this is to say that bontecou is strictly interested in representation to the contrary the exhibition shows that by 1967 she was becoming all the more allusive donald judd a great fan of bontecou s work wrote of it in a 1965 article originally published in arts magazine and reprinted in the retrospective s catalogue the image does suggest other things but by analogy the image is one thing among similar things judd clearly respected the autonomy of bontecou s imagery rather than reading it as antiwar or proto green expression these all too common readings are forced and occasionally made too overtly by the catalogue s essayists undoubtedly bontecou held strong views that are reflected in her work but i would argue that the hybridization of beauty and ugliness in her work undercuts any direct polemic though we can observe in her mongrel flowers and gnarling fish a critique of the cold war or a salute to rachel carson s silent spring the remarkable fact is that in the post hiroshima world in the wake of so called progress bontecou finds a type of beauty in the midst of evil lucy lippard with her landmark 1966 show eccentric abstraction identified a group of artists eva hesse bruce nauman and louise bourgeois whose sculpture was simultaneously erotic and surreal yet definitively abstract bontecou in contrast was by the late 60s establishing her own version of the erotic and the surreal in hyperreal if distorted forms from the real world this moment in bontecou s career was and has remained the most controversial while most critical assessments of it have been negative i find this bad taste sculpture to be kitsch and bizarre yes but simultaneously beautiful and hallucinatory for me one of the high points of the hammer installation came in the last room an eerie environment of sculpture and drawings bespeaking the weird depths bontecou was plumbing by this time here orange tinged vacuum formed plastic flowers sporting wings and flaccid tendrils were grouped on a waist high table while sinister looking plastic fish suspended by wire from the ceiling appeared to swim by drawings of flowers and fish some like botanical illustrations others in white charcoal or colored pencil on black paper capture the feel of a quasi scientific nocturnal environment in a natural history museum the plastic objects may veer dangerously close to hobbyist models and all sorts of mass produced decorative tchotchkes and they only sideswipe the new materials movement of the time there were many plastic art shows in the late 60s but i nonetheless find them as disturbing and powerful as anything that came before furthermore while the plastic fish and flowers are at home with the neo conceptualist duchampian and narrative strategies that have replaced formalist criteria they come from another place though they resonate with the sense of found objects and can certainly be per ceived as allegorical omens of a world gone wrong they are more directly derivatives of intense observation and an equally intense imaginative state like the war addled reliefs they are meticulously fabri cated to project their sources also in the last room of the exhibition was bontecou s considerable output of the 70s this is work from the period often characterized as one of withdrawal an assumption that smith in her excellent essay neatly refutes recounting that bontecou taught drawing and 3 d courses at brooklyn college from the early 70s until her retirement in 1991 her pedagogy seemed to focus most on encouraging students to as she described it to me recently use their imaginations the work she herself made throughout her teaching career makes it clear that bontecou s own imaginative life also continued to expand stepping into the final space of the hammer installation is exhilarating the sculpture here much of which was begun in the 80s and completed in the 90s still employs metal armatures and fabric and wire mesh panels but now the frames of wire and rods make for a skeletal lightness underscored by the presence of hand formed white porcelain parts delicacy has replaced mass the visitor is surrounded by amorphous winged and finned objects of different sizes hanging from the ceiling at various heights or placed on pedestals associations abound are we in some oceanic space or a galaxy of solar masses or are we surrounded by a menacing swarm of insects or birds like the best horror film directors bontecou has upped the fear quotient by instilling in her sculpture humanoid qualities as well is this human presence meant to evoke the artist herself a kind of examination of the self had been there before the voids at the centers of the 60s wall reliefs certainly hinted at bodily orifices a fantastic colored pencil drawing from 1989 in which large heavy lidded blue eyes dominate a field of bulbous fishlike eyes hovering amid pierced spheres might strike one as a kind of self representation those eyes appear again in a fine graphite drawing done nearly a decade later in 1997 here hooded by long lashes or perhaps feathers they have taken on the sharp stare of an eagle of course this is not a self portrait bontecou would never draw herself but these eyes do remind one of those of the young bontecou in mulas s portrait from 1963 in which she is shown half in shadow peering through a circular construction in her studio her very sober eye staring steadily into the camera bontecou s work particularly when its full spectrum is taken into account has commonly been deemed unassimilable into the canon of major talents yes we do have to acknowledge the powerful reliefs of the 60s and her singular status as a famous woman artist in a male dominated art world but with this full retrospective a new case begs to be made bontecou s work is still thank goodness very odd but rather than seeming entirely anomalous bontecou can now be seen to fit alongside other singular talents into a history that once might have been called alternative but that today seems central to the development of american and european sculpture drawing and installation it is interesting for instance to think of bontecou in comparison to paul thek who in the late 60s was also engaged in making objects that were related to but critically distanced from the real world works such as his technological reliquaries a series that included fragmented human limbs made of wax and metal and encased in a plexiglas box one might also compare bontecou s fish to thek s fishman 1968 a latex cast of his own body to which cast rubber fish adhered like leeches from thek one might naturally jump to robert gober or to zoe leonard s strange fruit 1992 97 suddenly bontecou s work of the late 60s and early 70s allegorical home made political and completely out of keeping with contemporaneous post minimalist practice seems like a logical link this retrospective makes a strong case for bontecou s taking a major place in a much needed historical reevaluation of the history of late twentieth century american art lee bontecou is on view at the ucla hammer museum through jan 11 travels to the museum of contemporary art chicago feb 14 may 30 and

the statement said the wounds included a serious head injury lacerations bruising and loss of consciousness honolulu tiffany reyes had just gotten back to her seat from the bathroom and was about to buckle her safety belt when hawaiian airlines flight 35 dipped in an instant reyes found herself on the aisle floor staring up at caved in ceiling panels and a cracked bathroom sign that was hanging i asked everyone around me was that me reyes said they said i had apparently flown into the ceiling and slammed into the ground reyes 40 was among 20 people on the flight passengers and crew taken to hospitals after turbulence struck their plane flying from phoenix to honolulu without warning sunday eleven people were in serious condition in all 36 people received medical treatment for bumps bruises cuts and nausea said jim ireland director of honolulu emergency medical services reyes was heading home after picking up her daughter kaylee from college she initially thought something had hit the plane and that it was crashing she briefly thought they were going to die because she had never encountered anything so violent on a flight before that s the most terrifying experience i ve been through in my whole 40 years of life reyes said reyes wasn t bleeding and the adrenaline surging through her dulled the pain that would eventually come she crawled back into her seat and her daughter who was buckled up and escaped injury just held me the whole time others had it much worse reyes said she saw a woman walk off the plane with gashes in her head and blood on her face and clothes an ambulance took reyes to an emergency room where she received x rays had her blood taken and various other screenings after five hours there she and her family her daughter son and husband went home to decompress she had a headache which began to fade sunday night but the left side of her body started to ache i can t even move around in bed reyes said monday so i have to sleep right on my back without even moving the national transportation safety board said monday it is investigating the incident the full flight had nearly 300 people aboard and carried many passengers traveling to hawaii for the holidays like jacie hayata ano who was heading home it was just rocky she told khon tv and then it quickly just escalated to the point where we re shaking so much that we were pretty much like floating off of our chairs hawaiian airlines chief operating officer jon snook said such turbulence is isolated and unusual noting the airline had not experienced anything like it in recent history three flight attendants were among the injured he said jazmin bitanga who was also traveling home for the holidays said there were two drops in altitude including one that was so strong it sent her boyfriend s water bottle into the plane s ceiling just all around me there were people crying she told hawaii news now there was some internal damage to the aircraft during the turbulence snook said the fasten seat belts sign was on at the time though some of those injured were not wearing them he said the airline was aware of the forecast for thunderstorms and unstable air and weather conditions but had no warning that the particular patch of air where the turbulence occurred was in any way dangerous snook said he did not know how much altitude the plane lost during the turbulence saying that would be part of an investigation involving the national transportation safety board the plane s flight data recorder would provide those details he said the investigation would also address precisely what the passengers and crew were doing at the time he said the airbus a330 200 began its descent immediately after the turbulence snook said the crew declared an emergency because of the number of injuries on board and air traffic controllers gave the flight priority to land the aircraft will undergo a thorough inspection and maintenance mostly to fix components in the cabin snook said snook said he could only speculate whether some passengers hit their heads but that was likely based on the injuries and the damage to cabin paneling if you don t have your seat belt on you stay where you are as the aircraft goes down and that s how those injuries occur snook said the investigation will examine what other measures were taken aside from turning on the fasten seat belt sign to ensure passengers were buckled in he said a high wind warning and flood watch were in effect monday for hawaii as a strong front moves across the islands according to the national weather service on monday severe turbulence hit a united airlines flight traveling from rio de janeiro to houston the airline said two passengers and three crew members suffered minor injuries and were taken to a hospital shortly after the flight landed at george bush intercontinental airport in houston the airline did not describe the nature of the injuries in 2019 37 passengers and flight crew members were injured when an air canada flight from vancouver to sydney hit intense turbulence about two hours past hawaii the boeing 777 200 was diverted to honolulu where the injured received treatment thirty people were taken to hospitals and nine had serious injuries over the atlantic a 2017 american airlines flight from athens hit severe turbulence along the new york coastline seven crew members and three passengers were injured most people associate turbulence with heavy storms but the most dangerous type is so called clear air turbulence the wind shear phenomenon can occur in wispy cirrus clouds or even clear air near thunderstorms as differences in temperature and pressure create powerful currents of fast moving air

people shop at a target store during black friday sales in chicago illinois us november 25 2022 people continue under strains as energy drives a spike in costs while the us federal reserve has persistently attempted to tame inflation this year the government continues to spend heavily as it runs record high budget deficits the november us budget deficit jumped by 57 billion or 30 percent from a year earlier to 249 billion a record for the month as revenues fell and outlays for education healthcare and interest on public debt rose sharply the us treasury reported on dec 12 receipts for november fell 10 percent or 29 billion from a year earlier to 252 billion while outlays rose 6 percent or 28 billion to 501 billion also a record for november the present inflation has been caused by the huge increase in federal government spending which was accommodated by the fed said raymond hill a senior lecturer in finance at the goizueta business school at emory university in atlanta as is almost always the case government spending is the fundamental culprit here with the fed abetting driving the getaway car driving the revenue decline was a 4 percent drop in individual withheld tax receipts a 64 percent increase in individual tax refunds and a 98 percent decline in federal reserve earnings the treasury said the big deficit was primarily due to a significant drop in government receipts even as the biden administration continued to spend at a torrid pace michael maharrey wrote on dec 13 on schiffgold com which focuses on investments in precious metals the us government can t keep borrowing and spending without the fed monetizing the debt it needs the central bank to buy treasuries to prop up demand without the fed s intervention in the bond market prices will tank driving interest rates on us debt even higher either the government will have to cut spending or the fed will have to keep creating money out of thin air in order to monetize the debt for the first two months of fiscal 2023 which started on oct 1 the treasury s interest payments were up 48 billion or 87 percent the department said
the last gas chamber was removed from a county animal shelter in 2021 still the bill ensures the method of euthanization will never be used again in the state example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video ohio usa a decades long effort by the ohio society for the prevention of cruelty to animals to end a cruel method of euthanization has finally been explicitly enshrined in the ohio revised code under the recently passed senate bill 164 county run animal shelters in ohio will no longer be allowed to euthanize domesticated animals with a gas chamber proponents of the bill say they engaged in a years long campaign with over a dozen ohio counties to get this method of euthanization to end and they ve had success according to the ohio spca the last gas chamber was removed from a county shelter in june 2021 still the passing of s b 164 is being seen as a victory in that gas chambers will never again be used in the state john bell a lawyer with ohio spca says at one time thousands of animals a year and possibly into the tens of thousands of animals were euthanized using inhumane methods that s despite a statute that was already in the o r c saying that no domestic animal shall be destroyed by any method other than a method that immediately and painlessly renders the domestic animal initially unconscious and subsequently dead i cannot speak to why anyone would have ever thought that gassing was legal under this immediate and painless rule but they did said bell bell says the spca spent years uncovering evidence of cruelty in euthanization practices in violation of that passage this included shooting the use of homemade gas boxes and gas chambers they also engaged in a campaign of awareness raising and public pressure it s been a long journey but the organization is happy to see their work pay off the senate bill 164 passed the ohio house on thursday after already having been passed by the senate it s expected that governor dewine will sign the bill into law
europe s russia sanctions are a shot in the foot it seems obvious that sanctions an increasingly important tool of western foreign policy should inflict significant pain on the target without exacting unsustainably high costs from the country imposing them but the european union s sanctions on russia intended to punish the country for its brutal war of aggression against ukraine do not meet this condition at the centre of the eu s plan to punish russia is an effort to eliminate its dependence on the cheap russian energy that long powered its growth including by increasing its reliance on liquefied natural gas imported from the united states and elsewhere but lng has long been an overpriced and carbon intensive alternative to piped gas before russia invaded ukraine it was 4 5 times more expensive than natural gas now it is even more exorbitantly priced since the war began the cost of lng has more than doubled but with the kremlin slashing gas flows to europe in order to ensure that it not the eu dictates the timetable for phasing out russian supplies european countries have had little choice but to rely increasingly on lng imports this is creating serious challenges for europe s manufacturing base to the point that some european firms are now considering shifting production to the us which offers not only cheaper fuel but also massive subsidies and tax credits under its new inflation reduction act ira already europe s decision to turn its back on russian gas has increased the likelihood of a deep recession skyrocketing gas prices which are a staggering 14 times higher than two years ago have fueled inflation and destabilized eurozone financial markets so just when europe s economies are on the brink of contraction the cost of living is spiking and the threat of rolling power outages looms european policymakers adoption of desperate measures like price caps and regulated tariffs could well exacerbate the situation to conserve gas some european governments have even turned to coal moreover european leaders like french president emmanuel macron have pleaded with us president joe biden to ease pressure on their economies by adjusting some controversial ira provisions months after an agreement to strengthen and expand nato transatlantic relations are beginning to fray the one thing the eu appears unwilling to consider is changing course on sanctions this month alone it has imposed an embargo on imports of russian crude and joined its g7 partners in introducing a us 60 per barrel 2 137 baht cap today many european countries politics are lurching rightward italy s current governing party traces its roots to benito mussolini s fascist movement likewise the sweden democrats has neo nazi roots in poland and hungary right wing governments show increasing authoritarian tendencies if soaring energy prices and runaway inflation worsen economic conditions a likely scenario in the short term far right forces could gain further ground across the continent one might be able to argue that the sanctions large costs were worth shouldering if they were significantly hampering russia s war effort but if the eu is enduring so much pain while russia s aggression proceeds apace sanctions become tantamount to self flagellation this is why moral outrage however justified should never drive policy to be sure the eu s international image has long rested on its reputation as a force for democracy human rights and a rules based order which strengthens the case for a bold if costly response to russian aggression but had cooler heads prevailed it would have been obvious that a rapid transition away from russian energy supplies would undermine the eu s global standing by denting its sustainability credentials the turn to coal is a case in point and causing a global energy crisis which is hurting poorer countries given that the eu accounts for 11 of global energy consumption its quest to secure replacement supplies was bound to disrupt the entire global economy as a result when the eu rejected russian energy the world suddenly faced energy scarcity with countries in asia latin america and elsewhere losing access to some supplies on which they had previously depended this should have prompted a more considered debate about what should come next rather than an abrupt transition away from russian energy supplies russia s actions in ukraine are clearly both unjustified and unconscionable but it makes little sense for europe to respond by damaging its own competitiveness and global standing it will take years for europe to recover from the unprecedented energy crisis that it has helped to create 2022 project syndicate
with us interest rates rising a portion of twitter s debt funding floating rate and an existing interest bill of more than us1 billion a year for a company that lost us221 million last year before the advertisers started fleeing the funding clearly needs restructuring the us33 5 billion of equity in the original structure was mostly provided by musk himself external investors provided just over us7 billion and musk the rest his latest sale of tesla shares suggests his commitment will rise and that he might even have to sell more of his shrinking tesla holdings if the attempt to raise more external equity fails there are also reports that musk s bankers are themselves trying to restructure the loans which they were unable to syndicate and can t get off their balance sheets without incurring multi billion dollar losses according to bloomberg they re considering a swap of some of the more expensive debt in their package for margin loans backed by musk s remaining unencumbered tesla stock tesla s securities and exchange commission filings have shown that about half his remaining shares had been pledged for an existing margin loan putting up more of his tesla shares as collateral would be a high risk move for musk given that tesla s shares have plummeted this year since the twitter bid was announced tesla s market capitalisation has fallen from us1 2 trillion to us474 billion that s a fall of about 60 per cent to put that decline into perspective the tech heavy nasdaq index has fallen about 29 per cent over the same period and the new york fang index which includes tesla and other mega tech stocks like apple amazon and facebook 35 per cent loading tesla shareholders are angry that musk their chief executive is essentially living in twitter s headquarters and devoting his time and attention to twitter rather than their company which has been experiencing difficulties in a flat lining covid impacted china and a rapidly slowing us auto market with a forward price earnings multiple of more than 30 tesla s share price remains vulnerable and the tie musk has created with a floundering twitter won t help tesla shareholders there is now a twitter shadow over tesla that includes an over hang in the market from the liens on musk s shareholdings and the potential for margin calls and or further sales the chaotic and frenetic management style musk has demonstrated at twitter would be unsettling for his bankers and tesla shareholders concerned about his financial and mental stability he fired half twitter s employees at once and then discovering he actually needed some tried without much success to rehire some of them he has installed beds in twitter s offices for the hardcore workers who remain and also threatened not to pay redundancies musk isn t paying twitter s rent and is seemingly managing the company through an incessant and erratic stream of tweets but there s a glimmer of light defying some predictions that were based on the mass exodus of twitter s engineers the platform hasn t broken down and the volume of posts on twitter seem to have increased significantly the flip side of that is the return of anti semitic material and the far right which with the demolition of the teams and processes responsible for twitter s content moderation data security and privacy protections and musk s own arbitrary banning and shadow banning of users has caught the attention of regulators the european union has already warned him that it could ban twitter in europe or fine it six per cent of its global revenues if it doesn t have mechanisms for identifying and removing illegal or harmful content the eu s digital services act that came into force last month has very strict data protection rules and standards that target hate speech and disinformation elon musk s libertarian ambition of turning twitter into a digital town square has run into trouble credit ap musk may see himself as a free speech purist but if he wants to retain access to europeans he might have to re hire a lot of the content moderators he s sacked the committee on foreign investment in the us is also scrutinising the outside investors in musk s bid structure to see whether there is any risk to national security and congress is investigating twitter and other social media platforms for their handling of user s data and their role in spreading misinformation and disinformation there are also cases before the us supreme court that could make platforms liable for promoting illegal or harmful content musk s libertarian ambition of turning twitter into a digital town square governed by the principle of free speech absolutism is destined to collide with the ambition of lawmakers to protect users privacy suppress hate speech and other harmful content and stamp out disinformation in the real world if not in musk s mind freedom of expression has some limits
washington dc the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultationwith cambodia cambodian gdp growth rebounded in the second half of 2021 driven mainly by exports of goods but this year the economy has been buffeted by developments in china the slowdown in consumer demand in advanced countries the us and europe are significant markets for cambodian manufactures and tighter global financial conditions mainly via external demand but also funding costs for some financial institutions inflation surged following significant increases in fuel and fertilizer costs export orders for the second half of the year have weakened and the real estate market is slowing despite the new pressures the recovery is projected to continue real gdp growth is forecast to be 5 percent in 2022 after the strong export performance earlier in the year and nearly 5½ percent in 2023 supported by the continued recovery of tourism and ongoing policy support although dampened by external pressures and the impact of rising prices on real disposal income inflation is expected to peak this year be lower in 2023 and decline further thereafter assuming it remains mostly confined to imported goods uncertainty around the outlook is particularly high and risks are tilted to the downside the most pressing risks are from rising private debt conditions in key large economies and inflation the public finances are expected to gradually improve spending pressures and lower than expected tax revenue resulted in a fiscal deficit of just over 7 percent of gdp in 2021 the deficit is expected to narrow to just over 4 percent of gdp in 2022 with a strong bounce back in revenues widen somewhat in 2023 and decrease further thereafter public debt carrying capacity remains vulnerable to further shocks to exports and growth but risks of external and overall debt distress remain low so long as public debt is constrained in the future and the increase in private debt is not associated with an increase in contingent liabilities of the sovereign executive board assessment executive directors welcomed cambodia s strong economic recovery from the pandemic supported by the country s strong economic buffers and robust crisis response directors agreed that the growth outlook is broadly favorable notwithstanding downside risks from slower external demand and rising domestic vulnerabilities including elevated levels of private debt in that context they encouraged the authorities to calibrate fiscal policy to help support vulnerable households without compromising price stability while also taking steps to address financial sector risks and corruption vulnerabilities directors encouraged the national bank of cambodia to rein in credit growth by gradually restoring monetary conditions to pre crisis levels they saw merit in normalizing prudential conditions to pre pandemic settings with heightened supervision and readiness to raise provisioning requirements directors also underscored the importance of implementing corporate insolvency debt and bank restructuring and deposit protection frameworks directors supported the authorities current fiscal plans to provide insurance against downside risks to aggregate demand while maintaining steady reduction in fiscal deficits over the medium term however given wide external imbalances and strong credit growth they emphasized that fiscal support should be well targeted social protection measures should continue to be used to protect the poor against the effects of inflation coupled with offsetting cuts elsewhere directors noted the importance of policy frameworks to ensure resilience over the longer term they encouraged efforts to enhance spending efficiency and strengthen revenue mobilization including by broadening the tax base and rationalizing exemptions a debt anchor in nominal terms combined with an overall deficit ceiling would provide a credible framework particularly as cambodia seeks to develop a market for sovereign debt the recent issuance of the first domestic government bond is a welcome development directors underscored the importance of complementary structural policies to support strong inclusive growth they welcomed the progress made in implementing anti corruption action plans and encouraged continued efforts to strengthen governance frameworks more broadly directors also emphasized the need for structural measures to boost productivity to help raise living standards and to durably restore external balances given the pegged nominal exchange rate they also underscored the importance of improving data quality through capacity development and encouraged the authorities to build on recent efforts to strengthen climate adaptation and mitigation it is expected that the next article iv consultation with cambodia will be held on the standard 12 month cycle under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement the imf holds bilateral discussions with members usually every year a staff team visits the country collects economic and financial information and discusses with officials the country s economic developments and policies on return to headquarters the staff prepares a report which forms the basis for discussion by the executive board at the conclusion of the discussion the managing director as chairman of

the central bank torch will pass to the bank of japan next week even though the consensus is for no policy changes the prospects for the yen have started to improve heading into a potentially stormy year there s also a heavy dose of data releases from canada and the united states boj to tighten next year economic developments in japan have been encouraging lately raising speculation that the central bank might finally consider an exit from its decade long stimulus program inflation has fired up and is currently running at 3 7 the tankan survey suggests business conditions are improving and the government has unveiled a 200bn spending package to shield consumers and boost wages the bank of japan will conclude its meeting on tuesday and despite all this economic progress it is not expected to adjust policy while inflation has accelerated wage growth hasn t picked up as much speed so policymakers can argue that inflation dynamics are not self sustaining yet with the economy also contracting last quarter it s probably too early for any tightening moves nevertheless it is becoming clear that policy changes are coming possibly next year not only is the economic landscape improving but governor kuroda also opened the door to adjusting yield curve control recently the strategy that has decimated the yen by extension the stars seem to be aligning for a comeback in the yen most of the elements that ravaged the currency this year widening interest rate differentials soaring energy prices and a lack of tourism have started to reverse looking into next year the boj might start to tighten just as foreign central banks end their own tightening cycles with recession risks also intensifying in other major economies rate differentials could continue to compress meanwhile oil prices have declined and tourists are allowed to visit japan again helping to boost demand for the currency add everything together and it s a solid setup for the yen which might come from behind to be the surprise winner of 2023 as the global economy tips over one crucial variable will be who will replace kuroda as boj governor when his term expires in april if traders get the sense it will be someone more open to raising rates that could be the catalyst for the comeback deluge of us data in the world s largest economy there s a barrage of second tier data releases coming up the ball will get rolling on tuesday with housing data for november which has increased in importance lately as investors view the housing market as a barometer for how much interest rate increases are affecting the economy consumer confidence data for december will hit the markets on wednesday before the week concludes with durable goods orders personal income and spending and the latest core pce price index on friday new home sales are out on the same day the federal reserve resorted to shock tactics this week signaling it will raise rates beyond 5 and keep them there until the end of next year even though this message was much more hawkish than market pricing which currently sees rates ending next year at 4 3 the dollar fell in the aftermath it seems that investors didn t really buy it there s a sense that the fed is either bluffing to tighten financial conditions or that a weakening economy next year will force policymakers to renege on their rate promises either way it s never a good sign when a currency cannot rally on positive news the reaction function in the dollar has turned asymmetric lately negative developments tend to hurt the reserve currency more than positive developments boost it something that was on full display this week after the us inflation report and the fed decision this dynamic likely reflects how crowded the long dollar trade was just a few weeks ago but it could also be a sign that the tide is turning all told the outlook for the dollar appears neutral as it is difficult to envision either massive losses or massive gains from here on the bearish side us inflation is simmering down and traders clearly don t believe the fed will follow through on its rate plans that said other major economies are in even worse shape than america so the world s reserve currency is unlikely to enter a full blown downtrend while europe and china are so fragile canadian data releases across the canadian border there s another flurry of data on the menu starting with retail sales on tuesday then on wednesday the latest inflation report will be released ahead of the monthly gdp print for october on friday investors will inevitably focus on the inflation prints as those will be the most crucial for what the bank of canada does next market pricing suggests the tightening cycle is probably finished already assigning just a 50 chance for another small rate hike next year as for the canadian dollar its fate is linked to oil prices and global risk sentiment so it is difficult to be optimistic heading into a potentially stormy 2023 with stock market valuations still expensive and global economic momentum fading
