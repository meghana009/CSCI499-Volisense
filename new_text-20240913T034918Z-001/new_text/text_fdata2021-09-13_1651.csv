a key part of my job as the individual investor product manager here at morningstar australia is to know as much about our subscribers investing habits as possible in a little over two years at morningstar i have been constantly surprised by the domestic bias of our subscribers that is their tendency to only invest in local shares a recent survey of our premium subscribers shows that the average allocation to international investments is 21 and 54 of subscribers have no international exposure in their portfolio context is crucial here so i am going to use my own portfolio as an example not because i ve done it all right on the contrary but because a real life example will better show what s at stake like most things in life i m striving to become a better investor this is a personal example but i think it nevertheless highlights some of the crucial principles of this investing guide the anatomy of my portfolio by using morningstar s portfolio x ray tool i can establish the following global exposure of my portfolio as background it is important to note that i am an american citizen who lived in the united states for the majority of my working life before moving to australia 4½ years ago like many individual investors i exhibit a high degree of home bias home bias is the natural tendency to invest domestically because of familiarity with local companies and economic conditions home bias goes beyond just individual investors some of the biggest names in the investment world warren buffett jack bogle and peter lynch among them are not immune to a remarkable degree of home bias and as they have each said investing in what you know and products you re familiar with makes sense so is home bias that bad the answer is it depends as we will explore below the impact of home bias depends on the size and concentration of the local market how does my portfolio compare to the global market like many of you reading this i ve ended up with a portfolio that on the surface doesn t reflect the globalised economy the question is how far off am i one easy comparison to make is to look at the ftse global all cap index this index is intended to represent the global stock market it includes large mid and small cap stocks from all the markets across developed and emerging markets vanguard uses it as a benchmark for their products that track the global stock market compared to the ftse global all cap index i am overweight us stocks the index calls for a 54 1 allocation to the united states i have a 73 66 allocation on a percentage basis that equates to a more than 36 difference between my allocation and the suggested allocation vs an absolute difference of 19 56 however the largest discrepancy between what i own and the index is australian shares i have a 9 69 allocation to australia that turns out to be quite a bit larger than the 2 2 allocated to australia in the index that means that my portfolio has an allocation that is 340 larger than the portion of the global index that australia accounts for consequently if you are 100 allocated to australia you are missing out on upwards of 97 of the global value of companies does it matter where a company is headquartered the portfolio x ray shows me that my top 5 holdings are intel 3m adp diageo and cisco they are all large cap companies and with the exception of diageo are all based in the us in a globalised economy with large multinational companies the location of a company s headquarters matters little take diageo for example is it a british company because it is based in london looking at their 2018 annual report i can see that revenue from great britain isn t even part of the reporting breakdown the company makes 24 of its revenue from a combined europe and turkey category north america leads the way with 34 of revenue conversely many of my american holdings earn large percentages of their revenue outside of the united states in 2018 more than 60 of 3m s revenue came from outside of the united states intel makes 80 of its revenue outside of the united states in australia there are certainly examples of companies that get the majority of their revenue from outside the country however the percentage of domestic revenue for the asx 200 is higher than many other indexes more than 60 of asx 200 revenue comes from australia while for the s p500 in the us the corresponding figure is about 40 and it s about 30 for the ftse 100 in the uk many of the largest australian companies and most popular holdings for our subscribers have a domestic focus examples of this include the big four banks and telstra global allocation how much is enough the obvious answer is that it depends on your personal situation it is safe to say that for the vast majority of people it isn t the 0 that 54 of our subscribers allocate to global shares nor is it the 2 2 that the index allocates to australian shares the morningstar portfolio construction guide contains five different defensive growth asset class combinations related to five different levels of risk conservative cautious balanced growth aggressive the recommended allocations to australian assets range from 36 in the conservative portfolio to 49 in the aggressive portfolio that is in stark contrast to many of our subscribers portfolios not to mention my own what are the impediments to international investing the purpose of this guide is to examine the reasons why our subscribers don t invest internationally the reasons make complete sense and echo some of my own experiences in trying to increase my global allocation the rationale that our subscribers gave for not having a higher global allocation 29 said they don t know enough about overseas markets 20 said they are concerned about currency risk 10 said they don t know what to invest in 7 said they don t know how to access investments in overseas markets at morningstar our mission is to empower you to make sound investing decisions we believe that being better informed about global investing is a means to that end along with the information contained in this guide we are happy to announce that we ve expanded our stock coverage to include global data and research where we previously covered 200 companies from australia and new zealand we re now adding research on 1300 additional global companies from north america europe and asia we hope you will find this guide useful happy investing introduction i wanted real adventures to happen to myself but real adventures i reflected do not happen to people who remain at home they must be sought abroad james joyce the australian stock exchange makes up just 2 of global sharemarkets that s a whopping 98 of the world s sharemarkets that remain untapped if your portfolio only includes australian investments within the asx 60 of companies belong to the banking and resources sectors this consequently means limited asset class diversification and little exposure to emerging industries investing overseas however can mitigate concentration risk while providing exposure to a great mix of stocks that are otherwise underrepresented in australia such as technology by spreading your investments and risks strategically you insulate yourself against the potentially nasty side effects of one market falling vanguard international shares index vs the s p asx 100 tr source morningstar in this guide we examine the benefits risks and idiosyncrasies of international investing and how to make it work for you why should you invest overseas a pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty winston churchill diversification diversification is a straightforward concept that is commonly misapplied and misunderstood the goal of building a diversified portfolio is to lower risk without affecting the level of returns the key question is what is the risk that you are trying to diversify away from at morningstar we think about risk differently than most of the financial industry who use terms such as price volatility and standard deviation traditional views of diversification prioritise the correlation between different assets classes and focus on creating a portfolio that contains asset classes that show little correlation in other words the portfolio contains some asset classes that are supposed to go up when other asset classes go down that way there is less short term volatility in the overall account value morningstar uses a simpler and more practical definition we define risk as losing money that can t be made back for investors that s the risk of not having enough money in time to retire or having to change your lifestyle so that your savings last throughout retirement take some time to think about your own view of risk and how fluctuations in your portfolio would affect your life if you are investing for the long term and can adequately cover any short term cash outlays with an emergency fund then perhaps your definition of risk is the same as ours the less value that an investor puts on the correlation of returns of different asset classes the more attention can be paid to building a portfolio of global investments that are trading at attractive prices compared to intrinsic value given our definition of diversification we see two main benefits of international investing first we think that investing globally can boost your chances of unearthing attractive investment opportunities there is an opportunity cost to limiting your investments to the australian market as we mentioned the asx comprises just 2 of global sharemarkets investors who limit themselves to domestic companies risk overlooking whole industries with potential for returns technology is a perfect example overseas the dominant names are apple microsoft samsung amazon alphabet and alibaba some of which fall under the snappy acronym we now know as the faangs innovation and entrepreneurship are still catching on here and we struggle to find a foothold in pharmaceuticals telecoms and cars as well in short there are innovative areas the australian market simply isn t large enough to cover composition of global sharemarket the second benefit of international investing is related to losing money that can t be made back for most people working and living in a country means the local economy can play a big role in determining your financial well being a downturn in the local economy can lead to or be caused by depressed prices in housing and the sharemarket at the same time your livelihood could suffer as economic upheaval often leads to wage cuts and job losses and if you re on the eve of retirement it could dramatically alter your circumstances this effect may be amplified for a country like australia that makes up a smaller percentage of the global economy as we learned during the 2008 global financial crisis the australian stock market is not immune to economic shocks on the other side of the world the local economy held up well and australia avoided a recession however the australian stock market still experienced similar losses to the us which was the epicentre of the crisis however it is hard to imagine a homegrown recession in australia caused by say a slump in housing or commodity prices making much of an impact on major markets in north america europe or asia risks of overseas investments most people talk about fear of the unknown but if there is anything to fear it is the known deepak chopra international investing presents a list of advantages but also a unique set of risks how you negotiate these risks will again depend on your personal circumstances and risk appetite in addition to garden variety investing risks you must also be aware of currency risk and political economic and regulatory risk currency risk currency risk means that you re vulnerable to changes in exchange rates obviously as any income or capital gains losses generated overseas will need to be converted to australian dollars you ll be at the mercy of the dollar s performance against its overseas counterparts currency movements are notoriously difficult to predict fluctuations can be caused by the comparative performance of national economics shifts in global trade geopolitical risk and the perceived safety of one currency vis a vis another currency movements can have a devastating impact on investors with shorter time horizons for investors approaching or already in retirement who are relying on income or capital gains from their portfolios for day to day expenses a prolonged rise in the australian dollar and a high allocation to global investments can be a troublesome combination all investment decisions should take careful consideration of your personal circumstances global investing and your approach to currency risk is no different remember that the point of investing is to achieve your financial goals and enable you to maintain your desired lifestyle sometimes chasing the highest return is appropriate but this is seldom the case your success at investing often comes down to your ability to realistically assess what enables your lifestyle and what puts it at risk only then can you develop a portfolio that reflects your own circumstances it takes some time to determine what can affect your income and where you spend your money if either is influenced by global economic performance and exchange rates then you might have a different perspective on currency risk for instance a retiree with 100 of their portfolio allocated to australian shares who spends 20 of their income on international travel can be extremely vulnerable to falls in the australian dollar one way to address currency risk is to hedge your global investments a currency hedge involves using a financial instrument to eliminate currency risk in theory you could do this yourself but another approach is to purchase an exchange traded fund that is hedged against currency risk one example is the vanguard msci index international shares hedged etf vgad which receives a morningstar medallist rating of silver as of april 2019 this particular security gives you exposure to the msci world index ex australia which includes 1 578 stocks from around the world the fact that it is hedged means that the net asset value of the etf is unaffected by fluctuations between the australian dollar and all the currencies of the holdings currency hedging does entail a cost and the fees will be higher in this case we can see the exact hedging cost by looking at the vanguard msci index international shares etf vgs this etf also receives a morningstar medallist rating of silver and follows the same index but is un hedged meaning that the returns will be affected by currency fluctuations whereas the hedged fund charges an annual management fee of 0 21 the un hedged version charges a fee of 0 18 in this case the hedging cost is 03 per year political economic and regulatory risks political economic and regulatory risks can affect your investment portfolio no matter where you invest investors naturally feel more comfortable with such risks when investing in their home country in most cases this comfort is based on the illusion that you have more control in your home country than you would elsewhere technically you have more control over your own country s government because you have the right to vote however there are many cases when there is substantial opposition to a tax policy from which you benefit or a company or industry that you hold to see this in action look no further than the political and societal opposition to franking credit rebates and the banking and mining industry when investing overseas there are a couple key factors you should consider does the country in which you are investing respect the rule of law are there strong property rights is there a stable political system often overlooked are the country s corporate governance practices does management operate to enrich themselves or large shareholders who may be government entities or are they good stewards of shareholder capital one good way to asses this is the morningstar stewardship rating for stocks our equity analysts assign one of three stewardship ratings exemplary standard and poor based on management s stewardship of shareholder capital if you are investing in countries that have a history of poor corporate governance the morningstar stewardship rating can be a useful guide to how individual companies stack up how do you invest globally risk comes from not knowing what you re doing warren buffett the traditional way to get exposure to global markets was to purchase an actively managed fund or listed investment company lic that specialises in global investing in the past 15 years however the advent of the exchange traded fund or etf has expanded the options available investors between the three investment vehicles actively managed funds lics and etfs investors have a wide number of strategies to choose from morningstar alone rates 101 global equity strategies you can use an online brokerage account to buy units in lics and etfs managed funds can either be purchased through your online broker or directly through the fund manager by completing an application which can usually be found at the back of the fund s product disclosure statement or on the fund s website investors can also buy direct equities in overseas markets through brokerage accounts all major brokers offer global investing with varying fee levels and exchanges brokerage fees have always been an impediment to purchasing direct equities but as investor demand has increased some brokers have dramatically lowered costs for

bloomberg house democrats are set to propose raising the corporate tax rate to 26 5 people familiar with the matter said among other plans that fall short of president joe biden s ambitions in a bid to help improve chances of passing a major social spending package democrats on the house ways and means committee plan to put forward an increase in the business rate that s currently 21 offering less than the 28 biden sought the people said on condition of anonymity because the measures aren t public yet the top rate on capital gains would rise from 20 to 25 instead of the 39 6 biden proposed that would have been equal to a new top rate on regular income the people said while the numbers are still subject to change before the proposal is officially released such scaled back plans would amount to an acknowledgment that even higher rates would have a tough time getting through congress after some moderate democrats expressed objections with thin majorities in both chambers democrats can afford just three defections in the house and none in the senate as they use a process called budget reconciliation that allows them to bypass republicans read quicktake how capital gains are taxed and what biden would do a spokesperson for ways and means committee chairman richard neal didn t respond to a request for comment sunday the panel is set to debate the tax portions of the bill tuesday and wednesday earlier sunday west virginia senator joe manchin a moderate democrat whose vote is crucial in the evenly split upper chamber renewed his objections to the 3 5 trillion tax and spending reconciliation plan he said he can t support the price tag doesn t see the urgency and is concerned about inflation and the impact of higher corporate taxes on u s competitiveness manchin speaking on cnn s state of the union floated a roughly 1 5 trillion headline number for the package safety net the ways and means panel and others in the house have already passed or have introduced major spending portions of the democrats plan to remake the u s safety net including a multi year extension of an expanded child tax credit paid family medical leave universal pre k and two free years of community college ways and means democrats are expected to propose raising the top individual income tax rate to 39 6 as sought by biden the people said the democrats would also propose a 3 surtax on individuals with adjusted gross income of over 5 million a proposal not included in biden s plans released earlier this year other proposals may fall short of what biden wants one change being contemplated is increasing the holding period for carried interest from three to five years the people said which would weaken a tax break rather than eliminating it entirely the carried interest tax break lets some private equity and hedge fund managers pay lower taxes on their pay the 2017 republican tax law required investment funds to hold their assets for more than three years instead of one year senate democrats have already been planning for the possibility of scaling back some of biden s proposals by focusing revenue raising efforts more toward businesses than individuals on friday senate finance committee chairman ron wyden introduced two new proposals likely to be included in the senate s overarching bill later this month an overhaul of tax treatment for business partnerships and a 2 excise tax on stock buybacks that was co sponsored by senate banking committee chairman sherrod brown of ohio such proposals are seen as less politically risky than the 28 corporate income tax rate the white house wants since multiple democratic senators have said they prefer a corporate rate closer to 25 while generating other revenue to make up the difference 2021 bloomberg l p

a judge ruled friday that a legal challenge to washington s new tax on capital gains can move forward the seattle times reports the ruling by douglas county superior court judge brian huber could ultimately lead to the state supreme court deciding whether the new capital gains tax constitutional the legal challenge takes aim at senate bill 5096 which passed this spring through the democratic controlled house and senate and was signed by gov jay inslee it creates a 7 tax on the capital gains of sales of assets like bonds and stocks above 250 000 the law takes effect january 2022 with the first state tax returns coming due in 2023 the law exempts a range of assets like retirement accounts sales of real estate livestock timber and some agricultural properties and some auto dealerships it also exempts the sales of sole proprietor businesses with gross revenues of up to 6 million if it takes effect the tax would raise about 445 million per year that money would go into the state s education legacy trust account intended for child care and early learning programs related capital gains tax signed into law in washington state the legal challenge is a consolidated case that started with different lawsuits against the state by several plaintiffs including the owners of farmland and the washington farm bureau that contends the new law among other things imposes an income tax in that scenario it could violate the washington constitution which states that taxes are to be applied uniformly across the same classes of property in his order cited among other things an allegation by plaintiffs that the new tax has already lowered the market value of their property and forced them to make tax planning decisions that impact their financial interests in a way that is concrete and non speculative the judge also denied a request by the attorney general s office that the case be moved to thurston county if it were to proceed in a statement solicitor general noah purcell said the attorney general s office disagreed with friday s ruling but we have every confidence that this law will ultimately be upheld stay connected with q13 news on all platforms download q13 news and weather apps watch q13 news live subscribe q13 fox on youtube daily brief sign up for our newsletter follow facebook twitter instagram
will the housing market ever cool off the housing market has been red hot since the pandemic began and home sales have remained elevated in this episode of the five recorded on aug 23 fool contributors jeremy bowman brian withers and toby bordelon dig into the drivers behind rising home sales and discuss what s next in the residential real estate market 10 stocks we like better than airbnb when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and airbnb wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 brian withers we re going to move to the third news item and home sales are up again this month it s really interesting there was a 12 month low in may and so things have climbed for the last couple of months but if you go back to october the october 2020 high was a significant high for like back through 2008 so the places where things are and maybe rather than just me draw the thing with my hands let me share the slide here so this is home sales over the last decade so let s make a little bar column this looks easier you can see that this month was almost i want to say 6 million home sales last month other than these few months here this number you go back 25 years and it s a high going all the way back to like 2007 so this is a pretty high water mark as far as home sales go in the u s and it was sort of fascinating to me and so i m wondering if this trend is going to continue you ve got the remote work thing going on the delta variant has potentially accelerated sales for the coming month so what the heck is going on with home sales and do you think it will continue over the next year or so jeremy why don t you take this one first jeremy bowman well yeah i think that the housing market has been pretty crazy since the pandemic started and i think what we re dealing with now is nobody really knows for sure what the post pandemic situation as far as remote work and all that stuff is going to be i don t know anybody who is like oh yeah i m definitely going back to the office five days a week and everybody i talk to is like well maybe after labor day it might be part time the delta variant has thrown all this stuff into the air there s even more uncertainty than we thought we were dealing with before so i think of all the trends we ve seen during the pandemic with e commerce and cloud computing zoom and all these things that have taken off and gotten traction i think remote work is probably going to be the stickiest a lot of people seem to like it it obviously offers benefits for parents and other people who maybe need to check out for a few minutes during the day or have other needs to attend to i don t think anybody really misses commuting so if you have the freedom to work from wherever you want you re going to take advantage of that and so i think the trend that covid sparked with people moving out of high priced cities and looking for more space and re evaluating or balancing what that quality of life looks like it s going to continue i think another point worth mentioning is that airbnb abnb 3 22 and these vacation rental or home sharing sites have really taken off now your home is a monetizable asset in a way it wasn t before and if you can remote work if you re a single person you can just rent out your apartment or whatever for a month and go travel and do that sort of thing that may not be directly related to the housing market but i think it might change the way people think of it or hey i can buy this beach house and just rent it out when i m not there i think that s going to also drive the housing market as well toby bordelon yeah i do agree that the work from home trend i think is going to continue i think that s going to be here to stay in some form i don t know that it s going to have a huge impact in the housing market long term though i think eventually we re going to level off like we are going to see these sales level off or at least the rate of increase is going to slow in terms of price increases a lot of what we re dealing with we talked about this before a lot is supply issues eventually that rectifies itself it will take a while we re talking about housing it s not something that you can say let me build a few more computers and we re good to go it takes a while to build the house and it takes a lot of skilled labor to build a house that s another part of the equation but eventually we re going to get there i m also seeing though stories of increasing rents in places like new york city like back to pre pandemic levels and even above indicating that this whole narrative of people fleeing the cities might not be all it s cracked up to be just like you think back two years ago people were talking about millennials don t want to own homes in the suburbs well as it turned out they did they just couldn t afford them and as it turns out people do like living in cities to some extent i think back to when i lived in new york i didn t move to new york for a job i decided to look for a job in new york because i wanted to live there i wanted the career and i wanted to do the work that was done in new york but i made a conscious decision that s where i want to be let me look for a job there not oh i have this great opportunity i guess i have to move to new york just because you can work from home doesn t negate the social and entertainment value of being in a particular place and the lifestyle of being in that place and if that s what you want that s what you want at least for a time so i could certainly see that even if law firms and accounting firms and all kinds of offices and people within offices in new york are saying you don t have to come to the office all the time people could say cool but i still want to live here how am i going to make that happen and maybe that means you to have a bigger place or whatever but i think just because we re going to see a trend where we work from home doesn t mean that there s suddenly going to be this perpetual increase in prices eventually it will settle out and people will be where they want to be both to live and then work however they want to work you re going to see a reshaking and a rethinking of things but we ll come to an equilibrium again at some point

over five million students face food insecurity while at college however some people may think that food insecurity is not a problem at syracuse university which is simply incorrect according to su about 80 of students receive some type of financial aid many students live off campus and cannot afford sufficient food to satisfy all nutritional requirements and we should also be cognizant of the community members from surrounding areas that also face food insecurity su administration should be doing much more to help community members help those facing food insecurity as it is our collective responsibility to look out for one another and the local community according to lynn hy chief development officer of the food bank of central new york there are numerous ways students can aid food insecure individuals many students aren t aware that su has two food pantries one in hendricks chapel and one on south campus which provide food cleaning supplies and other essentials to any su or suny esf student hy also said that volunteerism is imperative to helping food insecure individuals hunger exists everywhere and that includes on syracuse university s campus hy said volunteerism encompasses a multitude of involvement opportunities one way to contribute is by donating items which significantly benefit food pantries no matter if the donations are canned foods toiletries or other items fundraising is another mode of volunteerism because without fundraising community organizations will not have the financial means to serve the community another mode of volunteerism is facilitation and there are several ways in which it aids food pantries examples of facilitation include coordinating food drives with registered student organizations and arranging a time to ask for donations around the community as a community we should recognize that there are people in our community who face food insecurity and we must provide adequate resources simply giving time to support local food operations whether through volunteering to stock shelves transporting people to food drives or assisting local organizations such as the food bank of central new york and the kids cafe is a tremendous relief to the community additionally su needs to make it easier for su community members not facing food insecurity to aid those who are for example many students do not regularly go to hendricks chapel or south campus so it would be helpful to have multiple donation drop off boxes across campus such as in resident halls outside of apartment buildings and near the schine student center providing multiple donation locations could reduce students waste while also aiding people in need once multiple donation drop off spots are established su can upload a map of all the contribution points to their website with a page explaining the significance and impact of the donation boxes providing transparency by su on how community members can make contributions establish a straightforward donation system and create more opportunities for donations because of the simplicity of the map if we all practice volunteerism it would go a long way as it takes a village to ensure that everyone has access to nutritional nourishment whether you donate time or food your contributions will not go unnoticed we need to hold su responsible and make sure no student ever has to decide between paying for books or lunch andrew lieberman is a junior citizenship and civic engagement and political science dual major his column appears biweekly he can be reached at

nysearca ung is up 90 1 over the timeframe natural gas bulls have rising gas demand and a supply crunch to thank for the impressive gains an unusually cold winter in europe as well as a global rebound from covid 19 have triggered strong demand and depleted natural gas inventories meanwhile hurricane ida has knocked out a considerable amount of gas production with 77 of oil and gas production still offline in the gulf of mexico according to u s government statistics natural gas inventories are currently 17 lower compared to a year ago and 7 below the five year average here are 2 more ways to play the natural gas boom natural gas henry hub usd mmbtu source business insider 1 buy chesapeake commodity price hedging is a popular trading strategy frequently used by oil and gas producers as well as heavy consumers of energy commodities such as airlines to protect themselves against market fluctuations during times of falling crude prices oil and gas producers normally use a short hedge to lock in oil prices if they believe prices are likely to go even lower in the future according to tudor pickering holt co via barron s the majority of the energy companies they cover have hedged away significant portions of fourth quarter cash flow about 85 hedged on average in the us unfortunately hedging also means that these companies are unable to enjoy the benefits of rising gas prices and can in fact lead to hedging losses however some bold producers betting on a commodity rally hedge only minimally or not at all tudor pickering rates chesapeake energy nyse chk a buy saying the company remains one of the few producers that remain relatively unhedged this might come off as an odd pick given chesapeake s history but somehow makes sense at this point widely regarded as a fracking pioneer and the king of unconventional drilling chesapeake energy has been in dire straits after taking on too much debt and expanding too aggressively for years chesapeake borrowed heavily to finance an aggressive expansion of its shale projects the company only managed to survive through rounds of asset sales which management is averse to debt restructuring and m a but could not prevent the inevitable chesapeake filed for chapter 11 in january 2020 becoming the largest u s oil and gas producer to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years thankfully chesapeake successfully emerged from bankruptcy this year with the ongoing commodity rally offering the company a major lifeline the new chesapeake energy has a strong balance sheet with low leverage and a much more disciplined capex strategy the company is targeting 2 billion of fcf over the next 5 years enough to improve its financial position significantly chk shares are up 35 since its march comeback

status modified general community quarantine mgcq both health authorities and local officials were confident in responding to the increase of infections a spillover from the parties and gatherings during the holiday season that preceded however when the third wave came in the middle of the year the region s healthcare system particularly in cebu buckled as the rapid transmission of the virus resulted in more infections more patients seeking hospital care and unfortunately more deaths hospitals were overwhelmed with patients waiting for admission along the streets medical grade oxygen cylinders were selling fast and cebu city government officials started looking for more burial spaces as bodies of confirmed and suspected covid 19 patients pile up these were just some of the proofs of how deadly the dreaded delta variant is in this two part special feature we will look back on the recent wave of infections that hit cebu island and how cebuanos are now gradually recovering and learning from its worst surge yet the delta variant last july 29 the department of health doh reported the first batch of confirmed cases of the delta variant in central visayas and all of these came

states government the world health organization who in addition recently confirmed that the mutation is the dominant strain in the philippines and community transmission is evident but by the time they made the announcement the central visayas office of doh doh 7 had long suspected that the delta variant was responsible for the latest covid 19 surge in cebu read local delta cases in region 7 reach 83 as who confirms community transmission 24k new cases in 1 month when august came the entire island of cebu had consistently recorded triple digits in the number of new covid 19 cases per day

infection were reported in cebu in the same period from figures to scenarios on the ground beyond the figures the situation here took a morbid and grim turn with experts from the national scene describing the outbreak as cebu s worst surge yet it began with ambulances lining up outside cebu city s largest hospitals an indication that these are reaching overwhelming levels some officials blamed the lack of manpower in covid dedicated treatment facilities for this read hospital occupancy on the rise but officials say outbreak still manageable no sooner customers were seen crowding the pharmacies and stores selling medical equipment as medical grade oxygen used to aid patients confirmed or suspected to have the infection became a hot commodity fortunately its supply remained stable despite an increase in demand read no hoarding of medical oxygen seen in cebu then there was the issue on the handling of cadavers even funeral parlors here were overwhelmed as bereaved families try to book cremation machines in cebu city at least two funeral homes can do cremation the standard process for patients who succumbed to covid 19 the roman catholic church here also extended help to the city government after they approved the latter s request to open more burial spaces in catholic cemeteries read archdiocese of cebu approves giving tomb space to cebu city as of august 31 doh 7 has

cebu city philippines the implementation of another round of stricter community quarantine revived the anxieties and uncertainties that cebuanos felt in 2020 but the ongoing covid 19 vaccination rollout provided the much needed hope of living normal lives soon while under modified enhanced community quarantine mecq the three largest cities cebu lapu lapu and mandaue continue to inoculate more and more individuals against the infection furthermore their immunization coverage rates are starting to pick up cebu officially began the rollout of covid 19 vaccines last march with healthcare workers assigned at the vicente sotto memorial medical center vsmmc the largest covid referral hospital in central visayas healthcare workers who were constantly exposed and at risk of getting the infection were the government s priority in their vaccination campaign by august central visayas achieved a significant milestone after the department of health here doh 7 reported that around 92 percent of the region s more than 131 000 medical frontliners were already fully vaccinated against the infection however the turnout remains low among senior citizens the second most vulnerable group

emergency use authorization eua for children ages 12 to 15 years old vaccination vs delta variant the delta variant is currently the dominant strain of sars cov 2 in the philippines and the u s it is responsible for most of the severe and critical cases of covid 19 and experts both local and abroad point to vaccination as the most effective protection against the infection the covid 19 vaccines approved or authorized in the united states are highly effective at preventing severe disease and death including against the delta variant the centers for disease control and prevention cdc said but they are not 100 percent effective and some fully vaccinated people will become infected called a breakthrough infection and experience illness for all people the vaccine provides the best protection against serious illness and death it added local health experts shared the same observation and added that consistency in following health protocols such as the constant wearing of face masks frequent hand washing and physical distancing would serve as added protection to date there are no reported deaths in central visayas due to the covid 19 vaccine health officials dismissed most mortalities reportedly linked to the vaccination due to lack of evidence read 85 of covid related deaths in private hospitals unvaccinated incentivizing vaccinated individuals the vaccination rollout and a growing number of people getting vaccinated also gave the public and private sector something to look forward to a gradual and safe reopening of the already battered economy and one of their solutions is to provide more mobility for fully inoculated people especially now that the government s vaccination drive has included non medical essential workers tagged as a4 they are the second biggest pool among all sub priority groups qualified to receive free covid 19 vaccines in central visayas based on the data from the visayan vaccination operations center vvoc close to 1 million people belonged to the a4 subgroup in cebu city the local government allowed restaurants and other similar establishments to offer dine in services for those who are either partially or fully vaccinated against covid 19 all they have to do is present their vaccination cards the move earned praises from business communities here and in metro manila cebu province for its part decided to shorten the quarantine period for fully inoculated returning overseas filipinos rofs and overseas filipino workers ofws arriving at the mactan cebu international airport mcia and residing here from seven to only five days vaccination status the 2020 census showed that central visayas population has grown to 8 million around 3 million more than the 5 million recorded in 2015 a total of 2 23 million doses of covid 19 vaccines as of september 9 were already administered in all four provinces cebu bohol siquijor and negros oriental according to the report from the vvoc of this number approximately 1 7 million are from cebu further breakdown of the figures translates to 997 652 individuals who already received their first dose and 666 391 who got their second dose and were considered as fully vaccinated overall the covid 19 immunization rate in the island province currently stands at 20 percent for those partially vaccinated 1st dose and 13 percent for those who completed their inoculation schedule 2nd dose in cebu city officials are aiming to achieve herd immunity as it targets to inoculate 700 000 of its population of 960 000 by december and they are optimistic in reaching the goal as long as the supply of covid 19 vaccines is steady enough to meet demand as of september 9 the same data from vvoc showed that the city already vaccinated 310 690 individuals for the 1st dose while 194 672 were already fully vaccinated against covid 19 cebu as an island has a total population of roughly 5 1 million lessons from the fruitful mecq when september came the covid 19 situation in cebu began to improve while hospitals have yet to fully recover from being overwhelmed fewer admissions were already made this month read covid situation in cebu city improves octa as of september 9 the doh s covid

sacrifices did not go to waste read eoc welcomes cebu city s shift to gcq in addition their reminders have also evolved instead of simply reiterating their calls to continue to follow health protocols

washington senior house democrats are coalescing around a draft proposal that could raise as much as 2 9 trillion to pay for most of president biden s sweeping expansion of the social safety net by increasing taxes on the wealthiest corporations and individuals the preliminary proposal which circulated on and off capitol hill on sunday would raise the corporate tax rate to 26 5 percent for the richest businesses and impose an additional surtax on individuals who make more than 5 million the plan could be a critical step for advancing the 3 5 trillion package which is expected to include federally funded paid family leave address climate change and expand public education while it is unclear whether the entire house tax writing committee supports the proposal it suggests plans to undo key components of the 2017 republican tax law although some provisions fall short of what mr biden proposed earlier this year but the revenue provisions outlined in a document obtained by the new york times and reported earlier by the washington post fall short of fully financing the entire package democrats are cobbling together despite promises by mr biden and democratic leaders that it would be fully paid for in order to assuage concerns from moderates in their caucus

while washington bickers about what if anything has been achieved after 20 years and nearly us 5 tn spent on forever wars there is one clear winner the us defence industry in iraq and afghanistan the american military apparatus relied to an unprecedented degree on private contractors for support in virtually all areas of war operations contractors supplied the trucks planes fuel helicopters ships drones weapons and munitions as well as support services from catering and construction to info tech it and logistics the number of contractors on the ground actually outnumbered us troops most years of the conflicts by the summer of 2020 the us had 22 562 contractor personnel in afghanistan roughly twice the number of american troops the gravy train for the defence industry was also fueled by the way the wars were budgeted and paid for congress used emergency and contingency funding that circumvented the normal budget process for the first decade of the conflict the us used emergency appropriations which are typically reserved for one off crises such as floods and hurricanes detailed spending oversight was minimal and because this type of spending is excluded from budget projections and deficit estimates it enabled everyone to sustain the pretense that the wars would be over shortly predator drone the result was what former defence secretary robert gates termed a culture of endless money inside the pentagon the defence department made the operational decisions managed the bidding process for contractors awarded the contracts largely using non competitive bids and kept at least 10 of the wartime funding in classified accounts not even the financial crisis of 2008 could interrupt the spending spree while congress imposed across the board spending caps on government programmes war spending was specifically excluded the pentagon was able to use the special contingency war budget to buy upgrades services and new equipment that were barely related to iraq or afghanistan consequently the pentagon budget kept growing and was able to double its size between 2001 and 2020 defense stocks outperformed the stock market overall by nearly 60 during the afghanistan war as the war spending surge enabled a wave of consolidation in the industry the big five lockheed martin boeing general dynamics raytheon and northrop grumman and a handful of others acquired the next tier of manufacturers such as hughes aircraft and mcdonnell douglas in the year to june 2020 the big five accounted for nearly a third of the us 480 bn obligated by the pentagon to defense contractors while only a fraction of these sales went specifically for iraq and afghanistan the conflict was highly lucrative for all the major defense contractors for example lockheed martin manufactured the black hawk helicopters used extensively in afghanistan boeing sold aircraft and land combat vehicles raytheon won the major contract for training the afghan air force and northrup grumman and general dynamics supplied electronics and communications equipment thousands of subcontractors around the world earned money from selling night vision goggles engines sandbags communications equipment and all manner of stuff to the war effort and global oil companies were key war beneficiaries since the pentagon is the world s single largest purchaser of fuel not surprisingly much of the wartime expenditures were highly wasteful the inspectors generals for afghanistan and iraq the wartime contracting commission and the pentagon s own inspector general all documented waste profiteering corruption and ghost spending money spent on activities that turned out not to exist at all according to government analysts the net result of the large scale private sector involvement in iraq and afghanistan was to increase materially the cost of war operations much of the us 145 bn reconstruction money was spent on questionable projects with budgets that seemed excessive or simply could not be accounted for many such projects now destroyed and dilapidated have littered the front pages over the past week the us presence on the ground may now be over but america will still have to digest the huge price tag the wars were paid for entirely with borrowed money rather than raising taxes a first in us military history and the us still owes 2tn in future veterans benefits this financial hangover will be compounded by the need to replace what has been destroyed or simply left behind and to pay for the weapons and equipment purchased during the last 20 years of go go defense spending the legacy of the post 9 11 defense spending binge will continue to gobble up the us budget for years to come the guardian
washington sept 12 reuters u s senator joe manchin on sunday said lawmakers were unlikely to pass their massive budget package by democrats sept 27 deadline adding that he could support a smaller 1 5 trillion bill manchin a west virginia moderate who has urged a pause on fellow democrat u s president joe biden s 3 5 trillion domestic spending plan said while he supported some provisions such as universal preschool he did not back clean energy and other measures the plan would also have to include a competitive tax code to help pay for it he told cnn adding he could support a domestic spending bill costing between 1 trillion and 1 5 trillion house speaker nancy pelosi had agreed to hold a sept 27 vote on a separate bipartisan 1 trillion infrastructure bill while biden and pelosi had hoped to pass both bills together centrist house democrats had objected and pressed for a vote on funding for roads and other projects first that could push back a vote on the domestic spending bill as democrats continue to hammer out a final number even as congressional committees move ahead with drafting portions of the package there s no way we can get this done by the sept 27 if we do our job he said on cnn s state of the union program we don t have the need to rush into this and get it done within one week he separately told nbc news meet the press program i could not support 3 5 trillion he added democrats have floated various ways to pay for the so called reconciliation spending package including taxing stock buybacks manchin said while he supported raising taxes on companies the bill must have globally competitive tax rates including citing a 28 capital gains tax rate a 25 corporate net rate and a 15 minimum corporate tax rate telling cnn they should all pay something democrats maintain a narrow grip on congress with vice president kamala harris holding a tie breaking vote in a 50 50 split senate and a six seat edge in the u s house of representatives those tight margins mean every senate democrat must be on board to pass most bills that lack republican support i don t think that i am the lone vote against the 3 5 trillion plan manchin told nbc senator bernie sanders an independent who caucuses with the democrats and holds large sway over the party s progressive wing separately said he believed both the infrastructure and the domestic spending bills would garner enough votes it would really be a terrible terrible thing for the american people if both bills went down and that is a real danger sanders said asked if he believes ultimately both bills would pass he told abc s this week with george stephanopoulos program i believe they will yes reporting by susan heavey additional reporting by humyra pamuk editing by lisa shumaker

fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more are you ready for the crash are you ready to see 10 25 or 40 of your portfolio vanish in the proverbial puff of smoke are you ready to question if you really should be investing anyway if you have the stomach for this if your father sister neighbour was right when they said this stock market thing was a casino and just too risky are you ready i hope so no not because i think a crash is coming but because i know it is i ve been doing this a very long time now i ve invested through a lot of different markets i ve lived through even more though it pains me to admit it there are a decent number of people reading this who don t even know about black monday in october 1987 when the world s stock markets absolutely tanked let me share part of the wikipedia description of that day all of the twenty three major world markets experienced a sharp decline in october 1987 when measured in united states dollars eight markets declined by 20 to 29 three by 30 to 39 malaysia mexico and new zealand and three by more than 40 hong kong australia and singapore yep really though i wasn t an active investor that day it s seared into my mind maybe you re old enough to remember the dot com crash again from wikipedia on friday march 10 2000 the nasdaq composite stock market index peaked at 5 048 62 by the end of the stock market downturn of 2002 stocks had lost 5 trillion in market capitalization since the peak at its trough on october 9 2002 the nasdaq 100 had dropped to 1 114 down 78 from its peak no it wasn t the absolute vertigo inducing one day fall of 1987 but the impact over 18 confidence sapping and portfolio draining months was twice as big four dollars in five had evaporated fast forward by the best part of a decade to the gfc here s how wikipedia describes the impact of the global financial crisis by march 6 2009 the had dropped 54 to 6 469 from its peak of 14 164 on october 9 2007 over a span of 17 months before beginning to recover and unless you ve been living under a rock you ll know the story of the covid crash the s p asx 200 index asx xjo fell by 37 in just over a month between mid february and mid march including its largest single day percentage drop since yep 1987 are you ready for a crash yet i hope so crashes can be brutal one day affairs or they can be drawn out 18 month grinding miseries they can feel like a sharp kick in the guts or a headache that just lingers they sap your confidence your will and your bank balance a crash is a brutal menacing mongrel of a thing so i hope you re ready because one is coming and you need to be prepared you need to be financially prepared don t invest any money you ll need in the next three to five years if your 100 000 portfolio becomes 75 000 50 000 or 40 000 overnight you don t want to be a forced seller you need to be emotionally prepared it is going to hurt like hell you will question yourself and you ll hate me you ll remember those doubts you had and wish you d taken your own advice not to get started investing or to sell last week last month or last year when you thought you should have you ll want to sell everything just to stop the pain the pain of looking at that poor beaten up share portfolio the pain of even more losses in the days weeks or months ahead worse a few of you will be forced to sell maybe even everything because you didn t listen unwisely borrowing to buy shares and the bank will call in the loan now are you prepared because a crash is coming and it s time to get prepared and here s what i think you should do buy shares what didn t i just say and then i said and the stories about yep all true worse there are people out there making predictions of just how soon that crash will come and how bad it ll be and i still want you to buy yep see investing isn t about avoiding the crashes oh i would if i could if i could know when the crash was coming and how bad it d be and how long it d last alas i m not blessed with such foresight neither unfortunately are you and those people who seem to know a crash is coming they ve known it for years it just never comes well maybe not never but just like the broken clock that is still right twice a day being seldom right is not only not very clever it s also useless see here s the thing that 87 crash the market finished 1987 higher than it started says wiki the gained 0 6 during calendar year 1987 so if you d been told to sell all of your shares on december 31 1986 because a crash was coming you d have actually missed out on making a small gain and the market went higher after that the stock market is higher than the pre dot com peak than the pre gfc peak than the pre covid peak in other words even if those stock market nostradamus had been right every one of those times and not been wrong the other 54 times following their advice and selling everything would actually have cost you money oh sure you can tell yourself you would have bought back in after each crash but the number of really smart sensible people who missed the post covid crash recovery is astonishing it s easy to believe you ll be different but it s bloody hard to do and the asx had mad back most of its losses within three months while covid cases were getting worse not better and i ll tell you now i did not forecast the covid crash i did not expect its suddenness or its depth i did not pick the speed or size of the recovery but you know what i did i bought shares during a pandemic during a crash am i freaking nuts yes yes and no respectively instead i was prepared it wasn t my first rodeo and while i had some personal experience under my belt i was also in the words of sir isaac newton standing on the shoulders of giants i was prepared i knew i wouldn t need to raid my portfolio to meet my living costs meaning i wouldn t be a forced seller during a market dip i had girded my loins for the fact that a crash was coming no i didn t know when where why or how bad i just knew that history is full of crashes and another one was almost as certain as death and taxes i knew it could would be bad i knew my portfolio would look sick that i would doubt myself that even though i knew these things i d still worry but like odysseus i metaphorically in my case tied myself to the mast lest the sirens call me onto the rocks you see both those who forecast crashes with regular inaccurate monotony and our innate desire to avoid more pain are the stock market sirens so by the way are those promising you get rich quick investments but that s another article and this is important because you need to know the track record of those who offer you investment advice i told our members and readers to do precisely the same yes while others panicked while they predicted doom and ran around like chicken little not because i was a better forecaster by the way in fact they very opposite i knew i didn t and couldn t know so i didn t waste time and money trying to pretend to be smarter than the average bear i just kept investing confident that the long term returns would justify my actions and i encouraged you to do the same and in future you we need to lash ourselves to our own investment masts i can t speak for you but i m planning to add regularly to my investments every payday between here and retirement at market lows at market highs neither of which i ll know at the time because you can only know those things in hindsight during booms during busts and if history is any guide some self appointed market gurus will keep making predictions of doom the whole time and if history is any guide the world s stock markets will likely continue to rise despite not in the absence of periodic crashes so i hope you re ready for the crash i hope that by being ready it won t take you by surprise and you won t do anything silly i hope that forewarned is forearmed and because we can t know when it ll come how bad it ll be and perhaps more importantly how far the market will rise before any crash arrives i hope you won t let predictions of doom scare you away i hope you ll invest regularly anyway fool on

the socialist equality party calls on working people in california to vote no in the election to recall governor gavin newsom and then to cast a replacement vote for our candidate educator david moore the only socialist running in this election a no vote is necessary to defeat the ultra right campaign aimed at overturning the results of the 2018 election and replacing newsom with a right wing republican most likely the fascistic radio talk show host larry elder but the sep advocates a no vote without the offering the slightest political support to newsom or the democrats on all the major issues confronting the working class the coronavirus pandemic the environmental crisis the corporate attacks on jobs and living standards the defense of democratic rights and the rights of immigrants the democrats and the republicans defend the profit interests of the ruling elite the overriding question is the need to mobilize the working class as an independent political force against both corporate controlled parties on the basis of a socialist program only the sep candidate david moore advances such a program california is in the middle of a deadly surge of covid 19 with thousands of preventable infections hospitalizations and deaths more than a dozen counties across the state have reached 100 percent icu capacity and have to redirect patients pediatric hospitalizations are higher than they were a year ago and with the reopening of schools to in person instruction the toll of infections and deaths among children is bound to skyrocket beyond deaths children can suffer long covid symptoms for months including fatigue and brain fog cognitive decline mood and anxiety disorders and kidney dysfunction the democrats have sought to frame the recall election as a contest in which newsom is protecting california and following the science while the republicans reject science and protective measures the truth is that both big business parties reject science driven measures to eradicate the virus and renounce basic public health measures like lockdowns and school closures in their drive to maintain corporate profits they insist that children must go back to school so that their parents can be forced back to their jobs the dispute within the ruling class is between those like newsom and president biden who peddle the fiction of mitigation that vaccines with occasional masking can contain the pandemic and republicans like larry elder and ex president trump who openly demand the end of any pretense that the pandemic can be contained and seek to remove even the most basic public health measures without any plan to eliminate transmission mitigation measures like masks and vaccines simply slow the rate at which people become infected the bipartisan plan is for covid 19 to become endemic with deadly outbreaks for generations to come as new variants emerge and immunity wanes in the recall election on tuesday there is only one party the socialist equality party standing in opposition to the mass infection of workers and children with sars cov 2 we demand a science based policy to eradicate the virus and eliminate its threat to public health we call for the formation of rank and file safety committees independent of the corporatist unions and big business parties in every workplace and neighborhood to enforce the closures and safety measures necessary to contain the pandemic the wealth exists to fully compensate workers and small businesses during a new lockdown to fully fund education and to massively invest in health care infrastructure the problem is that that wealth is currently possessed by a handful of billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic the government has provided trillions of dollars in bailouts to the banks in order to prop up the stock market the dow jones is reaching record highs and the country s billionaires have seen their wealth grow by 1 8 trillion over the course of the pandemic while ordinary americans face homelessness and hunger all the great problems confronting mankind the pandemic homelessness war the rise of fascism and authoritarianism climate change pose before the working class the necessity take political power in its own hands and to restructure social and economic life on the basis of social need not private profit the objective basis for a socialist movement is the growth of working class struggle the pandemic has enormously intensified class conflict in the us and internationally workers are beginning to fight back from volvo autoworkers in virginia frito lay workers in kansas mine workers in alabama dana auto parts workers teachers and health care workers throughout the country these struggles are part of a growing movement of workers throughout the world the development of the class struggle must be armed with a socialist program and led by a revolutionary party the socialist equality party and its sister parties in the international committee of the fourth international in the california gubernatorial election vote for david moore of the socialist equality party join the sep and take up the fight for socialism

the hill a newspaper covering congress reports that business lobbyists are pleased that they have watered down president biden s proposed tax increases on corporations and wealthy individuals one source identified as a lobbyist with ties to senate democrats tells the hill the business community has made progress with certain democrats on legitimate policy concerns with some of these proposals and their implications on the economy and international competitiveness what are those policy concerns that have successfully swayed moderate democrats the article does not specify we have the lobbyist s assurance that they are legitimate though this may come as a shock there is no actual requirement that lobbyists only advance legitimate policy concerns they are perfectly free to advocate completely self interested policy concerns as well indeed this unsavory practice has been known to happen from time to time what s more if the business lobbyists did happen to be pushing bad policy arguments simply because those arguments benefited the people who pay them they probably wouldn t admit this to a newspaper instead they would likely claim in public that their policy concerns are beneficent even if they are in fact utterly venal i don t mean to pick on the hill a paper that has supplied coverage of the biden agenda that is in many ways superior to that found in bigger publications media catering to capitol hill insiders like the hill have at least paid close attention to a significant development that has gained only fleeting notice in broader venues moderate democrats have slashed president biden s progressive tax agenda biden campaigned on a proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy by roughly 3 5 trillion over a decade nobody in washington currently believes he will sign a tax hike anywhere close to that magnitude the current predictions floating around politico s tax newsletter is one publication that has used this estimate peg the total at around a trillion give or take the most striking thing about the decision by moderate democrats to scale back biden s plan by some three quarters is that we have no idea what the rationale is according to the hill the lobbyists have argued that biden s plan would slow the u s recovery from the coronavirus recession it s not clear what basis they have for this conclusion if mainstream economists believe biden s tax hikes would imperil the recovery they aren t saying so publicly as economists like larry summers did when they loudly warned that biden s rescue plan would overheat the economy when the conservative american enterprise institute ran the numbers on biden s full tax increase proposal it found a negligible effect on economic growth reducing gdp 0 16 percent over the next decade increasing gdp by 0 19 percent in the following decade and reducing it by 0 18 percent over the longer run all those numbers are so tiny they are rounding errors tantamount to zero one of the most persuasive arguments at least judging from its results is the lobbying campaign to preserve a notorious loophole called stepped up basis or more colloquially the angel of death loophole here s how this loophole works normally if you sell an asset like a stock you pay tax on the profit if you bought 1 000 worth of gm stock and sold it for 2 000 you d pay taxes on the 1 000 capital gain however if you die and pass the asset on to your heirs then all the gains that occurred before you die are wiped from the books hence angel of death your heirs will only pay tax on the gain that occurred after they inherited the asset this exemption allows half of all capital gains to avoid any taxation ever the loophole is considered so ridiculous that conservatives often propose eliminating it as an alternative to increasing the estate tax jeb bush and mitt romney have both advocated eliminating the angel of death loophole biden is proposing to eliminate the loophole with the exception of a generous 1 million exclusion most capital gains belong to staggeringly wealthy fortunes worth well over 1 million former democratic senator heidi heitkamp is leading a lobbying campaign on behalf of wealthy benefactors looking to save the angel of death loophole heitkamp tells the hill with a straight face that the loophole is vital to protect an emerging entrepreneurial class within the hispanic community and within the african american community won t be able to take advantage of these tax rules if it is eliminated biden s proposal includes protections for family run businesses that does not satisfy heitkamp who argues in the hill s wording that many americans may think that wealthy and well connected people will most likely benefit from any exemptions and so in the name of americans who are cynical about well connected people benefiting from special exemptions heitkamp insists we keep in place a notorious loophole that almost exclusively benefits massively wealthy heirs heitkampf is also so committed to combating cynicism that she has declined to disclose the identities of her group s donors we can probably assume that they re mostly the hard scrabble black and latino small business owners she talks about so movingly in place of any well articulated public rationale the moderate democrats have instead put forward a transparently disingenuous pretext that their goal is to sign the infrastructure bill as fast as possible the ten house democrats led by josh gottheimer have insisted their goal in opposing the house budget is to get shovels into the ground as quickly as possible no labels the anti partisan group funded by wealthy financiers is running ads pretending gottheimer s clique is supporting biden s agenda emphasizing the infrastructure bill and making absolutely no mention of the tax dispute many reporters have repeated gottheimer s account of his motives at face value the hill s less blinkered account on the other hand frankly notes business interests have democratic allies in sens joe manchin w va and kyrsten sinema ariz and the group of house moderates led by rep josh gottheimer n j all have expressed concerns about the size of the spending plan and potential tax hikes since budget rules require any permanent costs be paid for and biden doesn t want to increase taxes on households earning less than 400 000 a year the size of his domestic policy legacy will be determined by how much new taxes on the rich he can get through congress his proposal is perfectly ample to finance a historic legacy a handful of moderate democrats are starving that legacy very very quietly if they had good reasons for their position you would probably know what they were update axios hans nichols reports that the congressional democratic bill is likely to jettison several biden proposals rates on corporate income and capital gains will rise but less than biden proposes an increase in estate taxes now looks unlikely raising the capital gains rate is facing the most internal opposition and it could end up staying at its current 23 8
auditors have discovered the state s database for criminal histories has a backlog of more than 58 000 records that need to be corrected or added to the repository arizona usa state auditors are casting a critical eye at the arizona database used for conducting background checks of people seeking certain types of jobs or work licenses the database also helps criminal justice officials decide whether defendants get plea bargains or sentencing leniency a report released friday by the auditor general s office said public safety may be put at risk by reporting gaps and a backlog in the central depository of criminal history records the arizona department of public safety maintains the database updating it with reports from law enforcement agencies and courts the department said it accepts most of the auditors findings and will implement multiple recommendations as of july 9 2021 the department reported it had approximately 58 500 bulk submitted offense and disposition records some of which date back more than 30 years that needed to be researched corrected and or entered into the central repository the auditor report stated dps told the auditors its backlog is the result of needing to prioritize other responsibilities and a lack of sufficient staff not maintaining an updated database could mistakenly give convicted felons access to fingerprint clearance cards or inhibit law enforcement from finding suspects in unsolved cases the auditors noted if criminal history information is missing from the central repository it may not be available to law enforcement agencies to assist in conducting their investigations auditors wrote in their report up to speed

alberto vilar enters manhattan federal court in july 2005 in new york the wealthy philanthropist who heads amerindo investment advisors inc was handed additional indictments after he had already been charged with investment advisor fraud securities fraud mail fraud wire fraud and four counts of money laundering louis lanzano ap a final twist in a drama filled life worthy of an opera alberto vilar died sept 4 at his home in queens new york city at the age of 80 just one week before the metropolitan opera house he loved would reopen after an 18 month closure the longest in its 138 year history in covering saturday s reopening associated press writer ronald blum described the event as a night to remember those who perished as it was in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the sept 11 2001 terror attacks but in fact marked much more the met performers played their home venue for the first time since hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic including met violist vincent lionti assistant conductor joel revzen and chorister antoine hodge blum said it also marked the first performance in the house since the death of conductor james levine the met s towering figure of the last half century not mentioned was vilar a former metropolitan opera board member with a front row seat whose name was removed from the grand tier of the met in 2003 after the opera said he failed to meet funding commitments before and after photos of a rock outside the gerald r ford amphitheater in vail vilar s name was removed after he failed to deliver on a pledge made to the amp courtesy illustration in vail vilar s name was removed from the gerald r ford amphitheater as vilar did not pay 1 5 million of the 3 5 million he pledged to the vail valley foundation for the 10 million remodeling of the structure vilar s 2 million donation made him the single largest contributor to the project but the foundation was forced to borrow 1 5 million to complete the remodeling the vail daily reported in 2005 support local journalism donate but the vilar performing arts center in beaver creek still bears vilar s name as the gifts mr vilar gave to our venue in exchange for naming rights were paid in full and not tied to mr vilar s separate and unrelated legal concerns said mike imhof the president of the vail valley foundation we have recently been informed of the passing of alberto vilar and we extend our condolences to his family imhof said the vilar performing arts center is grateful for the opportunity to bring world class entertainment to beaver creek year after year thanks to incredible support from this community the vilar performing arts center still bears the name of alberto vilar whose gifts in exchange for naming rights were paid in full according to the vail valley foundation courtesy photo broken promises funding commitments are of paramount importance in the world of opera as the grandiose performances enjoyed by audiences would not exist without patrons like vilar and the money they pledge in the 2010 book the management of opera by philippe agid and jean claude tarondeau it is noted that opera houses are incapable in both europe and the usa of generating sufficient income from the sale of tickets and other products to cover their operating costs therefore additional funding is needed as the box office only produces an average of 36 of the total income of opera houses in the u s and only half of that in europe agid and tarondeau note in europe public funding covers much of the difference while in the united states it s private donations that make up the majority of the discrepancy required to balance the opera budgets which in the case of the met reach levels in the hundreds of millions and employ close to 3 000 people as reported by blum in his coverage of the met s reopening on saturday there were more than 200 performers onstage huge returns vilar was arrested in may 2005 for misdeeds in his use of client funds at his investment firm amerindo advisors vilar was found guilty on 12 counts and his former partner gary a tanaka was found guilty on three counts vilar served eight years of a 10 year prison sentence for securities fraud and was released in 2018 vilar in 2018 told the vail daily that everyone who was a victim in the fraud which landed him in jail had been paid back in full and they made huge returns vilar added that s the catch 22 of the whole case in 2013 vilar lost an appeal of his conviction and a judge said he had taken actions to prevent his former clients from being repaid while awaiting resentencing momentarily free on bail vilar was able to convince a judge to add two and a half hours to his curfew to attend the met s production of eugene onegin his lawyer vivian shevitz argued successfully that vilar should be granted the curfew extension as he had been offered free tickets to a sold out opera this saturday night by the conductor his original bail signer valery gergiev during his trial and imprisonment vilar who was estimated to be worth 1 billion at one point and was called buck for buck the biggest benefactor in musical history by an industry observer writing for the the telegraph newspaper also saw his name removed from the washington opera s young artists program the kennedy center s arts management fellowship program and the royal opera house in london continuing case vilar s only immediate survivor his sister carole vilar williams told the new york times that her brother died of a heart attack he was born oct 4 1940 in east orange n j not havana as he sometimes claimed the times reports in the times obituary of vilar published sept 8 williams said vilar had been writing his autobiography while holding out hope that the government would release frozen monies related to the case we think it belongs to us they disagree vilar told the vail daily in 2018 saying stocks seized from his former company were worth three times the 22 million in fraud alleged by federal prosecutors in july the u s securities and exchange commission denied former bear stearns employee eugene ross a monetary whistleblower award via the dodd frank wall street reform act of 2010 for discovering the fraud ross in the process of voluntarily cooperating with government prosecutors and regulatory agencies in the criminal and civil actions against amerindo lost his job at bear stearns which strongly discouraged his participation in the legal reckoning that followed cut his pay took away his sales team and subjected him to unchecked harassment and retaliation writes leah mcgrath goodman with institutional investor magazine after leaving bear stearns ross was forced to sell his home to cover mounting legal bills that eventually bankrupted him goodman said yet he continued to provide evidence documents and testimony as a star witness in the 2008 criminal case that put vilar and tanaka behind bars ross could have qualified for millions under the whistleblower award but effectively disqualified himself goodman said because ross alerted his client and employer to the fraud immediately and the dodd frank reform had not yet been passed

herald reporters while the third wave of covid 19 infection continues to trickle down to just 4 8 percent of its mid july peak the vaccination rate is also continuing to slow with 286 134 jabs given last week between sunday and saturday down for the third week running the week before saw 289 892 jabs and last week s total was just over 55 percent of the 517 933 record seen in the third week of august according to figures from the ministry of health and child care a declining sense of urgency has seen the number of people coming forward for their first jab falling as the third wave receded and a lot of people decided to put off to a more convenient time their entry into the national vaccination programme the increased vehemence of the fake social media onslaught from american right wingers is also having some effect over the past three days yet another 1 5 million doses of sinopharm vaccine arrived from china as government readies to add teenagers on the inoculation programme the latest deliveries takes the total number of doses in the country to over 10 million in an interview yesterday chief coordinator for the national response to covid 19 dr agnes mahomva said the government would continue procuring more vaccines we have no intention to go without vaccines we are on course to achieve herd immunity we have been strategic from day one treasury has continued mobilising resources we are quite excited with what we have done and we will not look back said dr mahomva addressing journalists last friday after receiving the consignment of 500 000 doses deputy minister mangwiro said the medicines control authority of zimbabwe mcaz gave a conditional authority for vaccination of children the condition is that the ministry of health and child care shall conduct a phase three clinical trial first before rolling out the vaccination and the ministry is in the process of implementing the mcaz conditions and once that is complete the rollout will begin zimbabwe is now extending the vaccination campaign to teenagers from 14 to 17 who were not previously catered for in the initial plan after scientists approved it was safe to inoculate this age group the vaccination of children follows satisfactory progress in the ongoing inoculation exercise for the adult population which has won several international plaudits and endorsements from united nations agencies including the world health organisation he implored parents to take their children for vaccination if their chance arrives and insisted that the shots were a proven scientific record for protection against the covid 19 virus president mnangagwa said we must all go and get vaccinated the disease might have slowed down but other countries are already experiencing a fourth wave and as the waves go on they become more severe and more brutal the only solution that is scientifically proven now is vaccination let us all go out in our numbers and get vaccinated the vaccines are there and they are for free said dr mangwiro dr mangwiro also implored those with underlying conditions to accept the vaccines and said those with sugar diabetes and high blood pressure will be stabilised by doctors before being vaccinated last week saw 148 013 zimbabweans line up for their second jab taking the total of fully vaccinated to 1 849 006 by late saturday afternoon this is 12 33 percent of the entire population of zimbabwe estimated at around 15 million at some stage this week the total of the fully vaccinated will go over 2 million as more of the first dosers from the high rates in the second half of august finish their four week waiting period but the number of zimbabweans entering the programme last week by lining up for the first jab was only 138 121 the first time since the middle of august that second dosers exceeded the number getting their first dose by saturday 2 836 753 zimbabweans had taken their first dose about 18 91 percent of the total population this means zimbabwe is still the best in the region and the third best in continental africa when looking at the figures for the percentage who have received at least one dose after morocco and tunisia but only just as south africa has now inched up to 17 83 percent the four tiny island states of seychelles mauritius cape verde and comoros also have vaccination rates ahead of zimbabwe making the country the seventh best in the african union zimbabwe has so far administered in first and second jabs 4 685 759 doses to give 31 24 doses per 100 people an impressive rate by african standards supplies of vaccine are now being delivered faster and stocks are exceptionally good at the same time the ministry of health and child care continually expands the distribution putting in more public health teams who vaccinate for free as well as allowing more private hospitals doctors and pharmacies to administer doses for a small fee in theory set at 400 although many charge a little more the vaccines for the private system are still free and the charge is just for the jabbing this means that the fall in numbers of doses being administered weekly is purely the result of fewer people coming forward not because there is a shortage of vaccine or a bottleneck at the distribution end from the third week of august we know we can administer more than 500 000 doses a week or 2 million a month and with the improvements put in place by the health ministry that is now higher harare and chitungwiza lead the zimbabwean pack with 499 842 first jabs by saturday between them and another 334 602 second doses for a total of 834 444 doses between them while harare metropolitan is easily the most populous province the vaccination rate is high manicaland has 360 488 first doses and 238 169 second doses with mashonaland west on 319 695 first doses but 199 880 second doses midlands has 298 607 first doses and 174 715 second doses mashonaland east 289 857 first and 204 952 second masvingo 248 878 first and 144 515 second bulawayo metropolitan 235 563 first and 174478 second giving it more total doses than masvingo but fewer first doses matabeleland north 226 306 first and 145 101 second mashonaland central 209 256 first and 139 827 second and matabeleland south the province with the lowest population 148 277 first and 92 766 second so far as covid 19 infection rates go the rolling seven day average is now 113 with 795 new infections recorded last week the death rate is still hovering around an average of 10 a day with 70 deaths last week death rates follow two or three weeks behind infection rates as it takes some time for an infected person to become very ill while the infection rate is now just 4 8 percent of the mid july peak it is still three times the rate seen before the start of the third wave hence the need for great care and the calls for vaccination
this time last year every crew change successfully achieved seemed exceptional they were complex tasks involving multi faceted challenges and unknowns as government instructions and medical advice changed frequently even daily since then the international shipping community has adapted to the new status quo brought about by the pandemic the industry s efforts to convince state and local authorities to recognise seafarers as key workers have made a difference but crew changes continue to be challenging in many parts of the world related seafarers first the logistics of a fleet wide vaccination program by may 2021 only 55 out of the imo s 174 member states had recognised seafarers as essential workers that number has now reached 60 still not enough pressure needs to be kept on the more than 100 states yet to act vaccinations lagging of the estimated 1 7 million seafarers worldwide more than half are from countries with vaccination programmes that lag behind those of richer nations many seafarers still cannot access the vaccines that could help to make their passage to and from home a realistic prospect on a more positive note some imo member states are working to improve seafarer vaccination rates the us india germany cyprus belgium netherlands and australia to name a few these efforts are almost without exception driven by local ngos and authorities linked to the industry among those campaigning to ease the plight of the maritime workforce is the global maritime forum s neptune declaration on seafarer wellbeing and crew change of which gac is a signatory industry wide vaccination is key to solving the crisis more states must prioritise seafarers and developed nations must use their stocks to boost dedicated vaccination programmes for seafarers passing through hubs such as singapore rotterdam uae ports houston and others sadly it is easier said than done global dynamics pre planning of crew changes remains critical as does the ability to adapt to changes in procedure at short notice in oman the gac team reports that authorities are closely monitoring crew change procedures and precautions being taken to minimise the risk of spreading covid 19 gac has earned their support but crew changes are still managed on a case by case basis in light of updates to health and travel advisories our people in abu dhabi have noted an increase in the number of procedures and medical tests required depending on the nationalities of the seafarers involved in india gac has successfully prepared and coordinated multiple crew changes even when last minute information and action has been required the development of checklists and standard requests for information from customers has helped to ensure gac has all the necessary information on hand when dealing with local authorities requirements can vary gac panama for instance notes the need for unified and digital not just scanned information to satisfy the various needs of different local authorities in europe more coordination and closer contact with local immigrations and health authorities is the new normal in russia however crew members without a russian visa face greater difficulties than locals or those from visa free countries gac s recommendation here is that seafarers should always obtain a visa even if they hold a valid seaman s book in australasia gac teams highlight the importance of closely following local procedures this is particularly important in australia where it is vital to keep up to date with local travel restrictions that vary from state to state and week to week in sri lanka gac has worked with authorities to perform direct bulk crew changes via exclusive charter flight and gained special permission to conduct emergency disembarkations at the country s ports this proved its worth in the evacuation of a sick passenger from a cruise vessel granted on humanitarian grounds after an arduous approval process granted sanitation services maintaining the highest sanitation and social distancing standards is critical even a small mishap can delay vessel quarantine or free pratique approval so gac s offices globally have adapted quickly to ensure that the highest standards are maintained gac and its local partners in sri lanka have pioneered a fumigation disinfection and sanitisation service for vessels at the country s four ports the deep cleaning service is offered to vessels sailing the east west shipping routes that pass close to sri lanka since its launch in 2020 gac has met the requirements of over 10 vessel operators giving them confidence in the safety of their crew and any local authorities personnel who may need to board security team challenges the transfer of armed guards is still a challenge in the past security teams on board floating armouries around the red sea western indian ocean and gulf of oman were not allowed to disembark due to stringent regulations on transfers globally but when the number of covid 19 positive cases onboard these floating armouries rose significantly gac sri lanka invested in a villa complex as an accommodation solution for private maritime security companies and law enforcement officers more to come the shipping industry must continue supporting seafarers maintaining pressure on all imo member states to designate them as key workers with crews still stranded onboard beyond their contracted period stress and fatigue is as serious an issue as the potential for serious illness due to the slow vaccination roll out and with new variants of the virus emerging we are unlikely to have seen the last of the challenges of the covid 19 pandemic yet as a ship agent responsible for port and husbandry services and an advocate for shipping companies and seafarers worldwide gac will continue to adapt and respond accordingly

oluchi chibuzor as nigeria adjusts to the economic fallout of covid 19 experts in the tech ecosystem have urged the government to maintain a consistent policy in the sector to sustain the various job creation initiatives gained across the nation this according to them would continue to increase the risk aversion of the growing sector operators investors and the intellectual prowess of the technological competence of the young demographic in the country in an exclusive interview with thisday the founder simply exponential consult limited mrs fayo williams decried that the various incessant policy instability in the sector if not contained would undermine the job creation efforts across the country within the tech space and its resultant multiplier s effect on the overall economy she stated that job creation in the sector remains one of the fastest ways an economy can empower its citizens to alleviate poverty and improve means of livelihood according to her we believe we are having a big challenge right now because nigeria has not provided the enabling environment for the technology and entrepreneurship ecosystem to thrive we wake up to different kinds of rule and policy and contradictions in positions of various fines and so on and so forth the main issue is that without a conducive existence for these technology ecosystems job creation and employability will suffer and we cannot keep going this way as capital importation into nigeria in q2 2021 declined 54 1 per cent q q to 0 88billion the lowest since q1 2016 and with fdi slumping to its lowest level in 11 years there is a big disincentive when it comes fdi from the way that we see these policies been rolled out and there is a big disincentives to the startup founders because of all this instability meanwhile fdi intelligence report a specialist division of the financial times has revealed that nigeria has the highest number of tech startups as most of them operate within the fintech industry the report noted that despite the lagos metropolis being renowned for its start up ecosystem it still suffers from chronically poor infrastructure and education recurring political instability and security issues more so inflation unemployment ease of doing business to socio economic factors such as banditry kidnapping and insurgency remains deciding factors in the mind of foreign investors towards the economy it added with isn being an interface innovation hub with the private and public sector the executive secretary innovation support network isn mrs nneka ukay explained that they are there for any investors on how to stay within the ambit of the law she however revealed that in the last 18 months foreign investors are not really being convinced to invest in nigeria stocks because there have been precedents of policy somersaults without any consultations or pre warning what happens is that a regulation or a directive is passed and then it halts activities immediately and then we now start working backwards to see how we can change the business models accommodate this new change from the government however as the world becomes increasingly competitive in terms of trade developed countries are developing specific pathways for tech startups founders and people who have competence for blockchain and cryptocurrency she said she warned that with this latest strategy nigeria will continue to see most of its young innovators leave for another country as it has become a prerequisite to have companies registered in more than one country to attract funds in the global startup space ukay adds that government must know that the startup ecosystem is global as some are deliberately positioning themselves in africa you have rwanda kenya and ghana that are deliberately seeking african startups to come rwanda has positioned itself as the sandbox of africa as an isolated environment where you can try anything without breaking anything rwanda is actively telling us to come to use them as our sandbox and you have other countries like the uae dubai uk usa positioning themselves with special visas for people in tech and software developers and startup founders on the flip side we have seen that the government is not necessarily responding well to this new technology and it has a lot to do with our socio political disposition being more autocratic and the young people being the citizens of the information age want news ideas to thrive in their own ways she added that a lot of this technology was strange to the government and would continue because the young ones are adopting as they go and so the government must not come down so heavily on us because they do not understand what we are doing

last week s historic adoption of bitcoin by el salvador as a legal tender presents a new analytical trend on the entire concept of money the mistrust that clouded the courageous roll out as well as the widespread dip of the cryptocurrency market points to the increasing role of external variables in determining the value of money the 30 in bitcoin bribe extended to every salvadorian is also metaphoric of the emerging concept of money as a store of value not only for the south american country but for other future adopters of the digital currency and businesses that are already accepting cryptocurrency payment few hours into the roll out the 30 incentives had shrunk to 25 as the coin dived from 52 000 to 43 000 in an hour amidst the hysteria and glitch around the functionality of the digital wallet in the run up to the adoption the el salvadorian government s mop up of the market to stock for its not too eager citizens among other factors had pumped the value of the flagship cryptocurrency to a three month high the historic adoption should by logic drive the consolidation of the uptrend of the past few weeks unfortunately there is no science or logic in the crypto world hence the sudden dip the steepest fall in recent history could only shock a salvadoran who was holding the electronic currency for the first time there have been different theories on the crash that followed the bumpy start to the nationalisation of the extremely volatile cryptocurrencies first the sell the news theory a model built on the pumping of financial asset value on the premise of a future event that could remarkably push up the price only for those who warehouse the asset to dump it when the expected event eventually happens another prominent explanation is connected to the increasing role of whales in the novel investment market whales are individuals or institutions which hold large amounts of a certain cryptocurrency like market makers in the conventional financial market whales leverage their disproportionately huge asset sizes in trade to alter the direction of the market in a manipulative manner they are responsible for the pumping and dumping culture which has become a norm in the cryptocurrency space there is thus an argument that the whales dumped their hoardings to take profits when bitcoin hit 52 000 or called up their arsenal to trigger a crash in commemoration of el salvador s bitcoin adoption just to prove a point here whichever supposition may be true is not as important as the possibility of an individual or non state actors to cause a major upset in the value of a supposed legal tender it means that certain variables that were hitherto considered as residual may not matter anymore in modeling the value of money in economies like el salvador the decentralised character of cryptocurrency and the coefficient manipulative possibility are at the heart of the argument for the central bank digital currencies cbdcs and virtual formats of fiat currencies issued by central banks today about 80 per cent of central banks including that of nigeria are in the process of issuing cbdcs its necessity notwithstanding the cbdc invention raises some salient questions on currency imperialism recently the bank for international settlements bis engaged the central banks of malaysia singapore south africa and australia to test the use of cbdcs for international settlements dubbed project dunbar the initiative will develop prototype shared platforms for cross border transactions using multiple cbdcs eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the time and cost of transactions the project intends to develop technical prototypes on different distributed ledger technology platforms of the projects whose technical prototypes will be demonstrated at the singapore fintech festival holding in november chief fintech officer at monetary authority of singapore sopnendu mohanty said project dunbar s work on using multi cbdc platforms to facilitate seamless multi currency fund transfers is a significant contribution to the global vision to make payments cheaper and faster the findings on how a common platform can be governed effectively and managed efficiently will shape the blueprint of the next generation payment systems a similar bis led project exploring cbdcs for cross border payments also involves central banks of china hong kong thailand and the united arab emirates uae details of these concepts are still sketchy but they align with the thinking of the international monetary fund imf in using stable coins to drive down the cost of remittances and cross border financial transactions the managing director of imf kristalina georgieva at a forum on digital currency said the adoption of stable coins is crucial to reducing remittances in developing countries and preventing the digital divide at the national level countries are jostling for the smartest and most scalable electronic money that can compete beyond their physical borders china had worked on digital yuan for years but the project only got into overdrive when facebook revealed its plan for diem its electronic currency china has found a limitless opportunity in its cbdc to reinforce its efforts to challenge the supremacy of the dollar it also intends to pitch the digital yuan as a global currency and fortunately cbdcs like other e money forms are only limited by their scale of utilities and not physical national borders other powers including russia have joined the race for cbdc a dream not only driven by the need to duplicate existing fiats electronically but also as weapons of extra national economic subjugation developing countries including nigeria are also on the verge of issuing electronic money but may necessarily not in the context of economic subjugation yet the director general of the securities and exchange commission sec lamido yuguda has argued that e naira must be designed to operate beyond nigeria to explore the opportunity in the cross border transaction opportunity yuguda who spoke at the chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn advocacy dialogue series four said the design and functionality of the proposed e naira must take into cognizance of the aspirations of other countries in three to four years some models will be more successful than the others we need to be alert to what other countries are doing i know that some countries will want to position their currencies in such a way that they will attract other users beyond their borders he advised about two weeks ago the apex bank announced the engagement of a barbados based digital financial technology firm bitt inc as a technical partner for the e naira project which will be unveiled before the end of the year with operations spreading across the caribbean bitt utilises blockchain and distributed ledger technology to facilitate peer to peer p2p transactions with mobile money across a suite of bitt s software and mobile applications a statement by the bank said the firm was chosen through a highly competitive bidding process it said it was chosen on its technological competence efficiency platform security interoperability and implementation experience in choosing bitt inc the cbn relied on the company s tested and proven digital currency experience which is already in circulation in several eastern caribbean countries bitt inc was key to the development and successful launch of the central bank digital currency cbdc pilot of the eastern caribbean central bank eccb in april 2021 the statement said but the issue is less about the competence of the technical partner than the limited time left to work on the project of course the e naira idea was first mooted in 2017 but it only got accelerated attention earlier in the year after the apex bank stopped financial institutions from transacting in cryptocurrency trading programme lead sustainable and inclusive digital financial services initiative prof olayinka david west at the cibn forum spoke extensively on the technical tasks involved in achieving a secured scalable and hitch free cbdc does the cbn have sufficient time to build the most needed infrastructure for an e naira nigerians would trust unlike the el salvadoran bitcoin experiment that has triggered protests time will tell

by mwansa p chalwe snr zambians have debated the merits and demerits of the imf program ad nauseam for the past seven years and one would have thought that the issue was long settled this is so because the previous pf administration were already implementing what is called prior actions of the imf program bail out process the pf were within a few weeks of getting the deal if it was not for the august 12 elections however since the new upnd administration came into power the issue has been resurrected for debate mainly by three known and more or less brief case opposition parties leaders the opponents of the imf programme have made some misleading and uninformed statements based on antiquated knowledge about the imf these statements need to be countered and corrected with facts so as to prevent the unsuspecting public from being misled the ignorance exhibited by some of our political leaders on the issue is mind boggling this article therefore is purely an educational piece on the imf and the impact of its anticipated program will have on the economy and ordinary zambians one of the major weaknesses of the arguments by the opponents of the imf bailout is the fact that it is based on the 1980s and 1990s imf financing structure and the structural adjustment programme sap which have since been discredited and discarded the 21st century imf is not the same as that of 1980s and 90s the critics seem to be stuck in that era because of the poor reading culture in our country it is therefore vital to start by updating readers briefly about the imf reforms as a way of background the imf experienced a decline in lending towards the end of the 1990s and the beginning of 2000 the institution was almost becoming irrelevant as most countries did not want to borrow from it and as a result it accumulated huge unutilized financial resources its brand was badly damaged the design and implementation of imf programs at that time were insensitive to individual countries situations consequently the imf was accused of making economic and social conditions worse for countries than improving them because of its structural adjustment programme reformed imf has 86 countries on its programmes there are two major issues that compelled the imf to change its operational model the failures of the structural adjustment programmes sap in the 1980s 90s and the asian crisis of 1997 8 the two experiences taught the imf a lesson about how to best engage with countries when designing a programme support the fund decided that there was a need for reforms in 2001 the imf created an independent evaluation office ieo the ieo was to conduct independent and objective evaluations of imf programs the imf carried out a wide ranging review of its lending facilities and terms on which it provided loans in march 2009 the fund announced a major overhaul of its lending framework including modernizing conditionality introducing a new flexible credit line enhancing the flexibility of the fund s regular stand by lending arrangement doubling access limits on loans etc the other reforms included changes in shareholding and making the institution more transparent than before the imf has changed from imposing a program on the country to being consultative the fund now asks the host country to design its own economic reform program which of course should address issues that caused the economic problems in the first place following the imf reforms more countries started trickling back to the imf the advent of the financial crisis of 2008 thrust the imf into a central position of lending to the developed and developing countries the imf currently has programs with more than 86 countries around the world out of which 33 are in africa the african countries on some form of imf financial assistance programmes include the following angola benin burkina faso cape verde cameroon central african republic democratic republic of congo ivory coast ethiopia gabon gambia guinea togo uganda namibia niger nigeria sierra leone south sudan sudan senegal south africa rwanda kenya mali mozambique malawi and many more zambia s recent history with imf zambia s recent experience with the imf dates back to june 2014 when the country approached imf after the kwacha depreciated badly in 2015 the currency and economy continued deteriorating and haemorrhaging the imf started providing zambia with technical support with a view to programme support in november 2015 zambia was offered a deal of about 1billion which was similar to the one that ghana got the former president edgar lungu rejected it for fear of losing the august 2016 elections the technical support and programme talks only restarted after the august 2016 elections and as a result of being assisted by the imf in the management of the economy the economy started picking up in 2017 the imf acknowledged the improvement in the zambian economy in 2017 compared to the near crisis of the fourth quarter of 2015 and most of 2016 the market confidence by both local and foreign investors rose and zambia s euro bonds were among the best performing foreign direct investments and portfolio investments started flowing into the country in droves during the whole of 2017 with treasury bills and government bonds being oversubscribed and the economy was showing signs of recovery the kwacha stabilized below k10 to a dollar inflation reduced from the high of 22 9 per cent to single digit of 6 8 per cent but as was typical with former president lungu s administration they were soon to score an own goal or commit an unforced error and indeed they did in july 2017 president lungu declared the state of emergency and subsequently arrested main opposition leader hakainde hichilema for treason and dared the imf to pull out if they wanted to in august 2017 the imf cancelled talks with zambia citing the country s excessive borrowing plans in 2018 zambia forced the imf to recall dr alfredo baldini the country representative the relations between imf and zambia soured badly and guess what from then on the country s economy has been on the downward economic spiral this has resulted in the foreign debt of 12 7 billion by december 2019 depletion of foreign reserves to as low as 1 37 billion or 1 8 months import cover the kwacha depreciation to about k23 to a us dollar and inflation was 24 4 per cent in august 2021 zambia s number one economic problem is the debt crisis and how to restructure zambia owes eurobond holders multilateral lending institutions bilateral countries the debt commercial banks and china it is very clear from the debt composition that zambia owes multiple creditors and therefore its debt restructuring is quite complex it is also apparent that the lion s share of zambia s external debt stock is owed to western and western allied institutions and according to the world bank data about 70 per cent of zambia s external debt at the end of 2019 was owed to western allied institutions western commercial banks and hedge funds together held about 6 billion which is over 50 per cent of zambia s external debt in the light of this anybody saying zambia has no debt crisis should not be taken serious and their economic expertise and credentials questioned the international monetary fund imf is at the centre of the resolution of the debt crisis and anybody who thinks otherwise must be living in cuckoo land zambian western creditors have expressly stated that they can only agree to a debt restructuring if the country was on an imf program bloomberg report of april 2021 confirmed this status external commercial creditors including those holding the nation s 3 billion of eurobonds want the government to reach a deal with the imf which they will then base their restructuring talks on the financial media company reported the international monetary fund still hopes to reach a deal with zambia before elections in august on an economic program that will form the basis of the nation s planned debt restructuring talks that began last year are continuing and the washington based lender aims to conclude them in the next few weeks the paper added quoting imf africa director abebe aemro the facts on the ground therefore show that zambia does not really have a choice on how to get out of the debt crisis apart from being on an imf programme the pf administration started the imf negotiations and the new upnd administration is simply continuing where pf left from in the light of the aforementioned facts and the scenario painted above the critics of the imf bailout are in a way just being disingenuous there is also some element of simplicity in the understanding of the reasoning behind the imf program it is not just an act of borrowing money per se as it is being presented by some politicians the programme is much more than just getting 1 3billion loan it is much more complex than that and has a lot of intangible benefits also the sdr1 33 zambia received to boost its reserves has nothing to do with the bailout talks that have been going on between zambia and imf but rather a covid 19 initiative for imf member countries benefits of imf programme to zambia there are about six clear benefits to the zambian economy if it goes on an imf programme firstly it will open the door for talks for the restructuring of zambia s foreign debts with its creditors as former finance minister dr bwalya ng andu once clearly spelt out in one of his statements on the issue zambia s total public and publicly guaranteed debt reached usd 18 5bn or approximately 104 per cent of gdp as at end 2019 impacting zambia s ability to advance social and economic initiatives especially in the current covid 19 environment dr ngándu once told creditors it has become increasingly difficult to service debt zambia is spending half of government revenue collections to service interest on debt currently compared to a few years ago when only 20 per cent of revenues would be channelled towards interest obligations dr ng andu added debt restructuring is the top priority of the new administration zambia has a 750m eurobond which is due next year 2022 but the country has no money to pay that amount and so the negotiations with the creditors is imperative the new finance minister dr situmbeko musokotwane confirmed the same in a zambia national broadcasting corporation znbc interview we don t have the money to pay back this is why it is important that we get on an imf programme so that we can re arrange not to pay next year i am 100 confident that it will be done he told the interviewer secondly the programme would come with the balance of payments support which would help with the stabilisation of the kwacha by forestalling the currency depreciation consequently as an import dependent economy this will prevent inflation from escalating and thus result in reduction in cost of living and cost of doing business thirdly since zambia entered the international capital market in 2012 by borrowing eurobonds its economy and the currency became subject to the dictates of the international financial markets these markets are highly sensitive to even mere statements by authorities this is what most people fail to understand if zambia goes on the imf programme the cost of servicing foreign debts which has been causing havoc in the economy will start going down the reduction in interest payments on loans will result in more funds being available for social services such as health and education fourthly there will be restoration of confidence in the management of zambia s economy under an imf programme this would in turn attract both foreign direct investors and portfolio investors resulting in increased inflow of foreign exchange dollars this will assist with the kwacha appreciation this increased confidence is already happening following the reduction of the country s political risk as a result of the election victory of president hakainde hichilema the imf programme will just add further to the positive market sentiment fifthly the imf programme would open up opportunities for zambia to borrow at concessionary rates borrow cheaply the majority if not all bi lateral and multilateral lenders would only lend zambia if it was on imf programme as it reduces their exposure to risk sixth the imf programme will instil some financial discipline and help in the restoration of budget credibility government expenditure is likely to be strictly controlled this could lead to the reduction in the budget deficit the strict expenditure control would lead to the reduction in government borrowing from the domestic banking system thus make more funds available to private sector as government will no longer be crowding out the private sector there will also be reduction of domestic interest rates this can in turn lead to increased economic activity and job creation there is one politician who challenged supporters of an imf programme to name a country that was successful whilst on imf programme following the reforms of the 21st century there are many countries that have been in debt and economic crisis that the imf has helped return to economic stability and growth there are two countries that come mind one is in europe and the other in africa in 2014 serbia s economy was in serious trouble the authorities adopted an ambitious program of fiscal adjustment and broad based economic reforms under the imf supported program economic advice and monitoring after three years of effort under the program by 2017 the economy had been turned around in early 2015 ghana turned to the imf for a 918 million loan to help stabilize the economy imf advisors working with the ghanaian government developed a three part program to restore debt sustainability by the end of the three year period in 2018 the ghanaian economy had recovered the pace of economic growth rose to 8 8 percent in 2019 from 2 2 percent in 2015 the inflation rate had fallen to about 8 percent from 19 percent cuts in wasteful government spending made room for much needed social services such as free secondary education ghana has free education now there is no denying the fact that the imf program will certainly come with some pain but one gets the feeling that the pf administration had implemented most of the harsh conditions and these have already filtered through the zambian economy as experienced by the high cost of living and high cost of doing business one gets the impression that the remaining big prior conditions are likely to be issues of removal of fuel and electricity subsidies all things considered there are more benefits than costs from the imf program if there is one thing that the pf and upnd agree on it is the fact that zambia needs the imf program to solve its debt crisis and for the economy to recover on the basis of the election results the two major parties represent 98 of the zambian population it is therefore rational to state that the uninformed views of three minor opposition parties on a highly economic technical and consequential subject and when one of them was not even on the ballot paper should really be ignored as there is very little or no merit in their arguments and are merely politicking

after a record breaking bull run for the u s stock market this year many wall street analysts are starting to warn that investors could be in for a bumpy ride in the coming weeks and months analysts at firms including morgan stanley citigroup inc deutsche bank ag and bank of america corp published notes this month cautioning about current risks in the u s equity market with the s p 500 already hitting 54 records this year through thursday the most during that period since 1995 several analysts said that they believe there is a growing possibility of a pullback or at the least flatter

the year the analysts cautious outlook for u s stocks presents a contrast to the so called tina or there is no alternative motto that has dominated investors outlook for much of the past year because yields on other assets such as bonds have been so low many investors have justified their continuous bullish positioning in stocks accommodative monetary policy from the federal reserve has provided a continuous boost for equities this year too as has the lure of big investment returns from a swath of companies ranging from meme stocks to covid 19 beneficiaries in their september notes however some strategists said they were looking at other parts of the market for future gains in a note last week morgan stanley strategists wrote that they were downgrading their rating on u s equities to

positions on the s p 500 outnumber shorts 10 to 1 a team of analysts including chris montagu wrote adding that around half of long positions would be in a loss situation if the benchmark index moved below 4435 less than 1 away from friday s closing level that means a small correction could be amplified by forced long liquidation pushing the market further down the citi note said this month s

1 the trouble with kibbles with camestros felapton 63 chapters into debarkle a chronicle of how the sad rabid puppies were the sff genre s reflection of broader right wing movements john scalzi shares his own retrospective thoughts on the debarkle at whatever 1 it really does seem like so long ago now the nonsense the sad rabid puppies henceforth to be referred to as the pups perpetrated is largely contained in the years of 2014 2016 and while that s not actually all that long ago a mere five years since midamericon ii where new hugo nomination rules were ratified to minimize slate nominating and nk jemisin won the first of her three consecutive best novel hugo awards it feels like a distant memory now a kind of oh yeah that happened sort of event there are reasons for that but i think the largest part has to do with the fact that the pups simply and bluntly failed at every level that was important for their movement the bifurcated goals of the pups were to champion science fiction with a certain political cultural point of view i e largely white largely conservative and to destroy the hugos by flooding the nominations with crap they did neither very well toward the former the material they slated was largely not very good and with respect to the latter the hugos both still persist and remain a premier award in the field their strategy was bad because it was addressing a problem that largely did not exist and was arrived at in a backward fashion and their tactics were bad because they exploited loopholes and antagonized everyone who was not part of their clique activating thousands of dormant hugo voters against them they were routed through a simple mechanism for which they had not accounted no award and once their slating tactic was blunted by a nomination rule change they flounced entirely when your only track record is that of complete failure it s not surprising you don t have much of an impact john lorentz says in a comment there as the 2015 hugo administrator i can tell you that five years or six years since it affected me directly is not nearly enough to for me to forget it i used to enjoy administering the hugos i ve done it four times 2015 was a shit show that destroyed any joy i had regarding the hugos in the long run the puppies didn t affect the field but they sure affected me also it was however the only thing i ve ever been involved with that has show up both as a question on jeopardy and a song on doctor demento so there s that 2 whose fault paul weimer finds more than he expected as he explains in his review for nerds of a feather microreview fault lines by kelly jennings like that original story and like the other stories in that anthology by other authors the central characters in the universe that jennings has constructed here and the central characters are women and note the name of velocity s ship given the preponderance of men as leads of a lot of space opera to this day jennings work is a refreshing rebalancing of that the novel is a two hander with velocity wrachant captain and owner of the susan calvin and brontë a young woman who is far more than she first appears the story s point of view focus on both velocity and brontë although we do not see the latter s point of view until her hijacking and even then it is initially months in the past i didn t like her at first after all she had hijacked velocity s ship and i thought at first that the flashbacks from her point of view were merely to flesh her out and give us perspective and point of view to sympathize with her however grudgingly so as the back half of the narrative continued to build and events in the present continued i saw the careful crafting of plot and the central mystery at the heart of fault lines 3 hanna memories joseph nicholas penned the guardian s judith hanna obituary during her 30 years of working for a range of campaigning bodies and ngos my wife judith hanna who has died aged 67 of liver cancer saw concern about the environment go from a fringe issue for community activists to a mainstream subject with a professionalised career structure her life and career embodied the principle of being

working for nuclear disarmament and better public transport in her final role as a social evidence principal specialist at natural england she promoted the now widely accepted health benefits of everyday contact with the natural world 4 bolts from the blue in the future tense newsletter torie bosch says we need a muppet version of frankenstein on aug 30 my heart broke a tiny bit that day the guardian published a remarkable interview with frank oz jim henson s longtime collaborator and the puppeteer behind fozzie bear miss piggy and other classic muppets oz hasn t been involved with the muppets since 2007 three years after disney purchased the franchise he tells the guardian i d love to do the muppets again but disney doesn t want me and sesame street hasn t asked me for 10 years they don t want me because i won t follow orders and i won t do the kind of muppets they believe in he added of the post disney muppet movies and tv shows the soul s not there the soul is what makes things grow and be funny but i miss them and love them as a lifelong muppets fan i have to agree there were delightful moments in the muppet reboots of recent years but they were a little too pale the chaos and the order a little too calculated but i think that there s a way to bring the muppets back one that could also and here comes the future tense agenda help spark smart discussions about scientific ethics especially around what it means to be human and how to approach innovation responsibly we need frank oz to helm a muppet frankenstein 5 i am the fire brain pickings maria popova discusses einstein s dreams physicist alan lightman s poetic exploration of time and the antidote to the anxiety of aliveness when you realize you are mortal the poet painter and philosopher etel adnan wrote while regarding a mountain you also realize the tremendousness of the future a decade earlier shortly before a heart attack severed her life time hannah arendt observed in her superb gifford lectures lectures on the life of the mind that our finitude set in an infinity of time stretching into both past and future constitutes the infrastructure as it were of all mental activities while arendt was composing these thoughts and silent cells were barricading one of her arteries ursula k le guin was composing her novelistic inquiry into what it means to live responsibly observing if time and reason are functions of each other if we are creatures of time then we had better know it and try to make the best of it a generation before her borges had formulated the ultimate declaration of our temporal creatureliness declaring time is the substance i am made of time is a river which sweeps me along but i am the river it is a tiger which destroys me but i am the tiger it

the guardian wonders whether it is time to take reports about ufos and aliens more seriously what i saw that night was real is it time to take aliens more seriously but nick pope a former ufo investigator for the ministry of defence is not convinced and thinks that godfrey is genuine he had a lot to potentially lose by coming out with this and yet stuck to his guns doesn t a hallucination explain what he saw i get that people do have hallucinations but they tend to be the result of either mental illness or some sort of hallucinogenic substance and this guy was on duty and was by all accounts rational and so those explanations don t seem to apply i m stumped when it comes to that particular case ask yourself how many times have you been tired and come to the end of a long day we ve all been in that situation and we don t suddenly construct bizarre narratives about spacecraft and aliens is it time to start taking these stories more seriously i m not saying that i believe it s literally true that these are alien spaceships says pope but at the very least these people who were previously disbelieved and ridiculed should be listened to and given a hearing 13 sword soul

like this for more than a decade cataloging the progress of its creations as they grow more lifelike and more unsettling one of its models is a robotic dog called spot with four legs and sometimes a neck topped with a camera head an android s best friend although the company maintains that its creations are research projects it does sell spot and has leased one to the n y p d it could have been used to accomplish tasks too risky for a living being such as delivering food in a hostage situation or checking areas with high amounts of radiation but its appearance accompanying police officers during an arrest in public housing sparked enough public backlash for its trial to be prematurely terminated people found the robodog both wasteful and chilling especially in the possession of the institution most likely to use force against them it surely didn t help that the robodog looked quite similar to the horrific killer machines in an episode of the show black mirror called metalhead probably because the show s creator charlie brooker who wrote the episode was inspired by previous boston dynamics videos we can ask the same question of the atlas what is it for the video only shows us what it can do for now the robots don t want anything apart from not falling over they await a reason for being the company says the goal is to create robots that can perform mundane tasks in all sorts of terrain but the video contains no such tasks we see only feats of agility not the routine functions these robots would be back flipping toward through this gap enter the tendrils of sinister

dive brief kroger executives said friday that the strength of the company s omnichannel retailing ecosystem fueled better than anticipated results in the second financial quarter as shopper dollars shifted between stores and digital channels digital sales in the quarter fell 13 however almost all of the shoppers who reduced their online spending continued shopping in kroger s stores ceo rodney mcmullen said during the company s earnings call kroger s comparable store sales compared to the same period last year declined just 0 6 while earnings per share reached 80 cents both figures beat wall street expectations however gross margins fell 60 basis points due to high shrink levels and supply chain costs dive insight kroger executives have said in the past that the company is working toward becoming channel agnostic as shoppers shift more of their spending to digital that omnichannel focus appears to be paying off so far though there s still considerable work ahead to make the channels equally profitable during the second quarter kroger shoppers toggled between online and in store shopping as the pandemic evolved at the beginning of the quarter shoppers were visiting stores more frequently than they had early on in the health crisis as the quarter progressed and the delta variant impacted regions across the country many shoppers shifted back to e commerce said mcmullen in many cases kroger was able to keep those shoppers within its shopping ecosystem he noted the company also added 340 000 new digital customers which includes a significant number of shoppers in florida where kroger recently began offering online shopping out of its automated fulfillment center kroger s seamless ecosystem is working mcmullen said this was evident during the quarter as we saw customers seamlessly shift between channels kroger offers pickup and delivery from the vast majority of its stores and is scaling a ship to home service as well the company reduced pickup wait times during the quarter mcmullen said and also began trialing services like a ghost kitchen integration with kitchen united and sushi delivery via doordash in three markets in store shoppers gravitated toward fresh products and bulk sizes executives noted identical sales increased year over year in produce floral bakery and deli mcmullen said as many consumers revert to stock up buying kroger is seeing higher sales of products like 24 pack toilet paper he noted kroger also recently rolled out bulk sized versions of some of its private label products which mcmullen said are selling well on thursday the company unveiled a new logo called the fresh cart that will be used across its store and digital properties optional caption courtesy of kroger while kroger s top line sales beat wall street expectations the company s gross margins slid 60 basis points causing its stock to fall 7 on friday mcmullen said around half of that impact was due to shrink and higher supply chain costs chief financial officer gary millerchip said kroger is proactively managing both margin pressures and that the company s elevated full year guidance which calls for higher comp store sales and earnings per share reflects their impact he also noted that kroger continues to make improvements toward doubling its digital profitability via fulfillment efficiencies and higher digital media sales as the pandemic has worn on supermarket operators like kroger continue to enjoy sales that are well above their levels before the health crisis hit industry analysts have expressed skepticism about there being any long term shifts to consumer behavior but mcmullen said the company s research shows that elevated food at home spending is becoming entrenched he pointed to the fact that more companies including kroger are planning to allow employees to work from home even after the pandemic is over a meaningful part of the trend change is really structural and sustainable and it s not just a one time blip because of covid mcmullen said
san diego california san diego gas and electric has agreed to refund 51 6 million to consumers and pay a 5 5 million fine after fraud was discovered in a program designed to encourage the public to purchase costly energy efficient lightbulbs san diego gas and electric and southern california edison created a program in 2017 to encourage consumers to purchase costlier energy efficient bulbs by providing incentives to manufacturers and stores to ship and stock them however an investigation found that 15 million subsidized bulbs went unaccounted for at a cost to utility consumers of about 55 million further it was discovered that the number of bulbs shipped in 2017 under the program was three times the number of bulbs sold in the state investigators found that bulbs were overstocked or never sold and at least one manufacturer falsified shipping invoices for bulbs that were never delivered the program was discontinued in 2020 the san diego gas and electric settlement calls for shareholder money to be used to reimburse consumers for money spent on the program from 2017 to 2019 the utility also was fined for filing a false statement with the public utilities commission sdg e took ownership of what went wrong spokeswoman helen gao said in an email to the san diego union tribune as reported by the associated press the lessons learned from the program failure have resulted in meaningful changes including new procedures and training to strengthen accountability and prevent this from ever happening again
following the u s supreme court s ruling which ended the eviction moratorium millions of renters stand the risk of losing their housing amid the new surge of the pandemic eviction filings have already skyrocketed for the week ending september 4 with four of six states monitored by the princeton university s eviction lab having already exceeded historic averages the u s census bureau s weekly household pulse survey for the week ending august 26 found that 3 511 056 respondents are facing the likelihood of eviction in the next two months this is taking place as the biden administration has allowed the expiration of federal unemployment benefits for 7 5 million jobless workers who will be left with nothing and the end of the 300 supplement for another three million workers still receiving meager state unemployment benefits while data is only out for the first four days of the month within these days dramatic increases in eviction filings have already been observed out of the 31 cities that the eviction lab tracks 13 or more than a third have seen an increase in evictions above and past their respective historic averages for the same period the three largest increases seen as of september 4 were recorded in charleston south carolina at 232 percent the historical average wilmington delaware at 238 percent and dallas texas at 134 percent people from a coalition of housing justice groups hold signs protesting evictions during a news conference outside the statehouse friday july 30 2021 in boston five states saw filings increase relative to historic averages in previous months with delaware seeing a 130 percent rise before september delaware saw eviction filings consistently at half or less of its 2016 19 averages at virtually every point following march 2020 when the moratorium was implemented indiana is now 22 percent above average it had also stayed under historical averages since march 2020 new mexico has seen a similar increase with evictions averaging now at 140 percent the state s 2017 2019 averages and reaching the highest point since the eviction lab started tracking the state other states like minnesota and connecticut did not increase past their historical averages but saw increases nonetheless relative to the months preceding the end of the moratorium rental assistance funds of 46 5 billion have been allocated but the vast majority of the money has not been distributed treasury department secretary janet yellen has warned that she would begin to move funds from jurisdictions that have failed to distribute assistance by the end of september to ones that did in other words the biden administration will allow poor renters in areas with unwilling local governments to be deprived of federal rental assistance in a hearing on friday california democratic congresswoman maxine waters said state and local governments have only distributed 11 percent of the emergency rental assistance funds available there is no question that the funds are not reaching landlords and renters quickly or widely enough she meekly complained one of the major reasons for the failure to distribute the funds is resistance from landlords themselves who have exploited the landlord friendly character of the measure which gives them veto power over whether to accept it or not the solution the congressional democrats advocate would be even more favorable to landlords the expediting assistance to renters and landlords act of 2021 bill introduced by waters would allow landlords to directly apply for back rent themselves in what essentially amounts to a bailout of the landlords slumlords who maintain illegal units will simply throw out residents late on payments and get new desperate renters the recent flooding in new york city caused by hurricane ida exposed that hundreds of thousands of low income residents live in illegally converted basements in los angeles county with a population of 10 million there are an estimated 200 000 such illegal units in addition the new york times noted federal and local officials housing experts landlords and tenants cited an array of problems that slowed the flow of aid bureaucratic missteps at all levels of government onerous applications resistance from landlords the reluctance of local officials to ease eligibility requirements for the poor difficulty raising awareness that rental aid even existed and a steep rise in rents that increased the incentive for kicking out low income tenants housing assistance has also been decimated by decades of bipartisan attacks on the remains of the social safety net in the country the only comparable program to the emergency rental assistance funds program is the section 8 voucher program a federal program that provides funding to make up the difference between what tenants pay and what the going market rate is for housing by paying landlords and nonprofits as the times notes section 8 s funding has been stagnant for decades and waiting lists of up to 10 years are not uncommon in many cities given the onerous nature of the certification requirements section 8 was unable to provide any sort of useful means for the new money to be directed that is no preexisting infrastructure was in place for the relatively small amount of funds to be distributed for rental assistance by contrast there is a vast governmental infrastructure for the various bailouts of the financial and corporate oligarchy which has received trillions of dollars looted from the public treasury this includes the bailouts following the 2008 global financial crash and many other small bailouts of individual industries such as the airlines in 2001 as well as gm and chrysler in 2009 the bipartisan cares act has funneled trillions more to the largest corporations including purchases of their bad debts and the federal reserve pumps 120 billion in virtual free credit into the financial markets every month in other word a well oiled infrastructure exists for distributing aid to the ruling class which has enriched itself during the pandemic while tens of millions of people are being threatened with destitution and homelessness
in case you missed the parades featuring giant doobie floats the joint giveaways for the vaccinated or the general celebratory aroma of city streets recreational marijuana is now legal in new york while attention is trained on the new legal drug business the state is building another even larger cannabis business is awaiting its day in the sun already legal to grow and process industrial hemp is the potentially billion dollar new york industry few are paying attention to yet while it may take longer to scale up than recreational marijuana industrial hemp could have even greater economic potential for the state although most people are familiar with the drug marijuana that comes from the cannabis plant far fewer know about the many uses for hemp which looks similar but has negligible amounts of the psychoactive chemical thc for those who are familiar with hemp they may most closely associate it with their local hippie stores next to the crystals and incense but its uses range from textiles for clothes to construction material to food people are chasing these bright shiny objects and i think those will have maybe short lived potential said daniel dolgin owner of eaton hemp in central new york of recreational marijuana i think there will be more losers than winners there will be big winners but the industrial side has much less sex appeal as companies seek green alternatives to traditional products from cotton which is incredibly water intensive to grow and process to plastics hemp is becoming increasingly popular but it still must overcome a decadeslong disinformation campaign associating it with its closely related drug cousin and set up the supply chains to compete with the major industries that helped to kill hemp in the first place dolgin s farm was one of the first to win a license under the state department of agriculture and markets industrial hemp agricultural research pilot program established in 2015 since then he s been growing his vertically integrated business growing processing creating and marketing hemp products as a sort of proof of concept to others interested in the industry we re in sort of the innovation stage where you have to show like hey this can be done dolgin said currently eaton hemp has entered the pet care industry with a popular hemp pet bedding among other products including hemp based foods the major roadblock now is getting other farmers interested in taking the potential risk as well as getting investors and companies to buy into the industry which takes time eaton hemp also sells cbd products which are made from a hemp extract that for a brief moment completely dominated the hemp market it s not a drug per se but it s touted as offering a calming effect without the high of thc unlike with other industrial hemp uses that require a degree of risk in building up the market cbd was a popular fad seen as an easy market to enter the problem was that the market became oversaturated with products without proper regulations southern tier assembly member donna lupardo sponsor of various hemp bills said that while she s eager to get those cbd regulations finalized the state is ripe to capitalize on hemp s many other uses i have a briefcase i call it my hemp sample bag lupardo said of a briefcase made of hemp fibers that she uses to carry sample hemp products like alternative styrofoam and building materials once people see what s possible they re very intrigued by it i have a briefcase i call it my hemp sample bag once people see what s possible they re very intrigued by it assembly member donna lupardo new york is already in a good position to enter the slowly burgeoning industrial hemp market as a major national leader we re already considered a leader in this industry lupardo said adding that the state was among the top five in the country in terms of licensed acreage before the pandemic we are absolutely viewed as not only innovators in terms of new products and new potential we re also viewed as a state that s willing to push the envelope daniel walcyzk is a professor of mechanical engineering at rensselaer polytechnic institute focused on hemp biocomposites as an alternative to the likes of carbon fiber he said that he can think of no state that is more advanced in its research new york has the potential to be a key leader in bast fiber including hemp research and development and application walcyzk said there just needs to be more thought into where the funding is going to go from an agricultural standpoint new york is well suited for growing hemp which thrives in a temperate climate like the state s unlike cannabis for recreational marijuana which does better in warmer climes it is not water intensive it helps replenish soil when used as part of a regular crop rotation and can even be used for remediating brownfields with toxic or hazardous materials in the soil and generally does not require pesticides or herbicides to grow as it naturally suppresses weeds also it offers a high return on energy consumed to grow the plant as effectively every part can be used in some way our motto is nothing goes to waste because we use every part of the plant to create a viable product dolgin said certainly the state is better suited for growing industrial hemp than recreational marijuana most of which will likely be grown in energy intensive indoor grow operations in new york jennifer gilbert jenkins an associate professor of agricultural science at suny morrisville said that the state s geography also is conducive to a robust industrial hemp industry as it has agricultural regions interspersed with small urban areas this means that materials don t have to travel far to get from farm gate to the first stage of processing gilbert jenkins said the geography of the state lends itself to ease of tying agricultural and industrial sectors together eaton hemp products courtesy of eaton hemp in that vein the agricultural side is just one part of the industry that could potentially benefit new york with the processing and manufacturing side presenting a potential boon for the state as well gilbert jenkins pointed out that the growth of the hemp industry could help revitalize rural areas that have lost manufacturing jobs in the past several decades if major industries decide to move into the state to process the raw materials they purchase that s the million dollar question gilbert jenkins said when asked just how big this industry could be for new york i think it could be a great tool to use to revitalize downtrodden poorer areas of the state hurting for investment and job growth hemp also offers new york an avenue into the green jobs sector as more companies are looking to invest in environmental alternatives to traditional products much stock has been put into the prospect of solar panel manufacturing plants in the state but hemp growing and processing is another way to grow the sector hemp could be a multibillion dollar industry particularly in the construction field said walcyzk but it s more than that it could be huge but i think more importantly is that it s the future walczyk said oil is going to run out natural gas is going to run out and carbon fiber by the way is petroleum based hemp materials have to be part of the engineering material future despite the multifaceted nature of industrial hemp the state still has major roadblocks to overcome first and foremost are the decades of disinformation about the plant after it was lumped in with the drug marijuana that depressed its use and research for years hemp was at one point a major crop in the u s to the point that colonial farmers were required to grow it in the 19th century henry ford famously created blueprints for a car built out of hemp biocomposites in fact in an article written in 1937 one magazine said that hemp was poised to become the billion dollar crop but in the 1930s and later with the nixon era and the rockefeller drug laws hemp got lumped together with marijuana as part of a concerted lobbying effort by major industries that stood to lose if hemp became too big including petroleum the producer of synthetic materials cotton and paper in fact strict laws about and demonization of marijuana have been traced back to the attempt to kill the hemp industry when new inventions made processing it easier and cheaper than before it wasn t until the 2014 u s farm bill that hemp became legal to grow for research purposes and was given a definition to differentiate it from marijuana so the state and many parts of the world similarly influenced by those big businesses have a long education campaign ahead of them to undo years of intentional effort to keep the hemp industry from burgeoning even as attitudes change there is also the issue of getting investors interested in the industry companies to set up shop or source from new york and support from the state there s no real way that farmers on our own can just create this industry through entrepreneurship and grit and hustle said damian fagon owner of gullybean farm in the hudson valley it has to kind of come from the top down with some guidance from the state lupardo is working on her end to get buy in from the state through conversations with empire state development but she said that the pandemic has interrupted her efforts there s no real way that farmers on our own can just create this industry through entrepreneurship and grit and hustle damian fagon owner of gullybean farm in the hudson valley dolgin said he has had conversations with the state department of transportation and the executive chamber about using hemp for phytoremediation remediating land with toxins and erosion control but he also acknowledged the hurdles the state still needs to overcome he compared the industry to different stages of development for the advent of the internet right now a lot of people who are kind of looking at the industry are looking at internet 3 0 and looking at uses for industrial hemp that don t have a market don t have the technology don t have the efficiency but it all holds a lot of promise dolgin said it s why he says his company is thinking about internet 1 0 by finding industries they can add products to for which there is already demand and buying hemp from other farmers to encourage them to begin growing it themselves fagon also cautioned against pinning too much hope on the promise of industrial hemp in new york once the market begins to take off more and other states start to get involved in growing manufacturing and processing he said that while hemp textiles could help revitalize the likes of garment making in new york city he said that competing with other states with more farmland and infrastructure could put a damper on industrial hemp in new york industrial hemp will be subject to the same push and pull factors that pushed the dairy industry out of new york fagon said he doesn t want to see farmers fall into the same trap as with cbd which promised big payouts but turned into a bust for many but many hemp proponents see a real opportunity for new york to enter the industry in a big way and with a new governor in the executive mansion they have renewed hope we have a governor who s not afraid to have her picture taken with me standing next to a cannabis plant lupardo said recalling a 2017 picture then lt gov kathy hochul asked to have taken at the state s first industrial hemp summit she s very very very big on what we re talking about right here

much is made of iran s use of proxy or allied groups to exert hard power influence throughout the middle east where tehran believes its interests are under threat lebanon or sees an opportunity to exert greater influence syria iraq or to act as a spoiler yemen but far less is made of its use of power of the energy kind exemplified in its use of its energy exports to take advantage of regional states inability to cater for their own domestic requirements in neighbouring iraq for instance iranian gas and electricity powers more than a third of the country s energy needs particularly in the south so reliant was iraq on iranian energy that former us president donald trump had to carve out an exemption from his policy of maximum pressure sanctions on tehran lest the iraqi grid collapsed and despite promises to reduce this reliance iraq has found it hard to kick the habit when baghdad falls into arrears on its payments and tehran squeezes supplies political instability results iran s energy diplomacy abroad is not without its challenges at home tehran also exports electricity to afghanistan pakistan and turkey although in the case of turkey pressure from washington and its own political desire to diversify its energy providers has seen a recent drop off in energy imports from iran but it is in lebanon where the role of energy in expanding iran s soft power has once again been highlighted lebanon s economy is broken with a collapse in the local currency leaving the government unable to afford to buy fuel and maintain subsidies meaning the price for a gallon of petrol has risen by 220 per cent in a year last month the country s central bank moved to eliminate fuel subsidies altogether earning the ire of the government beirut is suffering acute fuel shortages anwar amro afp via getty images enter iran or more precisely its lebanese ally hezbollah hezbollah s secretary general hassan nasrallah claimed that lebanon would be importing iranian oil paid for in lebanese pounds while caretaker energy minister raymond ghajar has denied that any permit for iranian oil imports had been sought an iranian tanker is supposedly bound for the syrian port of baniyas with its cargo then to be trucked to lebanon how much this will alleviate lebanon s current power crisis is open to question although the move is mostly about symbolism as much as substance these actions threaten the integrity of the us sanctions regime against iran and will boost the domestic stocks of hezbollah whose reputation has become increasingly tarnished as part of a government that continuously fails to serve the lebanese people but alternatives to iran such as gas imports from egypt or electricity from jordan would require transit through syria and that brings with it different challenges it would be another step towards re integrating syria into the regional architecture regardless of the technical upgrades to the infrastructure required and give damascus access to hard currency but from the us perspective such a move would be the lesser of two evils iran is always alert to opportunities understanding the energy cards it holds despite the economic constraints it operates under tehran has shown it is willing to play its hand in regional relations but iran s energy diplomacy abroad is not without its challenges at home this summer saw power blackouts in parts of iran as increased demand including from bitcoin miners coincided with reduced hydro electricity output during drought conditions it is unclear how much longer iran is going to be able to leverage its energy resources in the region to gain influence particularly if unable to negotiate a successful outcome in talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal if washington does re join the deal expect iran s power diplomacy to become even more effective rodger shanahan

a crisis for the us and global financial system is looming unless a conflict over lifting the us debt ceiling can be quickly resolved the conflict came into public prominence last week when us treasury secretary janet yellen wrote a letter to congress warning that the government was running out of money after a debt limit on government borrowing was reinstated on august 1 the limit had been suspended for the previous two years since then yellen wrote the treasury had been employing certain extraordinary measures to ensure that the government could continue to fund itself but these measures were reaching their limit once all available measures and cash on hand are fully exhausted the united states of america would be unable to meet its obligations for the first time in our history she said the treasury was not able to provide a specific estimate of how long the extraordinary measures would last but the best and most recent estimate was that money would run out some time in the middle of october this is not the first time a conflict has arisen over the debt ceiling the last major battle was in 2011 during the obama administration while it was ultimately resolved and a default avoided the conflict produced significant turbulence in financial markets and led to a downgrade of the us government s credit rating for the first time in history standard and poor s lowered the nation s credit worthiness from aaa to aa it is estimated the conflict cost the government 1 3 billion in increased interest charges on its debt in 2011 with additional costs in the years that followed reporting on the present dispute the financial times wrote that stand offs over the debt limit are sometimes dismissed as political theatre that is ultimately resolved but top biden administration officials view the stand off with increasing seriousness those concerns were set out in yellen s letter we have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence raise short term borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the united states she wrote a delay that calls into question the federal government s ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the us economy and global financial markets she urged that congress address the debt limit with broad partisan support in order to protect the full faith and credit of the united states by acting as soon as possible but broad partisan support is the least likely of all outcomes as the debt ceiling issue has become part of republican opposition to the biden administration s spending programs the republicans have insisted that any resolution must be part of a budget reconciliation vote it can be passed in the house where the democrats have a majority and by the senate which is split 50 50 with democratic vice president kamala harris having a tie breaking vote without any republicans having to vote for it they have refused to pass stand alone legislation that would lift the debt ceiling with 46 republican senators signing a letter to that effect meaning that it would not reach the level of 60 votes needed to defeat a filibuster their position was summed up in an interview given by wisconsin senator ron johnson who said the democrats shouldn t be expecting republicans to raise the debt ceiling to accommodate their deficit spending republican senate leader mitch mcconnell has insisted in the past that democrats not expect any republican support on the debt limit a position he repeated in an interview last week this debt ceiling is going to cover all of the things that all of us have been opposing he said and the democrats need to do the responsible thing and raise the debt ceiling because america must never default on its debt in fact the raising of the ceiling is needed to cover measures already authorised by congress and reductions in revenue going back to the trump tax cuts of 2017 as well as relief packages carried out under his administration white house press secretary jen psaki appealed for bipartisan support saying the debt issue was a shared responsibility and congress should move forward as they have multiple times but these times are very different large swathes of the republican party continue to insist that the election was stolen and provided crucial support for the attempted coup by trump of january 6 with the fascist led storming of the capitol house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters last week we have several options but she maintained that an increase in the debt ceiling would not be part of the biden spending package which the democrats are now seeking to put through congress in what could become a high stakes conflict the wall street journal reported last month that one option being considered was a stand alone bill that would put pressure on republicans to support it or risk rattling financial markets but given the overriding concern of the democrats for the stability of wall street and their continued subservience to the republicans this option would have to be considered as highly unlikely another option may be to attach the debt ceiling to another piece of necessary government funding while it has not been featured heavily in news coverage the debt ceiling issue is attracting international concern because of its possible impact on highly fragile global financial markets last week the financial times ran the yellen letter as its lead news story warning of the mounting risk of a us sovereign debt crisis in australia a column last friday by sydney morning herald financial commentator stephen bartholomeusz warned that america could be only weeks away from a debt default that would throw the us economy and global financial markets into chaos he wrote that a default on us debt was almost unthinkable and congress had always found a way to avert such an outcome however he continued it can t be ruled out entirely given how intense and unpredictable politics has become since last year s us election and trump s eviction from the white house

the delta variant is spreading through dana plants across the us putting workers lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk auto parts workers at dana report although the contract for some 3 500 auto parts workers expired august 18 and workers rejected a proposed tentative agreement by 90 percent the usw and uaw have forced workers to continue working including mandatory overtime to help the company stockpile parts in preparation for a strike as a result the plants are becoming centers for the spread of the pandemic the wsws contacted dana s office of safety as well as spokespersons for the uaw and usw to request specific numbers and received no response as of press time a number of hospitals near dana plants also said they could not provide information about the number of hospitalizations among workers the following review is based on statements from local union officials reports from workers and data from county health departments dry ridge kentucky the most serious outbreak appears to be at dana s plant in dry ridge multiple workers report that a large proportion of the plant s workforce of around 800 is currently out due to covid ex dana worker steven fletcher says he was fired from dana dry ridge after missing time due to covid earlier this year warren michigan there are currently 9 active cases at the plant in warren michigan according to an update from the company dated september 9 the company claims there were 53 confirmed positive cases in 2020 but already 114 this year at least one worker at the plant has died from covid in 2021 it appears that coronavirus has spread in the warren plant nearly four times faster than in the surrounding city of warren a large suburb of detroit this year has seen 7 312 total cases in the city equal to 5 42 percent of warren s population according to the county covid dashboard by contrast at the dana plant which is believed to have a workforce of roughly 600 the 114 reported cases in 2021 would amount to around 19 percent of the plant s typical workforce this is up sharply from last year when the percentages for warren and the dana plant were roughly 5 and 8 8 percent respectively incredibly workers report that dana and the uaw are sending a team of workers from warren to the dry ridge plant to help fill orders the plant in columbia missouri is also reportedly sending a group of workers to dry ridge there is a substantial risk that they will get infected in dry ridge and then bring the virus back to their coworkers crossville tennessee it appears there is also an outbreak at dana s crossville tennessee plant a usw notice published september 10 said that due to covid infections we had to delay the vote at the crossville local however while the vote was postponed the union kept production going fort wayne indiana an individual with detailed knowledge told the wsws that covid is spreading in the fort wayne plant two of the individuals with whom this source works are presently sick with covid in a separate department of the plant one worker says there are 5 confirmed positive cases other workers at the plant report that they have asked for exact numbers but that the usw and company have not told them workers say the company sprayed them with fungicide at fort wayne earlier this year and forced them to keep working when there were reports of positive cases paris tennessee a worker at the paris plant reports that at least two workers in their department are currently sick with covid and that recently an entire shift of maintenance department workers tested positive another person with knowledge of conditions at the paris plant told the wsws i don t know the exact number of active cases the company makes a point of keeping cases as quiet as possible i know for sure there have been 2 deaths but i think there was a third many others have caught covid that turned into pneumonia which made recovery even more difficult danville kentucky one worker at the danville plant reports five workers in their department are presently sick with covid according to a company notice 8 workers at the plant out of a workforce of 300 are currently out for confirmed cases lima ohio a worker reports that there have been at least 5 or 6 recent cases in their department and that the company did not clean any of the equipment after the workers tested positive another worker in lima ohio said we would never know it s not like they clean or care anyways workers at other plants were unable to confirm the total case number because they say the company and unions are not reporting the numbers a worker in toledo ohio told the wsws we have had employees who have tested positive been told not to tell others as they can t afford for a whole line to call off on a covid leave i ve had people gone for days on my line thinking they were on vacation and hear later that they had covid this is the normal at our dana plant i worked next to my team lead every day who tested positive i didn t know until 3 days after she had been gone i thought she was on vacation an auburn hills michigan worker says they don t notify us by text like they used to our own safety guy isn t vaccinated so its hard to take him serious case data from local government organizations reveals that in every county where a dana plant is located covid cases are on the rise substantially cases are at an all time peak in dry ridge henderson louisville and danville kentucky as well as paris humboldt and crossville tennessee cases are increasing rapidly in lima and toledo ohio fort wayne indiana columbia missouri pottstown pennsylvania and warren st clair and auburn hills michigan if workers get sick it is more likely than ever that they will not be able to be treated in the hospital the hospitals in paris crossville and danville have no icu beds available according to public reporting in fort wayne indiana the only two hospitals with public data are 99 and 97 percent full in maumee ohio there is only one bed remaining at st luke s hospital located on the same highway exit as dana s world corporate headquarters the shortage of beds is particularly acute in kentucky and tennessee where nine of dana s 21 us plants are located and which are currently experiencing some of their worst ever surges for seven of these nine facilities icu bed utilization within a 30 mile radius of the plant s physical address is above the national average of 81 82 percent according to the us department of health and human services for the louisville plant according to the latest government figures icu utilization is 110 percent for three plants danville kentucky gordonsville tennessee and crossville tennessee there are fewer than 10 available icu beds within a 30 mile radius by keeping the plants open dana and the uaw are not only placing workers own lives at risk but also the lives of their spouses children elderly parents and the community at large the delta variant has proven capable of killing healthy children or giving them lingering effects including impairment of brain function if the virus is already in dana s plants that means it is likely spreading in the schools grocery stores the restaurants and everywhere else indeed manufacturing plants next to schools are known to be key drivers of community transmission at the beginning of the pandemic major outbreaks in rural counties throughout the country were highly correlated with outbreaks at meatpacking plants which management with the support of an executive order by the trump administration kept open in spite of mass infections efforts to mitigate the spread of the pandemic including through mask wearing and vaccination are not enough to stop the spread as long as the plants are open the virus will spread the delta variant spreads indoors even with mask wearing and breakthrough cases of vaccinated people are more common the plants are poorly ventilated without adequate air conditioning meaning particles sit in the air and spread to every production line and every part of the plant the policy of the us government and the corporations is to kill workers for profit right now the governors of all states where dana plants are located whether democrats or republicans are opening up schools and forcing workers children as well as teachers to risk their lives so workers can go to work to be exploited for profit as a result 660 000 people have died in the us every day twice as many people die of covid in the us roughly 1 000 than soldiers on both sides died on an average day during the civil war roughly 500 all over the world it is the same and over four million people are dead meanwhile corporate profits and the stock market are reaching new records while the billionaires enrich themselves through pandemic profiteering the world socialist web site and autoworker newsletter call for the immediate shutdown of all dana plants with full quarantine pay for every worker workers must not be forced to choose between infection and eviction dana ceo james kamsickas 2020 salary alone 10 5 million is enough to provide every dana worker with 3 000 immediately to cover costs during quarantine add to this the 14 million in quarterly dividend payments dana pays out which it resumed in march after suspending it in 2020 due to the pandemic as well as its 7 3 billion in total assets and there is more than enough money to pay workers full time for the weeks required to control the spread
iran and the un atomic agency on sunday announced the iaea will keep up surveillance of tehran s nuclear activities soothing a sore point in talks to resuscitate a 2015 deal to curb its programme with negotiations in vienna between iran and world powers deadlocked the steps hashed out with international atomic energy agency chief rafael grossi on a visit to tehran leave a chink of hope for us president joe biden s ambition to restore the agreement known as the jcpoa since donald trump s administration walked away in 2018 iran has since also retreated from many of its commitments in a joint statement sunday grossi and iranian atomic energy organization aeoi chief mohammad eslami also one of the country s vice presidents hailed a spirit of cooperation and mutual trust while noting that surveillance was an issue to be treated exclusively in a technical manner eslami welcomed good and constructive negotiations with mrgrossi while again insisting on the technical nature of the bargain iran s official irna news agency reported their deal relates to limits iran has imposed on the iaea s ability to monitor various of its nuclear facilities iran has refused to provide real time footage from cameras and other surveillance tools that the un agency has installed in these locations nuclear monitoring under a compromise deal the monitoring equipment remains in the agency s custody but the data is in iran s possession and must not be erased as long as the arrangement remains in force initially agreed for three months the compromise was extended by another month and then expired on june 24 with no word on next steps the iaea said in a statement last tuesday that its verification and monitoring activities have been seriously undermined by tehran s actions but under sunday s agreement iaea s inspectors are permitted to service the identified equipment and replace their storage media which will be kept under the joint iaea and iran s aeoi seals in the islamic republic of iran the joint statement said the way and the timing are agreed by the two sides stalled talks the surveillance issue had heightened tensions at the time the new government of iran s ultraconservative president ebrahimraisi was taking charge in tehran iran has also boosted its stocks of uranium enriched above the levels allowed in the 2015 deal the iaea has said a meeting of the un agency s board of governors is scheduled for monday we have decided to be present at the next meeting and to continue our talks on the sidelines iran s eslami told irna raisi argued in a statement on wednesday that his country was transparent about its nuclear activities which iran has always insisted are peaceful naturally in the event of a non constructive approach by the iaea it is unreasonable to expect iran to respond constructively he said us secretary of state antony blinken cautioned last wednesday that faced with the impasse the united states was close to abandoning its diplomatic efforts
this lecture was delivered at the socialist equality party us 2021 summer school held august 1 through august 6 by marcus day a writer for the world socialist web site the events at volvo trucks this year have crucial theoretical political and historical significance what took place marks the most important convergence in decades between a major struggle of industrial workers and the program and activity of the trotskyist movement for roughly three months nearly 3 000 heavy truck manufacturing workers in dublin virginia fought with increasing consciousness against both volvo one of the largest multinational companies in the world and the corporatist united auto workers union at an early stage in this fight with the close collaboration assistance and encouragement of the socialist equality party workers formed the volvo workers rank and file committee vwrfc striking volvo truck workers in the course of the struggle the vwrfc became the rallying point for broad sections of workers and their opposition to further concessions in a combined effort with the world socialist web site and the sep the vwrfc worked to promote workers aspirations develop their fighting capacity articulate their interests and demands and unify workers both at the new river valley plant and across volvo s operations internationally the vwrfc and the wsws combated the lies and maneuvers of volvo and the uaw and fought to cut a path to win the strike what was the context within which the volvo strike emerged over the last three years there has been a growing number of strikes and other forms of class struggle internationally in which our party has played an increasingly central and direct role beginning in 2018 there was the wave of teachers strikes in a number of us states in 2019 there were the wildcat strikes by tens of thousands of auto parts workers in matamoros mexico early in the year in the us in the early fall of 2019 there was the strike by 40 000 gm autoworkers during which the party developed important connections between workers in the us and those in silao mexico there were also the strikes by 20 000 at t workers the walkout by over 30 000 chicago teachers and the strike by 3 600 workers at mack trucks which is also owned by volvo workers in these struggles came almost immediately into conflict with the unions these were part of a global upsurge of the class struggle with major strikes in france and other european countries in india and in brazil and virtually throughout latin america mass demonstrations against inequality and attacks on democratic rights broke out seemingly in every corner of the globe as we ve explained the coronavirus pandemic emerged under these conditions of growing class struggle as well as advanced political crisis acting as a trigger event accelerating and intensifying the underlying contradictions of capitalism in early 2020 as the enormity of the danger posed by the pandemic began to become clear to masses of people workers sought to take action defying the criminal attempts by both the corporations and the trade unions to sacrifice health and lives to maintain production and keep profits flowing in march wildcat strikes among autoworkers spread from italy to spain and canada and then to a number of us auto plants the slogans and political line of the icfi found increasingly direct expression in these actions the sociality equality party statement calling for a shutdown of the auto industry to save lives was read by tens of thousands as the work stoppages spread the plants in canada and the us where job actions took place were ones where we had influence among workers developed over a number of years just two months later mass global protests were ignited by the police murder of george floyd in minneapolis including the largest demonstrations in us history protests took place essentially in every major american city and in many small towns encompassing young people workers and broad sections of the population of every race and ethnicity over the course of 2020 the international committee of the fourth international icfi intervened in and sought to give leadership to a wide range of struggles against the ruling class herd immunity policies working with autoworkers educators amazon workers and transit workers to initiate rank and file committees independent of the corporatist trade union bureaucracies our party has played a particularly important role in the struggles of teachers and educators against unsafe school reopenings over the last two years helping educators establish rank and file safety committees in a number of states and cities as well as in other countries and countering the grotesque lies of the ruling class that children are immune to or do not transmit the coronavirus class struggle expands in 2021 entering into 2021 the struggles of workers have taken on a new and more determined character they have been fueled by widespread anger over the catastrophic handling of the pandemic the accompanying social devastation and the obscene growth of corporate profits and the fortunes of the billionaire pandemic profiteers since the beginning of the year the following strikes have erupted with some still ongoing hunts point produce workers in new york city st vincent nurses in massachusetts columbia university and new york university grad workers ati steelworkers in pennsylvania and other states warrior met coal miners in alabama exxonmobil oil workers locked out in texas cook county nurses and state workers in and around chicago frito lay workers in kansas and pepsi workers in indiana volvo cars workers in belgium electrical workers in turkey vale nickel miners and rio tinto smelter workers in canada tea plantation workers in sri lanka shipbuilders in south korea new zealand nurses teachers transit workers and railway workers in brazil food delivery workers in germany in all of these struggles workers have been in conflict with the unions fighting against both the concessions the unions previously granted to employers and the new ones they are seeking to impose this was the case at volvo where workers were determined to reverse the conditions agreed to earlier by the uaw first there was the multi tier wage and benefit system which the uaw has assisted the corporations in spreading throughout the heavy agricultural equipment deere caterpillar and auto industries over the last 25 years repudiating the principle of equal pay for equal work for which earlier generations had fought the tier system has been used as a means of permanently lowering the wages of new hires and rolling back pensions and other benefits most importantly from the standpoint of the companies and the union it has served as a strategic wedge to pit different sections of workers against each other in an attempt to block a unified struggle and undermine solidarity while wages for newer workers at volvo were slashed significantly after 2011 pay raises for core group i e legacy workers were frozen or consistently kept below inflation lowering their real wages the company continually shifted more and more health care costs premiums deductibles maximum out of pocket charges onto the workers further eroding their take home pay this was done not just for active workers but also for retirees who had been promised that their health care costs would be taken care of after having devoted their working lives to the company retirees have been increasingly unable to live on their fixed income and compelled to take on work in their 60s 70s and beyond thus prior to 2021 anger had been building up at volvo for years particularly when workers were forced by the uaw and the company to continue laboring throughout the pandemic generating billions in profits for volvo and its wealthy shareholders it should be pointed out that our efforts to reach workers at the plant began more than a decade ago in 2008 when wsws reporters spoke to workers on the picket lines during a strike we continued to report on struggles at the new river valley factory in subsequent years and extended our contact with volvo and mack workers april 17 april 30 the first volvo strike as any careful review of events makes clear the uaw was working from the outset with a plan to impose volvo s demands for new concessions on the workers this involved centrally the near total information blackout by the uaw on its discussions with the company which the union would continue throughout the months long struggle when the uaw would infrequently speak to workers of the negotiations it would do so as a mouthpiece for volvo conveying management s lies and threats and adding on lies and threats of its own in the middle of march the uaw extended the previous contract with the company a five year concessions agreement forced through in 2016 for 30 days defying the workers 97 percent strike authorization vote and allowing the company to stockpile trucks hoping to contain and head off workers opposition by calling a limited strike and prepare the ground to push a deal through the uaw sanctioned a walkout beginning on april 17 it quickly became clear that there was broad interest in and receptivity to the perspective of the wsws among the workers on april 20 the article written by comrade ed hightower striking volvo truck workers in virginia demand restoration of uaw backed concessions was widely circulated on volvo and mack trucks workers facebook groups comrades in the region set to work systematically contacting workers via social media because of its previous theoretical and political work the party was sensitized to the emergence of working class opposition at volvo and anticipated that conflict with the uaw would inevitably arise thus the sep mobilized to act on the possibilities present in the situation and provide crucial strategic and tactical advice and organizational support to the workers in their struggle and as we were expanding our network of contacts and beginning to hold more frequent discussions with workers the icfi was simultaneously preparing to launch a major international initiative on april 24 the icfi published the statement forward to the international workers alliance of rank and file committees it advanced critical conceptions that guided the intervention among volvo workers the statement explained for the working class to fight back a path must be created to coordinate its struggles in different factories industries and countries in opposition to the ruling class and the corporatist unions the iwa rfc will work to develop the framework for new forms of independent democratic and militant rank and file organizations of workers in factories schools and workplaces on an international scale the working class is ready to fight but it is shackled by reactionary bureaucratic organizations that suppress every expression of resistance new pathways for mass struggle must be created the formation of the volvo workers rank and file committee early on april 30 a friday at the end of the second week of the walkout word began to spread among workers that a tentative agreement had been reached between the uaw and the company and that the uaw planned to call off the strike no information about the terms of the deal was released provoking growing distrust and anger among the workers later that afternoon the party organized a meeting with a small group of volvo workers after reviewing the maneuvers and duplicity of the uaw and warning that it was being done with the aim of engineering a sellout we won agreement with the workers that they would establish the basis of a rank and file committee as well as their support for the publication of a statement calling for opposition to the uaw s sabotage of the strike at our prompting workers explained during the meeting what they felt they needed to achieve a decent standard of living and proper working conditions irrespective of the impact on the company s bottom line this led to the formulation of the following initial demands which would continue to be developed throughout the struggle 1 a 25 percent across the board wage increase to restore the income lost over the last three uaw contracts 2 the abolition of the multi tier wage system and the restoration of the principle of equal pay for equal work 3 full overtime payments for work over eight hours a day and weekend work no forced overtime one full day notice before any scheduling of overtime with the right to refuse with no retaliation 4 an end to speedup and harassment by management we are not inmates of a prison but self respecting workers 5 workers oversight of safety protocols and social distancing to stop the spread of covid 19 the right to halt production and close the plant for full cleaning with guaranteed compensation to workers if there are covid outbreaks a few broader points should be made here on the workers who participated in the committee at various stages as we ve noted previously many in this region in southwestern virginia previously voted for trump including some of those workers who would come into leading positions on the committee itself there were also other political viewpoints those who supported the democrats either biden or sanders others expressed anarcho syndicalist politics and there were also some who considered themselves socialists while explaining our socialist program we did not set agreement with it as a condition to participate in the committee or even agreement that the uaw was beyond reform what was required was agreement that a struggle for workers interests was needed and that workers could not wait for the uaw to act a sorting out took place some workers who participated early in the committee drew closer to us over time others drifted away but then got back in touch later on there was a dynamic interaction between the workers coming into struggle and the most conscious factor in the situation the revolutionary party comrades held daily continuous wide ranging discussions with workers listening learning about the conditions they confronted how sentiments and moods would shift in response to new developments party members strove to raise the level of consciousness of workers not infrequently coming into conflict with their initial limited conceptions we explained the class forces at work behind volvo and the uaw the role of wall street and finance capital there were discussions on the nature of the uaw and the degeneration of the unions the history of earlier working class struggles on identity politics and our campaign against the 1619 project and on the russian revolution and what socialism genuinely is in opposition to its many counterfeits and falsifications throughout our discussions we stressed the critical importance of workers developing their own initiative warning them against placing any confidence in the uaw the uaw and company management increasingly fearful of the hearing the wsws was getting predictably sought to sow distrust by means of red baiting and the promotion of anti communist tropes while this was not entirely without impact many workers came to see that the wsws provided the only honest and truthful information about their struggle countering the propaganda of the company moreover many and not only those at volvo came to view the wsws and sep as the most consistent proponents of the interests of all workers at the plant one of the workers on the committee speaking after the strike described the change of attitudes among those who were initially skeptical of the committee there were plenty of naysayers about the committee at first but then everybody was like what is the committee saying we heard management we heard the uaw now we want to hear what the committee is saying eventually even the naysayers were saying the committee is the only credible source of information may 1 may 16 runup to first contract vote in the 72 hours following the uaw s moves to shut down the first volvo strike graduate student workers at columbia university in new york city voted to reject a concessions agreement backed by a uaw affiliated union and exxonmobil initiated its lockout of 600 oil workers in beaumont texas the first volvo workers rank and file committee statement was issued stop the uaw sabotage of our strike no contract no work as well as a statement of the wsws autoworker newsletter calling for opposition to the uaw sellout most importantly on saturday may 1 the icfi held its international may day online rally elaborating and motivating the call for the formation of the iwa rfc the rally presented a comprehensive analysis of the global capitalist crisis and outlined the internationalist socialist program necessary to resolve it at volvo the uaw was able to shut down the first strike but as information about the deal began to emerge indignation spread rapidly among the workers the basic terms of the first deal which the uaw almost certainly received from volvo and agreed to before the first strike began would persist throughout subsequent supposedly new agreements which contained largely cosmetic modifications the contract included continuation of the tier system under the cover of a years long progression to top pay onerous increases in health care costs for active workers attacks on retiree health care below inflation raises effectively wage cuts for the top of the pay scale extension of working hours and an attack on the eight hour day through the alternative work schedule the company and uaw would subsequently claim this was removed in later contract proposals but this remains to be seen while the uaw was seeking to sell this pro company agreement to workers former uaw president dennis williams who was president during the last contract at volvo in 2016 was being sentenced for his part in the scheme to embezzle union funds the sentencing of his successor gary jones would follow less than a month later in june undoubtedly the years long uaw corruption scandal which demonstrated irrefutably that the union was run by dues swindlers and bribe takers played a role in further alienating volvo workers from the uaw however what is significant is that even as the federal government has tried to wrap up its investigation and claim that the uaw s leadership now has clean hands workers distrust and hostility toward the uaw has not lessened but instead increased many volvo workers rightly suspected even before the contract struggle that nothing fundamental had changed and those feelings found plenty of confirmation in the uaw s treachery throughout the struggle the work we have done exposing the material interests of the uaw its ties to the stock market and the swelling incomes of the union executives has been an essential element in furthering that process in the runup to the first contract vote uaw secretary treasurer ray curry who oversaw the entire contract process as head of the uaw s heavy trucks department arrogantly stated that the contract would pass by 60 percent instead on may 16 workers voted down the agreement by 91 percent just a few days later the first open letter was issued from the volvo workers rank and file committee to uaw international president rory gamble curry and uaw local 2069 president matt blondino the letter carefully reviewed the lying maneuvers of the uaw and raised a series of demands directed to the uaw first we will not accept any contract that is negotiated behind closed doors all negotiations must be supervised by a representative of the rank and file workers we will not accept another contract proposal cooked up behind our backs for the simple reason that this would only produce another sellout second we outline here the minimal basis for an agreement that workers will accept a 25 percent across the board wage increase to restore income lost over the last three contracts maintain current health insurance rates and coverage fully paid health care benefits for retirees with no copays or premiums end the multi tier wage system and transfer all workers to top tier pay and benefits eliminate the alternative work schedule and keep current overtime rules implement a cola clause to meet the soaring prices of consumer goods five personal days for all workers not just salary workers a 3 500 contract ratification bonus we are not interested in hearing talk about how the company cannot afford these demands even in the midst of our strike volvo reported 1 billion in profits in the first three months of 2021 alone the stock price has doubled in the past 12 months martin lundstedt the ceo makes 51 million a year third any resumption of strike activity cannot be used to starve us into submission in order to get us to agree to the same deal we already defeated strikers must be provided with full income for the duration of and from the beginning of any strike paid for from the 700 million uaw strike fund that has been built up with our dues money fourth we will not accept another attempt to force a contract through with lies and threats any new agreement must be provided in full to all workers with two weeks for us to review and discuss before a vote workers would tell us the letter spread like wildfire throughout the plant leading to a significant upsurge in interest in joining the committee it s important to stress that these the demands were raised not from the standpoint of bolstering illusions in the uaw but rather of exposing the maneuvers and pro corporate character of the uaw this required that we take into account the fact that while there was overwhelming opposition to the attempts to impose new concessions and a rank and file committee had been established the uaw still retained control over the negotiations and was continuing its efforts to keep workers in the dark and work out a way behind their backs to get the deal through moreover despite widespread distrust and hostility towards the uaw there still remained illusions among workers even among committee members in the possibility that the union executives could be compelled to come back with a better agreement and even that the uaw could be reformed the challenge was to find a bridge to the consciousness of these workers and a lever both to help them develop their own initiative and to encourage the incipient insurrection against the union bureaucracy on may 20 the day after the open letter began to be circulated the uaw announced its second tentative agreement with volvo which was now for six years instead of five ray curry lyingly claimed as he would with every subsequent deal that it made even more solid gains toward fair pay benefits and job security protections from may 20 to june 6 as the uaw s selective highlights revealed that the deal was little different from the first opposition and anger mounted in the runup to the vote on the second tentative agreement the vwrfc gained a growing hearing and more workers contacted it it issued several statements over this period as the situation developed analyzing each new turn in the struggle show us the contract may 22 vote no to a slave s contract may 28 we need a strategy to win june 4 on june 6 the second tentative agreement was again overwhelmingly rejected by virtually the same margin 90 percent a devastating repudiation of the uaw june 7 july 14 the second strike the uaw seeing the extent of the opposition and feeling it could not get its deal with the company through without shifting its tactics authorized a new strike beginning at noon on june 7 the same day the immensely important perspective column by comrade david north was published volvo truck workers in virginia return to the picket lines a turning point in the us and global class struggle placing the volvo strike in its broader historical context the perspective stated in history there is such a thing as retribution for all the crimes committed by capitalism against the working class over the past 40 years the ruling class in the very process of attacking the working class and vastly enriching itself has overseen a vast expansion and integration of the capitalist system of production the most significant and revolutionary outcome of this process driven by staggering advances in science and technology is the massive growth in the global working class the volvo workers in dublin virginia are well aware of the fact that the corporation headquartered in gothenburg sweden employs almost 100 000 workers in production facilities located in 18 different countries spanning every continent many of these facilities are interdependent requiring a flow of products from one plant to another contrary to the claims of the bureaucracy that resistance to the corporations is hopeless the workers realize that their potential power if organized and deployed globally is immense therefore the critical issue for the volvo workers and the working class as a whole is that of perspective program and leadership it became clear almost immediately that the second walkout unwanted by both the company and the uaw was different from the first franky marchand the general manager of the new river valley plant said in a statement following the june 6 contract rejection that this action is difficult to understand volvo responded aggressively setting out to intimidate workers and break their solidarity it counted on the uaw s assistance which did in fact do everything it could to disarm the workers in the face of the company s attacks the company cut off health care and other insurance sent out termination letters and began to bring in strikebreakers who were protected by the police marchand issued another statement later that week saying that volvo would not return to the bargaining table until the process for the new round of negotiations is clear to all that is until it received assurances from the uaw that it could succeed in securing ratification as we explained in a number of statements throughout the struggle groups and publications such as the democratic socialist of america and jacobin magazine as well as left voice and socialist alternative worked in tandem with the corporate media and the uaw to black out information about the strike on the rare occasions when they commented on it as in the case of labor notes and the valley labor report radio show they said nothing about the vwrfc downplayed the treachery of the uaw and falsified what was taking place the response of these organizations was a social phenomenon reflecting the class interests they represent they are oriented toward and largely composed of privileged sections of the upper middle class including an increasing number of union officials as we explained both the trade union apparatuses and the pseudo left organizations view the class struggle as something to be highly regulated and pacified by them as they grow wealthy in the process thus the beginning of the rebellion of workers against the corporate institutions called unions cannot yet be spoken of for fear it will spread further and blow apart this set up these social interests and political concerns also underlay their zealous promotion of the rwdsu unionization drive at amazon a top down operation backed by the highest reaches of the state one can see the utter hypocrisy of these groups in their hue and cry over amazon s efforts to block the rwdsu through the nefarious and all powerful on site mailbox and their dead silence soon after on the brutal anti democratic strikebreaking of volvo and the uaw a sharp contrast can be drawn between the response the organizations of the petty bourgeois pseudo left and that of our movement our international party significantly intensified its efforts to break through the uaw media blackout and mobilize workers in the us and internationally just in the first week of the strike statements of support were published from us mexican indian british and german autoworkers and other workers a number of interventions were carried out at auto plants in michigan as well as in chicago we drew the connections between what workers were struggling against in dublin virginia and what they were facing in detroit and elsewhere explaining the necessity of workers forming new rank and file organizations to link up and coordinate their fights on june 14 the second open letter by the vwrfc to the uaw s gamble curry and blondino was issued the letter posed the following questions to the uaw executives what are your demands in the negotiations with volvo why are you paying only 275 a week in strike pay what is your strategy for victory after stipulating the workers demands for the resources needed to win the struggle strike pay at workers full income the mobilization of workers at mack and elsewhere the letter concluded we are demanding that a line be drawn in the sand that this strike result in a clear victory for workers if they are informed about our struggle workers throughout the country and indeed around the world will understand that it is in the interests of all workers they will understand that this is a strike not only for us but for the future a successful struggle here at volvo will strengthen every autoworker and in fact the entire working class if you are not prepared to carry out such a fight then get out the rank and file will elect a bargaining and strike committee of its own that is prepared to carry out the struggle that is required the letter was again widely read and circulated throughout the plant and met with an enthusiastic response the uaw for its part responded with silence while working in the background on a plan to get the deal through the party continued to expand its efforts to mobilize workers in the us and internationally through the second and third weeks of the strike on june 17 the perspective column by comrade kishore was published break the isolation of the strike of the volvo trucks workers in dublin virginia on june 20 the first of the ic s interventions among volvo workers internationally took place with comrades in australia distributing material and interviewing workers at the volvo group s wacol facility in the western suburbs of brisbane the capital of the australian state of queensland on june 22 the call for mack workers and autoworkers to form solidarity committees was initiated with the wsws autoworker newsletter statement autoworkers form rank and file solidarity committees to break the isolation of the strike at volvo trucks on june 25 a friday the uaw announced that then president rory gamble would step down setting the stage for the appointment of ray curry as we explained in a profile curry was and is a creature of the uaw apparatus without the slightest connection to the real conditions and struggles of autoworkers on july 1 the same day that curry began his term as union president obviously not a coincidence the uaw announced a new tentative agreement with volvo the third the announcement of the deal was the first public statement by the uaw nationally on the strike since its onset curry said of the new contract uaw members and their families felt strongly about the need for financial stability gains in this contract and were willing to strike not once but twice to achieve those gains this contract reflects significant gains from the prior two tentative agreements as with previous statements curry made no attempt to explain the contradiction between his claims that earlier deals were the best that workers could get and his assertion that the latest contract represented significant gains as before the uaw refused to release the full contract to entire membership and set a vote for july 9 roughly one week later the following monday july 5 marked the beginning of the fifth week of the strike volvo had by this point begun to slow production and idle shifts at its mack trucks plants in hagerstown maryland and macungie pennsylvania which have a closely interdependent manufacturing process with the new river valley plant although the company would claim that the slowdowns were due at least in part to the microchip shortage on july 5 mack trucks allentown assembly workers with whom we had been meeting issued a statement initiating a rank and file committee and declaring solidarity with the volvo workers comrades in canada also distributed leaflets at a montreal nova bus plant a subsidiary of volvo the next day a wsws team visited the volvo cars and volvo trucks plants in ghent belgium eliciting a powerful response by workers and statements of solidarity out of the many important interviews and statements from workers internationally that we published throughout the strike the article and video produced on this intervention had perhaps the most significant impact on the consciousness of workers at the new river valley plant as well as the mack trucks workers a mack worker told us he was moved to tears after watching the video the party s efforts to connect the struggles of workers internationally had an impact not only on workers in the us just two days after the intervention in ghent volvo cars workers there initiated wildcat action over an attempt to impose an extension of their work week from 37 5 to 40 hours agreed to by the union behind their backs work stoppages continued through the following day on july 9 a friday volvo workers again voted down the uaw backed contract this time by 60 percent despite threats from the union about the consequences while the vote represented a stinging repudiation of the uaw it was becoming clear that there were greater divisions among the workers than in earlier votes and that the economic pressure of a paltry 275 a week in strike pay was beginning to have the intended effect of eroding support to sustain the strike at the same time the third contract rejection provoked a serious crisis for both volvo and the uaw nrv general manager franky marchand stated at the time that it was necessary to immediately end the strike because the continued loss of production represents too much of a risk to the future of our business and our facility after emergency meetings between the company and the union following the vote the uaw announced to workers that the company was moving to unilaterally impose the third ta beginning on monday july 12 with the company retroactively declaring it their last best and final offer the uaw declared that it would hold a revote on the third ta on wednesday july 14 providing cover for and aiding the company s naked strikebreaking a worker would later tell the wsws that the proposal for the revote was made by the uaw to the company the wsws and vwrfc issued statements countering and exposing the lies of the uaw in relation to holding a second vote and we campaigned again at plants in detroit and ghent to mobilize workers in support of the strike on the morning of the vote volvo workers issued a video statement calling for a rejection of the third ta the video denounced the anti democratic moves of the uaw and the company and significantly explicitly appealed for support from workers internationally it should also be noted contrary to the pseudo left claims that the unions represent workers interests that the workers in the video were compelled to conceal their identities because of the very real danger of victimization by the uaw itself the revote on the third tentative agreement took place on july 14 workers reported to us that there was broad opposition to the deal with a number of workers who had previously voted yes saying they planned to vote no this time as a protest against the uaw s blatant disregard for the workers democratic will however there were also reports by workers afterwards of the extreme financial pressure many were under after a delay of over three hours the uaw announced a contract ratification by just 17 votes or 0 3 percent workers immediately responded on facebook with accusations of fraud and calls for a recount or revote which the uaw ignored as we explained in our statements following the vote regardless of whether there was ballot manipulation and there was certainly reason to believe that there was many of those who voted yes did not do so out of support for the contract or the union and the entire contract negotiation process overseen by the uaw was fraudulent and illegitimate workers were not defeated by the company they were betrayed by the uaw the aftermath of the strike a statement by the vwrfc issued the weekend following the vote summing up the lessons of the experience for workers explained the uaw represents the companies not the workers and no amount of pressure will change that far from responding to our overwhelming rejection of their deals with volvo by reversing course and working to achieve our demands the uaw instead reacted by doubling down on its information blackout and deepening its conspiracy with the company which culminated in the assistance it provided volvo in getting the third ta implemented through the revote last week while the uaw has shown it is not capable of meeting our needs that does not diminish or remove the necessity of a collective rank and file organization of workers to defend and fight for our interests a real movement of workers must come from the bottom not from the bureaucracy the building of a powerful rank and file movement of the workers by the workers and for the workers is the task facing all workers everywhere on july 18 workers returned to the plant on their first full day back but now in a newly defiant mood workers reported there was hardly any production the first few days later in the week there were reports of workers refusing requests to work during downtime this is important while the contract was imposed for now there is a significant section of workers at volvo and at mack trucks i would add who feel a new self confidence that they ve learned in the course of this struggle and that the next battle will turn out differently to this date the uaw has still not released the full contract to workers fearful of the anger that continues to smolder expressing the mood of many one worker told us a lot of people are mad and not a lot of work is being done but all over the country and the world workers are starting to wake up in the week following we worked with workers at the mack trucks macungie plant to concretize and formally launch their rank and file committee issuing a statement this statement has already elicited a strong response from mack workers there can be no doubt that the political representatives of the ruling class are well aware of and seriously concerned about the growing influence of trotskyism among industrial workers president biden visited a mostly empty mack trucks plant in pennsylvania last week seeking to counter the growth of internationalism via the promotion of his buy american nationalist economic program at the same time he reiterated the need for labor management partnership that is a corporatist alliance of the unions the companies and the state which biden and the democrats as well as the dsa and the pseudo left view as critically necessary to suppress contain and regulate the class struggle what are the critical lessons of the strike that must be drawn by our movement 1 our analysis and perspective have been confirmed in the objective development of the class struggle itself which has enormous significance long before this year our party determined that workers would inevitably come into conflict with what are now falsely called unions and that new organizations committees based on the rank and file and independent of the corporatist bureaucracies would be required to unify workers and provide them a means to fight further we have explained that there had been an enormous growth of the working class internationally and that the class struggle would increasingly take on and would have to take on a global character as we stated as early as 1988 in the icfi perspectives resolution it has long been an elementary proposition of marxism that the class struggle is national only as to form but that it is in essence an international struggle however given the new features of capitalist development even the form of the class struggle must assume an international character workers are increasingly striving towards and recognizing the need for international unity but it is through the party that workers have begun to become really conscious of themselves as an international class we saw this at earlier stages in the class struggle in the last two years with matamoros strikers appealing across the border for us workers to join them the courageous response of silao autoworkers to the gm strike and the cross atlantic transit worker meetings in each case there was a crucial interaction between the program and activity of the party and the objective development of the class struggle our conception that this is the fifth stage in the history of the trotskyist movement in which the icfi becomes an increasingly active and direct participant in the world crisis of capitalism and is being built as the conscious political leadership of the international working class has found a powerful substantiation in the course of the class struggle itself and in relation to this week s extremely important lectures reviewing the long struggle of the trotskyist movement to unify the working class and counter the reactionary racialist politics of the bourgeoisie and upper middle class the struggle at volvo this year again demonstrated that the basic division in society is class not race and that the dominant aspect of american society is the class struggle not racism white workers many of whom voted for trump fought side by side with their black brothers and sisters in the course of the volvo strike while undoubtedly there is political confusion and backwardness that we must combat the volvo strike shows that it is the working class of all races and genders and nationalities that is the progressive and revolutionary class in society the force we are oriented toward and will build our party in 2 the volvo strike marks a new phase in the class struggle and the period that began with the defeat of the patco strike in the early 1980s has come to an end there is a growing wave of overwhelming rejections of union backed concessions deals these votes reflect not only a new determination by workers to halt and reverse the decades long union backed corporate attacks against them they express as well a shift in the relationship between classes workers are searching for a way to go on the offensive the contract rejections have been driven not only or primarily by the immediate issues involved but more fundamentally by the growing anger and opposition in the working class over the obscene inequality that has reached new extremes during the pandemic and the subordination of every aspect of their lives to the profit interests of the ruling class 3 the role initiative theory and practice of the revolutionary party the most conscious factor in the situation was indispensable in realizing the potential in the situation at volvo the 2020 congress resolution is particularly relevant here 86 the party must patiently explain to workers and youth the nature of the crisis and the strategy of the struggle for socialism but the need for patient explaining must not become a justification for passive contemplation opportunities to translate political understanding into practical actions must not be missed the aim of the party is to lead workers in struggle without the party there would have been opposition to the attacks of the company and the uaw but it would not have developed the highly conscious organized and sustained character that it did as comrade kishore wrote in his perspective on july 11 class war at volvo and the fight for rank and file committees many of those involved in the rank and file committee do not yet consider themselves socialists they want to win their strike which can and must be won they are part of an increasingly militant working class that is no longer willing to accept the constant attack on their jobs and living conditions the responsibility of socialists is not to stand aside but to assist workers in the development of their independent organization and initiative while seeking to develop a deeper understanding of the social and political implications of the struggles in which they are engaged the events at volvo this year are a foreshadowing of even more explosive battles to come which will more and more become the norm everywhere our party must carry the lessons of the volvo strike into the forthcoming struggles work to systematically recruit workers into the party and expand the network of rank and file committees as part of the fight to construct a revolutionary leadership in the working class

or expand to other markers it could weigh on future air cargo growth the level of inventories remains relatively low compared to sales volumes historically this has meant that businesses had to quickly refill their stocks for which they also used air cargo services air cargo traffic is back to pre crisis levels and that is some much needed good news for the global economy but while there is a strong demand to ship goods our ability is capped by the shortage of belly capacity normally provided by passenger aircraft that should be a sign to governments that they need to share their plans

dear dan i m a gay man after a decade together and five years of marriage my husband informed me he wasn t really interested in sex anymore that was a year ago and we haven t had sex since he told me i should leave him if regular sex was really that important to me but if i chose to stay i had to remain faithful to him that means me not having sex with anyone else i m 35 he s 38 and he doesn t see his unilateral decision to end our sex life as him breaking faith with me there s also the issue of financial dependance i am not dependent on him he is dependent on me i didn t want to abandon him during a pandemic while he s unemployed so i stayed now he tells me he s asexual and accuses me of being unsupportive of his sexual identity if i so much as mention missing sex to make a long story short three months ago i met a guy at work we re the only people on our floor currently coming into the office and we got to talking and it turned out he s bisexual and married but open i ve been blowing him a couple of times a week for the last two months he s close to my age and i really need this we aren t in the same department so i don t report to him and he doesn t report to me he doesn t reciprocate but i don t care i wasn t on grindr and didn t go looking for this do i need to feel bad about it cheating homo on knees eating dick dear choked so your husband insists you honor the commitment you made to him not to have other sex partners but he s released himself from the commitment he made to you to be your sex partner and invited you to divorce him if you didn t like it and you didn t divorce him you stayed not because you wanna stay in this marriage and not because you re obligated to stay in this marriage to affirm his sexual identity but because he s unemployed and you don t wanna turn him out on the street during a pandemic ok you don t need to feel bad about this you don t need to feel bad about the dick you re eating at work and if you ve been reading my column for longer than a week choked you knew i was gonna say that so you wanted a permission slip and you ve got it signed and notarized and now if you stop giving those hot non recip blowjobs to the bisexual guy at the office i m gonna be pissed at you for wasting my time so don t let me down here choked keep eating that dick of course eating that dick isn t a long term solution to your problem but that dick will make your life more bearable in the near term it sounds like it has already but ultimately you re gonna have to counter your husband s ridiculous ultimatum with a perfectly reasonable ultimatum of your own he doesn t have to be sexual with you he never has to eat your dick ever again but he can t expect you to live a sexless life tell him you re gonna seek dick elsewhere choked and if he doesn t like it then he can leave dear dan just wanted to commend you for your advice to having a realistic discussion on needs in last week s column i say this as someone who recently went through a similar though blessedly temporary situation with my girlfriend the first time i lost my erection before i came i was a little bummed but my attitude was basically dang well at least i made her come my girlfriend however had a mild to moderate freak out was everything ok was she doing something wrong was i not attracted to her anymore like hardon s partner i also got in my own head and the same thing kept happening it got to the point where i was avoiding sex because i didn t want to deal with the crisis counseling session that would inevitably ensue if i couldn t come again after a few weeks of this i was finally able to get through to her that talking and obsessing about it was only making it worse she backed off i got to a point where i could relax again and it wasn t long before our happy healthy way hotter than you d expect from a couple of divorced 40 year olds sex life picked up where it left off as you implied to hardon sometimes you just need to stfu and hope for the best guys being who we are nothing sets our deep seated insecurities ablaze like being pestered about our dick problems no matter how well meaning and sincere the pesterer is we re kind of like toddlers who suffer a minor boo boo if we see you frantically running toward us waving your hands and asking what s wrong we re going to flip out but if you don t make a big deal out of it we won t either just wanted to share my straight dude perspective and thank you for your level headed response please end needless interrogations speedily dear penis thanks for sharing and while i sometimes feel like i should say everybody doesn t always need to come during sex i worry about some straight guys reading that and then giving even less of a shit about getting their female partners off than they already do i don t want to accidentally widen the orgasm gap while more than 95 of straight men self report that they always come during sex according to the archives of sexual behavior only 65 of straight women said the same we should all want our partners to get off and should make a good faith effort to get them off but we shouldn t make a huge deal out of it if our partner every once in a while for whatever reason doesn t get off and i think you missed something i know i know who am i to tell you anything i m a mature woman who had a younger male lover for a while same scenario in that he was super fit had stamina was eager etc all was good except that he had to finish himself off with a hard and furious handjob every time i suggested that he go on a masturbation diet stop jerking off every day and when he did masturbate use props e g wrap a cloth around his hand grind against pillows fleshlight whatever he could think of because i had the idea that the intense and hard hold he used when masturbating was the culprit and i was vindicated it took a few patient tries but he got there dear sit thank you for sharing and i would ve addressed the issue you raised the issue you successfully addressed with your hot young man if hardon had mentioned something similar i e her boyfriend using what i ve long called the death grip to finish himself off dive into the savage love archives sit and you ll find tons of advice for guys who used the death grip during masturbation and then couldn t get off during partnered sex because the inside of a vagina a mouth or a butt doesn t feel like the inside of a bony clenched fist my advice for guys who suffer from death grip syndrome is the same as yours stop jacking off like that use a lighter touch get some lube and maybe a fleshlight and retrain the dick it doesn t work in all cases some guys can t come back for other guys that s just what their dick needs but i ve heard from plenty of men over the years who successfully retrained their dicks to my readers i had to file this column early due to the labor day holiday but i want you to know that i m furious about what happened in texas last week a law banning abortion went into effect and what didn t happen in the supreme court the trump packed court didn t block that law from going into effect essentially nullifying roe v wade texas s new anti abortion law empowers individual citizens to sue anyone they suspect of having helped a woman get an abortion doctors clinic staffers parents anyone lend a friend some money to pay for an abortion you could be sued drive a friend to a clinic you could be sued if a lawsuit brought against you is successful you could be ordered to pay the person who sued you 10 000 and reimburse their legal expenses if you prevail in court you get nothing no damages none of your legal expenses reimbursed women still have a constitutional right to an abortion in the united states but abortion is effectively illegal now in texas and will be soon in other states as gop legislators and governors drive a truck through the hole the supreme court just ripped open in roe v wade my advice to women and men in texas stock up on morning after pills available over the counter for now and vote every last gop motherfucker out of office

neuchatel switzerland business wire masimo nasdaq masi announced today the ce marking and commercial launch in europe of the single patient use adhesive rainbow supersensor compatible for use with both masimo and third party monitors with masimo rainbow technology inside in an industry first the comprehensive convenient and multi purpose supersensor uses 12 leds to simultaneously offer 12 blood constituent parameters noninvasively and continuously set oxygen saturation spo 2 total hemoglobin sphb carboxyhemoglobin spco methemoglobin spmet oxygen reserve index ori pvi rpvi pulse rate pr respiration rate rrp perfusion index pi fractional oxygen saturation spfo 2 and oxygen content spoc all on the same single patient use adhesive sensor by allowing clinicians to noninvasively and continuously monitor so many different physiologic indicators simultaneously the supersensor offers the ability to assess the patient s status continuously at the core of the supersensor is masimo set pulse oximetry which has been clinically proven to help care teams enhance patient safety and improve patient outcomes in fact more than 100 independent and objective studies have shown that masimo set outperforms other pulse oximetry technologies in clinical settings and motion and low perfusion conditions providing clinicians with increased sensitivity and specificity to make critical care decisions 1 set has also been shown to help clinicians reduce severe retinopathy of prematurity in neonates 2 improve cchd screening in newborns 3 and when used for continuous monitoring with masimo patient safetynet in post surgical wards reduce deaths due to opioid overdose while also reducing rapid response team activations icu transfers and the cost of care 4 7 continuous hemoglobin monitoring with sphb as part of patient blood management programs has been found to help clinicians improve outcomes in both high and low blood loss surgeries such as reducing the percentage of patients receiving transfusions 8 reducing the units of red blood cells transfused per patient 9 10 reducing the time to transfusion 11 and reducing costs 12 the utility of pvi a measure of the dynamic changes in perfusion index that occur during the respiratory cycle as an indicator of fluid responsiveness has been demonstrated in more than 100 independent studies 13 use of sphb and pvi together as part of an integrated goal directed therapy protocol for fluid management and blood administration has even been shown to help clinicians reduce mortality 30 and 90 days after surgery by 33 and 29 respectively 14 ori is a noninvasive and continuous trending index that extends oxygen monitoring of patients receiving supplemental oxygen by monitoring oxygenation beyond the upper limits of conventional pulse oximetry ori offers the potential for advanced warning of hypoxemia during preoxygenation and intubation procedures and of hyperoxia in patients receiving greater concentrations of supplemental oxygen than clinically required for example in a study of pediatric patients undergoing general anaesthesia with orotracheal intubation researchers found that ori detected impending desaturation in a median of 31 5 seconds before noticeable changes in spo 2 occurred 15 a study evaluating the ability of ori to predict mild hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation found that the time between decrease in ori and subsequent decrease in spo 2 may allow preventive action and that a higher ori value during preoxygenation was independently protective against hypoxemia 16 in another study researchers found that monitoring adult icu patients with ori significantly reduced the time these critically ill patients spent with moderate hyperoxia compared to monitoring with oxygen saturation spo 2 alone 17 spmet helps clinicians noninvasively and continuously monitor methemoglobin levels in the blood 18 elevated methemoglobin levels can be caused by many drugs given in hospitals including inhaled nitric oxide ino therapy 19 20 which has been used as a potential treatment for lung complications associated with covid 19 spmet may be an important monitoring tool during ino therapy dr max jonas consultant in intensive care medicine and anesthesia at university hospitals southampton uk commented critically ill patients are frequently hemodynamically unstable with variable oxygen delivery which may be inadequate and lead to a cumulative oxygen debt especially with noradrenaline infusions clinically this makes continuous monitoring and optimization of oxygen delivery using hemoglobin fluid responsiveness and oxygen saturation extremely important it is also clinically invaluable being able to recognize impaired oxygen carriage and hence content in the blood for instance the methemoglobinemia generated by inhaled nitric oxide therapy which we are currently frequently using during the treatment of covid 19 pneumonitis and also for pulmonary hypertension spco enables quick and noninvasive monitoring of carbon monoxide levels in the blood and may lead to the identification of elevated co levels that might otherwise go unnoticed in front line settings such as fire rescue and mass casualty scenarios 21 22 studies of emergency room patients have shown that spco may be a valuable tool for monitoring a large number of patients for possible co exposure 23 24 for example in a study of emergency room patients of 32 patients diagnosed with co poisoning 22 would not have been identified without spco monitoring 25 by making spmet spco and spfo 2 available on the same sensor the supersensor provides a more complete picture of oxygenation in the presence of potential dyshemoglobin interference fractional oxygen saturation fo 2 hb provides a measure of the fraction of total hemoglobin that is currently oxygenated as opposed to spo 2 functional oxygen saturation which measures the fraction of hemoglobin that is oxygenated based on an estimation of the effective hemoglobin available hemoglobin capable of being oxygenated in healthy individuals fo 2 hb is often similar to spo 2 but when dyshemoglobin levels are elevated fo 2 hb may be more representative of the total oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin than spo 2 in the presence of dyshemoglobins spo 2 may appear normal but spfo 2 a noninvasive continuous measurement of fo 2 hb may provide more insight into a possible oxygenation impairment combined with the ability to monitor spco and spmet on the same sensor clinicians now have additional information to help determine if a dyshemoglobin species is responsible and intervene appropriately dr anne booth consultant in neuroanaethesia and phem at cambridge university hospitals and joint clinical lead adult critical care transfers east of england stated when assessing patients oxygenation we need to be prepared for the unknown especially in emergency and critical care if there are patients that have elevated carboxyhemoglobin from prior history of smoking or from carbon monoxide exposure their oxygen content would be impaired similarly with inhaled nitric oxide therapy which is commonly used for covid 19 patients may be subject to high methemoglobin levels parameters provided on the masimo supersensor like oxygen content spoc and fractional oxygen saturation spfo 2 can help us identify the source of diminished oxygen delivery so we can react accordingly dr aryeh shander anesthesiologist and an expert in patient blood management commented a key focus in our care for critically ill patients during surgery and beyond is to minimize oxygen consumption and maximize oxygen utilization the information now available noninvasively via a pulse oximetry like sensor on total hemoglobin concentration fluid responsiveness dyshemoglobin presence fractional oxygen saturation oxygen content and more can give us much needed and critical information to help in providing the best clinical judgements the ultimate goal is to improve the patient s outcome and not just treat a number dr kiyoyuki miyasaka anesthesiologist at the national center for child health and development tokyo japan noted pulse oximetry has progressed greatly since its invention in japan in the 1970s with the latest sensors from masimo clinicians now have greater visibility of the patient s overall oxygen delivery helping us better understand the underlying physiology impacting their condition i look forward to seeing how masimo pulse oximetry can further improve patient care joe kiani founder and ceo of masimo said the supersensor represents a key milestone in masimo s continued innovation journey giving clinicians access to 12 breakthrough noninvasive measurements in a single convenient and comprehensive sensor as part of our rd rainbow set sensor family while easing concerns about cross contamination because of being a single patient use adhesive product i am proud of our team for delivering this innovation to the medical community sphb and spmet monitoring are not intended to replace laboratory blood testing blood samples should be analyzed by laboratory instruments prior to clinical decision making clinical decisions regarding red blood cell transfusions should be based on the clinician s judgment considering among other factors patient condition continuous sphb monitoring and laboratory diagnostic tests using blood samples spco monitoring is not intended to be used as the sole basis for making diagnosis or treatment decisions related to suspected carbon monoxide poisoning it is intended to be used in conjunction with additional methods of assessing clinical signs and symptoms the accuracy of pvi in predicting fluid responsiveness is variable and influenced by numerous patient procedure and device related factors pvi measures the variation in the plethysmography amplitude but does not provide measurements of stroke volume or cardiac output fluid management decisions should be based on a complete assessment of the patient s condition and should not be based solely on pvi in the u s pvi is cleared as a noninvasive dynamic indicator of

by adamb sun 12 sep 2021 08 30 54 adonis wrote thank you adam for your kind words and yes i have been reading about peak oil and in general many different conspiracy theories since 1999 adonis wrote after all this reading i probably came to the conclusion around 2016 that something big was planned for 2020 by the powers that be and it may be a good thing so really we should just accept whats coming as socialism may be our only hope to ensure the continuity of the human race on planet earth we owe it to the next generation that we are all on board with the great reset you are welcome and yes it is obvious any reason you limit your reading to this time frame and don t choose to understand the long history of claims without basis claims with basis that never come to fruition and why those who came before didn t get it any more corrct then most recently peak oilers mayan calendar loonies harold camping believers gold bugs anti fiat currency and fractional reserve banking amateurs etc etc any particular reason that you believe the powers that be have power to guide random human events pinballing through time as just one example at this very website people made all sorts of claims about how the plunge protection team were the only thing keeping the us stock market afloat and then 2008 arrived and it became obvious to all that there was no plunge protection team worthy of the name worse yet once that was revealed the market then began reacting to central government actors in the recovery again something that wasn t supposed to happen because 2008 was proclaimed as the end both in terms of the economy and peak oil fiscal stimulus of the type employed at the time had been specifically declared to not be effective against the onslaught of claimed global peak oil in that year yet it was effective for the economy and the us went on to become the world s largest producer of oil and gas dispatching both its prior peaks and boosting the world to all time new highs as well when do you know that the current claims and thoughts are as much a crock as the same ones done little more than a decade ago
