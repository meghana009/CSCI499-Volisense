what does your voice reveal about your health scientists say the way you talk could help diagnose a range of conditions from heart disease to parkinson s too loud too common too posh too mousey some of us may fret about what our voice says about us but soon it may be a life saver giving doctors vital clues as to whether we are at risk of parkinson s heart disease or even alzheimer s in the latest breakthrough doctors have used short recordings of speech to assess if people are at risk of a heart attack caused by clogged arteries cardiologists at the mayo clinic in the u s told the american college of cardiology conference last month how their study of more than 100 patients showed that an artificial intelligence computer programme can accurately predict coronary artery disease a build up of plaque in the heart s arteries by analysing three 30 second clips of patients voices too loud too common too posh too mousey some of us may fret about what our voice says about us but soon it may be a life saver giving doctors vital clues as to whether we are at risk of parkinson s heart disease or even alzheimer s a stock image is used above the computer was fed 10 000 voice samples from patients with coronary artery disease from these it learnt to detect problems from 80 tell tale features of the patients voices such as changes in frequency pitch volume and phrasing that are so subtle they can t be picked up by the human ear the 108 patients in the study all due to undergo a coronary angiogram an x ray that assesses the condition of the heart s arteries were asked to record samples of themselves reading a prepared text those which the computer algorithm scored as high risk for heart disease also had angiograms suggesting they were more than twice as likely to suffer heart problems than those scored as low risk over the next two years nearly 60 per cent of high risk patients were admitted to hospital for chest pain or heart attacks compared with 30 per cent of those with a low risk speech scientists aren t sure why certain voice features may indicate heart disease one theory is that it s to do with the autonomic nervous system the part that controls bodily processes we don t consciously think about including heart rate and speech since the same system controls both these functions it is possible that problems with the heart somehow send subtly audible ripples through our speech those which the computer algorithm scored as high risk for heart disease also had angiograms suggesting they were more than twice as likely to suffer heart problems than those scored as low risk a similar system is being piloted in the netherlands to detect early signs of dementia the project at the alzheimer centre amsterdam is asking older people to record their voices on smartphones and send them in for analysis by a computer algorithm the algorithm picks up subtle changes in pitch clarity and linguistic habits such as using only simple verbs and making slight mispronunciations which can be some of the very early indicators of dementia meanwhile researchers in italy are using voice algorithms to detect parkinson s disease already known to cause hypokinetic dysarthria where speech is soft monotone and lacks articulation in february scientists in rome reported in the journal frontiers in neurology how their study of more than 200 older people showed the computer algorithm could detect the disease even in people yet to show symptoms john rubin a consultant ear nose and throat surgeon and head of the voice disorders unit at university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust says voice research has great potential people have been interested in using the voice to make diagnoses for a long time he says since the 1970s research has identified that people can reasonably well identify how old someone is from hearing them speak it s where this type of research started a 2016 study at nottingham trent university found that most people can decode clues about others health height and age all from listening to their voices researchers said voice analysis may be an evolutionary trait to help us choose a suitable mate the voice may even give clues to a woman s fertility according to a 2019 study at james madison university in virginia published in evolutionary psychology it recorded women counting from one to ten once a week for four weeks and played them to male volunteers the voice of a woman at peak fertility was perceived to be so sexy that the sound of her merely counting out numbers caused male listeners testosterone levels to rise dr melanie shoup knox a psychologist who led the study says there may be a physical explanation for subtle fertility related changes in female speech the larynx is particularly sensitive to sex hormones she says these may promote or obstruct vocal clarity depending on the level of hormones speaking clearly may also make a woman more attractive according to scientists from the university of california irvine and the university of utah who found that men rated women s voices as 73 per cent more attractive if they enunciated with a high degree of intelligibility but this only works with women says dr daniel stehr a psychologist who co authored the study men he says can get away with mumbling and poor diction may even make them sound more attractively masculine and while a deep voice in a man might be perceived as sexually attractive research suggests it bears little relation to fertility on the contrary men whose voices were rated as more attractively low tended to have lower concentrations of sperm in their ejaculate evolutionary biologists at the university of western australia warned in the journal plos one in 2011 regardless of whether you re a tenor or bass articulate or mumbly the past two years of pandemic lockdowns and social isolation have wreaked havoc with our voices say researchers from trinity college dublin they surveyed 1 575 people on the number of times they had suffered from a hoarse voice or vocal tract discomfort since the first coronavirus lockdown writing in the journal of voice at the end of 2020 they blamed a huge increase in the use of video calls on the fact that 85 per cent of respondents had complained of sore throats and hoarseness since the pandemic had begun as mr rubin explains since the start of the pandemic many of us have come to rely on zoom or suchlike to communicate we are talking to each other from rooms with differing acoustics this makes things sound different so we may strain our voices to talk louder we re also often sitting slumped and leaning towards the computer which is not good posture and can have an impact on the health of our voices if we want to look after our voices the answer is to stay physically fit by doing something such as taking a brisk walk three or four times a week advertisement what we eat and drink is important too acid reflux can cause damage to your vocal cords so if this is a problem it is best not to eat spicy fatty foods and we need to keep ourselves hydrated with two to three litres of liquid a day consumed steadily over that time
when tesla boss elon musk expressed a desire to buy twitter last week citing an absolutist vision of free speech as at least one reason behind his motivations one had to wonder if his running afoul of the securities and exchange commission over one of his tweets played a part to be sure even if twitter had no regulations moderating speech on the platform musk or anyone in a similar position could violate sec regulations via tweet a platform s rules don t protect someone from the feds regs still musk has shown a thin skin for criticism and it often appears that he desires to be able to say what he wants on twitter without consequences consequences like having a federal judge rule that musk knew certain infamous tweets about taking the company private having secured funding at 420 a share were misleading tesla investors sued after the tweets hurt the company s stock and lost them money it s a class action suit and musk and tesla could be on the hook for billions in damages lawyers for the shareholders are seeking a restraining order against musk to prevent him from speaking publicly about the tweets before the trial the shareholders have expressed concern that tweets from musk could taint the jury pool has used his fame and notoriety to sway public opinion in his favor waging battle in the press having been defeated in the courtroom their lawyers wrote in the filing obviously this doesn t mean tesla and musk have lost the lawsuit it only means that u s district court judge edward chen believes musk knew his tweet was false and misleading and held that he recklessly made the statements with knowledge as to their falsity as for musk s defense first his lawyer alex spiro claims musk really was thinking about taking tesla private in 2018 and had the financing to do so second free speech all that s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech he said here are the case specs if you re curious in re tesla inc securities litigation u s district court northern district of california no 18 04865 as for this author i cannot pretend to know if musk knowingly lied for whatever reason including a poorly received attempt at humor or if he really was sincere about going private i do think however that free speech doesn t necessarily apply when your words can move markets and possibly violate sec regulations actions consequences et cetera

in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q1 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more could you give our readers a bit of background on wcm drew absolutely rupert wcm is a 76 person investment management firm based in laguna beach ca we manage 107 billion in assets as of 31 december 2021 predominantly focusing on institutional client relationships our primary goal is to generate long term sustainable excess returns for clients through a culture of innovation close alignment of employee incentives with client objectives and a flat power structure that fosters meritocracy and critical debate to this end we strive to mitigate risk for our clients focusing our attention on downside protection low volatility and low turnover the firm was founded in 1976 but we didn t adopt our institutional focus until the current management team bought out the original founder in the late nineties the single most important lesson we learned during our transformation from a 200 million ria to 100 billion institutional asset management firm is how critical a role corporate culture plays in the success of an organization we have been incredibly intentional about building a culture focused on our core values of having fun showing gratitude and serving others we believe it s people that ultimately drive results so we want to foster a culture that empowers our people and encourages them to think different and get better we have also been committed to passing down equity to the next generation of investors and leaders at the firm today over 50 of our employees have an equity stake in the firm and we have 11 principal owners with an equity stake of 1 or more our global growth equity team is responsible for the majority of our assets under management managing strategies across international global and emerging markets my co pm andrew wiechert and i are responsible for wcm s global value equity enterprise along with sachin kashyap a business analyst dedicated to our team why do you believe your approach differs from that of other value focused funds andrew you know rupert i m confident that there isn t another value manager approaching markets the same way we are here at wcm back when we launched focused international value in 2011 we approached the market with the belief that international indices are structurally inefficient and that we could exploit these inefficiencies from several angles first we believe our portfolio possesses a significant structural advantage if you look at the benchmarks outside the us and this is especially true in emerging markets they re filled with basic commodities poorly run banks and utilities it s our firm s view that as emerging economy consumers gain higher disposable incomes they will do what developed economy consumers have done for decades expand their use of technology seek out higher quality branded consumer goods and demand more comprehensive healthcare fortuitously our bottom up process for identifying great investments naturally leads us to emphasize discounted high quality businesses in these same sectors e g consumer technology health care and niche industrials in other words our process drives toward the sectors and industries benefitting from where the world is headed this means our portfolio not only looks materially different than the benchmark but that it also stands to meaningfully benefit from the global emerging middle class this positions our portfolio in front of a multi decade tailwind where the sources of real value creation will come from the sectors we emphasize this is in stark contrast to many traditional value funds who tend to bargain hunt in more cyclical sectors or industries that tend to be facing long term headwinds to be clear we don t believe value investing needs to be or should be a sector bet on these typically lower quality subsections of the market second and more importantly we believe our process has a significant stock selection advantage this derives from our framework for identifying successful businesses that we can purchase at discounted entry points while we know valuation is critical to identifying investments with the best risk reward profiles we are also convinced that quality wins over time and while our frontend valuation discipline certainly produces an attractive opportunity set we believe our focus on identifying businesses with strengthening competitive advantages economic moats and superior corporate cultures is what truly propels the probability of outperforming over the long term moreover we believe pairing our valuation discipline with our long term time horizon and our emphasis on quality ends up highlighting unique businesses that are easily overlooked by other investors we believe there is a false dichotomy between value and growth investing that has been growing over the past several decades as both camps become more entrenched in their way of investing we believe our process allows us to exploit the growing opportunity set in between third and perhaps most importantly we believe we have a temperament advantage this derives from our efforts to build a culture at wcm that fosters humility absence of fear audacious different thinking and continuous learning as we ve done that we ve come to believe that a culture which attracts and keeps the best people is not only important to the success of our firm but that it is important to the success of any organization and in particular to the businesses we want to own ultimately it is great people that keep a business squarely in front of the important tailwinds and it is great people that nurture the competitive advantage to grow year after year we think that building these concepts into our own culture and into our process is why our small team has exhibited the judgment and temperament necessary for long term success you say you start the idea generation process with a series of quantitative screens could you offer our readers some idea of the sort of metrics you re screening for in this initial step andrew there might be some doubts about this after the last 10 years or so but we believe valuation is absolutely critical to the risk reward profile of any investment and we believe that price is going to be a much more important factor for returns in the next 10 years than it has been in the past decade or so this belief is why we ve always put valuation at the front end of our process as it ensures that we re fishing in the right pond e g the top three deciles of the most undervalued stocks in the non us universe that said we don t think there is anything magical about our screening process by design they are incredibly simple and focus only on the factors we think best represent value across all sectors and industries our initial criterion consists of simply eliminating companies with a market cap less than 2 billion this initial step alone reduces the entire non u s universe to about 2 000 names our secondary set of criteria consists of a simple six factor screen that ranks the remaining international universe based on valuation p e p b p cf dividend yield financial strength price net assets and relative strength eps estimate revisions this screen limits our universe to 600 names for consideration our next step we would argue adds the most value to the narrowing process and to our subsequent returns this step includes seeking businesses with favorable and long term economic tailwinds high or rising return on invested capital roic this suggests the presence of an economic moat low or no debt we don t have a precise standard on this but generally speaking we use a net debt ebitda threshold of about 2 5x high or rising operating margins history of consistent and sustainable earnings revenues and free cash flows and relative price strength this set of hurdles narrows the universe to a very manageable list of 200 names from this narrowed universe we are actively following 100 names for consideration from this list we construct a portfolio of 40 50 high quality businesses that we believe are attractively valued are supported by longterm tailwinds are growing their competitive advantages and are aligned with superior corporate cultures lastly the final portfolio is diversified not just across sector industry country currency and revenue but also across our own distinct sub categorizations our traditional transitional and opportunistic value profiles while growing economic moats and superior corporate cultures are barriers to entry for all three of these profiles the criteria we seek beyond these factors will depend on the value profile we assign to the company for traditional value we primarily seek strong operators with more predictable earnings and free cash flows for transitional value we are primarily looking for signs of inflection points in the business e g a narrative shift product mix shift or cultural turnaround ultimately we believe these names have the potential to transition from value names to

the us centers for disease control and prevention unveiled its new system for travel risk assessments on monday many european nations are now considered at high risk for covid 19 along with other marquee destinations around the world the new system places destinations into the following categories level 3 high risk for covid 19 level 2 moderate risk for covid 19 level 1 low risk for covid 19 unknown not enough data to assess risk the big change comes at level 4 which was regularly used for places considered very high risk for travelers level 4 will no longer be routinely used for that purpose instead a level 4 notice is reserved in the new system for only special circumstances those circumstances include extremely high case counts emergence of a new variant of concern or healthcare infrastructure collapse the cdc said other factors that may be considered include information such as vaccination rate and hospitalization rate the cdc did not assign any destinations to level 4 on its travel recommendations website page on monday levels 3 2 and 1 will still be primarily determined by the previous formula of 28 day incidence or case counts the overhaul comes against a backdrop of us government agencies and the public continuing to react and adapt to an ever changing pandemic and sometimes in sharp disagreement on monday a federal judge in florida struck down the biden administration s mask mandate for airplanes and other public transport methods and a biden administration official says the order is no longer in effect while the ruling is reviewed cdc s level 3 in the new system the level 3 high risk category applies to destinations that have had more than 100 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days among the countries in level 3 is france which was the most visited country in the world in 2019 before the pandemic according to the un s world tourism organization but other stalwarts of the european travel scene are in the high risk category too on april 18 they included germany greece ireland italy portugal spain united kingdom it s not just european favorites that find themselves on this rebooted list other popular travel spots around the world also at level 3 include brazil canada egypt malaysia mexico south korea thailand in all there were just over 120 destinations at level 3 late monday afternoon the cdc reports on roughly 235 places total the cdc advises that you be up to date with your covid 19 vaccines before traveling to a level 3 destination up to date includes not only the full initial vaccinations but any boosters for which you re eligible the cdc does not include the united states in its list of advisories level 2 destinations carrying the level 2 covid 19 moderate designation report 50 to 100 covid 19 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days it had only 11 entries on monday scattered in spots around the globe the most notable names were bolivia peru south africa sri lanka turks and caicos islands you can view the cdc s risk levels for any global destination on its travel recommendations page in its broader travel guidance the cdc has recommended avoiding all international travel until you are fully vaccinated if you re concerned about a health situation not related to covid 19 check here level 1 this level is dominated by destinations in africa and had almost 55 entries in the first week under the new system to be in level 1 covid 19 low a destination must have 49 or fewer new cases per 100 000 residents over the past 28 days some of the noteworthy places include colombia dominican republic india jamaica kenya philippines senegal unknown finally there are destinations for which the cdc has an unknown risk because of a lack of information usually but not always these are small remote places or places with ongoing warfare or unrest the azores cambodia and nicaragua are among the locations currently listed in the unknown category the cdc advises against travel to these places precisely because the risks are unknown a medical expert weighs in on risk levels transmission rates are one guidepost for travelers personal risk calculations according to cnn medical analyst dr leana wen we ve moved into a phase in the pandemic where people need to make their own decisions based on their medical circumstances as well as their risk tolerance when it comes to contracting covid 19 said wen who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the george washington university milken institute school of public health some people will decide the risk is too high for them in the higher categories wen said other people will say because i am vaccinated and boosted i am willing to take on that risk so this really needs to be a personal decision that people weigh understanding that right now the cdc is classifying the different levels based on community transmission rates and basically only that wen said they re not taking into account individual circumstances more considerations for travel there are other factors to weigh in addition to transmission rates according to wen the transmission rates are one guidepost wen said another is what precautions are required and followed in the place that you re going and then the third is what are you planning to do once you re there are you planning to visit a lot of attractions and go to indoor bars that s very different from you re going somewhere where you re planning to lie on the beach all day and not interact with anyone else that s very different those are very different levels of risk vaccination is the most significant safety factor for travel since unvaccinated travelers are more likely to become ill and transmit covid 19 to others wen said and it s also important to consider what you would do if you end up testing positive away from home where will you stay and how easy will it be to get a test to return home the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story atlanta confused about inflation you re not alone inflation is paradoxically both incredibly simple to understand and absurdly complicated let s start with the simplest version inflation happens when prices broadly go up that broadly is important at any given time the price of goods will fluctuate based on shifting tastes someone makes a viral tiktok about brussels sprouts and suddenly everyone s gotta have them boom sprouts prices go up meanwhile sellers of cauliflower last season s trendy veg are practically giving their goods away such fluctuations are constant inflation however occurs when the average price of virtually everything consumers buy goes up food houses cars clothes toys etc to afford those necessities wages have to rise too it s not always a bad thing in the united states for the past 40 years or so and particularly this century we ve been living in an ideal low and slow level of inflation that comes with a well oiled consumer driven economy with prices going up around 2 a year if that sure prices on some things like housing and health care are much higher than they used to be but other things like computers and tvs have become much cheaper so the average of all the things combined has been relatively stable still with me all right let s cut to today and why inflation is all over the news when inflation is a bad word inflation becomes problematic when that low and slow simmer gets fired up to a boil that s when you hear economists talk about the economy overheating for a variety of reasons largely stemming from the pandemic the global economy finds itself at a rigorous boil right now economists use two main gauges to track inflation in the united states and both are at their highest level in four decades the consumer price index for march rose 8 5 a level not seen since december 1981 when the cpi stood at 8 9 the personal consumption expenditures price index which the federal reserve prefers rose 6 4 in february from the same period a year earlier its fastest increase since january 1982 and here s where econ 101 merges a bit with psych 101 there s a behavioral economics aspect to inflation where it can become a self fulfilling prophecy when prices go up for a long enough period of time consumers start to anticipate price increases you ll buy more goods today if you think they ll cost appreciably more tomorrow that has the effect of increasing demand which causes prices to rise even more and so on and so on that s where it can get especially tricky for the fed whose main job is to control money supply and keep inflation in check how d we get here blame the pandemic and russia s assault on ukraine in the spring of 2020 as covid 19 spread it was like yanking the plug on the global economy factories around the world shut down people stopped eating at restaurants airlines grounded flights millions of people were laid off as business disappeared practically overnight the unemployment rate in america shot up to nearly 15 from about 3 5 in february 2020 it was the sharpest economic contraction on record at the same time the fed implemented emergency stimulus measures to keep financial markets from tanking the central bank slashed interest rates to near zero and began pumping tens of billions of dollars every month into the markets by buying up corporate debt in doing so the bank likely prevented a full on financial meltdown but keeping those easy money policies in place over the past 20 months has also fueled you guessed it inflation by early summer 2020 demand for consumer goods started to pick back up rapidly congress and president joe biden passed a historic 1 9 trillion stimulus bill in march that made americans suddenly flush with cash and unemployment assistance people started shopping again demand went from zero to 100 but supply couldn t bounce back so easily turns out that when you pull out the plug on the global economy you can t just plug it back in and expect it to start humming at the same pace as before take cars for example automakers saw the covid crisis beginning and did what any smart business would do shut down temporarily to mitigate losses but not long after the pandemic shut factories down it also drove up demand for cars as people worried about exposure on public transit and avoided flying automakers and car buyers had whiplash cars require an immense number of parts from an immense number of different factories all around the world to be built by highly skilled laborers in other parts of the world getting all of those discreet operations back online takes time and doing so while keeping workers from getting sick takes even more time economists often describe inflation as too much money chasing too few goods that s exactly what happened with cars and houses and peloton bikes and any number of other items that became hot ticket items how s the supply chain involved in all this supply chain bottlenecks that s another one you see all over right let s go back to the car example we know that high demand limited supply prices go up but high demand limited supply production delays prices go up even more all modern cars rely on a variety of computer chips to function but those chips are also used in cellphones appliances tvs laptops and dozens of other items that as bad luck would have it were all in high demand at the same time that s just one example of the disconnect in the global supply chain because new cars have been slow to roll in used car demand shot through the roof which drove overall inflation higher in some cases car owners were able to sell their used cars for more than what they paid for them a year or two prior what happens next prices and wages are likely to keep going up but for how long and how much depends on countless variables across the globe russia s invasion of ukraine dashed hopes that prices would come down significantly in 2022 the conflict has upended commodity and oil markets driving up prices of food and gasoline around the world that s compounding supply chain headaches leading to further shortages of critical food items and oil lockdowns in china meanwhile have left the world s largest seaport essentially at a standstill corporations bear some blame as well as many big companies have been raising prices to protect their profit margins and there s no telling what kind of new shocks a resurgent covid variant a massive shipping container getting stuck in a waterway a natural disaster could set back progress there s no single government or central bank that can fix the inflation resulting from those global disruptions but central banks are doing what they can in the united states the fed began raising rates in march by a quarter of a percentage point its first increase since 2018 and plans to raise rates several more times this year when money becomes more expensive to borrow that can take the heat off price increases and bring the economy back down to that nice gentle simmer or so the fed hopes its biggest challenge is to deploy interest rate hikes at a pace the economy can tolerate raising them too much or too quickly would risk collapsing demand which could derail economic growth or even cause a recession

most college students are better at spending money than saving it since they re not used to having money but it is crucial that college students start saving money now emergencies and unexpected expenses don t wait until you re established in your adult life to happen they can happen at any time and what s more the sooner you start saving and investing your money the more you will have and who doesn t want more money love it or hate it you need to know about money and how to invest it that dictates many of the choices you make from where you live to what you ll buy now no one is saying you have to become an expert but you have to know the basics and it s important to start while you re still in college more from college money 101 an easy guide to help college students set up their first budget how college students can start investing and making money how i learned about investing in stocks and you can too get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters there s a saying in the investing community the best time to invest was yesterday the second best time is right now what that means is that the earlier you are able to start the earlier your money grows this is done through the magic of compound interest that means the money that you will be making when investing will grow exponentially based on the earnings made previously it is what people mean when they say make your money work for you here s an example let s say you invest 1 000 in a stock and it goes up 5 that s 50 now your investment is worth 1 050 let s say you make 5 the next year that s now 5 of 1 060 which is 53 if you make 5 the next year that s now 5 of 1 113 which is 56 your original 1 000 is now worth 1 170 now imagine that over 20 30 or 40 years it adds up by not investing right now you are basically letting that money slip away a lot of people already have an intuitive sense of what to do with money but they may not know or utilize the tools that can help grow that money exponentially it s not enough to just try to save or save when you get around to it you need to make saving a habit and keep it going and growing a simple way to do it is to use the 50 30 20 rule this is where 50 of your income goes to necessities such as rent student loans and other bills 30 goes to wants such as that new pair of shoes or that spring break trip and 20 goes to savings if you are a college student with a job or internship and you aren t able to save in this ratio right now that s ok when i was in med school i was spending 95 on needs 5 on wants however i knew that i would be able to use the rules of thumbs with a grain of salt since it didn t fit my situation said carolyn mcclanahan founder and director of financial planning at life planning partners what s important is that you start saving some money whatever you can 25 50 or 100 a month the more you save the sooner you reach financial flexibility mcclanahan said having money set aside allows for more choice that means you will be ready for emergencies when they inevitably arise and you ll be able to afford more of the things you want one thing that helps is automating it just set it and forget it set up an automatic transfer of a set amount each month and you ll be surprised how fast it grows then check back in with yourself regularly like you are your own financial advisor and see if you can increase what you are saving even if you only increase it a little bit each month or every few months it will add up how can you save and invest first even if you don t have a lot of money to invest it s important to split your savings into two distinct buckets liquid and illiquid liquid savings in the simplest terms means money you can access anytime that s like your checking and savings accounts this is for your day to day cash but also unexpected costs that may come up you need to be able to either write a check or pay someone via payment apps like venmo paypal and apple pay what is the opposite of this it s called illiquid assets and this is the type of money that you can t access so easily this ranges from your stock investment portfolio to even shoes you re trying to flip for a profit online you can t just cash out of these things quickly and in some cases there are penalties for withdrawing too early if there is a fixed date on that investment why would you want money you can t access quickly simple it tends to generate a higher rate of return than a checking or savings account but both are equally important to have if you have zero savings right now the most important thing is to figure out how much money your bills are every month and start stashing away in a saving account or financial app three to six months of your expenses so if your monthly bills come to 2 000 then you need at least 6 000 in an account that you can access anytime if you need it even if that seems like a lot set it as a goal and work hard to get there figure out where you can trim expenses even a little bit to stash more into savings veryone needs an emergency fund to able to breathe in case something goes wrong mcclanahan said get in the right money mindset my best tip is to keep your expenses consistent you may have heard the expression life is a marathon not a sprint well that totally applies to your money too think of the big picture the long term sure you will have a couple of anomalies such as buying a new phone or laptop but aside from that keep your spending consistent and that comes down to one word discipline contrary to what some people may think paying rent isn t that hard said dominic wash a psychology student in michigan state university what s hard wash said is knowing how much you can afford to spend on things like going out and eating out i ve spent more on food than i do on rent and any other expense combined wash said it s not that i m not able to budget my groceries it s just that i need to discipline myself erin yi a biopsychology cognition and neuroscience major at the university of michigan said it s also important to think of durability how long something you buy will last vs having to replace it which means spending more money when i m shopping i think about the long term benefits yi said for example i usually want to buy clothes for how long it will last me i usually don t want to do fast fashion with groceries frozen food all the time even when i eat out i try to calculate how much more i can stretch it out when i take it back home source jacob shin by actively seeking out the opportunities to save money you prepare yourself for longevity building up funds that can be used for better use now this does not mean you can t treat yourself every once in a while you can always go out and eat and go on a small shopping spree but it is crucial to be proactive keeping in mind how your decisions will affect your future where to start after you set up a savings account and build up a few months expenses in savings think about using an investment account or app to get some of your money really growing the best thing to do is set up a self directed stock account and set up automatic contributions said stephen engel a senior private wealth advisor at palumbo wealth management start early then learn engel said of course when you get your first full time job most of those will offer a 401 k retirement plan with a matching contribution from your employer here you are able to put your earnings into an account where untaxed money goes in grows in the account and then gets taxed later on when you withdraw it in retirement if you move to a new job you can roll that over into an individual retirement account ira you can also invest in what s called a roth ira where there is a contribution limit but there are tax benefits down the road the roth ira is different form a 401 k as it allows you to invest earned income that has already been taxed both of them are great ways to put your earned income into stocks and let grow through compound interest remember think big picture the best way to start learning about ways to invest is to start doing some online research you don t have to spend hours studying just read an article here look up a term there keep at it and that little bit of information gained will also grow over time don t be afraid to make mistakes either it can be nerve racking to be clueless at the cost of your own money but with the right amount of knowledge and common sense you ll learn to manage those risks with your finances as well just don t invest huge amounts of money not that most of us have it while we re in college in any one place until you learn a little even then it s smart to diversify have your money invested in a wide variety of things that way if any one investment falls it doesn t take your whole life s savings with it don t abuse credit cards credit cards are a necessity for establishing your financial history and trustworthiness if you have a credit card that you use and pay your bill on time every month it shows that you are trustworthy when it comes to money you will get a credit score based on that and it will be something creditors look at throughout your life when you go to rent your first apartment buy or lease your first car or down the road buy your first house if you never had a credit card that means you don t have credit history so it will be difficult to buy house without a record but debt is a big problem engel said never build up debt if you set up a credit card with a 10 000 limit and you charged 10 000 interest will pile up the average credit card interest rate is 18 32 for new offers according to wallethub s recent credit card landscape report credit cards charge what s called an annual percentage rate so on 10 000 that s 1 832 you don t pay that all at once a portion of that is charged each month on your monthly bill but that s not it remember how we talked about compound interest how that can work in your favor when it comes to saving investing and growing your money well it works against you if you carry a balance so if you carry a balance month after month it will keep compounding you ll be paying interest on the original amount plus the interest charges you accrued last month and the month before etc it will be a lot harder to dig out of that cycle so start good habits early and don t carry a credit card balance discipline one of the great things about graduating and starting your adult life is you get to make your own decisions about everything but that also includes your money so you have to be smart about it you don t want to be in a situation where you need to pay rent by midnight and you re wondering where that money is coming from so make sure you have a balance of liquid and illiquid assets in order to take care your life expenses now and your paradise in the future college money 101 is a guide written by

filling up has been claiming an ever larger share of californians paychecks this year here a san diego area station charges more than 6 a gallon in march by many metrics the u s economy is chugging along at a healthy clip the latest readings on some key economic indicators are all good unemployment is low quarterly profits are high home construction is up retail sales continue to grow and the gross domestic product showed solid growth the same is true for california whose gdp growth and job gains outpaced the country as a whole for much of the last year los angeles did particularly well on the jobs front according to beacon economics and its economy hamstrung by pandemic related restrictions is expected to transition from recovery to expansion in the early months of 2023 and yet a recent survey found that 4 in 5 americans expect a recession this year people are trying to talk themselves into a recession right now said david shulman an economist who advises ucla s anderson forecast advertisement even shulman sees trouble coming however just not until 2024 that s because of the eye popping acceleration in inflation which could eventually trigger a downturn southern californians are exposed to some of the worst of its effects given their gasoline sucking commutes and high housing costs to help you understand the risks and what you can do to prepare for them here are some facts and pointers about recessions and the current economic situation what is a recession the national bureau of economic research a private nonprofit not a government agency is the group that economists regard as the official scorekeeper of recessions it defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months typically that s meant at least two consecutive three month periods when gdp has declined taking inflation into account that s the technical definition what recessions mean in human terms is a surge in unemployment as demand for goods and services drops causing businesses to lay off workers which further suppresses demand for goods and services with companies retrenching instead of expanding the unemployed have a tough time finding work which exacerbates the slowdown it s a vicious cycle that the government tries to interrupt by pumping cash into the economy normally by paying unemployed workers a portion of their previous wages for several months but also occasionally by sending stimulus checks or enacting tax holidays in the most recent recession the federal government and california s state government opted for stimulus checks there is also a psychological dimension when consumers lose confidence in the economy and rein in their spending that s happening now according to the conference board s survey of consumer confidence which found the public growing more pessimistic about the future despite feeling better about their current situation advertisement when you see 6 for gasoline shulman said you feel poor in some people s minds that s a recession california newsom lawmakers haggle over plan for relief from california s high gas prices more than a month after gov gavin newsom pledged to give californians money to offset rising gas prices he and state lawmakers have yet to find common ground on the plan what causes a recession economists point to a variety of factors that can send the economy into reverse the u s has endured three recessions so far in the 21st century and each had a different cause the downturn from march to november 2001 was tied to steep losses in the stock market first when the dot com bubble burst in late 2000 then when terrorists flew planes into the world trade center on 9 11 the great recession which ran from december 2007 to june 2009 was caused by a financial industry meltdown tied to the subprime mortgage fiasco and the brief but extreme downturn from february to april 2020 was a consequence of covid 19 and the government ordered restrictions on travel and commerce the common thread in each of those was a sharp decline in demand either businesses and individuals had less money available or they weren t able to spend what they had the situation is dramatically different today demand is extremely strong because there s plenty of money sloshing around the economy a situation created by rock bottom interest rates high employment rising wages and aggressive federal borrowing and spending to cover stimulus checks among many other things but file this one in the too much of a good thing category because the demand has greatly exceeded the supply of goods and services advertisement everywhere you look you see nothing but an insane degree of consumption said economist christopher thornberg founding partner of beacon economics in los angeles defenders of the big federal aid packages say that millions of americans affected by covid needed a rescue but thornberg counters no matter how you slice it the federal government overstimulated this economy at an insane level over this last year rapidly rising stock and home prices helped increase u s household net worth by more than a third since the start of the pandemic americans are flush we feel rich and therein lies the problem thornberg said we re not rich the economy does not have the capacity to produce products at the level people want them in other words this is false wealth this mismatch which some economists blame entirely on the federal reserve pumping money into the system and others attribute at least in part to the covid related problems in supply chains at factories and in service industries exacerbated by the russian invasion of ukraine is driving prices up and prices will continue to go up thornberg said until demand and production capacity are back in synch in response the federal reserve is starting to raise interest rates making it more expensive to borrow money that change will affect businesses as well as consumers jim doti an economics professor at the center for economic research at chapman university said the fed is also dropping hints that it will start selling some of the bonds in its portfolio doing so would increase upward pressure on interest rates and reduce the supply of money the one two punch of higher prices and higher interest rates applies the brakes to a growing economy the fed s goal is a soft landing in which the tighter money supply eases demand while still allowing for some economic growth but there are plenty of economists who fear that the fed waited too long and acted too meekly allowing inflation to become powerful enough to trigger a downturn there is no soft landing thornberg said the horse is out of the barn is southern california more or less at risk noting the long commutes that typify the state shulman said california s obviously more sensitive to what s going on now because of gas prices for people who have no alternative to driving such as the commuters forced by high housing costs to live far away from their l a workplaces the roughly 50 increase in price per gallon over the last year has been the equivalent of a pay cut advertisement the higher fuel prices could also hit california harder than other parts of the country doti said because of the state s reliance on tourism the first thing that consumers cut is discretionary spending which includes travel he said that s why the covid recession hit california harder the state s extremely high housing prices are another problem doti said property values should drop later this year and more deeply in california than they will elsewhere in the u s he said but he added that rising interest rates will probably make homes less affordable even at lower prices the double whammy of higher mortgage interest and extraordinarily high house prices will probably deter not just entry level home buyers but also people looking to move up from their first home shulman said and for renters he said the likely increase in costs is even worse than the federal inflation numbers suggest that s because many tenants are on yearly leases which delays the day of reckoning on price hikes then there s the relatively high percentage of californians still looking for jobs the state s unemployment rate was 4 9 in march more than a third higher than the national average of 3 6 if you start with a higher rate going into a recession shulman said you re going to end up with a higher rate the stock market which has lost its mojo in 2022 is another risk factor for california doti said the state s tech heavy economy is rich in start up companies that rely on borrowed funds if the market turns bearish those companies that have borrowed more will have a much more difficult time rolling over that debt he said and if a recession does hit shulman said it would pose one other unusual problem for california it will increase the pressure for outmigration which would be a negative for the economy if you see less opportunity in california all of a sudden the rest of the country may look more attractive advertisement yet california has some factors operating in its favor shulman said southern california still has a presence in the defense industry albeit a diminished one and it stands to benefit from the federal government s increasing outlays for military hardware during the ukraine war he also said that despite the increase in fuel costs the state s hospitality and tourism industries should benefit from the huge pent up demand for travel now that few covid related restrictions remain in effect similarly shulman said there s a large unmet need for home and auto purchases that should sustain demand here on top of that he said there s huge capital spending coming around related at least in part to clean energy this to me doesn t make a recession shulman said what can you do to defend yourself certified financial planner barbara ginty host of future rich podcast said the covid 19 pandemic highlighted the importance of a personal emergency fund she has heard clients call themselves emergency proof but 2020 proved that you yourself might not have an emergency but you cannot prevent an emergency of a global event having that good emergency fund can alleviate a lot of that financial stress she said nevertheless millions of americans don t have a stash to draw on if things go south according to a bankrate survey last year a little more than half of the people sampled didn t have enough saved to cover three months of expenses and a quarter of the people sampled had no emergency fund at all so although the economy is still humming along it s a good idea to try to set aside some money and the place to start financial advisors say is by creating a budget advertisement budgets are your financial strategy said author jesse mecham founder of the personal finance site youneedabudget com and a strategy can involve cutting back but it doesn t have to mean that specifically or necessarily a budget is just a plan it s not a task master it s not a warden and you re now in prison creating a budget is mainly an exercise in figuring out where your money is coming from and going to and seeing which things can be adjusted and which ones can t the main point mecham and ginty said is understanding where your money is going and what s most important to you you just have all these different options if you re very aware of what your money is doing and what you need it to do mecham said most americans just really aren t aware of what their money is doing they re very reactive thanks in part to the stimulus checks americans saved far more during the early days of the pandemic than they had in the previous four decades although the savings rate has since come back down to earth how much you ll need in your emergency fund depends on your personal situation and your dependents ginty said but having enough to cover one month of expenses is a good starting point mecham said a financial cushion can give people time to find the silver lining in a downturn for a lot of people it s an opportunity he said you can be more picky

the cnn journalist decries you and i having free speech but one of his own is free to dispense hate upon seeing so many in the media ecosystem coming out to loudly issue dire warnings about granting more freedom of expression to twitter account holders brian stelter has to join in on the monday edition of his cnn program take my word such a thing exists he weighed in on the prospect of elon musk taking over twitter and what the foreboding future might hold if people were not so restricted on the social media platform advertisement this is the thing about brian stelter he dependably and obliviously manages to display all the aspects of dysfunction in the press he has taken on the task of being the cleanup crew for the journalism sector but in the process he manages to typify the root problems in the industry and goes on to routinely defy journalism standards his ethical recidivism leads one to wonder how aware he is about his lapses how much is covering up the negatives and how much is him being truly blind to his contradictions a prime example of his eclipse sized blind spot is how in 2021 he was decrying the way chinese authorities clamped down on the news outlet apple daily calling the move a chilling effect on the news and that it has a dark impact on the freedom of the press was not shocking however these entreaties were countered by commentary from himself and his ward boy wonder oliver darcy while both were simultaneously lobbying for cable outlets to take down the one america news network from their channel packages the reality of varying sets of standards is not new and it returned today as stelter talked with lauren hirsch from the new york times about musk s latest movements and the twitter board of directors working to derail his buyout attempt stelter was supportive of the blocking maneuver starting his day crowing about how the stock dropped in the morning but then after it rebounded by 2 5 percent he decided to suspend comments on the stock price advertisement here s laurenshirsch with the latest state of play about twitter i suspect the twitter board is very nervous about having this look like they are dismissing elon outright so they re going through the motions pic twitter com azat1cexnn brian stelter brianstelter april 18 2022 in the course of their talk hirsch mentioned how moderating users to this point has been good for twitter s business and brian saw the opportunity to make his point against the projections of elon s influence people don t play in the gutter proclaimed the host most people don t want to send their kids to play in the gutter this is stelter operating like so many other journalists in the press with the firm belief that musk is going to strip down any and all restrictions on content on the platform it is like complaining about an action before a complainable action even happened it is also quite certainly rooted in another journalist horror story the belief that this could lead to a return of donald trump to the platform what is precious about this perpetual press pearl clutching is that they pretend twitter is not already a sociopathic sewer and that much of that is a result of the imbalanced enforcement of the site s terms of service stelter wants to paint a scenario of decorum being tossed off the penthouse office s balcony but what he is really saying is that he despises the idea of others having the freedom to operate like the elites who are free from admonishment by the twitter authorities advertisement one need only peer back one full day to find an example of the double standard stelter pretends is not in place on sunday a mid east journalist was found to have called for the removal of all jews it was not an oblique reference that could be interpreted as hateful the man called on allah to deliver the next hitler to accomplish his goal why does miandawoodadv still have a twitter account he s literally calling for genocide twitter seems to have a soft spot for anti semites also how does trump lose his twitter account but mian dawood keep his pic twitter com aumpstigae ian mckelvey ian_mckelvey april 17 2022 consider the innocuous infractions we have seen that lead to accounts being suspended or permanently banned this one calls for outright extermination of a race but somehow this does not rise to the level of twitter s tos violations dawood has deleted his tweet and this was sufficient enough for the twitter authorities who police their digital realm this shows what stelter is actually saying in his lecture he frets that if standards are loosened on twitter the place will turn into the garbage gutter because everyone will be permitted to speak just like his fellow elite journalists
graphite is one of 50 minerals listed by the us government as being critical to national security and economic growth expansion to produce 11 250 tonnes a year at the louisiana plant was already fully funded after a us178 million equity raising in february however mr verner said the us government loan would enable his company to allocate cash towards further expansion studies that could quadruple production again to 45 000 tonnes a year to the extent that this funding does complete we will apply surplus funds from the balance sheet and from the equity raise to development looking at expansion of vidalia and in that process we will continue to engage with doe and look at options for potential further funding down the track he said louisiana plant is a loss leader syrah mines graphite at balama in mozambique and sells close to half its output to china where other companies process and purify the product into a form suitable for insertion into the anodes of lithium ion batteries syrah has built the louisiana plant under a strategy to become vertically integrated and sell higher margin products directly to car and battery makers advertisement the louisiana plant is in effect a loss leader for the company at the moment it produces small volumes of high purity coated spherical graphite for potential customers who are undertaking several years of testing to ensure syrah s product is suitable before signing long term supply contracts that qualification work received a big vote of support in december when tesla signed up to buy 8000 tonnes a year of the battery grade graphite about 71 per cent of the plant s initial commercial output if syrah executes the plan to produce 11 250 tonnes of high purity coated spherical graphite in louisiana by september next year the company should start generating strong profits at the plant and will become the only vertically integrated producer of such battery grade graphite outside china but it would still supply only about 5 per cent of north american demand if syrah can expand the louisiana plant to produce 45 000 tonnes of battery grade graphite a year by 2026 it would still supply between only 12 per cent and 15 per cent of forecast north american demand advertisement syrah said in a statement the loan was conditional on further due diligence by the doe but if all went to plan the funds should be transferred in september the loan would have a 10 year term with interest rates linked to long term us treasury rates it is clearly better than what could be achieved in the commercial market and therefore it has been a focus for us for some time said mr verner who was previously an executive at bhp australiansuper s unflinching support the doe loan would be the first debt syrah has taken on apart from two convertible notes issued to australiansuper they were the first convertible notes issued to a listed company by australia s biggest superannuation fund those convertible notes symbolised australiansuper s unflinching support for syrah through a severe bear market in 2018 and 2019 which was worsened by intense short selling of the stock advertisement australiansuper has subscribed for syrah shares on numerous occasions over the past six years and is the company s biggest shareholder with 18 per cent the syrah loan marks the revival of a us25 billion us government fund created in 2007 to support the growth of a low emissions transport industry on us soil the advanced vehicles technology manufacturing avtm program the avtm fund has not made a loan since 2011 when taxpayer funds were lost in a high profile corporate failure but it has been revived under us president joe biden s clean energy manifesto and has us17 billion still to lend doe loans director jigar shah said in a statement published by syrah the conditional commitment offered to syrah would be the first ever avtm loan to support a supply chain manufacturing project and further demonstrates doe s commitment to building a strong domestic supply chain for zero emission transportation solutions this reiterates president biden s commitment to strengthening us critical mineral supply chains the doe fund is just one avenue through which the us government is funding australian producers of critical minerals lynas corporation is in talks with the us department of defence over possible financial support for a potential rare earths separation plant on us soil most likely in texas

kendrick s recent collaborations with his cousin baby keem show that he s still tapped into youth culture the flows he hit on family ties and range brothers make it clear that he s still having fun with music and that he would sound great on production from buzzing 808 kings like tay keith cardo kenny beats and more and of course if he really wanted he could just rap his ass off over soulful gritty beats and contribute another record to the canon that artists like alchemist roc marciano and westside gunn have cultivated over the years the album s title also makes one wonder if we re in store for another concept album will kendrick take us through a sonic universe offering social commentary through mr morale the big steppers journey colloquially steppers has entered our lexicon as the latest term for shooters or goons though it s been co opted by some people to signify that a stepper is a general badass with that in mind a cursory interpretation of that title hints at a good kid m a a d city like paradox it will be interesting to see how much kendrick plays into meme marketing with his new album tiktok was bubbling in 2017 but it s now the undisputed king of social apps in 2022 nearly every top selling rap and pop project has been bolstered by a winning tiktok campaign so will kendrick play the game it s highly unlikely we ll see kendrick making an overt toosie slide or body play for tiktok supremacy but the hysteria behind the top o the mornin refrain on range brothers shows how his animated delivery and charisma allow him to slip in meme able moments as naturally as anyone his forthcoming album is so anticipated that kendrick doesn t have to do much marketing for it to dominate the charts in may but a winning meme gives the right song staying power while it s fun to speculate on how cultural and industrial changes will shape the new album it s also worth considering how his own life and times will reflect in the music at 34 and already more accomplished than 99 9 percent of rappers it wouldn t be surprising if he s feeling anxious about his artistic fulfillment both cole and drake in their early to mid 30s have been candid about their qualms of how to keep the artistic flame alive and where to take their careers next drake and j cole have each exercised the artistic freedom to release whatever they want however they want a luxury afforded to stars of their caliber drake has routinely put out billboard appeasing albums with a little something for everybody while cole s last project 2021 s the off season was an ode to craft that saw him simply trying to rap as well as he could over stripped down production that brought his lyrics to the foreground kendrick could go in either direction or chart his own course sometimes having the power to do anything can be a burden with millions of fans the confusion that drake and cole have expressed is a symptom of success in a space that demands constant commercial triumph lest fans believe you ve fallen off kendrick may grapple with being a nearly 20 year rap vet who has already seen music s commercial heights is he still looking to be king kunta and fight for the rap crown as feverishly as he reached for it on control or will pglang represent the start of a new chapter of his public life as an executive more importantly how has this period shaped his growth as a father husband son brother and loved one last august he posted some nu thoughts to his twitter page in which he reflected that he like most of society wasn t in a good space i spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts writing listening and collecting old beach cruisers he wrote the morning rides keep me on a hill of silence i go months without a phone love loss and grief have disturbed my comfort zone but the glimmers of god speak through my music and family while the world around me evolves i reflect on what matters the most the life in which my words will land next he was 29 when damn dropped so what have his 30s been like so far what breakthroughs did he have on those phoneless moments riding his bike on silent hills those glimmers of god make me wonder what kind of gems the new album will offer to the millions of people desperately trying to stay emotionally afloat in a world that assails one challenge after another kendrick reportedly had a daughter in july 2019 and he s famously private about his personal life so there s a chance that he has nothing public to say about family life but being a first time father especially of a daughter may have given him new insights on life if he does explore fatherhood hopefully it will be more interesting than the now i want to treat women like humans trope we ve heard from other famous girl dads whatever happens kendrick will have the rap world in a frenzy he has one of rap s most beloved catalogs and it s difficult to imagine him not dropping another album of the year contender that will motivate his mc peers and give the rap world what they ve been looking for
by chris isidore and sara ashley o brien cnn business some employees at the apple store at new york s grand central terminal are seeking to form a union the latest high profile labor organizing effort to take root in the pandemic era a person familiar with the matter told cnn business that workers at the grand central apple store have begun collecting signatures to file a petition to unionize the first step of a union organizing effort if they file cards from at least 30 of the workers at the store the national labor relations board can hold an election the employees leading the effort are partnering with workers united an affiliate of the service employees international union and the same union supporting the so far successful organizing effort at starbucks the apple employees have dubbed their effort fruit stand workers united the organizing effort was first reported by the washington post on the group s website it says a union is needed because wages have not kept pace with the cost of living in new york city it said it also wants better job protections for workers apple has grown to be the most valuable company in the world the employees site says why should its retail workers live precariously we cannot live at the whims of apple s generosity we can t bet our futures on luck if apple s goal is to leave the world better than we found it then they need to hold themselves to a higher standard apple would not comment directly on the organizing effort we are fortunate to have incredible retail team members and we deeply value everything they bring to apple said the company s statement we are pleased to offer very strong compensation and benefits for full time and part time employees including health care tuition reimbursement new parental leave paid family leave annual stock grants and many other benefits the company has more than 270 us stores and tens of thousands of us retail employees the starting salary for retail workers is 20 an hour or about 40 000 a year for a full time employee the average hourly wage for retailer workers at electronics and appliance stores nationwide stands at about 25 50 an hour according to the bureau of labor statistics that is all workers in the sector not the starting wage growing union efforts the employees leading the organizing effort at the grand central store and the workers united union argue that a union is needed no matter the current starting wage hourly wage workers across the country have come to the realization that without organizing for a collective voice employers will continue to ignore their concerns in the workplace said a statement from workers united workers across the country have decided a collective voice is what they need and organizing movements are stronger than they have been in a long time while nearly 40 of government workers belong to unions only 6 1 of private sector employees are union members according to data from the bureau of labor statistics and the representation of retail workers is even lower only 4 4 with most of those in grocery stores union membership has been in a decline for decades with private sector union membership falling from steadily from the 16 8 it held in 1983 organizing nonunion companies such as starbucks amazon and apple are crucial to union efforts to regain influence they have lost over the decades typically a union waits until it has cards from more than 50 of workers to file for an election and even then the efforts to win an election often fail in the face of an anti union campaign by management to persuade employees to vote no the trend appears to be shifting earlier this month amazon employees at a warehouse in staten island made history when they voted in favor of a union and at more than a dozen starbucks stores nationwide unions have secured high profile victories inspiring other workers to follow suit in the past six months the number of elections filed with the nlrb is up 57 from the same period a year ago it s the most active level of organizing in at least 10 years unhappy apple workers the effort is just the latest example of worker agitation inside apple s corporate and retail workforce that seeped outside the company and into the public sphere the company which has long prided itself on secrecy has seen its employees push back and speak out over issues ranging from alleged pay disparities remote work policies and mistreatment of its frontline retail workers in august two apple employees janneke parrish and cher scarlett started appletoo to help workers organize and protect ourselves as they pushed workers across apple s various workforces including corporate and retail to share stories to demand changes parrish was fired by apple and she s filed a charge with the national labor relations board alleging retaliation meanwhile scarlett left apple in november she also has pending complaints with the labor board apple in november posted a statement to employees informing them of their right to speak up about pay and workplace conditions a spokesperson declined to comment on those cases earlier this year one former apple retail worker published a lengthy medium post titled apple s retail staff are second class employees a memoir from the fruit stand after turning in his resignation notice detailing his time working for the company since 2016 apple easily has the financial resources to be the exemplar of a modern progressive workplace but instead has established itself as the paradigm of capitalist greed wrote matt herbst telling cnn business in february that he d already had roughly 100 people reach out to him that work at various stores telling him they d had similar experiences the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company

character that has made his mark is thor odinson aussie legend chris hemsworth has carried the hammer through seven different marvel movies and recently he had the rare opportunity to front his fourth solo movie thor love and thunder thor s initial two movies may not have been as well received as some of the other marvel movies but things undeniably turned around with thor ragnarok taika waititi breathed new life into the thor series with a wildly comedic and action packed take on the franchise and he s continuing that trend in thor 4 when will thor love and thunder be on disney thor love and thunder had its release date shifted a few times due to covid 19 but eventually hit cinemas on july 6 2022 as is now tradition with disney s films the marvel movie will make the jump to streaming and

at 2019 s san diego comic con sdcc it came with the announcement that not only would waititi and hemsworth be coming back but so would natalie portman as jane foster except jane looks a little different this time around advertisement thor love and thunder draws from the notable mighty thor comic book storyline which sees jane foster wield mjolnir and become a female iteration of thor adding to the female power is the return of valkyrie who we last saw crowned as the king of new asgard in avengers endgame tessa thompson announced at sdcc that valkyrie would be looking for her queen in thor 4 meaning that the character s lgbtq comic book roots will be addressed in this film we love to see it as for thor himself the last we saw of the god of thunder he was off on a spacefaring trip with the guardians of the galaxy thor was also massively overweight after his dark period in avengers endgame but chris hemsworth was spotted looking more bulked than ever on the thor 4 set so it seems we ll see him undertake a fitness journey thor also has his hands full with a new enemy gorr the god butcher gorr has a personal vendetta against the gods which doesn t bode well for our mate the god of thunder according to the official synopsis we ll see thor on a journey of self discovery the film finds thor on a journey unlike anything he s ever faced a search for self discovery but his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as gorr the god butcher who seeks the extinction of the gods to combat the threat thor enlists the help of king valkyrie korg and ex girlfriend jane foster who to thor s surprise inexplicably wields his magical hammer mjolnir as the mighty thor together they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the god butcher s vengeance and stop him before it s too late waititi confirmed that thor 4 is so over the top in the very best way considering how ragnarok turned out it seems thor love and thunder is ready to take things even further who is in the cast as expected plenty of familiar faces are returning for thor s fourth adventure the holy trinity of chris hemsworth natalie portman and tessa thompson returns as

bakersfield calif kero with monday being tax day some in the central valley are coming together to call for policy change where the wealthiest people pay their fair share of taxes they hoping to bring awareness to the growing economic gap by pushing for a tighter taxing system for wealthier corporations but how viable is it in the united states we have a progressive tax system meaning the more income you have the more taxes you pay but once you throw in deductions tax credits and a long list of other tax laws and loopholes it can become complicated the latest data from the white house shows that between 2010 and 2018 the wealthiest 400 billion families paid an average of 8 2 percent of their income tax the average working class american pays about 1 3rd or 30 percent of their income in taxes but because tax is based on income some of the most wealthy people and corporations are reporting no income and therefore don t pay taxes using some of those laws some of the wealthiest people in the country have found ways around paying income taxes which is why many including those in the central valley are pushing for tax reform it s a source of frustration for tasha hall with the group unrig our economy central valley she held a press conference monday calling for change if me as a working american can pay my taxes millionaires and billionaires should not have loopholes where they can not pay their fair share of taxes a local financial advisor with moneywise dave anderson points to a report from propublica last year that showed some of the most well known billionaires including amazon founder jeff bezos took advantage of those loopholes the problem is many of the ultra wealthy have been able to eliminate their income in some cases billionaires have paid no income taxes based on how they receive their income explained anderson all of his wealth is locked up in his stocks so how does he provide for his lifestyle well he goes out and he gets loans loans that are not taxable loans that are backed by the assets that he owns those that understand the system they can really decide where their income is coming from whether to realize gains or not and so it is tricky for a government to kinda figure out about this anderson says the answer to whether billionaires are taxed fairly depends on who you ask there are a lot of disagreements on what actually can be done and if it is constitutional to target only a select few but when it comes to income taxes income is what can complicate things anderson adds the solution is not as simple as raising taxes because not all income is treated equally for example some found ways to have no income others have their money in assets that do not get taxed while some have their money in capital gains which is when you make money off selling an asset like a stock and can be taxed depending on income they have their earnings they have right offs and things like that they may show no earnings in which case they are not taxed which is why amazon may pay less in taxes than you and i do added aaron hedge chair and professor of economics at california state university bakersfield being in the central valley there are a lot of farms and a lot of people that have been able to become very wealthy off of their farms and so we want to make a statement that all of the contributors to the wealth of the central valley should also be contributing to our tax base erica cap another member of unrig our economy central valley is talking about major ag corporations in the region and also others who are using those loopholes to avoid paying what she calls their fair share read also millions of americans not claiming tax credits they are owed some people have proposed getting rid of an income tax and implementing a consumption tax if there is a consumption tax those of us who consume less would pay less in taxes than those who consume more said hedge hegde adds the argument to this is that the wealthier contribute to the economy by investing another idea he says is a flat tax but that would usually hurt low income people in recent years there have been multiple attempts to change the tax situation but all have failed in congress with income inequality continuing to rise that is not a good scenario to be in continued anderson so we should all regardless of what side of the aisle you are on should be for doing something about that the central valley group also says they hope more people get involved and call on their representatives to push for a change
the international monetary fund has warned that increasing levels of domestic government borrowing from banks in nigeria and other emerging markets could threaten the country s financial stability according to the imf the pandemic has increased the amount of government debt emerging market banks are holding which could increase the pressures on public sector finances and threatening financial stability in the process the washington based lender disclosed this in a report titled emerging market banks government debt holdings pose financial stability risks it added that authorities should act to minimise the risk it said governments around the world have spent aggressively to help households and employers to weather the economic impact of the pandemic public debt has mounted as governments have issued bonds to cover their budget deficits the average ratio of public debt to the gross domestic product a key measure of a country s fiscal health rose to a record 67 per cent last year in emerging market countries according to chapter 2 of the imf s april 2022 global financial stability report it added emerging market banks have provided most of that credit driving holdings of government debt as a percentage of their assets to a record 17 per cent in 2021 in some economies government debt amounts to a quarter of bank assets the result emerging market governments rely heavily on their banks for credit and these banks rely heavily on government bonds as an investment that they can use as collateral for securing funding from the central bank economists have a name for this interdependence between banks and governments they call it the sovereign bank nexus because government debt is also known as sovereign debt a vestige of the middle ages when kings and queens did the borrowing according to the imf the large holding of sovereign debt could expose banks to losses if government finances come under pressure and the market value of government debt declines which could force banks especially those with less capital to reduce their lending to companies and households weighing on economic activity it added that as the economy slows and tax revenues reduce government finances will come under pressure further threatening banks it stated that this could eventually lead to a government default the imf said now emerging market economies are at greater risk than advanced economies for two reasons for one their growth prospects are weaker relative to the pre pandemic trend compared with advanced economies and governments have less fiscal firepower to support the economy for another external financing costs have generally risen so governments will have to pay more to borrow what could trigger the doom loop in a country a sharp tightening of global financial conditions resulting in higher interest rates and weaker currencies on the back of monetary policy normalization in advanced economies and intensifying geopolitical tensions caused by the war in ukraine could undermine investor confidence in the ability of emerging market governments to repay debts copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in whole or in part without prior express written permission from punch contact

economic relief efforts was a series of economic impact payments made to u s households payment amounts and eligibility varied in each package but most lower and middle income households received 3 200 per adult across the three payouts with more for households with dependents these payments were included to help households deal with lost jobs or wages as a result of covid related disruptions and to help stimulate demand in the economy at a time when many industries were struggling u s census survey data from july 2020 just a few months after the initial round of payments from the cares act showed that the payments were a significant help to many households in covering regular living expenses more than 60 of u s adults more than 150 million people used their stimulus checks to cover living expenses far more than the share who paid off debt or simply saved the money given that much of the economy was shut down in the spring and early summer of 2020 and unemployment was still at historic highs the additional relief from the federal government provided much needed support for families who would have struggled to make ends meet otherwise despite the success and popularity of the first round of stimulus payments in the cares act subsequent rounds faced more criticism these critics anticipated that with many parts of the economy performing better than expected broad based stimulus would give well off households more money than they needed and potentially produce inflation some economic experts and policymakers instead argued for more limited means tested payments to the neediest households in retrospect the census survey data confirms that there were indeed significant differences between how more needy and less needy households used their stimulus payments the households most likely to use their stimulus payments for living expenses were racial and ethnic minorities and low income earners more than three quarters of black adults 75 9 reported using stimulus checks for living expenses compared to just 60 3 of adults identifying as white alone differences were even starker along the income distribution 77 1 of adults with household income below 35 000 used stimulus payments for living expenses nearly five times the share for adults from households earning more than 200 000 15 7 these higher income earners were more likely to pay debt save money or buy non necessary items given the demographic and economic trends in how stimulus payments were used the southern u s which has a higher population of minority and low income adults saw the greatest share of adults using their checks for living expenses eight of the 10 states where the most adults used stimulus to cover living expenses are found in the south including louisiana 74 4 and west virginia

black lives matter is dusting off its flags and signs and once again stopping traffic to honor the latest moron who chose to ignore the cops and got himself shot advertisement patrick lyoya a black man was pulled over because the car he was driving had the wrong license plate which is frequently indicative of a stolen car lyoya ignored over a dozen police commands including one telling him to get back in his car stop resisting and drop the police officer s taser which he had wrestled away from a grand rapids mich policeman at one point the police officer was on top of lyoya who was on his hands and knees wrestling for the taser the policeman who in the various videos sounds as though he is running out of energy to continue fighting pulled his gun and shot lyoya in the back of the head hero takes a fall like so many other black criminals who chose to fight the cops lyoya will be the next blm hero as per usual blm is now screaming that lyoya didn t deserve to die because of a wrong plate that s not why he died he died because he like so many other black heroes resisted arrest attacked a cop and got shot in the process he also took a cop s weapon what did he think was going to happen he probably knew he d be a hero to the far left they d riot in his name and paint murals of him nationwide why live in obscurity when you can die a legend advertisement we ve all seen it again and again the obamas oprah and a host of other big wigs black celebrities paid homage to career criminal george floyd on the anniversary of his decision to resist arrest resulting in his death obama even tweeted the following george floyd was murdered one year ago today since then hundreds more americans have died in encounters with police parents sons daughters friends taken from us far too soon but the last year has also given us reasons to hope george floyd was murdered one year ago today since then hundreds more americans have died in encounters with police parents sons daughters friends taken from us far too soon but the last year has also given us reasons to hope barack obama barackobama may 25 2021 the reasons to hope include defunding police departments nationwide maybe obama should have suggested that black men stop committing crimes and stop fighting cops when they get caught but the left chooses to make heroes of their criminals why because it will inspire more black men to resist fight and die and that s all part of the plan fact o rama legendary musician prince had one funeral while legacy criminal george floyd had four advertisement i was able to locate two murals dedicated to prince one in his home state of minnesota and one in new zealand george floyd a career criminal who once pointed a loaded gun at a pregnant woman s belly to rob her has them all over the country the left has no interest in teaching black men to obey the law and obey cops when they don t blm sees these dead black men as an opportunity to make money and to push their marxist agenda white liberals believe crime is as colin flaherty the now deceased author of don t make the black kids angry and white girl bleed a lot put it the new black entitlement crystal ball prediction o rama patrick loyoya will be in the news longer than black supremacist mass shooter frank james who shot people on the nyc subway out of pure racial hatred we live in an era where black people have never been more prosperous at least they were when trump was president two out of nine supreme court judges are black many police chiefs are black though blm chased some out of their jobs remember they can t scream systemic police racism if the police chief is black those chiefs have to go ferguson mo cop darren wilson was almost beaten unconscious by gentle giant michael brown before wilson shot brown to death the violent left again claimed brown didn t deserve to die for walking in the middle of the street where wilson saw him and told him to move to the sidewalk the usual riots ensued and a commemorative plaque was hoisted for brown in other words he is a hero for attacking a cop and dying in the process tell me again how black lives matter to the far left advertisement opinion o rama i believe black leaders want to see more young black men fight cops and die in the process their goal is to see resisting arrest be decriminalized we ve seen the left decriminalize traffic stops that somehow affect black people more in nevada and seattle baltimore decriminalized prostitution drug possession defecating in public and a bunch of other low level crimes rather than teach people not to poop where we walk play and live the left thinks we should just make it ok to do so shouldn t we be elevating black people to prosperity instead of making it legal for them to drop a crab cake on the street equity how many don t resist masks have you seen the message is clear the left wants black men to resist arrest and die and for two reasons those blm mansions aren t going to pay for themselves george soros knows a key to bringing communism to the u s is to have rampant crime if you think soros cares about black men i d like to sell you a very loud chihuahua who incidentally poops shares of twitter stock i keep him in my neighbor s yard black men are the unwitting cannon fodder for the left who pretend to defend them the left pushes their 400 years of slavery myth to keep black people angry at white people they also propagate the delusion that cops are hunting black men to make sure that black men will continue to fight the cops and die if and when black men stop resisting and dying blm big wigs will have to get jobs and soros will have failed in his lifelong dream of bringing communism to the united states advertisement you can see the various videos of the lyoya

these two under the radar semiconductor service companies could give your portfolio a boost the semiconductor sector which is responsible for producing the advanced computer chips that power our favorite electronics is large and complex most investors are familiar with industry darlings like nvidia or advanced micro devices but there s an entire subfield of companies providing critical products and services to the world s top chipmakers some of them are trading at very attractive market valuations as they tend to receive less attention than their more glamorous peers and that s an opportunity for investors it s possible you ve never heard of ultra clean holdings uctt 2 85 or mks instruments mksi 1 80 but they re fast growing and highly profitable and those aren t the only reasons to add them to your portfolio right now the case for ultra clean holdings ultra clean is based in california and has been in business for over 30 years the company is conscious of the rapid growth in demand for semiconductors triggered by the onset of advanced technologies like electric vehicles smart homes and the 5g network it provides a range of products and services to make the chip manufacturing process more efficient which is increasingly important as semiconductors become more complex for example the company s chemtrace solution identifies contamination risks in fabrication clean rooms to help chipmakers maintain a high yield with less waste and its quantumclean processes prolong the life of production equipment with fast service turnarounds to reduce potential downtime ultra clean s mechatronics segment also focuses on unlocking precision in the manufacturing process carefully testing robots assemblies and systems to ensure requirements are being met for the given purpose automated production processes need to operate at high speeds while maintaining pinpoint accuracy so this analysis can prevent costly issues once manufacturing goes live the company is on an impressive growth streak at the moment on both the sales side and profitability side recovering from a loss in 2019 to deliver positive earnings per share metric 2019 2020 2021 cagr revenue 1 06 billion 1 39 billion 2 1 billion 40 earnings loss per share 0 24 1 89 2 69 n a analysts expect further strength in 2022 with 2 5 billion in revenue and 4 9 in earnings per share in the cards yet ultra clean stock trades at a price to earnings multiple of just 12 which is a 47 discount to its peers in the industry represented by the ishares semiconductor etf which trades at a multiple of 23 it implies ultra clean stock would need to almost double just to trade in line with the broader sector and if it continues this run of performance it just might the case for mks instruments mks instruments is another service company with a multidecade history this time spanning over 60 years it not only serves the semiconductor industry but it also has a robust portfolio of customers in industrial technology health science and defense the company describes itself as the go to critical problem solving partner for advanced manufacturers given the company s broad solutions it says virtually every semiconductor chip is made with mks products as chips become smaller yet more powerful producing them is growing more complex and mks supports manufacturers with solutions in all four phases of the chip production process one of the challenges for chip makers is maintaining production yield while also boosting productivity as new chemistries in advanced semiconductors require process innovations mks offers multiple tools to solve these new age problems including infrared optical sensors plasma sources and process monitoring the goal is to reduce waste save cost and ultimately increase output the company has generated strong financial results recently but its soaring earnings per share is of particular note it s partly attributable to a continued increase in gross profit margin from 45 2 in 2020 to 46 8 in 2021 metric 2019 2020 2021 cagr revenue 1 9 billion 2 3 billion 2 9 billion 24 earnings per share 2 55 6 33 9 90 97 analysts predict further full year growth during 2022 in both sales and earnings albeit at a slowing rate no company can near double its profits every year forever however investors get the benefit of a 0 22 quarterly dividend so mks will pay you a return of approximately 0 75 per year to hold its stock that s better than money in the bank in most cases mks instruments stock trades at a price to earnings multiple of 11 which is even cheaper than ultra clean holdings so there s a similar case for significant upside in order for mks to trade in line with the broader semiconductor sector

of the following documents 1 a certification issued by the prsd under its official seal specifying that the organizational documents and the copy of the permit to organize have been duly filed 6 evidence that the paid in capital of the ife has been subscribed issued and paid and that the ife complies with the requirement regarding maintaining unencumbered assets as discussed above 2 the payment of a license fee in the amount of us 5 000 in the form of a money order official check or certified check payable to the order of the secretary of the treasury of puerto rico 3 a certified copy of all documents filed at the prsd 4 copy of the regulations or by laws adopted by the board of directors or governing body of the ife certified by the secretary or authorized person before notary public 5 evidence showing the principal place of business 7 a statement or certificate of corporate resolution certified by the secretary or authorized person before notary public indicating that the ife has complied with all the provisions of the act and regulation 5653 and that it is ready to commence operations and 8 a sworn statement signed by the chief executive officer of the institution certifying that the entity has adopted and will implement the procedures and systems necessary and adequate to comply with the bank secrecy act and regulations issued thereunder and that it has adopted or will adopt the policies and procedures necessary to comply with all ofac requirements 6 tax benefits dlapiper com after an ife license is issued by the commissioner a copy of the same must be filed with the prsd no later than 10 days from the date of issuance thereafter the ife may request a tax exemption grant from the puerto rico department of economic development and commerce ddec for its spanish acronym in the event the tax exemption grant is issued the effectiveness of such tax grant is retroactive to the date of its filing unlike ibes ifes receive their preferential tax treatment through a tax grant or a contract with the government rather than by operation of law the contractual protection of tax grants secures the tax benefits for a period of 15 years and thus cannot be repealed or modified by the puerto rico legislature the 15year period may be renewed the extensions must be requested 6 to 24 months before the end of the applicable 15 year term ifes receive their preferential tax treatment through a tax grant or a contract with the government in an effort to attract more investors and further boost the puerto rico economy the ife act can interact with act 60 for shareholders tax benefits include i a 6 percent income tax rate on distributions to puerto rico resident shareholders of earnings and profits derived from authorized ife activities and ii full puerto rico income tax exemption on such distributions to non prresident shareholders under subchapter a of chapter 4 of act 60 2019 as amended better known as the puerto rico tax incentives code act 60 both the ife and its shareholders receive preferential tax treatment the ifes have the following tax benefits i a fixed 4 percent income tax rate on the net income derived by the ife from authorized ife activities ii 75 percent exemption on property tax and 50 percent exemption on municipal license tax on such activities and iii full exclusion of interest financing charges or participation in partnerships benefits which will not be considered gross income from puerto rico sources and therefore will not be subject to taxation or withholding provisions for nonresidents of puerto rico at the heart of these incentives is the potential interplay between the ife act and act 60 in an effort to attract more investors and further boost the puerto rico economy the ife act can interact with act 60 so that dividends received by a bona fide pr resident from authorized ife activities that are puerto rico source income are fully exempt from puerto rico income tax under act 60 and are also exempt from us income tax pursuant to the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 7 international financial entities in puerto rico these nine factors are also relevant finally if you are considering applying for a license to do business as an ife the following may be of interest 1 the ife act makes us anti money laundering statutes such as the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and ofac pronouncements applicable to ifes compliance with anti money laundering statutes and regulations is of utmost importance to the commissioner 2 the commissioner may not establish interest rates to be paid or payable to the ife 3 the ife act does not establish lending limits for ifes although for ifes that are depository institutions having lending limit policies would be recommended as a safe and sound practice 4 the ife act provides that all information submitted to the commissioner regarding the ife will be treated as confidential and may not be revealed by the commissioner unless through a written court order from a court of competent jurisdiction or a formal order from a governmental agency in the course of its supervising powers of the ife and when the commissioner understands that such action is in the best public interest 5 certain ifes which receive deposits may qualify as a territory financial institutions for purposes of the foreign account tax compliance act fatca if that is the case the ife may not be obligated to provide information about its clients to the us internal revenue service under fatca 6 although the ife act includes activities such as securities brokerage trading and investment advisory services as authorized activities the ife may be required to have additional licenses or registrations under the us securities exchange act of 1934 as amended 1934 act the us investment advisers act of 1940 as amended 1940 act and or the puerto rico uniform securities act as amended prusa said licenses or registrations depend on the type of activities the ife is going to perform since there may be some exceptions and exemptions that may be applicable the point here is that obtaining an ife license does not exempt the entity from obtaining other licenses or registrations that may be required under other statutes such as the 1934 act the 1940 act and the prusa notwithstanding the above an ife can offer securities brokerage trading services to its clients through the ifes duly authorized trust department and by using the services of duly registered securities broker dealers as long as the ife does not charge commissions for trades which are performed by the duly registered securities brokerage dealer 8 dlapiper com 7 the federal reserve bank of new york ny fed has opened banking accounts for ifes in that sense the ife becomes a client of the ny fed which does not equate to becoming a member of the federal reserve system the fed or being regulated by the fed in 2019 the ny fed issued a circular announcing that it was suspending approval of all new and pending applications for accounts and new services form international financial and banking entities in pr and the us virgin islands as a result recent events including the expansion of economic sanctions to venezuela and stated that it would release enhanced standards applicable to its provision of account and financial services

the suspension and pause period and published its federal reserve bank of new york account and financial services handbook and related documentation which includes the guidelines and requirements to apply and maintain an account at the ny fed 8 as long as the ife is not a banking subsidiary of a bank holding company under the us bank holding company act of 1956 as amended bhca there is no requirement for the ife to have its deposits insured by the fdic if on the other hand the ife engages in both deposit taking and lending activities in the united states then the ife could be considered as a banking subsidiary of a bank holding company under the bhca in that case the owner of the ife other than individual natural persons and the affiliates of the ife would be subject to the applicability of the bhca in addition to requiring the ife to have its deposits insured by the fdic 9 ife applicants that seek to organize ifes to engage in financial activities related to blockchain technology and virtual currencies will have to follow the guidelines established by the commissioner on april 12 2018 said guidelines follow similar statements issued by the office of the

photo credit evgenia parajanian shutterstock the u s economy today is in far better shape than it was at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic two years ago unemployment is approaching pre pandemic levels gdp growth is up significantly and many workers especially lower earners have seen a boost in wages though the effect of this has been tempered by recent inflation two years ago the new pandemic and ensuing economic effects created much more uncertainty and fear in the economy with spiking unemployment and entire sectors of the economy shutting down in response the federal government stepped in with unprecedented levels of financial relief to u s households and the economy in three major stimulus packages passed in 2020 and 2021 one of the signature components of congress s economic relief efforts was a series of economic impact payments made to u s households payment amounts and eligibility varied in each package but most lower and middle income households received 3 200 per adult across the three payouts with more for households with dependents these payments were included to help households deal with lost jobs or wages as a result of covid related disruptions and to help stimulate demand in the economy at a time when many industries were struggling u s census survey data from july 2020 just a few months after the initial round of payments from the cares act showed that the payments were a significant help to many households in covering regular living expenses more than 60 of u s adults more than 150 million people used their stimulus checks to cover living expenses far more than the share who paid off debt or simply saved the money given that much of the economy was shut down in the spring and early summer of 2020 and unemployment was still at historic highs the additional relief from the federal government provided much needed support for families who would have struggled to make ends meet otherwise despite the success and popularity of the first round of stimulus payments in the cares act subsequent rounds faced more criticism these critics anticipated that with many parts of the economy performing better than expected broad based stimulus would give well off households more money than they needed and potentially produce inflation some economic experts and policymakers instead argued for more limited means tested payments to the neediest households in retrospect the census survey data confirms that there were indeed significant differences between how more needy and less needy households used their stimulus payments the households most likely to use their stimulus payments for living expenses were racial and ethnic minorities and low income earners more than three quarters of black adults 75 9 reported using stimulus checks for living expenses compared to just 60 3 of adults identifying as white alone differences were even starker along the income distribution 77 1 of adults with household income below 35 000 used stimulus payments for living expenses nearly five times the share for adults from households earning more than 200 000 15 7 these higher income earners were more likely to pay debt save money or buy non necessary items given the demographic and economic trends in how stimulus payments were used the southern u s which has a higher population of minority and low income adults saw the greatest share

chinese real estate developer bond prices have ticked higher as investor confidence gets a boost from policy support for the battered industry since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday but analysts point out beijing s emphasis that houses are for living in not speculation means the property market won t resume the high growth of the past the tide may be turning on china s battered real estate market investor confidence in the sector appears to be improving as bond trading volumes and prices rose in recent weeks in part boosted by the government s promise to support the sector and some loosening of policies but analysts say china s high growth property market may be a thing of the past set to be changed forever following the recent shakeup in the sector get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters s p global ratings said in an early april report that china s policy crackdown on its residential housing market has bottomed but that it will take several quarters for markets to feel the effects of the regulatory easing when china s residential market emerges from this correction it may be changed forever s p said we anticipate fewer developers will be able to employ the highly leveraged fast churn strategy that brought past success recent reports show that some cities and banks are willing to support real estate again after a plunge in home sales in the last few months since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday he also noted how covid had affected some people s income and their ability to pay mortgages on time the government s stance trying to prevent the contagion preventing the spillover from the real estate sector spillover to the real economy gary ng asia pacific economist at natixis told cnbc in a phone interview earlier this month any change in china s real estate industry has significant implications for the economy since property and related sectors account for roughly a quarter of gdp according to moody s the latest wave of covid restrictions has added pressure to growth that was already slowing the measures may have been too tight now we see this fine tuning of the policy ng said the worst time is over basically for those developers who are broadly in line with the current regulatory target or framework the problems of real estate developers in china came to a head after the authorities rolled out the so called three red lines policy in august 2020 aimed at reining in developers after years of growth fueled by excessive debt the policy places a limit on debt in relation to a firm s cash flows assets and capital levels while many developers reduced their debt levels accordingly a result of the policy was that banks became less willing to lend to the sector against this backdrop evergrande the world s most indebted developer fell into default for the first time late last year as the debt crisis unraveled other chinese developers also started showing signs of strain some missed interest payments while others defaulted on their debt altogether bond trading volumes up prices rise the bond issuance in asia s high yield bond market dominated by chinese real estate developers slumped in the first quarter of this year the region issued only 4 4 billion worth of debt about 85 lower than a year ago according to data from dealogic this was a result of chinese property developers largely being cut off from the bond market amid a growing number of stressed and distressed situations in the sector said dealogic however sentiment turned around slightly in mid march after china signaled support for its companies and indicated that authorities would work toward stability in its struggling real estate sector bond trading volumes in the real estate debt market jumped to nearly 700 million in mid march a nearly 20 increase from over 583 million traded in the beginning of the month according to data from electronic fixed income trading platform marketaxess by late march volumes increased further to cross 700 million before falling back slightly again in april bond prices also rose correspondingly the ice bofa asian dollar high yield corporate index has climbed more than 15 in the period between mid march to the beginning of april three provinces have also loosened their policies which include removing restrictions on home purchases for those without full local residency status and that should lift short term sentiment said nomura in a report on april 4 these policy relaxation measures are in line with our expectation and confirm the local governments increasing awareness and efforts to counter the rapid deterioration in the physical property market nomura said citing government data that sales across 30 major cities were down 47 year on year in march natixis ng said more large developers especially state owned ones can buy land or acquire other real estate assets at cheaper prices now he noted the firm s analysis found that seven out of 10 land acquisitions year to date were by state owned enterprises in a sign that the private sector was still struggling earlier this month developer kaisa announced it entered a strategic cooperation with china merchants shekou industrial zone holdings and china great wall asset management both of which are state owned the agreement is set to include joint ventures and asset acquisitions a hong kong exchange filing showed outlook for developers despite the optimism the situation ahead for developers could deteriorate further according to analysts s p pointed out that so far the policy relaxation has applied to the demand side and not for supply of units supply may be limited even if homebuyer sentiment improves because funds are prioritized to complete presold homes and repay debt it said in a briefing last week defaults will rise as down cycle persists under the shadow of sluggish sales narrower funding channels due to lack of confidence the ratings agency said it believed that 20 developers are now facing a liquidity crunch and another 4 could be at risk under the joint venture model earlier this year several developers announced they would not be able to release financial results on time not for speculation despite news of more support for real estate ng said beijing s tone remains focused on preventing speculation in the once hot market which means home prices aren t going to increase that much as a result companies that once profited from surging home prices are going to need to adapt he said we will see developers not able to repay their debt the fundamental takeaway from recent developments is that china s policy toward property investment has changed the analysts said over the long term policy will be guided by the principle that housing is for living not speculation s p global said the new business models will at least to some degree need to fit that objective back in october eric xin managing director at citic capital said at an avcj investing conference in beijing that real estate will likely become a public utility so more people can afford housing in china that s why you see all the developers are in trouble because utilities should be dominated by soes said xin also managing partner at trustar capital it shouldn t be a big focus capital on the other hand capital

the conflict in ukraine and the sanctions on russia are having a major impact on the world s grain supplies which will dramatically raise the cost of food along with energy and debt the longer the fighting continues the war in ukraine in all its dimensions is producing alarming cascading effects to a world economy already battered by covid 19 and climate change with particularly dramatic impacts on developing countries according to an april 13 report pdf by the united nations conference on trade and development unctad recent projections by unctad estimate that the world economy will be a full percentage point of gdp growth lower than expected due to the war which is severely disrupting already tight food energy and financial markets if the spring planting season in ukraine is delayed for a few more weeks and the disruption of key regional exports is not addressed there will likely be long term consequences such as rising food shortages limited fertilizer supplies a major global recession and a restructuring of supply chain networks the ability to produce crops in ukraine right now and moving that production out of the region has been severely disrupted millions of ukrainians have fled from the agricultural regions due to the war causing a labor shortage land mines are also being planted in fields while freedom of movement is restricted in the conflict zones experts estimate that 50 percent of ukrainian wheat production and 25 percent of corn production is currently in the conflict zone this makes it hard for farmers to get their crops planted and even if they are harvested there would still be major logistical challenges to delivery international freight carriers are largely prohibited from sending ships into the black sea region while the insurance rates have skyrocketed there s a lot that we are not talking about in terms of the overall issues that can come from the ukrainian russian conflict particularly if it extends over a year two or three said richard kottmeyer of fti consulting inc at a april 14 webinar hosted by the american feed industry association afia if the war ended today we would have food inflation widely for three years he said that s significant as the war continues food inflation and the number of years continues to get worse the agricultural industry was already hurting from pandemic induced labor shortages and the eu s farm to fork strategy which is an attempt to reduce the environmental and predicted climate impact of food production the ukraine crisis added another layer of existing pressure to the market with food inflation likely to hit levels not seen in 20 plus years said kottmeyer together ukraine and russia provide around 30 percent of the world s wheat and barley around 20 percent of its maize and more than 50 percent of its sunflower oil the united states could increase exports of corn and wheat by 200 million bushels each but that would only make up 10 percent of the shortfall in wheat and about 17 percent of that in corn the major agricultural exporters based on current global wheat stocks will not be able to make up the deficits due to the loss of the ukrainian russian grain market corn shortages may possibly be covered but the margin to accomplish that is increasingly tighter kottmeyer said he believes that commodity prices will continue to rise with some analytical models showing corn at over 12 a bushel and a recession that will probably hit the eu which may lose up to 3 to 4 percent of its gdp this year russia is also the world s top natural gas exporter and the second largest exporter of crude oil russia and belarus which has also been sanctioned by the west contribute a combined total of about 20 percent of fertilizer exports most of the world s potash is from the region as well which is needed to make agricultural fertilizer it looks like russia and belarus are limiting shipment and production kottmeyer said explaining with limited supply europe is unlikely to get allocations india may be the most at risk for lack of fertilizer because they are some of the earliest to plant these disruptions will harm developing countries the most said the u n with the report warning of higher food prices leading to civil unrest it is feared that the war in ukraine may spark mass protests and action from groups looking to capitalize on the instability in affected countries the u n says as many as 1 7 billion people are highly exposed to the effects of the ukraine war and of those people 553 million are already poor with 215 million undernourished commodity prices are reaching record highs across the board partially due to the conflict said the u n report food prices are 34 percent higher than this time last year and have never been this high since started recording them similarly crude oil prices have increased by around 60 percent and gas and fertilizer prices have more than doubled food prices are 34 percent higher than this time last year and have never been this high since started recording them similarly crude oil prices have increased by around 60 percent and gas and fertilizer prices have more than doubled existing food inflation will get worse with the most severe pressure being placed in vulnerable regions like northern and west africa there is going to be a fight for supply for inputs for wheat for food between energy and grains he said there isn t a model i see where someone is not a loser the question is who loses and what do they lose kottmeyer said how are we going to define who is harmed by the scarcity without that definition it s going to be developing countries and we re going to go from one conflict to more conflicts he warned
chinese real estate developer bond prices have ticked higher as investor confidence gets a boost from policy support for the battered industry since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday but analysts point out beijing s emphasis that houses are for living in not speculation means the property market won t resume the high growth of the past the tide may be turning on china s battered real estate market investor confidence in the sector appears to be improving as bond trading volumes and prices rose in recent weeks in part boosted by the government s promise to support the sector and some loosening of policies but analysts say china s high growth property market may be a thing of the past set to be changed forever following the recent shakeup in the sector feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here s p global ratings said in an early april report that china s policy crackdown on its residential housing market has bottomed but that it will take several quarters for markets to feel the effects of the regulatory easing when china s residential market emerges from this correction it may be changed forever s p said we anticipate fewer developers will be able to employ the highly leveraged fast churn strategy that brought past success recent reports show that some cities and banks are willing to support real estate again after a plunge in home sales in the last few months since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday he also noted how covid had affected some people s income and their ability to pay mortgages on time the government s stance trying to prevent the contagion preventing the spillover from the real estate sector spillover to the real economy gary ng asia pacific economist at natixis told cnbc in a phone interview earlier this month any change in china s real estate industry has significant implications for the economy since property and related sectors account for roughly a quarter of gdp according to moody s the latest wave of covid restrictions has added pressure to growth that was already slowing the measures may have been too tight now we see this fine tuning of the policy ng said the worst time is over basically for those developers who are broadly in line with the current regulatory target or framework the problems of real estate developers in china came to a head after the authorities rolled out the so called three red lines policy in august 2020 aimed at reining in developers after years of growth fueled by excessive debt the policy places a limit on debt in relation to a firm s cash flows assets and capital levels while many developers reduced their debt levels accordingly a result of the policy was that banks became less willing to lend to the sector against this backdrop evergrande the world s most indebted developer fell into default for the first time late last year as the debt crisis unraveled other chinese developers also started showing signs of strain some missed interest payments while others defaulted on their debt altogether bond trading volumes up prices rise the bond issuance in asia s high yield bond market dominated by chinese real estate developers slumped in the first quarter of this year the region issued only 4 4 billion worth of debt about 85 lower than a year ago according to data from dealogic this was a result of chinese property developers largely being cut off from the bond market amid a growing number of stressed and distressed situations in the sector said dealogic however sentiment turned around slightly in mid march after china signaled support for its companies and indicated that authorities would work toward stability in its struggling real estate sector bond trading volumes in the real estate debt market jumped to nearly 700 million in mid march a nearly 20 increase from over 583 million traded in the beginning of the month according to data from electronic fixed income trading platform marketaxess by late march volumes increased further to cross 700 million before falling back slightly again in april bond prices also rose correspondingly the ice bofa asian dollar high yield corporate index has climbed more than 15 in the period between mid march to the beginning of april three provinces have also loosened their policies which include removing restrictions on home purchases for those without full local residency status and that should lift short term sentiment said nomura in a report on april 4 these policy relaxation measures are in line with our expectation and confirm the local governments increasing awareness and efforts to counter the rapid deterioration in the physical property market nomura said citing government data that sales across 30 major cities were down 47 year on year in march natixis ng said more large developers especially state owned ones can buy land or acquire other real estate assets at cheaper prices now he noted the firm s analysis found that seven out of 10 land acquisitions year to date were by state owned enterprises in a sign that the private sector was still struggling earlier this month developer kaisa announced it entered a strategic cooperation with china merchants shekou industrial zone holdings and china great wall asset management both of which are state owned the agreement is set to include joint ventures and asset acquisitions a hong kong exchange filing showed outlook for developers despite the optimism the situation ahead for developers could deteriorate further according to analysts s p pointed out that so far the policy relaxation has applied to the demand side and not for supply of units supply may be limited even if homebuyer sentiment improves because funds are prioritized to complete presold homes and repay debt it said in a briefing last week defaults will rise as down cycle persists under the shadow of sluggish sales narrower funding channels due to lack of confidence the ratings agency said it believed that 20 developers are now facing a liquidity crunch and another 4 could be at risk under the joint venture model earlier this year several developers announced they would not be able to release financial results on time not for speculation despite news of more support for real estate ng said beijing s tone remains focused on preventing speculation in the once hot market which means home prices aren t going to increase that much as a result companies that once profited from surging home prices are going to need to adapt he said we will see developers not able to repay their debt the fundamental takeaway from recent developments is that china s policy toward property investment has changed the analysts said over the long term policy will be guided by the principle that housing is for living not speculation s p global said the new business models will at least to some degree need to fit that objective back in october eric xin managing director at citic capital said at an avcj investing conference in beijing that real estate will likely become a public utility so more people can afford housing in china that s why you see all the developers are in trouble because utilities should be dominated by soes said xin also managing partner at trustar capital it shouldn t be a big focus capital on the other hand capital should go into innovation
by mary steurer casper star tribune via wyoming news exchange casper in jackson workers camp out in cars and tents in cheyenne hundreds commute from neighboring towns meanwhile laramie is struggling to attract new businesses wyoming public media reported last year all because of an affordable housing shortage lawmakers will look for solutions during this year s interim legislative session the interim session is the legislature s brainstorming period lawmakers meet to research dozens of issues affecting the state and blueprint bills to address them earlier this month the joint corporations elections and political subdivisions committee named workforce housing as its second highest priority for the interim it ll be new territory for lawmakers said rep dan zwonitzer r cheyenne co chair of the committee housing reform has had a fringe following in the wyoming legislature for years especially among teton county lawmakers for the most part though the state s left the matter to local governments and housing groups to sort out and they tried said brenda birkle head of cheyenne s affordable housing task force and executive director of my front door a nonprofit that helps first time home buyers it wasn t enough attempts to manage it elsewhere outside of the legislature have failed she said meanwhile the affordable housing shortage is only getting worse advocates and officials told the star tribune especially since the start of the coronavirus pandemic the committee s aim is twofold zwonitzer said figure out why and what can be done about it i don t think there s a clear end point of where we want to get to zwonitzer said it s really a survey of the field and what possibilities are before us the first task is nailing down the problem the committee will consult a variety of groups for help including housing advocates realtors and construction companies zwonitzer said what is workforce housing anyway housing organizations often use the term to mean housing for low or middle income workers especially those employed in major industries and essential services in teton county that d be housing for those tourism and hospitality jobs for instance some housing groups define workforce housing by income level instead in those cases the term usually refers to housing for people making around 50 to 120 of their community s area median income in teton county that s roughly 43 500 to 104 500 that same bracket in laramie county would be 33 500 to 80 400 according to data from the u s department of housing and urban development hud birkle s organization my front door primarily serves people who make a little less than that between 30 and 80 of the area median income that s around 26 100 to 69 600 in teton county and 20 073 to 53 528 in laramie county according to hud data while quality housing is often woefully out of reach for households in this bracket they make up a huge portion of the population birkle said helping them could have an enormous impact on stabilizing the workforce she said really if you want to break the poverty cycle permanently it s in that group she said so what about solutions birkle urged the committee to lean on nonprofits that work in workforce housing for help finding some direction dan dorsch special projects coordinator for habitat for humanity of laramie county recommended housing trust funds as a potential starting point dorsch also sits on cheyenne s affordable housing task force housing trust funds set aside pools of money for affordable housing programs there are a few different ways the state could pay for one dorsch explained federal programs are available through the national housing trust fund but they can be difficult to navigate and have a lot of red tape that smaller organizations don t have the capacity to access he said in an email local housing trust funds make it easier to access funds and can be used in conjunction with federal dollars he added dorsch pointed to iowa s state housing trust fund program as a potential model wyoming lawmakers have no shortage of their own ideas for addressing the housing shortage teton county delegates have long floated the so called mcmansion tax bill for example to prop up jackon s housing programs that legislation would let counties pull in extra cash by taxing high end real estate transfers the latest version of the bill which was sponsored by the joint revenue committee failed its introductory vote on the house floor in february shelly duncan r lingle spoke against the mcmansion tax during the 2022 legislative session duncan works in real estate and said the tax unfairly burdens commercial property owners and home buyers duncan who is a member of the corporations committee is in favor of creating a state agency to keep stock of housing needs and coordinate relief efforts in times of crisis we need to take a holistic look across the entire state she said it could also serve as wyoming s fair housing office duncan said wyoming is one of just a handful of states without an agency to enforce housing discrimination law let us know what you think 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
as a colombian american financial advisor catalina franco cicero sees why selecting a planner is often a puzzle for many immigrants who have come to her practice she said catalina franco cicero is a financial advisor with plantation florida based tobias financial advisors graciela valdes catalina franco cicero deciphering that for them is actually something that s very rewarding for me because i can definitely empathize with the challenge said franco cicero of plantation florida based tobias financial advisors they can sometimes be dismissed because they have an accent or sometimes people think if you re from a foreign country you don t have enough investable assets such red flags represent only one of the many tensions and complexities surrounding a prospective client s choice of a financial advisor according to more than a half dozen planners and other experts who shared their best tips on the topic with financial planning in their haste to deal with a pressing matter or leverage newly secured assets investors run the risk of placing their money in the hands of an advisor who doesn t suit their specific needs clashes with their personality or closely held values or might not even be looking out for their best interests without following steps recommended by experts many americans struggle with the decision so many people are either underserved or not served at all by their financial advisor said stephanie j h roberts of albany new york based haase family advisors at steward partners with the financial landscape and the changing taxes and what happens in investments everything moves so quickly that it s really hard to know what you don t know many investors have no advisor most americans do not hire any planners according to research firm cerulli associates which reported this month that 60 of u s adults don t work with an advisor to plan for retirement or manage their retirement nest eggs as would be expected the share gets smaller among clients with higher amounts of investable assets but a notable 35 of adults with at least 2 million said they don t have an advisor preferences toward self directed research and planning the perception of not having enough assets for an advisor and a belief that the fees simply aren t worth it are the most commonly cited reasons for not hiring one a degree of skepticism that a prospective client doesn t know how to find the right one or that advisors wouldn t improve portfolio performance or act in their best interest also constitute typical reasons for not hiring an advisor that does show up sometimes where people with the highest income think they re smarter than the average bear the most confident might not be the most competent said scott smith cerulli s director of advice relationships the problem here is that most investors aren t willing to make a lot of effort or willing to have a good framework to understand what they re looking for for starters investors may not even know where to begin their search even though an array of online tools could assist them the cfp board the national association of personal financial advisors the financial planning association the xy planning network changing how individuals prosper chip and the garrett planning network provide some of the most popular resources for beginning the quest or narrowing the field of advisors finra s brokercheck and the sec s investor gov display advisors registrations and regulatory histories in addition some startups are developing technology aimed at matchmaking at no cost to the investor with a questionnaire and a proprietary algorithm smartasset connects prospective clients to registered investment advisors based on characteristics such as location asset levels or openness to virtual service chief product officer aniket gune said in an email new incoming assets under management to the participating advisory firms reached 5 billion in 2019 10 billion in 2020 and 20 billion last year gune said our mission is to help consumers find the best financial advice he said our goal is to create better matches based on consumer attributes and experiences and our in house concierge team is extremely important and humanizes the matching process as they re the first point of contact after consumers complete our survey start with the f word several advisors told fp they open with prospects by explaining the importance of understanding how an advisor is paid and whether they are acting under a fiduciary duty some or all of the time the industry doesn t make things easy to understand when it comes to topics such as the difference between fee only planners who don t take commissions and are always held accountable to the fiduciary duty and fee based advisors who can receive commissions and are subject to it only when serving advisory accounts according to danika waddell of seattle based xena financial planning the sec has to a murky extent raised the standard of care for brokerage accounts from merely suitable recommendations to ones that are vaguely described as being in a client s best interest the fiduciary duty requires financial professionals to place a client s interest ahead of their own still fiduciary status in itself doesn t remove the risk of bad actors while acknowledging that those distinctions aren t necessarily bad or good depending on a client s situation and the particular advisor waddell said she commences any prospect calls with roughly a five minute discussion of industry classifications and business models it s confusing and overwhelming and that s for the people who work in the industry she said for people who aren t familiar with the terms and all of the fee structures it s really hard to understand the landscape comprehension of the financial advice landscape is the first subject that samuel deane of new york based deane wealth management brings up when asked how to pick an advisor as well he said the range of people calling themselves a financial advisor includes insurance agents money managers stock brokers and all kinds of other professionals so clients should ensure they re looking for full bore planning and speaking to a planner deane said you may have financial advisors who actually sell products said deane just understanding that and understanding how each of those people are compensated will help you understand who is going to provide you with actual advice versus selling you a product insurers have a lot of good well intentioned people and they ve traditionally been one of the only places that give black and brown advisors a chance to break into the industry according to advisor anna n jie konte of silver spring maryland based dare to dream financial planning regardless industry conflicts of interest can incentivize some bad behavior she said too many people walk into a relationship with a financial professional and don t understand how they re compensated n jie konte said i think that gets a lot of people in trouble finding a fit n jie konte and the other advisors who spoke with fp view a close relationship between the client and the planner as among the most important factors in the selection prospective clients should evaluate whether an advisor is listening closely to what they say and empathizing with them said luis rosa of pasadena california based build a better financial future this is a process that requires people to feel comfortable enough to be open and tell a complete stranger something that you might not have shared with anyone in the past rosa said clients ought to speak with at least four or five advisors before making their pick according to cedric edwards of garden ridge texas based edwards wealth consultants and stifel independent advisors he makes a point of remembering minute details that prospective clients share in their meetings and pointing out the contrast between planning for long term financial goals and just managing a person s portfolio edwards said financial advisor cedric edwards is the founder of garden ridge texas based edwards wealth consultants stifel financial when you re selecting that financial advisor you better have someone that s relationship building rather than treating you like a number he said i don t believe that the robo advisors are going to take my job my job is a relationship business my job has nothing to do with coming in to pick the hot stock in practice the relationship resembles that of a patient with their primary care doctor said franco cicero of tobias financial that s what makes the initial interactions so important if they didn t listen well or at all then you re not going to be comfortable working with them and they have no hope of delivering what you want and expect she said you should be able to tell them anything because you re basically becoming financially naked in front of your advisor you re not going to make a good team toward your financial success if you can t talk about the mistakes that you made prospective clients seeking to create a financial plan need to give themselves time and think beyond one or two individual stocks that seem attractive said roberts the way we approach it investments are the tip of the iceberg she said that doesn t happen overnight that s a long process a good process a deep process so you want to do it with someone you enjoy someone you trust and someone you deeply respect these days clients can come into the first meeting equipped with more knowledge about whether they re part of a practice s target niche for example deane works primarily with millennials from technology fields he said noting that his frequent social media posts writing and podcast appearances make that clear in advance through that conversation i think we re both assessing whether or not we re a good fit he said for the most part clients already know about my specialty they know about my expertise they know i m the son of immigrants because of the content that i put out too many people walk into a relationship with a financial professional and don t understand how they re compensated financial advisor anna n jie konte of dare to dream financial planning watch out for red flags a practice s area of focus and common experiences often prove decisive in figuring out whether an advisor may be the right one for a particular client n jie konte agrees for clients who want to share part of their income or earnings with family members or other loved ones any advisor who tells a first generation immigrant not to do so is raising a really big red flag she said you need to make sure that your advisor is respectful of your values or shares your values n jie konte said they often tell them don t do that stop doing that it s a very culturally tone deaf thing to say to edwards the most common red flags come from an advisor who drives a very expensive car and talks up the big earnings potential of their investment strategies without asking about a client s family he said edwards an air force veteran with more than two decades of experience as an advisor drives a honda accord that s a different type of relationship it truly is edwards said if they re driving the fanciest thing on the street do you really want to be supporting that habit another frequent red flag shows up among couples in which the advisor is only speaking with one spouse and leaving the other often the woman out of the conversation or out of the meeting entirely said rosa he notes the research suggesting that the vast majority of widows change advisors there are signs of women taking more control of their finances said roberts a large new client recently joined her practice because the husband is older than the wife and he knew that she would be comfortable with roberts team she said it s ok to not know and it s ok to get yourself educated and ask those questions we find that some of our female clients ask the best questions asking questions is their superpower and they should use it freely roberts said i m blown away by the younger generation and it s a nice sign to see waddell never hesitates to give prospective clients the names of two or three other advisors to interview as they make the important decision on who will be their planner ultimately i m not worried about giving someone a name and then they find a better fit to me that s a win win for everybody she said at the end of the day the conversations with prospective clients usually serve as a really good indicator on whether they could have a successful relationship with an advisor waddell said i encourage clients and prospective clients to ask as many questions as possible she said you might think it s annoying to have to interview five or six advisors but it s worth it to do the work up front for someone that you re going to work with for 30 years it is an overwhelming process unfortunately but i think it s worth it to take your time and be a little methodical with it

even though i knew that a new car is needed a long time ago my priorities were different bhpian randamoozham recently shared this with other enthusiasts before i jump in a little bit about myself believe me it will make sense once you finish the review i spend a lot of time before buying anything but when i do i intend to use it for a long time and sometimes till it wears out you must have understood that from the title of this article be it my scissors which i use for cutting my moustache it s with me for the last 28 years travelled with me from kerala to chennai mumbai bangalore raleigh atlanta and back to bangalore and still going good or my first smartphone which lasted for 5 years till it broke and second one already completed 5 years now you know why i had to spend a lot of time choosing the right car for me in the right budget i am a tall guy 184 cms 6 foot and 1 cm all the guys who are 180cms and calls themselves as 6 foot please bear with me way back in 2007 i did not have much choice when buying my wagon r vxi it was the perfect car for me then for a comfortable driving position even mahindra scorpio did not give me comfortable seating during those years even though i knew that a new car is needed a long time ago my priorities were different but it hit me when my younger one told me to move a little front since i always push the seat to the extreme back i knew that i can not wait anymore i was hesitant since my wagon r serves me well within the city and i am not a fan of driving a long distance i am hoping that tucson will change it coming from a 17 year old car i do not have much to compare it with tucson except the toyota camry i drove for 7 years when i was in the usa man how i miss my camry i asked for the price in india and it is 50l and did not even look back i landed on tucson gls 2wd diesel phantom black this is my third week and hitting 500km on the odometer likes elegant and classic design it is timeless and it grows on you handle puddle and corner lamps i find these lamps very useful automatic headlights and rain sensors yet to experience the automatic rain sensors though space in the back seat jeep disappointed me in this category my family thanks me every time they get in even if i push my seat to the extreme back they are comfortable very smooth drive did not feel the need for a paddle shift while driving or overtaking yet to go on a highway trip which i am planning pretty soon wireless charger my 5 year old s7 edge works well with this blue link i like the option of starting the car and keeping the ac on 5 mins before i arrive especially when the car is left in the sun parking sensors for the front and back last but not least i expect the car to have better safety measures since it is ckd once the localization starts you can expect issues and it will take a couple of years to sort it out dislikes ventilated seats are missing i loved the ventilated seats in some of the other cars while test driving which would be really helpful while driving during the day 360 degree camera i really miss this given the size of the car especially when you are cutting corners in crammed junctions wonder warranty hyundai withdrew the wonder warranty from feb 1 2022 there is a twist to the story details in the booking experience parking sensors do not get activated automatically at low speeds it works as designed by hyundai and works like a charm when i put the car in reverse i wish it automatically gets activated while the speed lowers to less than 10 km hr steering wheel i don t like the grip i feel like they are slippery and the placement of the horn android auto is not wireless which defeats the purpose of wireless charging one of my friends who owns a tiguan told me that it is better when it comes to google maps to get quick updates from phone to car blue link app throws an error that the door is not locked every time when i lock the car i need to refresh the app and then only it goes away not enough usb ports i see that there is only one port for usb charging if it is used for android auto you could not charge another phone utility spaces are not enough you can not keep a one litre bottle on the door panels and there is no provision to keep anything on the dash history here were my principles for buying a car never buy a car which is running like a taxi you lose the feel good aspect of owning the car thanks to my dear friend anil for instilling this in me always buy the top end i do not want to regret it later for few thousand it should be black i love the royal look of black always take the extended warranty for the period where the manufacturer allows you to thanks to my brother in law for this advice he learnt his lesson from his nissan terrano i test drove almost all suvs i thought about the octavia for a little but my wife was not for a sedan in the 20 40 lakhs range i called jeep skoda kia vw tata and hyundai on the same day i went to their corporate contact centres and they assigned the enquiry to dealers located near my home here are my impressions jeep compass i thought i will end up in jeep so i wanted to test drive this in the last but he showed up first i did not have much to expect but i feel that the sa was overconfident about the vehicle and did not try to explain the features properly to me but my family complained about the rear seat space i wanted a top end diesel and it comes only in 4wd which pushes the envelope to 37 lakhs hyundai tucson the lakshmi hyundai did not have a td vehicle so they brought a creta and i liked creta except for the 360 degree camera my wife and mother also loved the car but i did not want to be one of the millions of creta owners the sa was pushing for alcazar since the ventilated seats and 360 degree cameras are available in alcazar he also said the same engines are being used in tucson and why do you need to spend more money on tucson i also read about the arrival of new tucson so i decided to wait the sa offered 50k first but if i am ready to book he was ready to go up to a 75k discount hyundai alcazar i did not test drive the vehicle but took a look at it in lakshmi my family and i did not like the interiors i feel it is crammed with three rows it was ruled out volkswagen taigun liked the exterior but the moment i stepped in the seats looked cheap the brake nob and the manual seat adjustment surprised me after paying 23 lakhs i might get good build quality but i don t even get power seats after spending 23 l come on vw volkswagen tiguan had a brief test drive but rs 41 lakhs for petrol is not worth it for me skoda kushaq i had to call three to five times to get a td the exterior and the interior looked good i liked the car but i also heard the horror stories skoda recalls i wanted a diesel for those reasons i ruled out kushaq kia seltos seltos was my dream car two years ago since i started seeing seltos everywhere 2 million seltos in 2 years it lost the charm and i am bored with it i liked the td though the safety ratings for seltos also went against it in my books tata harrier good road presence but i could really feel the dragging rubber band effect in low gears and my wife from the rear seat asked me why the car is behaving like this there was a warning light and sound as i was finishing the test drive and the sa could not fix it tata is yet to perfect the art as far as i am concerned toyota innova i test drove the vehicle for the heck of it very comfortable suspension and is a no nonsense car i did not want to go for it for the same reason i do not want to buy a taxi car i started reading the tbhp again about the tucson new model but realized that their wont be any discounts plus the price would go north i wanted to do a test drive and wanted to shop around one saturday afternoon i called all dealers in bangalore and asked for a test drive for tucson diesel s top end only blue hyundai rajaji nagar offered a test drive on the same day and the sa shahabuddin came with the branch manager naveen to my home that was a good gesture on naveen s end to come home and he was serious about closing the deal straight away he offered a better discount and if i go with a starry night which they had in stock he was ready to give more discounts i asked for a couple of days to close the deal while trident came back with a better offer even lakshmi hyundai was ready to match the offers but the fact that naveen came to my home and took time to meet with me made me go with blue to my surprise naveen even bettered the deal and i closed the deal on the same day i should say that both shahabuddin and naveen were very helpful throughout the process and made me feel at home shahabuddin came home for the booking process naveen told me to book the car directly using hyundai click to buy website to block the phantom black colour since there were only two left in the plant during the negotiations naveen informed me that hml withdrew the wonder warranty but while booking the car i noticed that the wonder warranty is still available on the hml website as part of the tucson offers i brought it to the notice of naveen and he agreed to write to hml i took a screenshot of the same along with the date and shared it with naveen he told me that typically it will not be honoured since they closed the program in my mind well they should have updated the same on the website i booked the car online and i was told by their website that it is available as expected hml came back to naveen stating that the program is discontinued i did not want to leave it there and wrote to hml directly after a follow up no response from hml but i got a call from naveen offering me the 4th year extended warranty as complementary from the dealer end since hml puts the onus on the dealer to handle an unhappy customer effectively i had to pay only the 5th year extended warranty i went with the dealer insurance bumper to bumper basic accessories and an extended warranty of up to 5 years i feel an extended warranty is very important considering the cost especially this is a ckd of the car note different dealerships charge you different prices for the accessories blue charges only around 3k but lakshmi is charging around 6k please watch out for the on road price while you shop around i was told that it will take up to three weeks for the car to come but to my surprise the car came to the showroom in two days and i did the pdi registration was completed in a week s time and i took the delivery with the family the team at blue rajajinagar made us feel special with flowers cake and the ceremony i took the car straight to shell and filled the power diesel ppf and ceramic coating from krithi car care before i take the delivery of the car i had a discussion with krithi car care and took the advice of meena for the delivery she gave me some tips like i should ask the dealer not to do the machine polish or wax the car and leave the plastics in the car as is since ppf is a wet application typically the dealers use the same machine for polishing there would be swirls left on the car i was planning to do ppf in damage prone areas only but after a discussion with kp i decided to do the ppf for the entire body and ceramic coating complementary from them both meena and kp are very knowledgeable in detailing of cars and they give you the right advice on any matters related to the car even though i told my sa not to do any machine polishing they did the water washing and wiping off the car which left swirls on the body i was shocked to see swirls and scratches in the body when i took the car to krithi after two days of delivery kp from krithi consoled me stating that this is normal and he will take care of those before ppf is applied they took 4 days for the work and did an awesome job my experience with krithi was wonderful both meena and kp are knowledgeable in what they do and could give you good advice in maintaining the car note i thank kp and meena for convincing me to go for whole body ppf i already had my first scratch as you know the first scratch is always a scratch on your heart while parking the car my gate hit the car ppf saved the paint and it did the job which it was supposed to do it left a small dent but no issues with the paint kp s initial reaction was to leave it as it is but it was too much for me to take so he helped me to replace only the portion of the film you could very well make out a patch on the car but what to do i am yet to go for a long drive which is due i am planning for a trip to kodai and then to kerala more to come check out bhpian comments for more insights and information
chinese real estate developer bond prices have ticked higher as investor confidence gets a boost from policy support for the battered industry since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday but analysts point out beijing s emphasis that houses are for living in not speculation means the property market won t resume the high growth of the past the tide may be turning on china s battered real estate market investor confidence in the sector appears to be improving as bond trading volumes and prices rose in recent weeks in part boosted by the government s promise to support the sector and some loosening of policies but analysts say china s high growth property market may be a thing of the past set to be changed forever following the recent shakeup in the sector get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters s p global ratings said in an early april report that china s policy crackdown on its residential housing market has bottomed but that it will take several quarters for markets to feel the effects of the regulatory easing when china s residential market emerges from this correction it may be changed forever s p said we anticipate fewer developers will be able to employ the highly leveraged fast churn strategy that brought past success recent reports show that some cities and banks are willing to support real estate again after a plunge in home sales in the last few months since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday he also noted how covid had affected some people s income and their ability to pay mortgages on time the government s stance trying to prevent the contagion preventing the spillover from the real estate sector spillover to the real economy gary ng asia pacific economist at natixis told cnbc in a phone interview earlier this month any change in china s real estate industry has significant implications for the economy since property and related sectors account for roughly a quarter of gdp according to moody s the latest wave of covid restrictions has added pressure to growth that was already slowing the measures may have been too tight now we see this fine tuning of the policy ng said the worst time is over basically for those developers who are broadly in line with the current regulatory target or framework the problems of real estate developers in china came to a head after the authorities rolled out the so called three red lines policy in august 2020 aimed at reining in developers after years of growth fueled by excessive debt the policy places a limit on debt in relation to a firm s cash flows assets and capital levels while many developers reduced their debt levels accordingly a result of the policy was that banks became less willing to lend to the sector against this backdrop evergrande the world s most indebted developer fell into default for the first time late last year as the debt crisis unraveled other chinese developers also started showing signs of strain some missed interest payments while others defaulted on their debt altogether bond trading volumes up prices rise the bond issuance in asia s high yield bond market dominated by chinese real estate developers slumped in the first quarter of this year the region issued only 4 4 billion worth of debt about 85 lower than a year ago according to data from dealogic this was a result of chinese property developers largely being cut off from the bond market amid a growing number of stressed and distressed situations in the sector said dealogic however sentiment turned around slightly in mid march after china signaled support for its companies and indicated that authorities would work toward stability in its struggling real estate sector bond trading volumes in the real estate debt market jumped to nearly 700 million in mid march a nearly 20 increase from over 583 million traded in the beginning of the month according to data from electronic fixed income trading platform marketaxess by late march volumes increased further to cross 700 million before falling back slightly again in april bond prices also rose correspondingly the ice bofa asian dollar high yield corporate index has climbed more than 15 in the period between mid march to the beginning of april three provinces have also loosened their policies which include removing restrictions on home purchases for those without full local residency status and that should lift short term sentiment said nomura in a report on april 4 these policy relaxation measures are in line with our expectation and confirm the local governments increasing awareness and efforts to counter the rapid deterioration in the physical property market nomura said citing government data that sales across 30 major cities were down 47 year on year in march natixis ng said more large developers especially state owned ones can buy land or acquire other real estate assets at cheaper prices now he noted the firm s analysis found that seven out of 10 land acquisitions year to date were by state owned enterprises in a sign that the private sector was still struggling earlier this month developer kaisa announced it entered a strategic cooperation with china merchants shekou industrial zone holdings and china great wall asset management both of which are state owned the agreement is set to include joint ventures and asset acquisitions a hong kong exchange filing showed outlook for developers despite the optimism the situation ahead for developers could deteriorate further according to analysts s p pointed out that so far the policy relaxation has applied to the demand side and not for supply of units supply may be limited even if homebuyer sentiment improves because funds are prioritized to complete presold homes and repay debt it said in a briefing last week defaults will rise as down cycle persists under the shadow of sluggish sales narrower funding channels due to lack of confidence the ratings agency said it believed that 20 developers are now facing a liquidity crunch and another 4 could be at risk under the joint venture model earlier this year several developers announced they would not be able to release financial results on time not for speculation despite news of more support for real estate ng said beijing s tone remains focused on preventing speculation in the once hot market which means home prices aren t going to increase that much as a result companies that once profited from surging home prices are going to need to adapt he said we will see developers not able to repay their debt the fundamental takeaway from recent developments is that china s policy toward property investment has changed the analysts said over the long term policy will be guided by the principle that housing is for living not speculation s p global said the new business models will at least to some degree need to fit that objective back in october eric xin managing director at citic capital said at an avcj investing conference in beijing that real estate will likely become a public utility so more people can afford housing in china that s why you see all the developers are in trouble because utilities should be dominated by soes said xin also managing partner at trustar capital it shouldn t be a big focus capital on the other hand capital should go into innovation

devices made by corpower ocean eni spa eni bombora and wavepiston should hit european waters in 2022 trade eni spa eni cfd putting money into tidal tech fernando hernandez principal at hernandez analytica and business ambassador for scotland in the americas energy sector shared his thoughts with capital com said hernandez the intermittency of renewables became evident in 2021 which led to electricity price spikes in spain prompting government intervention and price protection this in turn elevates the need for tidal technologies to be developed and scaled to bolster grids as tidal can function when there is no wind or sun as is the case for wind farms and solar parks respectively in the realm of tidal technology orbital marine made significant advances when it launched a floating tidal system in 2021 the orbital o2 off the coast of orkney in the uk this system can generate an unprecedented 2mw hernandez further explained that the orbital o2 system can be installed not only along coastlines but also on rivers and can be repositioned at sea moreover the system uses a four point anchoring approach which reduces complexities and costs the aforementioned unlocks deployment opportunities for such tidal technology and the system s global scalability therefore it is not surprising that publicly traded technipfmc fti invested in orbital marine and is now a shareholder of the tidal company another company that is making similar advances at orkney via emec and which has a system that equally floats to generate renewable electricity is mocean energy will they be the next orbital marine in terms of attracting capital from a publicly traded company in closing the market might be on the cusp of increasing its impetus and investments in tidal trade technipfmc fti cfd is it a good time to invest in tidal energy simon johns managing editor of lubes n greases lng publishing told capital com from an environmental and sustainability perspective tidal energy technology looks like a worthy place to direct investment in europe especially tidal power ticks a lot of eu taxonomy regulation s boxes and so future proofing against regulations should be straightforward however dimitriadou noted that the ways of generating tidal energy still need more testing additionally the geographical location of particular countries favours more tidal energy generation than others due to significant tidal range the uk has recently communicated an increase in investment to tidal energy as part of the investment in renewables strategy while the ec has also stipulated tidal energy targets for 2025 and 2030 as well the above could mean investment in tidal energy by the private sector could be one of emerging opportunities particularly as the need for further alternative energy sources has become more paramount than ever however so far only small amounts of tidal energy have been generated globally while the investment required in technology and infrastructure is substantial dimitriadou said
chinese real estate developer bond prices have ticked higher as investor confidence gets a boost from policy support for the battered industry since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday but analysts point out beijing s emphasis that houses are for living in not speculation means the property market won t resume the high growth of the past the tide may be turning on china s battered real estate market investor confidence in the sector appears to be improving as bond trading volumes and prices rose in recent weeks in part boosted by the government s promise to support the sector and some loosening of policies but analysts say china s high growth property market may be a thing of the past set to be changed forever following the recent shakeup in the sector get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters s p global ratings said in an early april report that china s policy crackdown on its residential housing market has bottomed but that it will take several quarters for markets to feel the effects of the regulatory easing when china s residential market emerges from this correction it may be changed forever s p said we anticipate fewer developers will be able to employ the highly leveraged fast churn strategy that brought past success recent reports show that some cities and banks are willing to support real estate again after a plunge in home sales in the last few months since march due to weakening market demand banks in more than 100 cities in china have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points zou lan director of the people s bank of china s financial markets department told reporters thursday he also noted how covid had affected some people s income and their ability to pay mortgages on time the government s stance trying to prevent the contagion preventing the spillover from the real estate sector spillover to the real economy gary ng asia pacific economist at natixis told cnbc in a phone interview earlier this month any change in china s real estate industry has significant implications for the economy since property and related sectors account for roughly a quarter of gdp according to moody s the latest wave of covid restrictions has added pressure to growth that was already slowing the measures may have been too tight now we see this fine tuning of the policy ng said the worst time is over basically for those developers who are broadly in line with the current regulatory target or framework the problems of real estate developers in china came to a head after the authorities rolled out the so called three red lines policy in august 2020 aimed at reining in developers after years of growth fueled by excessive debt the policy places a limit on debt in relation to a firm s cash flows assets and capital levels while many developers reduced their debt levels accordingly a result of the policy was that banks became less willing to lend to the sector against this backdrop evergrande the world s most indebted developer fell into default for the first time late last year as the debt crisis unraveled other chinese developers also started showing signs of strain some missed interest payments while others defaulted on their debt altogether bond trading volumes up prices rise the bond issuance in asia s high yield bond market dominated by chinese real estate developers slumped in the first quarter of this year the region issued only 4 4 billion worth of debt about 85 lower than a year ago according to data from dealogic this was a result of chinese property developers largely being cut off from the bond market amid a growing number of stressed and distressed situations in the sector said dealogic however sentiment turned around slightly in mid march after china signaled support for its companies and indicated that authorities would work toward stability in its struggling real estate sector bond trading volumes in the real estate debt market jumped to nearly 700 million in mid march a nearly 20 increase from over 583 million traded in the beginning of the month according to data from electronic fixed income trading platform marketaxess by late march volumes increased further to cross 700 million before falling back slightly again in april bond prices also rose correspondingly the ice bofa asian dollar high yield corporate index has climbed more than 15 in the period between mid march to the beginning of april three provinces have also loosened their policies which include removing restrictions on home purchases for those without full local residency status and that should lift short term sentiment said nomura in a report on april 4 these policy relaxation measures are in line with our expectation and confirm the local governments increasing awareness and efforts to counter the rapid deterioration in the physical property market nomura said citing government data that sales across 30 major cities were down 47 year on year in march natixis ng said more large developers especially state owned ones can buy land or acquire other real estate assets at cheaper prices now he noted the firm s analysis found that seven out of 10 land acquisitions year to date were by state owned enterprises in a sign that the private sector was still struggling earlier this month developer kaisa announced it entered a strategic cooperation with china merchants shekou industrial zone holdings and china great wall asset management both of which are state owned the agreement is set to include joint ventures and asset acquisitions a hong kong exchange filing showed outlook for developers despite the optimism the situation ahead for developers could deteriorate further according to analysts s p pointed out that so far the policy relaxation has applied to the demand side and not for supply of units supply may be limited even if homebuyer sentiment improves because funds are prioritized to complete presold homes and repay debt it said in a briefing last week defaults will rise as down cycle persists under the shadow of sluggish sales narrower funding channels due to lack of confidence the ratings agency said it believed that 20 developers are now facing a liquidity crunch and another 4 could be at risk under the joint venture model earlier this year several developers announced they would not be able to release financial results on time not for speculation despite news of more support for real estate ng said beijing s tone remains focused on preventing speculation in the once hot market which means home prices aren t going to increase that much as a result companies that once profited from surging home prices are going to need to adapt he said we will see developers not able to repay their debt the fundamental takeaway from recent developments is that china s policy toward property investment has changed the analysts said over the long term policy will be guided by the principle that housing is for living not speculation s p global said the new business models will at least to some degree need to fit that objective back in october eric xin managing director at citic capital said at an avcj investing conference in beijing that real estate will likely become a public utility so more people can afford housing in china that s why you see all the developers are in trouble because utilities should be dominated by soes said xin also managing partner at trustar capital it shouldn t be a big focus capital on the other hand capital should go into innovation

non gaap measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable gaap measure and presented is presented in our earnings release at this time i would like to introduce you to your host for this call lakeland industries chief executive officer charlie roberson mr robertson the floor is yours charlie roberson chief executive officer thank you operator good afternoon and thank you all for joining us i m joined today by lakeland s chief operating and financial officer allen dillard as was highlighted in today s press release lakeland reported solid fourth quarter and strong full year preliminary results i m extremely proud of our team s efforts as we continue to position the company for success in the post pandemic era through continued pricing discipline investments in our sales and marketing functions and multiple operational capability enhancements and growth initiatives which together have broadened and strengthened our customer relationships positioning lakeland for continued above market growth going forward our revenue was 26 8 million for the fourth quarter and 118 4 million for the fiscal year importantly while these revenues has have declined on a quarter over quarter and year over year basis as expected the business has maintained its profitability in the face of multiple supply chain and inflationary constraints as evidenced by our ability to deliver gross margin performance this quarter that was largely in line with our long term stated goal of greater than 40 this achievement was noteworthy as several onetime items held back our performance in the quarter including what we regard as higher near term expenses that could reverse in the future such as elevated freight costs 10 stocks we like better than lakeland industries when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and lakeland industries wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of april 7 2022 we believe that higher cost of goods sold cogs due to manufacturing curtailments are behind us and that freight costs and sales revenue will improve going forward together manufacturing curtailment in our vietnam facility and increased freight costs added approximately 600 000 to cost of goods sold for the quarter additionally the natural effect that lower revenues present to the maintenance of margins tested the flexibility and durability of our new model gross margin was 39 2 for the fourth quarter and 43 for the fiscal year our performance for the year and in particular during the fourth quarter demonstrate the steps we have taken to underwrite our margin capability and sustain profitability at a higher level compared to prior periods at similar demand and revenue levels importantly we believe the revenue level in the fourth quarter provides a new base level for the company in terms of revenue from which we expect to grow going forward additionally these results highlight the successful execution of our business plan put in place before the onset of the covid 19 pandemic like many areas across the u s economy and the world this pandemic accelerated trends that were already in place for lakeland this translated into expediting the execution of our business plan bringing forward the benefits of the plan we set in motion several years ago with covid related spikes in demands having largely dissipated despite the occasional small boost following variant waves we are confident that our fourth quarter results can serve as a baseline for revenue and profitability in the post pandemic era further we expect to be able to grow these results at or above market trend growth rate on average by around 100 to 200 basis points per year due to key aspects of our strategy and positioning including our manufacturing footprint capabilities product focus customer service performance and financial strength it is also worth noting that while several of our end markets and customers have experienced a return to pre covid demand levels order rates from the majority of our end markets and customers including those in our important industrial markets remain below pandemic levels however we are beginning to see customer activity return in these markets and expect order trends from these customers to match pre covid levels soon and resume growth from there for example our oil and gas business which represents approximately 15 of our industrial revenues still remains meaningfully below pre covid levels though rebounding from lower levels seen during the pandemic as is the case with all other business segments there are near term complicating factors including necessary shifts in refinery crude supply arrangements due to developments related to the russian war in ukraine affecting refinery operating rates and turnaround activities in the u s more specifically refineries in the u s are set up with certain feedstocks in mind namely sweet or sour crude that are associated with certain reservoirs or countries from which they establish oil supply arrangements shifting or changing a specific refinery s crude source can be accommodated but these facilities need to be retrofitted for another fuel source which can t be done overnight with that said these are capital intensive facilities that will not be left idle or run at greatly reduced operating rates for long and thus we don t expect these interruptions to last long as new supply chain logistics are already being established in these markets in fact we are now beginning to see some turnaround activity in europe other industrial end markets include electric utilities and transportation are similarly recovering and we are optimistic about a return to growth in these markets in fiscal 2023 our collective team has been superb in helping us navigate persistent supply chain constraints and raw material cost inflation particularly as it relates to freight costs and delays we have successfully offset these headwinds through the use of geographically diverse in house manufacturing forward contracting of raw materials purchases and strategic inventory management we also executed on direct price pass throughs during the quarter and year which helped offset inflationary cost pressures and allowed us to maintain solid gross profit margins lakeland is able to successfully execute on these pricing measures due to the inelastic nature of demand for our goods relative to changes in price as our customers emphasize customer service quality and availability said differently lakeland is able to deliver quality products on a consistent and timely basis which trumps pricing discussion in our end markets we attribute our fiscal year 22 estimated retention rate of 51 for the approximately 500 new customers acquired during fiscal year 21 as a result of our covid response strategy to the importance of product availability over price as we look to fiscal 2023 and beyond and with the pandemic related demand surge already having run its course i d like to provide our investors with the company s long term strategic goals for the next several years which will guide our business model going forward over a three to five year period we expect to produce mid to high single digit growth on average annually in our core markets gross margin levels in the low 40s and ebitda margin levels in the high teens to low 20s leading to strong and growing levels of free cash flow generation to further support our growth plans and priorities over the long term underlying growth in our markets is projected to be at a mid single digit rate over the next decade and thus we expect to be able to outgrow the market by around 100 to 200 basis points per year this is the first time we are providing these long term targets publicly which speaks to the progress we have made as a company over the past several years and the realization of important components of our growth and performance initiatives i have highlighted earlier in summary lakeland is running well and is more focused agile company as a direct result of our strategic initiatives put in place by our new management team over the past several years investments in centralized integrated data systems manufacturing footprint expansion and a renewed focus on product mix has translated to a significantly higher and sustainable margin profile for the business we are confident in our future growth are well positioned to respond to geopolitical uncertainty and believe fiscal 2023 is shaping up to be the year where we showcased the company s growth potential and earning sustainability in the post covid era that concludes my remarks i ll now pass the call to allen to provide more insight into the company s operations and financial results allen allen dillard chief operating and chief financial officer thanks charlie and good afternoon everyone as charlie mentioned in his comments covid related demand surges were largely absent from our fourth quarter results however while we are confident that the pandemic overhang is behind us we have not yet seen a full return of pre covid levels of demand across some of our key market areas such as oil and gas and more broadly within the industrial disposables market due to distribution channel overstocking which is now showing signs of dissipating based on recent order size and frequency and affected markets on a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 domestic sales were 11 2 million or 42 of total revenues and international sales were 15 6 million or 58 of total revenues this compares with domestic sales of 16 million or 43 of the total and international sales of 20 9 million or 57 of the total in the same period of fiscal 2021 in terms of product mix for the quarter we saw disposables decrease to 52 6 of sales without the covid surge demand while chemical fire and our utility lines were increased as we are beginning to see customer activity increase in these areas as it relates to broader inventory corrections we believe distribution channel inventory levels are continuing to correct themselves and that sales have largely returned to normal rates in the u s and europe as evidenced by larger orders coming from our distributors further signaling that overstock inventory levels are dissipating as was the case in previous quarters efforts to improve our gross margin profile has shown durability which we expect will prove sustainable there are several key aspects to our business strategy we have successfully executed during the pandemic key components of which are a greater discipline around pricing a focus on quality product mix and sku rationalization customer service and reliability as well as product availability and investing in our manufacturing and supply chain capabilities as a result gross profit as a percent of net sales was 39 2 for the fiscal 2022 forth quarter an impressive achievement set against a 27 year over year decline in revenues fiscal fourth quarter revenues on an annualized basis put us back in line with where lakeland s business stood prior to the arrival of the covid 19 pandemic as charlie and i have already indicated our read on near term order activity including inventory levels is that the covid 19 boost to our sales has largely been taken out of our ongoing results at this point while gross margin fell modestly compared to 42 1 for the fiscal 2022 third quarter and were down compared to 48 5 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the performance this quarter demonstrated our conviction in having rebased the margin profile and earnings potential of this business as we exit this period as charlie indicated earlier gross margins in the fourth quarter were impacted by lower sales increased freight cost and isolated short term curtailments in our vietnam manufacturing facility due to covid related absenteeism and inventory management strategies our vietnam facility is currently operating at normal capacity lakeland reported operating profit of 1 1 million in q4 2022 down from 4 1 million in q3 2022 and 9 1 million in the prior year period negative operating leverage from lower revenues versus the prior period as well as higher incentive compensation expenses were the largest contributors to the drop in operating profits year over year as a result operating margins were 4 2 in the fourth quarter 2022 compared to 14 1 for the three months ended october 31 2021 and down from 24 5 and for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year net income of 500 000 or 0 06 per basic common share decreased from 2 9 million or 0 37 per common share in the third quarter of 2022 and was down from 7 7 million or 0 97 per share in fourth quarter of fiscal 21 capital expenditures for the quarter were 183 000 bringing year to date spending to almost 800 000 this figure compares to spending last year of 1 7 million the majority of our spending this year was spent on technology infrastructure to further extend these solutions to the balance of our global business and to enhance strategic manufacturing capacities moving to the balance sheet working capital was 108 6 million at january 31 2022 compared to 111 million at october 31 2021 and up from 107 2 million at the end of the fiscal year 2021 the company s current ratio at the end of the fourth quarter improved to 12 8 1 from 9 0 1 at the end of the third quarter and 9 4 1 at the end of fiscal 2021 our cash balance was 52 7 million at january 31 as compared to 52 6 million at the beginning of the fiscal year the company continued to have no debt at the end of the fiscal year and has up to 12 5 million available from bank credit facilities with an additional 5 million accordion credit facility available during the fiscal 2022 forth quarter the company repurchased 3 3 million or just over 159 000 shares of common stock under its repurchase program total shares repurchased for the fiscal year totaled 430 463 shares at a total cost of 9 2 million also as was highlighted in a press release last week subsequent to quarter end our board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 5 million this new program will become effective upon exhaustion of the current program which has approximately 800 000 remaining for repurchases this decision ultimately reaffirms our confidence in the company s growth profile and showcases our commitment to optimizing shareholder value in closing and as charlie already alluded to we remain committed to making investments in our global technology platforms expanding our manufacturing footprint and ultimately positioning lakeland for sustainable long term growth substantial investments in mexico and asia are just a couple of the projects that are well underway low in cost and accretive to gross margins ultimately these investments and operating enhancements coupled with a return to normalized demand in the post pandemic era give us confidence that we will drive profitability and value for our shareholders with that overview i d now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions questions answers operator thank you and the first question is coming from alex furman with craig hallum capital group your line is live alex fuhrman craig hallum capital group analyst great thanks very much for taking my question first i wanted to ask about the results in the fourth quarter it seems like revenue was a little bit less than we were looking for i m curious if that was your read as well and if that s the case where specifically was that coming from i know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the covid related demand is mostly dried up i mean has there been a kind of a mismatch of just the timing of the industrial recovery maybe being a little bit slower than what had been expected anything you can kind of give us to help size us size up the fourth quarter demand and kind of what that looks like now heading into the first quarter would be really helpful charlie roberson chief executive officer sure alex while it s not the industrial demand in general is still depressed there is one single subset of the industrial market that would have close the gap entirely had it come back to its full force and that s the oil and gas business if we take that alone at a 15 rate and at it back in we re back to where we think we ought to be and unfortunately as we were looking forward at what our revenue run rate would be we did not foresee the russia ukraine war alex fuhrman craig hallum capital group analyst yes that makes a lot of sense and then charlie can you talk a little bit about these three to five year goals that you re unveiling here looks like kind of getting to a high teens to low 20s ebitda margin would certainly be one of the highlights of those goals can you kind of talk about the path you see of kind of getting there over the next three to five years just the numbers that you just reported here i mean you re already pretty close there with kind of a 15 ebitda margin so is it your goal to be in that high teens to low 20s range for each year within the next three to five or is that kind of where you d like to end up four or five years from now allen dillard chief operating and chief financial officer yes it is where we want to attain that goal as quickly as possible alex the best i can say about where we are now and where we re going is with the scalability or the leverage in our business i think we re at the low end of our leverage right now if we meet our growth objectives to outperform the market by a couple of hundred basis points per year i think we get there relatively quickly i don t think it takes us five years but that s why we ve got the three to five year span in there does that answer your question alex fuhrman craig hallum capital group analyst yes yes that does thank you and then lastly i guess just thinking about the different regions in which you operate i know you mentioned some have been coming back faster than others are there any key regions that you re kind of looking at this year that could kind of make or break the year any kind of key developments in terms of the economic recovery that we should be looking out for as it relates to your business charlie roberson chief executive officer well the single largest piece for us is the u s and the north american market and that is where the bulk of our oil and gas business resides so that s key for us we re focusing on growing other areas we re not just waiting for oil and gas to return we re focusing on our utilities business that vertical and our critical environment verticals trying to replace some of that while we wait for that market to recover and as i mentioned in my remarks given where oil and gas is the gulf coast refineries are currently looking to replace feedstocks that s not going to go on forever but it doesn t make sense to turn around a refinery when you don t have any feedstock for it so once they identify a new source because the gulf coast largely uses russian oil the no 1 replacements for which are venezuelan and iranian oil so that explains part of that in the news once they find a new feedstock we anticipate they ll have to change their operations to accommodate the new source of the crude oil and that s when they ll begin executing turnaround alex fuhrman craig hallum capital group analyst ok that is really helpful thank you operator we have no further questions in queue charlie roberson chief executive officer thank you all for joining today s call we re excited about the future of lakeland and truly believe we are building a company positioned to deliver sustainable long term growth and profitability have a great day operator duration 27 minutes call participants charlie roberson chief executive officer allen dillard chief

the ridiculous claim that israel is guilty of committing an actual genocide in gaza is just a hamas talking point that leftists have sadly parroted the latest one being massachusetts senator elizabeth warren in a video that was posted to social media by a reporter for boston based gbh the serial exaggerator was seen telling a crowd at a local islamic center that she agreed that the jewish nation was guilty of the wholesale liquidation of the palestinian people a blatant falsehood that has been repeated ever since israel retaliated against the terrorists that slaughtered over 1 200 of its citizens last year warren who was fondly dubbed pocahontas by former president donald j trump for overstating her indian heritage to curry favor in academia at the expense of real native americans served up her latest double decker whopper on friday in response to a question at the islamic center of boston at a q a at a wayland mosque last week senwarren is asked if she thinks that israel is committing a genocide if you want to do it as an application of law i believe that they will find that it is genocide she says adding that she s trying to get past a labels argument pic twitter com mxqbp6otlh tori bedford tori_bedford april 8 2024 do you think that israel is committing genocide warren was asked by a female audience member at first the progressive firebrand tried to dodge a direct answer responding so what s happened now is there s going to be a long and involved debate over what constitutes genocide when you ask a legal question for me it is far more important to say what israel is doing is wrong she continued accusing israel of starving children and imposing its will on a civilian population it is wrong to drop 2 000 pound bombs in densely populated civilian areas warren s droning on wasn t acceptable to the crowd who demanded a yes or no answer if you want to do it as an application of law i believe that they ll find that it is genocide and they have ample evidence to do so the senator replied the first member of the upper chamber to openly use the g word against israel a rhetorical escalation pocahontas was referring to the international court of justice another one of the globalist israel hating bodies that have sided with the terrorists since day one of israel s military response to the barbaric october 7 2023 sneak attack on civilians in january the icj found it to be plausible that israel is committing genocide in gaza likely not expecting that her casual tossing about of the g word would end up on social media warren s office released a statement that seems to be a tepid attempt at damage control in a q a senator warren commented on the ongoing legal process at the international court of justice not sharing her views on whether genocide is occurring in gaza the statement read in january the icj found that it is plausible that israel has committed acts that violate the geneva convention as the senator said at the mosque what is far more important than any label that comes out of this legal process is the question of whether it should be the policy of the united states to support israel s actions in gaza the spokesperson for the senator added on tuesday defense secretary lloyd austin rejected warren s accusation saying that the u s doesn t have any evidence of genocide after pro hamas protesters interrupted a senate armed services committee hearing where he was speaking

stay and other travel developments cnn the us centers for disease control and prevention unveiled its new system for travel risk assessments on monday many european nations are now considered at high risk for covid 19 along with other marquee destinations around the world the new system places destinations into the following categories level 3 high risk for covid 19 level 2 moderate risk for covid 19 level 1 low risk for covid 19 unknown not enough data to assess risk the big change comes at level 4 which was regularly used for places considered very high risk for travelers level 4 will no longer be routinely used for that purpose instead a level 4 notice is reserved in the new system for only special circumstances those circumstances include extremely high case counts emergence of a new variant of concern or healthcare infrastructure collapse the cdc said other factors that may be considered include information such as vaccination rate and hospitalization rate the cdc did not assign any destinations to level 4 special circumstances do not travel on its travel recommendations website page on monday levels 3 2 and 1 will still be primarily determined by the previous formula of 28 day incidence or case counts the overhaul comes against a backdrop of us government agencies and the public continuing to react and adapt to an ever changing pandemic and sometimes in sharp disagreement on monday a federal judge in florida struck down the biden administration s mask mandate for airplanes and other public transport methods and a biden administration official says the order is no longer in effect while the ruling is reviewed cdc s level 3 traditional colorful asian fishing boats can be spotted on langkawi island in malaysia currently at level 3 vasilygureev adobe stock in the new system the level 3 high risk category applies to destinations that have had more than 100 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days among the countries in level 3 is france which was the most visited country in the world in 2019 before the pandemic according to the un s world tourism organization but other stalwarts of the european travel scene are in the high risk category too on april 18 they included germany greece ireland italy portugal spain united kingdom it s not just european favorites that find themselves on this rebooted list other popular travel spots around the world also at level 3 include brazil canada egypt malaysia mexico south korea thailand in all there were just over 120 destinations at level 3 late monday afternoon the cdc reports on roughly 235 places total the cdc advises that you be up to date with your covid 19 vaccines before traveling to a level 3 destination up to date includes not only the full initial vaccinations but any boosters for which you re eligible the cdc does not include the united states in its list of advisories level 2 mi teleferico is an aerial cable car in the city of la paz bolivia this south american country is at level 2 saiko3p adobe stock destinations carrying the level 2 covid 19 moderate designation report 50 to 100 covid 19 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days it had only 11 entries on monday scattered in spots around the globe the most notable names were bolivia peru south africa sri lanka turks and caicos islands you can view the cdc s risk levels for any global destination on its travel recommendations page in its broader travel guidance the cdc has recommended avoiding all international travel until you are fully vaccinated if you re concerned about a health situation not related to covid 19 check here level 1 looking for a nation currently at level 1 consider kenya here elephants roam in front of mount kilimanjaro at amboseli national park dan adobe stock this level is dominated by destinations in africa and had almost 55 entries in the first week under the new system to be in level 1 covid 19 low a destination must have 49 or fewer new cases per 100 000 residents over the past 28 days some of the noteworthy places include colombia dominican republic india jamaica kenya philippines senegal unknown finally there are destinations for which the cdc has an unknown risk because of a lack of information usually but not always these are small remote places or places with ongoing warfare or unrest the azores cambodia and nicaragua are among the locations currently listed in the unknown category the cdc advises against travel to these places precisely because the risks are unknown a medical expert weighs in on risk levels transmission rates are one guidepost for travelers personal risk calculations according to cnn medical analyst dr leana wen we ve moved into a phase in the pandemic where people need to make their own decisions based on their medical circumstances as well as their risk tolerance when it comes to contracting covid 19 said wen who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the george washington university milken institute school of public health some people will decide the risk is too high for them in the higher categories wen said other people will say because i am vaccinated and boosted i am willing to take on that risk so this really needs to be a personal decision that people weigh understanding that right now the cdc is classifying the different levels based on community transmission rates and basically only that wen said they re not taking into account individual circumstances more considerations for travel there are other factors to weigh in addition to transmission rates according to wen the transmission rates are one guidepost wen said another is what precautions are required and followed in the place that you re going and then the third is what are you planning to do once you re there are you planning to visit a lot of attractions and go to indoor bars that s very different from you re going somewhere where you re planning to lie on the beach all day and not interact with anyone else that s very different those are very different levels of risk vaccination is the most significant safety factor for travel since unvaccinated travelers are more likely to become ill and transmit covid 19 to others wen said and it s also important to consider what you would do if you end up testing positive away from home where will you stay and how easy will it be to get a test to return home
