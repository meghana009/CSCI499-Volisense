screening activities we are encouraged by the clinical data presented at the 2021 american academy of pediatrics national conference exhibition and are excited to continue to support cyprium s efforts to advance cutx 101 through nda approval as we parallel significant efforts in disease awareness education and newborn screening these developments support the group s ongoing endeavor to address unmet healthcare needs said matthew heck president and chief executive officer of sentynl about menkes disease menkes disease is a rare x linked recessive pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of copper transporter atp7a the minimum birth prevalence for menkes disease is believed to be 1 in 34 810 live male births and potentially as high as 1 in 8 664 live male births based on recent genome based ascertainment kaler sg ferreira cr yam ls estimated birth prevalence of menkes disease and atp7a related disorders based on the genome aggregation database gnomad molecular genetics and metabolism reports 2020 june 5 24 100602 the condition is characterized by distinctive clinical features including sparse and depigmented hair kinky hair connective tissue problems and severe neurological symptoms such as seizures hypotonia failure to thrive and neurodevelopmental delays mortality is high in untreated menkes disease with many patients dying before the age of three years old milder versions of atp7a mutations are associated with other conditions including occipital horn syndrome and atp7a related distal motor neuropathy currently there is no fda approved treatment for menkes disease and its variants about cutx 101 copper histidinate cutx 101 is in clinical development to treat patients with menkes disease cutx 101 is a subcutaneous injectable formulation of copper histidinate manufactured under current good manufacturing practice cgmp and physiological ph in a phase 1 2 clinical trial conducted by stephen g kaler m d m p h at the national institutes of health

release and referred to herein was prepared in accordance with ni 43 101 which differs significantly from the requirements of the u s securities and exchange commission the sec the terms proven mineral reserve probable mineral reserve and mineral reserves used in this news release are in reference to the mining terms defined in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards the cim definition standards which definitions have been adopted by ni 43 101 accordingly information contained in this news release providing descriptions of our mineral deposits in accordance with ni 43 101 may not be comparable to similar information made public by other u s companies subject to the united states federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves pursuant to cim definition standards inferred mineral resources are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity an inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve however it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations however the sec normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves by sec standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures canadian standards including the cim definition standards and ni 43 101 differ significantly from standards in the sec industry guide 7 effective february 25 2019 the sec adopted new mining disclosure rules under subpart 1300 of regulation s k of the united states securities act of 1933 as amended the sec modernization rules with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec modernization rules replace the historical property disclosure requirements included in sec industry guide 7 as a result of the adoption of the sec modernization rules the sec now recognizes estimates of measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources in addition the sec has amended its definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves to be substantially similar to corresponding definitions under the cim definition standards during the period leading up to the compliance date of the sec modernization rules information regarding mineral resources or reserves contained or referenced in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report according to u s standards while the sec modernization rules are purported to be substantially similar to the cim definition standards readers are cautioned that there are differences between the sec modernization rules and the cim definitions standards accordingly there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the company may report as proven mineral reserves probable mineral reserves measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under ni 43 101 would be the same had the company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the sec modernization rules view original content to

this article is more than 2 years old forbes a case of buy the rumor sell the news appears to be all the rage in chicago home to the chicago mercantile exchange group cme group cme the world s largest regulated futures and options exchange the rumor in question has been around for weeks and posits that the u s securities and exchange commission sec may agree to approve the creation of bitcoin etfs if the latter use btc futures contracts as collateral rather than spot bitcoin which brings us to the sudden rally in money deposited in bitcoin futures open interest oi contracts since early september think of open interest as the money investors tie up to support the bets on market activity cme data shows that as of october 12 there were 10 918 contracts in btc futures oi a boost of 72 over a six week period while the contracts had been in the red since mid february they are now in the black relative to where it started the year as a recent forbes report indicated a relatively small number of commercial traders are playing a key role on the demand side reflected in the rising cme bitcoin futures oi while the identity of these firms is protected by both the cme and by the cftc reporting protocol the manner in which they are tagged within cftc commitments of traders report suggests they are corporations and non us financial institutions with deep industry insight click here to subscribe to the forbes cryptoasset blockchain advisor this is also an indication they are sufficiently sophisticated to venture into the futures market and are flush with capital to do so in large dollar amounts each btc futures contract is worth five bitcoins equivalent to approximately 287 625 at the prevailing bitcoin price also in recent weeks hedge funds have provided liquidity think of liquidity as the money required to find a seller for every buyer per cme group trading rules the identity of trading groups involved in the 72 surge from october 5 to october 12 will only be known on sunday when the cftc releases the new cot report but what was known as of tuesday night is that the weekly increase in btc futures oi was above 2 000 contracts a very high level of weekly change forbes this surge in cme crypto futures isn t likely a blip the value of all crypto futures oi broke into record territory on october 5 at 3 3 billion meaning it s already higher than in april when bitcoin was trading at its 64 900 all time record in other words there s very little reason for this much capital being tied up unless these savvy cme futures investors expected a major positive development before the contract expires one likely explanation is they expect a bitcoin etf approval soon cme futures has been known to signal major change and by the looks of it it may have already started changes ahead the significance of bitcoin futures supporting btc etfs cannot be overstated viable bitcoin etf applications relying on btc futures include those by proshares invesco ltd ivz vaneck valkyrie digital assets and galaxy digital if one of these or any other is approved other big asset managers like fidelity and vanguard will want to package their own version of btc etfs and btc mutual funds said differently there would be a race for scale among asset managers to see which of them gets the lion s share of massive institutional bitcoin inflows likewise investors will be able to easily get bitcoin or crypto exposure from the convenience of their 401k and ira accounts without having to open a crypto exchange account this will in turn let stock exchanges like the cboe nasdaq ndaq and nyse rake in btc etf trading fees banks won t want to be left behind and they will do what they do best keep a large inventory of tradable assets in this case bitcoin or bitcoin futures to support the trading activities of large clients but of course the denouement of this story involves the sec and its new chairman gary gensler someone who quashed retail speculative activities in currency markets while at the helm of the cftc and may soon disappoint bitcoin etf fans time will tell what ultimately happens but the stakes are high and something genuinely big seems to be cooking follow me on or check out some of my other work twitter or linkedin some of my other work here

s tudy philosophy at sussex university and in your first year you may read john locke the enlightenment thinker is celebrated today for his letter concerning toleration in which he argued that to compel men by fire and sword to profess certain doctrines was not only immoral but pointless the only true persuasion is the inward persuasion of the mind if the students and staff denouncing kathleen stock a professor in the philosophy department are familiar with locke s argument they seem unmoved by it listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element since term began protesters in balaclavas and masks have been denouncing professor stock s transphobia they have let off flares next to signs saying stock out and put up posters reading we re not paying 9 250 a year for transphobia fire kathleen stock one group stated that our demand is simple fire kathleen stock until then you ll see us around police have advised her to install cctv cameras at home and implied that she may need security guards to return to campus for years a debate has rumbled over whether there is a problem with free speech in british universities those who say there is not deny that cancel culture is a real thing and regard those who disagree with them wherever they sit on the political spectrum as reactionaries borrowing talking points from the american right their opponents point out that silencing is by its nature hard to detect silence doesn t make much noise for them professor stock is not merely a persecuted woman she is proof personified as any good academic would point out one is a poor sample size but there is other evidence that free speech is at risk in british universities a report by the university and college union ucu in 2017 ranked britain 27th out of the then 28 members of the european union for the legal protection of academic freedom a study from policy exchange a right leaning think tank found that 32 of academics who identified as politically right leaning and 15 of those who identified as centrist practised self censorship speak to academics and many will tell you that there is a problem and tell you not to quote them few academics generally a leftie lot will shed many tears over the silencing of more right wing colleagues what makes professor stock s case so illustrative then is that her credentials liberal lesbian feminist obe are so impeccable and her claims so vanilla she is being vilified because she has said and written in a recent book material girls that biological sex exists and should in some circumstances take precedence over self declared gender identity and that therefore some female only spaces women s changing rooms sports prisons should be off limits to trans women that is males who identify as women that accords closely with most britons opinions and with british law but activists who oppose her argue that such views should not be taught uncritically in universities lecturers might teach biological sex as a historical artefact says one just as they would teach that people used to believe toxic things about the priority of white people but just as universities would not teach eugenics so the immutable binary nature of sex should not be promoted as an ideology that is real explore more summer reads beyond middle age people tend to get happier as

summer holiday to believe that biology is bunkum may be novel but students have always been a rum bunch in the 19th century they set fire to effigies to protest against degrees for women in the 20th they embraced communism but when students turned trot vice chancellors did not don boilersuits and salute their comrades modern academia has been less stalwart in january more than 600 academics signed an open letter protesting against professor stock being awarded an obe rather than condemning the attacks against her the sussex branch of the ucu urged a university wide investigation into institutional transphobia and warned that appeals to both employment rights and academic freedom are often instrumentlised in other words used as cover for bigotry shereen benjamin a sociologist at edinburgh university has long suffered harassment for similar views in 2019 when students who agree with her put up stickers around campus saying that female is a biological reality the principal called them offensive and said those responsible would be disciplined just how much dissenting views are being stifled on campus was thrown into sharp relief last year when cambridge university tried to change its policy on freedom of speech to demand that staff be respectful of the differing opinions of others arif ahmed a philosophy lecturer objected saying that not all views are equally deserving of respect he wanted respect amended to tolerate to have his amendment voted upon he needed 25 academics signatures he struggled to get them despite approaching more than 100 people many said they backed him privately but would not do so publicly they feared for jobs promotions and contracts eventually he succeeded and when votes were cast in late 2020 86 9 were in favour of changing respect to tolerate with hindsight that may have been the moment when the tide turned against campus silencing after the sussex row started to make the headlines lady falkner a cross bench peer who is head of the equality and human rights commission an official watchdog and is married to an academic wrote a letter to the times saying that university is a place where we are exposed to ideas and learn to debate with each other students she says do not have a right not to be made uncomfortable they can t say that because they feel uncomfortable someone should be fired the leadership of sussex university too is finding its voice in recent days adam tickell its vice chancellor wrote to all staff saying that we cannot and will not tolerate threats to cherished academic freedoms the stir that provoked alarmed him he says the degree of interest in me speaking out in support of academic freedom is a concern to me because it should be no more news than the pope is catholic universities might admit the pope s catholicity they have been less willing to celebrate their own

the ministry of health is clarifying that the country s cache of pfizer covid 19 vaccines won t expire until february 2022 due to its extended shelf life as advised by the world health organisation who in a statement issued today the health ministry said its expanded programme for immunization unit was advised via official communication in september 2021 from the pan american health organisation paho of the world health organisation who advisory on the increase in the shelf life of unopened pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine vials the advisory indicates that the shelf life for unopened vaccine vials which are stored at temperatures ranging from 90 c to 60 c has been increased from six months to nine months this advisory applies to current and future batches of pfizer covid 19 vaccines the ministry said this shelf life extension means that trinidad and tobago s current stock of pfizer covid 19 vaccines which would have expired in november 2021 will now expire in february 2022 the ministry added it should be noted that the extension of the shelf life of the pfizer covid 19 vaccines was not a directive of the national technical advisory group the ministry of health or of the government of trinidad and tobago as was erroneously implied in the front page headline of the newsday newspaper on 12th october 2021 the ministry said it s hoped that this communication provides the necessary clarification for the public
texas gov greg abbott issued an executive order this week taking aim at covid 19 vaccine mandates and employers in the lone star state are navigating the latest legal questions the oct 11 executive order barred any entity in texas from compelling receipt of a covid 19 vaccine by any individual including employees or consumers who object to vaccination on the grounds of personal conscience religious beliefs or for medical reasons including prior recovery from covid 19 according to the order s language mark temple is a partner with bakerhostetler and leads the law firm s labor and employment practice group in houston he argues that abbott s latest executive order doesn t actually prevent a company from instating a companywide covid 19 vaccine mandate for employees the executive order gives employees broad leeway to refuse that vaccination for themselves abbott s executive order certainly doesn t prohibit the vaccines but it expands the scope in which those that choose not to get a vaccine can raise objections or concerns temple said the most vague of which is the question of personal conscience what does that actually mean employers around the nation have started to roll out vaccine mandates as company policies houston methodist was one of the first large hospital systems in the country to require its workforce to be vaccinated for covid 19 or face termination the full approval of the pfizer biontech vaccine by the food and drug administration this summer gave employers even more backing to implement vaccine policies of their own said ruthie white a houston based partner with spencer fane llp who co leads the firm s labor and employment practice group prior to that the department of justice said federal law doesn t prohibit public or private entities from requiring the vaccine in september the white house announced plans to order large employers to mandate covid 19 vaccines for employees or require weekly testing for unvaccinated workers it is still unclear when the occupational safety and health administration or osha plans to implement such a mandate for companies with 100 or more employees but the mandate got one step closer to becoming reality on oct 13 osha said it submitted the initial text of the emergency temporary standard to implement the plan to the office of management and budget according to the department of labor upon conclusion of omb s review the emergency temporary standard will be published in the federal register white told the houston business journal in mid september that she expected the process to take at least 30 days before osha would be able to issue such a mandate once the osha mandate does takes effect temple said he believes it is possible for large employers to remain compliant with it as well as abbott s latest executive order if an employee refuses to comply with a companywide vaccine mandate on the grounds of personal conscience religious beliefs or for medical reasons per the texas executive order an employer could still require that employee to produce weekly negative test results in compliance with the osha mandate then the next question is who is going to be paying for temple asked i m sure ultimately it s going to be the employer but that s the other practical aspect of what we re looking at if we go that route which i think a lot will conflicting issues for federal contractors also arise with the abbott executive order in early september president biden issued an executive order requiring all federal contractors to be vaccinated against covid 19 southwest airlines co nyse luv and american airlines nasdaq aal which are both headquartered in the dallas fort worth metroplex plan to continue requiring employees to be vaccinated despite gov abbott s latest order so they can remain compliant as federal contractors the airlines cited the president s federal order superseding any order or law from a state executive we are already seeing some of those challenges temple said i think those that are really concerned about the federal contractor executive order are going to comply with that and say if challenged we think the federal order is going to preempt gov abbott s order so we are going to go forward with the federal order

listen to this article listen to this article arizona schools are facing the prospect of not being able to legally spend some of the money they are receiving and without legislative action they will have to reduce their spending this school year by a cumulative total of more than 1 2 billion that translates out to more than 1 300 per student than what they ve already budgeted a 17 drop put another way they will be able to collect the state and local taxes as planned they just won t be able to spend it all and that has implications for districts who may find themselves unable to pay for the teachers they hired and the contracts they ve already signed the only thing that could avert this fiscal train wreck would be action by the legislature which could approve an exemption from the voter approved aggregate expenditure limit which currently stands at about 6 6 billion but that would take a two thirds vote and the signature of gov doug ducey and that vote would have to happen soon after lawmakers reconvene in january to help schools avoid having to make up that 17 loss in spending authority with last minute cuts cutting that amount out of our budget would be absolutely devastating said darcy mentone spokeswoman for the vail unified school district she pointed out that 88 of the district s operating budget is staff with the balance for everything from utilities to pencils if you cut 17 out of our budget this year we would have to look at layoffs mentone said and right at the end of the school year others have similar assessments it s catastrophic and it would be devastating to our budget especially since we ve already committed contracts for the year said chris hermann chief financial officer for the kyrene elementary school district and he said if the district has to start altering spending plans in the spring it doesn t give you hardly any time to make adjustments pima county school superintendent dustin williams said he and his staff have looked for a way around the expenditure limit short of legislative intervention but they haven t found one and absent action at the capitol he said there will be a devastating impact on education schools have the money currently in their bank account williams said but they wouldn t be able to spend it which is ironic because that s what we re all trying to do right now make sure that the kids and the schools are all safe and then also really start to tackle the learning loss that he said leaves it up to lawmakers to come up with a plan and hopefully the governor can come through and help us all as well williams said but gubernatorial press aide c j karamargin would not commit to ducey supporting an exemption the governor is not going to comment on pending future legislation if it is pending at all he said instead karamargin listed things he said his boss has done to improve overall education funding for example he said ducey signed a budget which funds the construction of seven new schools this fiscal year only thing is those are dollars that can be spent only for school construction and cannot be used for basic operations more to the point no matter how much more cash the governor says is given to schools the expenditure limit means they cannot spend it absent an exemption from the limit karamargin also noted that schools got more than 4 billion in covid relief dollars while those dollars are not subject to the expenditure limit they also are one time monies state schools chief kathy hoffman wants legislative action needless cuts will severely hamper school districts ability to serve students and help them recover from the effects of the pandemic said press aide morgan dick we need serious leadership and meaningful action from lawmakers so our schools can get on to their critical work of providing safe in person learning for students in their community senate president karen fann r prescott said she is personally interested in helping schools avoid a crisis the intention is never to do these kind of draconian cuts she said as we know right now many of the schools are struggling already with the covid issues fann said we don t need to pile more on to them right now house majority leader ben toma r peoria agreed for the need to act we expect to address the matter in the upcoming session he said and toma said part of the reason an exemption is needed is because republicans have funded k 12 education at record levels but the current problem is more complex than that it goes back to the aggregate expenditure limit that voters approved in 1980 for all k 12 spending statewide based on figures at that time it is adjusted annually for inflation and student growth what s happening this year is largely the convergence of two unusual factors first the limit is always based on last year s student numbers chuck essigs lobbyist for the arizona association of school business officials estimates that the drop in students in public k 12 education last year much of that due to covid will reduce the spending limit by about 300 million but the bigger problem is one that the legislature created in seeking to provide financial help in 2000 voters approved proposition 301 to levy a 0 6 cent sales tax to fund education including teacher salaries for 20 years and voters made those revenues exempt from the aggregate expenditure limit with that tax expiring this year lawmakers in 2018 agreed to a new identical levy to pick up in july and run until 2041 to keep the money flowing without interruption only thing is they never exempted what the new levy will raise from the expenditure limit and that alone accounts for more than 632 million of money now coming in to schools money they formerly got to spend but legally speaking cannot spend this year absent a legislatively approved exemption if lawmakers do not act that starts the process of determining how much each district will lose in spending authority essigs said the way the law is written anything over the expenditure limit is divided up among all schools with each forced to reduce spending by the percentage set regardless of how much they were spending if you re a high spending district you have to reduce your budget by 17 he said and that same figure also applies to those with lower spending if you re a district that has a lot of special ed kids obviously you can spend more because the formula allows you to spend more essigs explained that s because state law provides a higher level of aid for youngsters with special needs but that 17 hit he said would come to the total spending authority even the part of it that includes special ed students there s something else complicating the problem to balance the budget in the last decade lawmakers cut dollars from the district additional assistance fund money earmarked for schools to pay for items like books computers and buses in fact that account was zeroed out by ducey during his first year in office that account is now fully funded but those additional dollars that were restored to schools also helped to push total statewide expenditures above the constitutional limit

the title on the marquee deftly describes what takes place inside the golden theatre in a series of narrations monologues scenes and vignettes penned by keenan scott ii seven black new york men played by seven broadway actors offer up ideas notions experiences testimonies struggles and prescriptions for change in many ways the moralistic heartfelt 90 minute show thoughts of a colored man exemplifies what so many of the progressive activists who work in the theater business have said needs to happen far more on broadway people of color in this case men of color making up an entire cast although not the entire creative team and appearing in material that speaks specifically to the human consequences of systemic racism in america luke james left esau pritchett da vinchi forrest mcclendon dyllón burnside tristan mack wilds bryan terrell clark in thoughts of a colored man all are hoping it will find an audience the show certainly speaks to people of all races and gender identities but an apt marketing strategy or for you perhaps a theatergoing strategy would be to try and attract father and son pairings of black new yorkers offering a shared bonding experience much in the way that the musical mean girls does a lot of business with mothers and daughters coming to the theater through bridges and tunnels seeking out time together and something they can discuss going home broadway rarely has catered to the audience of urban black men from new york city whatever feelings anyone may have about a particular play or production that historical fact is beyond dispute the characters in the piece are diverse ranging from a guy who runs a barber shop to a young man with a job corralling shopping carts at whole foods to a financial services professional with a fancy apartment but it is their shared racial identity that offers the thematic link in the show the cast directed by steven h broadnax iii is an ensemble in all senses of the word tristan mack wilds dyllón burnside forrest mcclendon and da vinchi in thoughts of a colored man anyone whose diet of theatergoing extends beyond broadway certainly has seen works similar to this thoughts has genesis in narrative non dramatic theater in derived testimony so called slam poetry and performance monologues such pieces have thrived in regional cities for years especially in black theaters but almost never on broadway there is one notable exception in ntozahe shange s for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf that magical choreopoem played the booth theatre on broadway in 1976 and ran for 742 performances and nearly two years it clearly influenced scott indeed the characters in thoughts are named after feelings perhaps a nod to shange s choice of seven ensemble women without names in colored girls we meet the lady in red lady in orange and so on thoughts has love dyllon burnside happiness bryan terrell clark wisdom esau pritchett lust da vinchi passion luke james depression forrest mcclendon and anger triston mack wilds to call thoughts a choreopoem in the shange mode would overstate both the piece and the physicality of what broadnax tried to do although there is a little sweet music from te la and kamauu and a cool digital environment crafted by robert brill these guys talk rather than sing and dance it similarly should be understood that this is not a traditional play in terms of conflict and payoff that s not the intent da vinchi left and dyllón burnside in thoughts of a colored man i d argue that the piece actually could use yet more of those titular thoughts on the state of the nation of new york city of black america it s striking that the characters are named after emotions rather than ideas although there certainly are examples of both here it also could range yet deeper when it comes to exploring the clash of what we might think of as traditional values such as the centering influence of church or community versus new overtly secular notions of socialism gender complexities and intersectionality flowing out of college campuses and now fighting for influence with the black men of new york as every election reveals but the sight of this smiling black ensemble walking out on stage greeting an enthusiastic audience and taking stock of this moment in history their broadway moment was deeply moving who is the colored man is the first question closed followed by a statement our ancestors endured centuries of being property merely holding onto a dream of us having more than they could fathom they wanted us to live amongst the stars they charted for us so why have we settled for the dim light of the moon and not bask in the sun

by victoria knight earlier this month dr rashid buttar posted on twitter that covid 19 was a planned operation and shared an article alleging that most people who got the covid vaccine would be dead by 2025 his statement is a recent example in what has been a steady stream of spurious claims surrounding the covid vaccines and treatments that swirl around the public consciousness others include testimony in june by dr sherri jane tenpenny before ohio state legislators that the vaccine could cause people to become magnetized clips from the hearing went viral on the internet on april 9 2020 dr joseph mercola posted a video titled could hydrogen peroxide treat coronavirus which was shared more than 4 600 times in the video mercola said inhaling hydrogen peroxide through a nebulizer could prevent or cure covid these physicians are identified as members of the disinformation dozen a group of top superspreaders of covid vaccine misinformation on social media according to a 2021 report by the nonprofit center for countering digital hate the report based on an analysis of anti vaccine content on social media platforms found that 12 people were responsible for 65 of it the group is composed of physicians anti vaccine activists and people known for promoting alternative medicine don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the physician voices are of particular concern because their medical credentials lend credence to their unproven often dangerous pronouncements all three continue to hold medical licenses and have not faced consequences for their covid related statements but leaders of professional medical organizations increasingly are calling for that to change and urging medical oversight boards to take more aggressive action in july the federation of state medical boards the national umbrella organization for the state based boards issued a statement making clear that doctors who generate and spread covid misinformation could be subject to disciplinary action including the suspension or revocation of their licenses the american board of family medicine american board of internal medicine and american board of pediatrics issued a joint statement sept 9 in support of the state boards position warning that such unethical or unprofessional conduct may prompt their respective board to take action that could put their certification at risk and the superspreaders identified by the center s report are not alone khn identified 20 other doctors who have made false or misleading claims about covid by combing through published fact checks and other news coverage for example at an indiana school board meeting in august dr dan stock claimed the surge in covid cases this summer was due to antibody mediated viral enhancement from people receiving covid vaccines politifact rated his claim pants on fire false dr stella immanuel a member of a group america s frontline doctors which has consistently made false statements about covid said in a video that went viral in july 2020 that masks weren t needed because covid could be cured by hydroxychloroquine immanuel s website currently promotes a set of vitamins as well as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as covid treatments two of the doctors mentioned by name in this article responded to requests for comment mercola offered documents to rebut criticisms of his hydrogen peroxide covid treatment and took issue with the center s disinformation dozen report methodology buttar defended his positions saying via email that the science is clear and anyone who contests it has a suspect agenda at best and or lacks a moral compass he also pointed to data from the centers for disease control and prevention s vaccine adverse event recording system considered inconclusive by many experts since the onset of the covid pandemic misinformation has been widespread on social media platforms and many experts blame it for undermining efforts to curb the coronavirus s spread a recent poll showed that more than 50 of americans who won t get vaccinated cited conspiracy theories as their reasons for example saying the vaccines cause infertility or alter dna some physicians have gained notoriety by embracing covid related fringe ideas quack treatments and falsehoods via social media conservative talk shows and even in person with patients whether promoting the use of ivermectin an anti parasitic drug primarily used to treat animals in the u s or a mix of vitamins to treat covid doctors words can be especially powerful public opinion polls consistently show that americans have high trust in doctors there is a sense of credibility that comes with being a doctor said rachel moran a researcher who studies covid misinformation at the university of washington there is also a sense they have access to insider info that we don t this is a very confusing time and it can seem that if anyone knows what i should be doing in this situation it s a doctor don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free while covid is a novel and complicated infectious disease physicians spreading misinformation generally have no particular expertise in infectious diseases dr scott atlas who endorsed former president donald trump s unproven statements about the course of the pandemic is a radiologist traditionally the responsibility of policing physicians has fallen to state medical boards beyond overseeing the licensing process these panels investigate complaints about doctors and discipline those who engage in unethical unprofessional or in extreme cases criminal activity any member of the public can submit a complaint about a physician the boards are relatively slow and weak and it s a long slow process to pull somebody s license said arthur caplan founding head of the department of medical ethics at new york university in many states they have their hands full with doctors who have committed felonies doctors who are molesting their patients keeping an eye on misinformation is somewhat down on the priority list to date only two doctors have reportedly faced such sanctions in oregon dr steven latulippe had his license suspended in december 2020 for refusing to wear a face mask at his clinic and telling patients that masks were ineffective in curbing the spread of covid and even dangerous dr thomas cowan a san francisco physician who posted a youtube video that went viral in march 2020 stating that 5g networks cause covid voluntarily surrendered his medical license to california s medical board in february 2021 dr humayun chaudhry president of the federation of state medical boards however said it s possible some doctors could already be the subject of inquiries and investigations since these actions are not made public until sanctions are handed down khn reached out to the medical and osteopathic boards of all 50 states and the district of columbia to see if they had received covid misinformation complaints of the 43 that responded only a handful shared specifics during a one week period in august kansas medical board received six such complaints in all the state has received 35 complaints against 20 licensees about spreading covid misinformation on social media and in person indiana has received about 30 in the past year south carolina said it had about 10 since january rhode island didn t share the number of complaints but said it has taken disciplinary action against one doctor for spreading misinformation though it hasn t moved to suspend his license the disciplinary measures include a fine a reprimand on the doctor s record and a mandate to complete an ethics course five states said they had received only a couple and 11 states reported receiving no complaints regarding covid misinformation confidentiality laws in 13 states prevented those boards from sharing information about complaints don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free social media companies have also been slow to take action some doctors accounts specifically those among the disinformation dozen have been suspended but others are still active and posting misinformation imran ahmed ceo of the center for countering digital hate said social media platforms often don t consistently apply their rules against spreading misinformation even when it s the same companies facebook will sometimes take posts down but instagram will not ahmed said referring to facebook s ownership of instagram it goes to show their piecemeal ineffective approach to enforcing their own rules a facebook spokesperson said the company has removed over 3 000 accounts pages and groups for repeatedly violating covid and vaccine misinformation policies since the beginning of the pandemic buttar s facebook and instagram pages and tenpenny s facebook page have been removed while mercola s facebook posts have been demoted which means fewer people will see them tenpenny and mercola still have instagram accounts part of the challenge may be that these doctors sometimes present scientific opinions that aren t mainstream but are viewed as potentially valid by some of their colleagues it can be difficult to prove that what is being said is outside the range of scientific and medical consensus said caplan the doctors who were advising trump like scott atlas recommended herd immunity that was far from the consensus of epidemiologists but you couldn t get a board to take his license away because it was a fringe opinion even if these physicians don t face consequences it is likely experts said that the public health will medical misinformation doesn t just result in people making bad personal and community health choices but it also divides communities and families leaving an emotional toll said moran the university of washington researcher misinformation narratives have real sticking power and impact people s ability

socialist utopian centennial october 13 2021 by jim wagner as many have noted our god given rights are now steadily being suppressed in the name of a very old delusion with the new and catchy name of equity free speech was perhaps first on the chopping block and it continues to be hacked away a few days ago ocasio cortez and her squad announced a bold and dangerous expansion of their censorship and cancel culture policies here it is word for word the national socialist movement will in the future ruthlessly prevent if necessary by force all meetings or lectures that are likely to distract the minds of our fellow countrymen how clever they plan to purge all language that might distract our minds but distract them from what from the big lie of course if history is to be our guide because you see that rather brutal censorship statement was actually issued 100 years ago plus one february 24th 1920 by a politician who had just been released from prison for crashing the meeting of a rival and severely beating the man in response to his incarceration that criminal savant graciously reassured the police who apprehended him that all was well it s alright he told them we got what we wanted my rival did not speak the politician i am referring to as you may have guessed was adolf hitler and the national socialist movement he spoke of was his own newly formed national socialist german workers party a party originally the national socialist party which he himself named notwithstanding all the egg headed claims that the nazis were a faction of the right hitler s party was fully and explicitly socialist that is to say of the left his 25 point plan made that abundantly clear here are some of the provisions of that plan point 11 abolition of all incomes not earned by work point 12 the nationalization of trusts point 13 the sharing with the state of profits from large industry point 14 the abolition of land rents and speculation in land point 16 the communalization of department stores and their lease at cheap rates to small traders point 18 the death penalty for usurers and profiteers hitler s platform has a certain flavor of the american socialist demands being made today does it not point 11 alone makes clear that the national socialist party of which hitler became the seventh member and its first minister of propaganda was a socialist organization it would eliminate all forms of investment because no one would extend capital or credit other than for profit and profit is by definition income not earned by work there would be no stock market no corporations or even small businesses no banks no home loans no start up funding for small business there would be no invention no patents no copyrights in short there would not and could not be any civilization at all because all of these things entail income not earned by work but point 18 puts the final stamp on any doubt about the left wing pedigree of hitler s platform who would dare to sell or lend when the undefined crimes of usury and profiteering were to be punished by death since profit itself was outlawed under point 11 one would have to assume that all gain from the sale of goods would be profiteering not to digress too far from the point but to say that hitler was not a socialist is tantamount to saying that karl marx was not a communist that so many today believe this canard is merely a testament to the fact that we have been the victims of organized brainwashing for a very long time did hitler live up to all the tenets of his socialist party platform of course not socialism is not a sincere economic theory it is a path to power for the elite the cognoscenti and the woke and a road to serfdom for the rest of us anyone who believes that the allies of today s socialists big tech big pharma and the wealthy elite like george soros himself an actual nazi collaborator in the final solution of the jewish problem is naïve beyond imagining german big business was quick to support hitler in spite of his ominous platform and it will be equally quick to support the woke socialists of our own time who will dutifully grant it the monopoly advantage that it covets above all else did you get your vaccine yet as an aside there are other parallels too stark to dismiss between the nsdap nazis aka national socialist german workers party and the modern left for example their strident propaganda supported by street rioting and their simple minded slogans beneath the black metal swastika and silver wreath of hitler s party emblem was suspended a metal rectangle with the letters nsdap from which hung a square swastika flag with deutchland erwache emblazoned on it in the vulgate of the contemporary left those stirring words can best be translated as germany get woke i realize this information runs counter to the commonly held dogma on hitler and i am keenly aware of the volumes of plausible bunkum circulating on the internet so i don t expect you to trust my word on this but you can easily confirm for yourself what i am saying it comes from william shirer s the rise and fall of the third reich mjf books copyright 1959 pages 41 and 43 44 shirer an american journalist who lived in germany through the gruesome nazi experiment remains the foremost authority on hitler and his degenerate movement one might argue that hitler s party though socialist was different from contemporary socialist movements because it was explicitly racist that unlike our own native socialism it was based on the formal hatred of a particular ethnic group and that it was that racial hatred that defined it as a party of the right but to that i would say what is critical race theory if not the formal hatred of a particular race in this case the hatred of white people is that not a core principle of american socialism today university professors have been fired for refusing to teach it the german socialism of hitler and the bolshevik socialism of stalin differed from each other in only one fundamental way and that is that while the former was a third reich kingdom or empire and thus nationalist the latter was a third international and thus cosmopolitan the third reich was to consist of a racially pure german socialist population ruled by hitler the third international founded simultaneously in russia was to be a worldwide socialist rule under stalin that trifling distinction is the sole comprehensible pretense for calling one right and the other left some say that history does not repeat itself but only rhymes however in this case at least george santayana was right after the ghastly revelations of the holocaust we were regularly reminded to never forget but we seem to have forgotten in spite of that dire warning and because we have forgotten such a crucial piece of our history we are now being condemned to relive it i fear it will be the death of us jim wagner

portland ore ahead of the busiest season of the year for the u s postal service some oregon postal workers are voicing concerns about the latest policy changes they include new service standards that slow down first class mail delivery mail traveling less than 1 000 miles should reach its destination in three days and mail traveling more than 1 900 miles will take about five days the postal service also has hiked rates for mail packages and other special services with these changes and staffing issues said joe cogan president of portland s local postal workers union he doesn t think the postal service is prepared for the holiday crunch i just don t know how any organization or business can survive if you re reducing service and charging more it just doesn t make sense to me he said i can tell you that the employees that i represent we want to serve our customers to the best of our ability and we believe that this action prevents us from doing that postmaster general louis dejoy has said the postal service is hiring 40 000 seasonal workers to help with the holiday rush and that the changes are needed to trim a 160 billion loss by 2030 christopher shaw an author and historian of the u s postal service said he s already hearing reports of how these changes are affecting small business owners they often depend on first class mail and have said the slowdown will impact their day to day operations shaw said he thinks some may turn to other delivery providers which could lead to further privatization of the industry these changes he said are part of a trend where the postal service is conceived of not as a public service and instead more like a for profit business which could very well lead to degradation of the service that americans have expected and received over the years the changes are part of dejoy s 10 year plan called delivering for america which includes modernizing the vehicle fleet and making investments in mail processing facilities source oregon news service
highland the town council on monday proposed its 2022 civil operating budget the council also introduced the proposed operating budgets for the sanitary and water departments which are separate from the civil budget tonight is simply to introduce the budget with a public hearing said councilman mark herak d 2nd an official notice to the taxpayers says that any 10 or more taxpayers can officially register a remonstrance up to seven days after the hearing as advertised the proposed civil budget is 18 3 million this includes a property tax rate not to exceed 1 81 per 100 of assessed valuation this ties in with a maximum tax levy of 8 3 million the proposed numbers after the council adopts them will be submitted to the indiana department of local government finance which typically will finalize the proposal lower than presented thus the final rate assigned by the state will be less than advertised by the town clerk treasurer michael griffin noted the rate is based upon higher levies that will likely be adopted or used and the rate is based on an artificially lowered assessed valuation griffin explained this is the usual and customary practice used at the preadoption hearing griffin further noted that this protects revenues and town services from potential losses in the event of a reduction in the tax base as happened after the historic flood disaster in 2006 the sanitary district s 2022 budget is proposed at 4 1 million with an estimated tax levy of 239 515 similarly the water district s proposed budget is 410 788 with no expected tax levy whether town employee raises will happen next year is still to be determined employee raises will not be discussed tonight herak said that will be taken up later in the year the next step is for the council to adopt the budget at its next business meeting by law we have to adopt before nov 1 griffin noted one councilman and one resident expressed dissatisfaction with the budget process and the numbers involved it feels that i ve been shut out of the process that the public has been shut out of the process said councilman mark schocke r 3rd schocke s complaint centers around the budget being worked out only by griffin and herak instead of the whole council however council president roger sheeman r 5th said the entire council will discuss the numbers during its next study session at this time department heads will be asked to whittle down their wish lists to help put the budget into balance resident larry kondrat questioned the effect of the proposed numbers and what the taxpayers will have to pay is my property tax bill going to go up or down he asked the board saying other residents are wondering the same thing griffin offered a breakdown of the property tax bills paid by highland residents the largest chunk goes to lake county at 32 with highland s civil budget at 30 the school town of highland is next with 29 the highland sanitary district gets 6 with the water district less than 1 north township rounds out the tax bill with 3 in other business the council said it will consider a change in the local snow ordinance that would go from 1 inch to 2 inches before motorists must clear the streets of their vehicles

ultimate 8 point drop belied the down up down up action during the session which saw the asx200 trade in a 38 point range by the close only two sectors moved by more than 1 materials fell 1 1 on a big fall in the iron ore price while property won the day with a 1 6 gain led by retail reits this likely reflects a reopening play vaccination numbers the potential for booster shots and jabs for kids and an international border reopening the banks were weak 0 6 after commonwealth bank cba suggested at its agm it was prepared to go harder on lending restrictions which was worth 1 6 while bank of queensland s boq earnings result disappointed and that stock fell 4 3 consumer staples were strong 0 7 after bubs australia bub jumped a full 38 on a trading update which revealed a very strong result in china bubs is not in the index but fellow infant formula stock a2 milk a2m is and it jumped 13 5 in sympathy we recall a2 milk copped a hiding last week when a class action against the company was announced discretionary was also solid 0 5 helped by an 8 7 jump for auto parts company gud holdings gud after it provided an update suggesting it had enough inventory to carry through the supply shortage issue for now a bounce back of 6 5 for star entertainment sgr following its 22 plunge also helped on the losers board it was all about iron ore other than band of queensland sneaking into the top five movements in other sectors bare little mentioning so what will happen today we saw wall street also indecisive last night after another hot cpi with the dow not even managing to move a full point by the close the s p500 broke its losing streak in rising 0 3 but our futures are up a full 50 points or 0 7 this morning relief that the us cpi didn t spark anything untoward or is a big buying order going to hit the market today base metal prices knocked it out of the park last night although iron ore is down again but gold has shot up on the cpi so we ll likely see all gold miners in the top five winners today otherwise our september jobs numbers are out today feeling hot hot hot the us headline cpi rose 0 4 in september when 0 3 was forecast sending the annual rate up to 5 4 from 5 3 in august to mark a new 30 year high the main drivers of growth were energy food and rent the core cpi which excludes energy and food rose 0 2 when 0 1 was expected but the annual rate remained unchanged a 4 0 it is interesting to note the fed prefers the core pce measure of inflation which also excludes energy and food and furthermore weights house prices and rents at only around half of their weight in the cpi but given oil prices have doubled this year gas prices have trebled and house prices have risen 20 dragging rents along with them it is hard to see how the fed can ignore the reality of rising costs on households and businesses to that end the minutes of the last fed meeting released last night showed the fomc discussed kicking off tapering either in november or december but we knew that several fed officials said they preferred to proceed at a more rapid pace but we knew that too others were more worried about a taper tantrum should that be an issue wall street was also fully prepared for another hot inflation number as most see inflation pressure as remaining stickier than jay powell expects president biden went as far last night to himself announce that the two big ports in the la area which handle 40 of us imports will now run 24 7 so the reaction to 5 4 was muted there was a brief drop on wall street early but not for long while stronger inflation should imply higher bond yields the ten year yield actually fell 3 points to 1 55 while stronger inflation should imply a rise in the greenback it has already run up hard so it fell 0 5 on what appears a sell the fact but while the ten year yield fell 3 points the two year yield rose 2 points this flattening of the yield curve points to a bond market preparing for a fed rate hike sooner rather than later speaking of sell the fact jp morgan reported earnings last night beat on just about every metric and fell 2 5 the banks have also run up hard these past months there were also several one offs that assisted the beat current forecasts for s p500 september quarter earnings growth are at a consensus 27 6 in any other world that would be an omg number but not when one compares it to a 52 8 gain in the march quarter and 92 4 in the june quarter and not when one compares to the collapse in earnings in 2020 which provides the low base for these extraordinary 2021 numbers more big bank earnings results will follow this week and next week things really heat up in earnings season in close focus will be the faamgs the big cash flow machines led the nasdaq higher last night

article 3 months old international oct 14 2021 as the prosperity gap widens between rich and poor nations answers are sought over how us households continue to hold almost half of the world s total private financial assets forced savings help lift global financial assets wealth in the us is increasingly decoupling from the rest of the world china leads in growth rates of high wealth citizens prosperity gap widens between rich and poor nations australia has the second highest debt ratio in the world by mark woodruff forced savings rose to prominence in 2020 as they helped propel global financial assets beyond 300 of global gdp for the first time there was a near tripling of inflows into bank deposits according to a recent global wealth report from german financial services company allianz these deposits accounted for half or more of fresh savings in all markets considered except for australia where superannuation narrowly held sway the rise in bank deposits even left behind the growth in securities which climbed thanks to a robust performance of equities a subset of securities meanwhile in emerging markets financial assets grew by 13 1 in 2020 compared to 8 9 for industrialised countries for the same period asia ex japan achieved its highest growth rates this millennium from a longer term perspective and taking inflation into account asia ex japan is the undisputed growth champion per capita financial assets have increased more than fivefold on average since 2000 which is twice as fast as in the two other emerging regions eastern europe and latin america the global wealth report also revealed that richer countries were more affected by the pandemic though in the medium and long term it s expected covid 19 will likely hit emerging markets harder despite the short term hit to richer countries wealth in the us is increasingly decoupling from the rest of the world more people there can again count themselves as members of the global wealth upper class thanks to a strong increase in net financial assets more remarkably households in north america continue to hold almost half of the world s total private financial assets this share has remained stable over the past decade to gain perspective the per capita increase in average financial assets for the us in 2020 alone is roughly the amount of total financial assets per capita in greece in looking at the ways in which the pandemic may have changed the outlook for some assets classes individuals and countries let s first examine why the us is faring so well why has the us has prospered it seems portfolio construction savings behaviour is the key to the rise in us wealth notes allianz in the us savers hold just under 55 of their financial assets in the form of securities mainly equities and have therefore benefited greatly over recent years from the stock market boom in a markedly different portfolio approach western european and japanese savers only hold around 28 and 16 in securities over the past five years the increase in value of asset holdings accounted for 70 of total asset growth in the us for western europe this ratio is 46 and for germany a very modest 11 and japan 6 the rise in china s high wealth class the global high wealth class accounts for around 12 of the population or 600m people in the countries allianz studied this is the end result of 1 6 growth per annum since the year 2000 a rate of growth twice that of the overall population the growth is almost solely due to china which has now caught up with western europe each has around 140m high wealth citizens other regions such as eastern europe and the rest of asia have also seen strong growth over the past 20 years albeit at a much lower level according to the global wealth report in 2020 the share of western europe north america and japan in the global high wealth class has fallen to 67 from 93 prosperity gap between rich and poor nations to widen as referred to previously emerging markets may be hit harder in the medium to longer term by the after effects of covid 19 compared with industrialised countries the vaccination campaign in poorer countries is proceeding very slowly and will likely continue to hold back economic development over the next two years moreover fast rising public debt could potentially place a disproportionate burden on the poorer countries notes allianz there are also global trends to consider which while not triggered by covid 19 have been given an additional boost by the pandemic for example the pandemic has sped up the demise of hyper globalisation even before covid 19 increasing trade disputes and growing protectionism were causing a slowdown in international trade now trade will be further impacted by the shift towards sustainability and a shortening of supply chains which will lead to more on or near shoring of production at the same time covid 19 has provided a tailwind for digitalisation big data artificial intelligence and connected automation will permanently change the world of work and likely lessen the comparative advantage of relatively cheap labour in emerging markets elsewhere it s anticipated by allianz that decarbonisation will lead to an investment boom especially in the richer countries at the same time consumer demand in these countries will undergo a structural transformation which will have an impact upon the economic model of many emerging markets whether they are suppliers of raw materials or producers of goods debt debt in the us represented 81 5 of output in 2020 compared to 76 6 in 2019 however the rise was not so much because of an increase in liabilities but rather because of the sharp economic contraction of 2020 as of today debt delinquency is not considered a problem believes allianz nonetheless when pandemic protections expire both household and government debt could potentially become a risk factor meanwhile in australia the debt ratio is the second highest worldwide and reached a historical high of 129 3 in 2020 this reflects the burden that construction and housing prices have put on household balance sheets according to the global wealth report as an aside in the eu even before the pandemic 22 of the population was estimated to be at risk of over indebtedness it s the view of allianz this could worsen if the increasingly popular bnpl services are mismanaged outlook assuming no major stock market corrections 2021 should turn out to be another good year for the financial assets of private households according to allianz with overall growth in financial assets globally of around 7 compared to 9 7 in 2020 as interest in capital market investments such as equities or investment funds remains high 9 10 growth seems likely in 2021 roughly on a par with 2020 in contrast the trend for investments in insurance and pension funds is likely to be much more subdued here any slight rise in interest rates would likely result in losses for fixed

on 8 july 2021 the ecb issued its first strategic review since 2003 1 the new review systematises policy changes that have been adopted in the light of new economic challenges such as slower productivity growth globalisation digitisation climate change the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis and demographic changes in addition to pursuing its traditional price stabilisation objectives the ecb s 2021 strategic review aims to tackle the broader issues of financial stability balanced economic growth competitive markets employment and environmental concerns the latest cfm cepr survey2 investigates one component of the policy shift the new definition of price stability the strategic review makes explicit the ecb s commitment to a symmetrical target around 2 inflation as opposed to the perception that the ecb was to keep inflation consistently below 2 there is existing evidence that the ecb has already followed such a policy but the review formalises this reality bletzinger and wieland 2017 hartman and smets 2019 however the ecb has not gone as far as the federal reserve did in its strategic review of last year 3 the fed has not only committed to a symmetrical target but also to a policy of catch up inflation whereby inflation may be allowed to exceed its target for a time following extended periods of below target inflation some commentators such as reichlin et al 2021b have urged the ecb to follow the lead of its us counterpart in allowing for a makeup element in its strategy they write that such measures would help in dealing with inflation shortfalls to ensure that average inflation outcomes under its policy are in line with its numerical inflation objective feld et al 2021 take a different view whereby the fed s approach may lack credibility because market participants may speculate that once inflation reaches two percent the fed will refrain from further raising inflation additionally some things remain unclear such as the period over which the average should be at two percent moreover if the inflation rate were to overshoot the target it could be quite difficult to reverse that a policy of catch up inflation can be viewed as a form of price level targeting low periods of inflation put the price level below its trend and catch up policies help the price level revert to its trend as would be the case with price level targeting svenson 1999 lay down the intellectual foundations for this policy svenson s influential research predicted that targeting the price level could lead to greater inflation stability than a policy of targeting inflation itself when monetary policy is discretionary further any inflation bias that might exist under discretion is replaced with a price level bias that has lesser economic implications subsequent research has noted that svenson s conclusion depends on price setting behaviour steinsson 2003 gaspar et al 2007 the information structure coenen and wieland 2004 ball et al 2005 and the degree of price stickiness minford 2004 among other factors see ambler 2009 for a review meh et al 2010 study the distributional implications of price level targeting and find that monetary policy redistributed wealth less aggressively compared to an inflation targeting regime however as nessén and vestin 2005 show average inflation targeting is not identical to price level targeting they formulate the conditions under which average inflation targeting outperforms both conventional inflation targeting and price level targeting namely when price setters are sufficiently backward looking federal reserve bank of new york president john williams 2021 defended average inflation targeting in a recent speech a natural alternative is a hybrid model that allows for a combination of average inflation targeting and price level targeting batini and yates 2003 ceccetti and kim 2005 closely related is a policy of nominal gdp targeting this policy aims to stabilise the path of nominal gdp leading to a countercyclical inflation target that allows inflation to be higher when gdp growth is slower this policy too implies a form of catch up inflation because it allows inflation to exceed and fall below its average rate at different points of the business cycle fackler and mcmillin 2019 prefer nominal gdp targeting to both inflation and price level targeting because the latter can be counterproductive in the face of supply shocks in the case of a negative supply shock an inflation targeting central bank is forced to slow an already decelerating economy because inflation exceeds its target in contrast nominal gdp targeting allows the central bank to let inflation increase because real gdp is declining sheedy 2014 highlights a further advantage of nominal gdp targeting it redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors in recessions a desirable risk sharing feature when contracts are incomplete and nominal a main critique of ngdp targeting is practical data on inflation and public expectations thereof are more readily available in real time that data on nominal gdp and gdp faces frequent revisions see beckworth 2019 for an extended discussion of nominal gdp targeting and honkapohja and mitra 2013 for its robustness properties hughes hallet 2015 investigates the applicability of nominal gdp targeting for the ecb the september 2021 cfm cepr survey asks about the desirability of catch up inflation and the best ways to implement such a policy the first question asks whether the ecb should follow the fed s example and allow for catch up inflation the question is framed in terms of catch up inflation for periods of below average inflation but should be understood as also applying to lower than average inflation following periods of excess inflation question 1 to what extent do you agree with the following statement the european central bank should systematically allow for inflation to exceed its target to compensate for periods of below target inflation thirty seven panel members answered this question fifty nine per cent either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement displayed above jumana salaheen cru group considers previous and current policies insufficient for the ecb to achieve its goals the ecb move to a symmetric inflation target underwhelming since the ecb was founded in 1998 annual hicp inflation has averaged 1 6 moving to a 2 symmetric target does not feel like a big enough change to shift inflation expectations which is ultimately what the ecb is trying to do introducing an average inflation target would be a bit more ambitious and would signal the desire for meaningful change in a similar vein john van reenen london school of economics argues that the ecb has clearly undershot its target for too long causing a deflationary bias in europe and generating too low a growth rate patrick minford who supports a policy of ngdp targeting in response to the second question below views average inflation targeting as a close substitute average catch up inflation targeting together with an output gap response in practice gets close to nominal gdp targeting so i think moving towards this will be beneficial thirty five per cent either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the question s statement volker wieland goethe university frankfurt states that make up strategies including price level targeting perform well in model based evaluations under rational expectations and full credibility the ecb has leeway to allow over and undershoots of inflation to promise credibly to provide a make up for past inflation below target is difficult however and subject to lack of credibility and uncertainty furthermore a symmetric price level targeting that makes up for past overshoots as well as undershoots of inflation is quite a challenge to deliver it would make it necessary to purposely tighten policy to keep inflation below the target rate of 2 to reach the price level target path consistent with a 2 trend a purely asymmetric policy catch up policy could overdo it and induce an upward bias costas milas university of liverpool highlighted that lacking a clear definition of average inflation targeting this policy would risk unanchoring of inflation expectations likewise robert kollmann université libre de bruxelles believes that the proposed catch up rule for inflation is too fuzzy as the rule does not stipulate how long and by how much inflation would be allowed to exceed its target after a period of low inflation this lack of clarity would further undermine the credibility of the ecb the ecb needs simple transparent and credible rules the ecb is rightly concerned about the persistent decline in the equilibrium interest rate and the resulting increase in the risk of hitting the interest rate effective lower bound this concern calls for a permanent increase in the target inflation rate to say 2 5 or 3 fabrizio coricelli university of siena and paris school of economics warns against applying crisis time targets to regular times he argues that prolonged periods of below target inflation as observed after the global financial crisis may reveal an instrument problem rather than a target problem the question is why central banks were unable to boost inflation through massive increase in money supply in such circumstances announcing that inflation would be allowed to overshoot the target is unlikely to have effects on inflation expectations david miles imperial college london supports coricelli s claim writing that any monetary policy committee would be right to be very wary of actively wanting inflation to be 4 for two years after it had been close to 0 percent for two years panicos demetriades university of leicester points towards potential political repercussions of the idea which in his view fails to account for them whatever the economic merits of this idea they are detached from political realities writes demetriades average inflation targeting is likely to be perceived as abandonment of price stability by the ecb the ecb has already been under fierce political attack in germany for its accommodative monetary policy the second question asks for the type of policy that should be adopted question 2 which of the following policies is the most desirable to meet the ecbs objective to achieve its mandate of price stability as you understand this term thirty seven panel members answered this question forty per cent support the status quo of inflation targeting while the remaining 60 support alternatives which include average inflation targeting nominal gdp targeting and hybrid policies jorge braga de macedo nova school of business and economics lisbon argues in favour of average inflation targeting saying that given the status quo this policy is the least complicated to adjust to although other policies targeting the price level or nominal gdp or a hybrid may be more appealing in theory in contrast patrick minford cardiff business school supports ngdp targeting underlining that it creates a powerful stabilising influence from monetary policy i found this gave the highest welfare under conditions of fixed price stickiness based on simulations on us data finally some respondents argued in favour of hybrid policies simon wren lewis university of oxford writes that because of the interest rate lower bound there are good reasons to aim for a price level catch up policy after recessions there is nothing equivalent after booms when you want bygones to bygones so an asymmetric policy makes sense where a price level catch up is used after lower bound recessions but otherwise we have inflation targeting forty per cent expressed support towards the status quo arguing for continued inflation targeting jagjit chadha national institute of economic and social research writes that a clear point target of 2 or perhaps 2 5 seems pretty much consistent with price stability we can adopt a margin of error or range and ask the ecb s president to explain deviations of more than 1 on either side and outline the reason for the miss and when we will return back to target range others argue that alternatives are either infeasible or too unclear costas milas states that any other policy is arguably much more difficult to understand let alone explain to market participants and the public similarly volker wieland writes that while symmetric price level targeting is better based on model evaluations i am still sceptical it can be implemented effectively he supports traditional inflation targeting and suggests that a good way to implement a make up strategy is to use a taylor rule with make up factor in communication references and further reading ball l n g mankiw and r and reis 2005 monetary policy for inattentive economies

biographers and school textbooks from previous decades made the same error based on what one historian calls anti christian rhetoric example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video st louis columbus day was observed on october 11 this year but not in as many places as it used to be president joe biden and an increasing number of states are choosing to recognize indigenous people s day instead missouri attorney general eric schmitt who is running for us senate made this argument on twitter for the continued celebration of christopher columbus he wrote in 1492 the consensus among scientists was that the earth was flat christopher columbus challenged that notion and changed the world forever it s been shared almost 3 000 times but many of those shares came from people skeptical of the facts posed in the tweet in 1492 the consensus among scientists was that the earth was flat christopher columbus challenged that notion and changed the world forever happycolumbusday eric schmitt eric_schmitt october 11 2021 the question did columbus prove scientists in his time wrong by sailing to what he thought was asia and not falling off the edge of the earth the sources jeffrey burton russell s 1991 book inventing the flat earth and christopher columbus himself in the form of archived letters the answer no christopher columbus did not disprove the understanding of scientists of his time by proving that the earth is round what we found jeffrey burton russell a professor emeritus of history at the university of california santa barbara who received his phd from emory university dedicated an entire book to the source of this claim repeated in some biographies and textbooks since the 1800s russell wrote that many astronomers scholars and map makers in columbus s time were talking about reaching the indies or any part of asia over the ocean to the west of spain they even used calculations by second century mathematician ptolemy to estimate how far it would be russell added that columbus himself never wrote that he wanted to prove that the earth was round in a letter quoted in columbus s encyclopedia brittanica entry the admiral wrote that he wanted to find a westward path by which to this day we do not know certainly that anyone has passed his primary goals were to open up trade routes that had been blockaded in the east and south and identify new populations for missionaries to convert to christianity russell s research found that spanish councils which included religious scholars at the time debated whether the return trip would be more challenging because of the curvature of the earth they suggested based on ptolemy s calculations that it would just be too far to be practical historians today suspect columbus misled the king and queen of spain with overly optimistic estimates of the journey distance in order to get funding his projection for the trip was about 20 its actual length wrote russell nobody s estimates accounted for the fact that columbus s ships would run into a large landmass on the way cutting the trip short while creating economic opportunities for spain several biographies and books appearing in the 1800s include vivid descriptions of christopher columbus attempting to convince religious scholars to approve the journey to the west in spite of their belief that the world is flat russell suggests this trend was most popular among darwinists who co opted the myth to make religious opponents of darwinism look unsophisticated so we can verify the scientists of columbus s time did not believe that the earth was flat and columbus didn t set sail to prove them wrong

washington d c dr anthony fauci chief white house medical adviser has said americans should celebrate good news about declining covid 19 cases as the holiday season approaches but they should not prematurely declare victory over the pandemic increasing vaccinations and adherence to public health precautions will ensure a happy halloween for children he added while telling cnn particularly if you are vaccinated you can get out there trick or treating if you are not vaccinated again think about it that you will add an extra degree of protection to yourself and your children and your family and your community so it is a good time to reflect on why it is important to get vaccinated but go out there and enjoy halloween as well as the other holidays that will be coming he added however he would not give his opinion on whether the u s should implement a vaccine mandate for air travel like canada for the upcoming holiday season which includes thanksgiving and christmas referring to the decline in covid 19 cases hospitalisations and deaths after the surge caused by the delta variant fauci stressed we have to just be careful that we do not prematurely declare victory in many respects we still have around 68 million people who are eligible to be vaccinated who have not yet gotten vaccinated i need to see the dynamics of the outbreak in the community go way down if you look at the history of the surges and the diminutions in cases over a period of time they can bounce back he said in response to a question on when vaccinated americans should not be required to wear masks indoors the number of deaths caused by covid 19 in the u s has exceeded 712 000 with 44 million total cases being recorded most hospitalizations and deaths are people who are unvaccinated
an economist at fgcu said there are multiple reasons why things are more expensive and out of stock all relating to the supply chain example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video tampa fla you have probably noticed when you go to the store things are more expensive and some items are out of stock well there are reasons why it s not just one thing it s lots of things and the pandemic in many ways created a perfect storm an economist at fgcu victor claar stated cargo ships are stuck at sea some have been there for months cbs news reported wednesday there are nearly 60 cargo ships are stuck floating outside the ports of los angeles and long beach cbs reported this is a symptom of a broken supply chain that is contributing to why you re not seeing items in stock claar points out the costs related to the shipping containers have increased tremendously what used to cost maybe about 6 000 to ship from one of the ports in china to the west coast ports now it costs about 30 000 claar explained claar described that as a ripple effect when you think about the supply chain realize it is just that a chain there s one link that connects to another link that connects to another now we have multiple issues affecting multiple links in that chain it drives up costs in one of those links and those costs are passed along where there are higher costs claar explained when container ships arrive at ports on the west coast they are met with more problems right now there is a shortage of truck drivers president biden has announced the ports will operate 24 7 to help cbs news reported soon workers will start unloading the quarter of a million shipping containers around the clock in los angeles and long beach which handle a combined 40 percent of the country s container traffic dockworkers told cbs news they re all in on the plan and have been wanting to work this way for years ports in florida have come forward saying they will allow the container ships out west to use their seaports as a solution clearly california is no longer the most efficient way to move consumer goods to either the east coast or even the midwest florida has the capacity to be the more efficient way to connect commerce to those locations written in a news release by florida ports council there has been no decision made about whether florida ports will help with this ongoing issue but the president and ceo of florida ports council is hoping florida can step in florida is where your success comes in and our seaports are the solution to ensure the cargo shipping logjam doesn t become the grinch that stole christmas michael rubin president and ceo of florida ports council said speaking of the holidays claar said now is the time to do your shopping even though you might have an ideal gift in mind just be aware that as you get closer to the holidays that gift may no longer be available and it might be at a price point that is higher claar stated empty shelves aren t just for hot ticket items even things like the refreshments the foods you ll need for your holiday hosting claar explained those are also items you will want to buy now while no one wants to hear that products are selling out and expensive claar said you should stay calm but prepare now i don t want to tell viewers to panic but i do think this is a time to think in advance and think strategically claar said the best thing you can do is get your holiday shopping done now as for when prices and supply will be normal again claar said that s hard to tell there s a lot we just don t know claar said
portland ore ahead of the busiest season of the year for the u s postal service some oregon postal workers are voicing concerns about the latest policy changes they include new service standards that slow down first class mail delivery mail traveling less than 1 000 miles should reach its destination in three days and mail traveling more than 1 900 miles will take about five days the postal service also has hiked rates for mail packages and other special services with these changes and staffing issues said joe cogan president of portland s local postal workers union he doesn t think the postal service is prepared for the holiday crunch i just don t know how any organization or business can survive if you re reducing service and charging more it just doesn t make sense to me he said i can tell you that the employees that i represent we want to serve our customers to the best of our ability and we believe that this action prevents us from doing that postmaster general louis dejoy has said the postal service is hiring 40 000 seasonal workers to help with the holiday rush and that the changes are needed to trim a 160 billion loss by 2030 christopher shaw an author and historian of the u s postal service said he s already hearing reports of how these changes are affecting small business owners they often depend on first class mail and have said the slowdown will impact their day to day operations shaw said he thinks some may turn to other delivery providers which could lead to further privatization of the industry these changes he said are part of a trend where the postal service is conceived of not as a public service and instead more like a for profit business which could very well lead to degradation of the service that americans have expected and received over the years the changes are part of dejoy s 10 year plan called delivering for america which includes modernizing the vehicle fleet and making investments in mail processing facilities source oregon news service
you won t get far if you follow the stairs to nowhere photo courtesy winchester mystery house san jose ca mrs winchester served as her own architect but it s possible that some ghosts had a hand in designing the house as well each night mrs winchester would retreat to her séance room and receive instruction from the spirits on the progress of her house the next morning she d present her construction workers with hand drawn sketches of what was to be done sometimes it seemed she didn t care what she built as long as she could hear the hammers of her crew the crew might spend a month constructing a room only to be ordered to destroy it the next month because mrs winchester paid well no one disputed her instructions advertisement mrs winchester had inherited 20 million and just less than half of the winchester repeating arms company stock this left her with a daily income of about 1 000 to spend on her house multiply those figures by about 20 to get an idea of how much money that would be in 2008 but what of these doors and stairs to nowhere doors may open onto walls or in the case of a second story door to the outside resulting in a big fall for anyone who might try to exit that way a closet door in the second floor séance room opens onto a first floor sink several feet below the stairs to nowhere are pretty much what they sound like stairs go up until they reach the ceiling and then they just stop the useless stairs might have a simple explanation the stairs were likely a part of the original house that mrs winchester bought and when she started adding on to the home she covered up the stairs whether it was accidentally or on purpose mrs winchester usually covered up her mistakes by just continuing to build around them because she had no master plan for the house her architectural ideas didn t always work out since she had no deadline for completion she d either tear down the mistake or cover it up with something else some people think that these touches were designed to confuse the evil spirits that were haunting mrs winchester believing that ghosts would get lost on stairs that went nowhere or accidentally step out of a door that went outside mrs winchester might have deliberately installed these weird touches if this sounds strange to you today you re not alone even at the time that mrs winchester was building the house she was regarded with suspicion some thought her an eccentric with too much money on her hands and her home took on the nickname mystery house not long after her death because mrs winchester left no diary or other communication we honestly have no idea what might have been going on her mind what we do have is her house which is still open to tourists is it a monument to madness or money is it still haunted on the next page we ll poke around inside the winchester mystery house stairway to heaven while the stairs to nowhere get a lot of attention all the stairways in the winchester house are unique most stairs in the house are only about 2 inches 5 centimeters tall the staircases zigzag back and forth going around and around in circles were these staircases also built to confuse the spirits possibly but the height of the stairs served a very specific purpose mrs winchester had very bad arthritis and these small stairs allowed her to get around
