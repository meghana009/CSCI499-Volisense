on recent earnings calls massive corporations have posted huge profits and promised continued price increases even as inflation continues to rise to rates not seen in decades for example starbucks celebrated a 31 percent increase in profits at the end of 2021 but it still plans to hike prices this year the new york times reported earlier this month tyson foods the meat processing behemoth raised its prices 19 6 percent overall driving record stock prices for the company inflation meanwhile hit a four decade high in january with the consumer price index increasing 7 5 percent over the past year before seasonal adjustment although prices dropped in the energy sector for goods like gasoline and fuel oil every other sector including medical care apparel transportation food and shelter saw increases resulting in the largest overall 12 month increase since 1982 some of that s to be expected with covid 19 still throwing kinks into the global supply chain the challenge of getting goods and materials where they need to be translates into increased prices for both companies and consumers meanwhile consumers have increased purchasing power due to wage increases and stimulus benefits like checks child tax credits and low interest rates and at least in the us they ve proven willing to pay higher prices at its core those are the necessary ingredients for inflation demand outstripping supply but some economists and politicians say that corporations are using inflation as an excuse to jack up prices beyond what s necessary to account for their increased costs more than just passing those costs onto consumers they say corporations are taking advantage of the unprecedented global economic circumstances to increase their profits simply because they can politicians like sens elizabeth warren d ma and sherrod brown d oh have recently drawn attention to what they say are outsized price increases made worse by anticompetitive corporate behavior here s the truth about inflation companies love it in reality companies aren t being forced to raise prices because of inflation they re raising prices because they can you have to watch this video from dionrabouin pic twitter com 86n5an9h3s sherrod brown sensherrodbrown february 10 2022 economists like nobel laureate joseph stiglitz see it too in a recent column stiglitz pointed to the oil industry as a particularly acute example what we are seeing today is a naked exercise of oil producers market power stiglitz wrote of rising energy prices earlier in february knowing that their days are numbered oil companies are reaping whatever returns they still can but there s plenty of pushback both political and economic to this perspective a survey of a number of leading economists by the initiative on global markets at the university of chicago s booth school of business showed that a majority of those surveyed 67 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement a significant factor behind today s higher us inflation is dominant corporations in uncompetitive markets taking advantage of their market power to raise prices in order to increase their profit margins only 7 percent of those surveyed agreed or strongly agreed with the statement i don t see the logic u s markets have been concentrating for decades but high inflation is one year old massachusetts institute of technology economist david autor wrote in response to the survey biden administration economic advisers too are disputing that message as the washington post s jeff stein reported on thursday messaging about corporate concentration leading to higher prices is currently a live debate within the administration president joe biden himself under immense pressure to address inflation has pointed out market consolidation in a few industries but hasn t gone so far as to blame it for the longer term inflation the us is experiencing this isn t a new issue biden said last month it s not been the reason we ve had high inflation today it s not the only reason but over time it has reduced competition squeezed out small businesses and farmers ranchers and increased the price for consumers but critics of major corporate price increases aren t arguing that the consolidation is the only force driving inflation rather that because these conglomerates hold so much of the market share they are able to raise prices out of step with the actual price increases they re incurring and passing on to consumers essentially that they re using the current inflationary environment as an excuse to raise prices more than necessary because they don t have competitors to drive them to keep prices down in turn contributing to the problem of inflation corporations have high pricing power driving higher costs and contributing to inflation what is clear is that we re in a highly unusual context gregory daco the chief economist at ey parthenon a global strategy consulting firm told vox according to daco companies are currently being rewarded for price hikes with higher valuations and stronger revenues so there s little incentive for them to stop doing so even if the prices aren t justified by increasing costs to corporations some price raises are to be expected there are increasing costs to supplies transportation and labor but consumers don t have a way of knowing how those increased costs factor into price rises and that s something we ll likely never figure out daco said i think it s nearly impossible to disentangle what is considered a natural if we can put that word here a natural outcome from the covid crisis from the massive injection of fiscal stimulus that led to very strong demand or very strong demand and recovery and the fact that supply was slower to come back daco told vox versus an environment where market concentration is exacerbating these price pressures because a few dominating firms have the ability to do so the inability to dismantle those two phenomena though is integral to the ability of certain businesses to continue increasing prices according to lindsay owens the executive director of progressive economic policy organization the groundwork collaborative and a former senior economic policy adviser to warren the preconditions for the price hikes we re seeing today long predate the pandemic owens told vox via email companies are able to take advantage of a crisis like the pandemic precisely because these foundations were set in place long before the crisis itself and in corporate earnings call after corporate earnings call executives are using inflation as a cover for egregious price hikes to boost their own profits as you read today s inflation report pay close attention to what the ceos who set prices are saying we got our hands on the latest batch of earnings reports and it s a doozy they re literally bragging about hiking prices while hiding behind inflation the receipts 1 7 lindsay owens phd owenslindsay1 february 10 2022 daco echoed that sentiment saying we are i think in a situation where market concentration is exacerbating inflationary dynamics warren has highlighted the meat industry as an egregious culprit calling for a justice department investigation into the industry s practices tyson is abusing their corporate market power and raking in record profits by jacking up meat prices she tweeted earlier this month i ve long argued that we need to enforce our antitrust laws to break up monopolies and promote competition and now it s more vital than ever as a tool to fight inflation tyson is abusing their corporate market power and raking in record profits by jacking up meat prices i ve long argued that we need to enforce our antitrust laws to break up monopolies and promote competition and now it s more vital than ever as a tool to fight inflation elizabeth warren senwarren february 7 2022 the biden administration has also planned to inject 1 billion into smaller independent meat processors to drive meaningful competition in the meat market after a white house economic council analysis found gross profits of the top four meat processors soared 120 percent over the course of the pandemic capitalism without competition isn t capitalism it s exploitation biden said during the january unveiling of the plan that s what we re seeing in meat and poultry industries now the only thing that will stop corporate price increases in the short term is if people buy less one way or another in the short term corporate price hikes aren t going anywhere so long as people are still willing to pay higher prices daco told vox it ll last and be sustainable as long as there is no pushback from consumers he said essentially if the price increases that are being passed on to consumers don t weigh on demand then businesses will continue to push up on prices for the time being that likely means the federal reserve will have to act to address inflation over the past year the fed has repeatedly signaled that the stimulus measures it put into place to aid in the recovery from the pandemic buying up government bonds and keeping interest rates low would have to be reversed to counter inflation and get it back to the central bank s target rate 2 percent now starting in march the fed is widely expected to start raising interest rates with two more potential hikes coming later in the year and even more by march of next year that move tamps down on inflation by making credit everything from mortgage payments to gigantic corporate loans more expensive thus decreasing purchasing power and demand slackening demand caused by a tightened monetary supply would send a fairly immediate signal to corporations that it s time to arrest ongoing price hikes other central banks such as the uk s bank of england have already begun to raise interest rates daco says the fed is lagging because it was caught a bit off guard by just how much the covid 19 pandemic affected the economy i think the fed was working under the impression that the pre covid world would return very rapidly that we would very rapidly return to a world where the inflation dynamics would be fairly soft therefore inflation would come back down toward 2 percent where you would have ongoing labor market gains where those would not stoke major inflationary pressures he told vox it s clear now he said that the fed needs to act but very carefully an excessively rapid or disorderly tightening of monetary policy could have more negative effects than desired daco said in the end what the fed wants to do is essentially proceed to the so called soft landing of monetary policy where it brings inflation back in line with its mandate it needs to allow the labor market to grow and the economy to move toward maximum employment and so without creating recession some fed officials have echoed this sentiment recently saying that a major initial rate increase isn t warranted and however interest rate increases proceed fed officials will have to weigh making a move that tightens the money supply across the board and decreases demand without tightening so far and so fast that for example businesses decide they can t afford to hire or keep workers on leading to a recession that doesn t completely negate concern about what stiglitz calls the supply side problems contributing to inflation both in terms of fixing the supply chain and in terms of addressing corporate consolidation for example robert reich a former us labor secretary warned in a guardian opinion piece on sunday that absent addressing anticompetitive behavior and other supply side issues responsibility for controlling inflation falls entirely to the federal reserve which has only one weapon at its disposal higher interest rates reich wrote higher interest rates will slow the economy and likely cause millions of lower wage workers to lose their jobs and forfeit long overdue wage increases such fixes however would likely be a long term project while the fed has the power to act now and absent some action corporations will likely continue to hike prices because they have the ability and the desire to do so as new york university economist thomas philippon told the new york times last month that s because the current unprecedented moment is just a manifestation of an underlying reality the firms were always greedy he said

elise lemire is professor of literature at purchase college suny and the author of miscegenation making race in america as well as more recently battle green vietnam the 1971 march on concord lexington and boston this past valentine s day the jury hearing a federal hate crimes case learned that four days prior to murdering ahmaud arbery a twenty five year old black man william roddie bryan who is white referred to his presumably white daughter s black boyfriend in a hateful way the associated press quoted his text message she has her now according to the ap bryan also called his daughter s boyfriend a monkey mr bryan s language makes clear that the n word is more than an insult it is a means of asserting that a black person is subhuman the revelation of mr bryan s text messages indicates that mr arbery was caught at the intersection of a set of white beliefs that crystalized between the american revolution and the civil war when descriptions and pictorial representations of blacks romantically and sexually coupling with whites proliferated in the united states the results of which were new words for describing race and race relations new laws for regulating interracial liaisons and new and deadly ways of policing black people s movements the first time the specter of interracial sex was used by whites to foment hysteria occurred in 1802 after a report was published in richmond virginia that president thomas jefferson was using sally hemings one of the hundreds of women the author of the declaration of independence enslaved on his plantation as a concubine published in the recorder or lady s and gentleman s miscellany september 1 1802 the federalist party flooded the public sphere with lascivious poems songs and political prints about the rumor some like a song supposed to have been written by the sage of monticello put words in the president s mouth that were meant to turn citizens against him of all the damsels on the green on mountain or in valley a lass so luscious ne er was seen as monticellian sally yankee doodle who s the noodle what wife were half so handy to breed a flock of slaves for stock a blackamoor s the dandy americans had coopted the british song yankee doodle during the revolution as a means of swelling patriotic fervor the federalists however invoked it to argue that the democratic republican party s investment in open elections and widespread suffrage was a dangerous endgame at a time when three fifths of the enslaved population was counted for determining representation in the house of representatives the federalists invoked the specter of interracial sex to argue that those who engaged in it were intent on increasing their wealth and power leaving less wealthy whites without either in the 1830s when abolitionists began to demand an immediate end to slavery their political opponents saturated the public sphere yet again with textual descriptions and lithographed images of abolitionists and their supporters engaged in interracial dancing kissing and marriages in many of these portrayals blacks were portrayed in profile with greatly exaggerated lips and facial angles meant like bryan s text message to link them to nonhuman primates often the whites portrayed were recognizable abolitionists such as william lloyd garrison with his distinctively lanky frame and receding hairline whites purchased these prints for home display a means of asserting that black economic and social ambitions were laughable on the grounds that blacks being monkeys were a distinct species from whites the implication was clear whites should be consolidating not giving away their political and other resources e w clay practical amalgamation 1839 courtesy of the library company of philadelphia in those days of deadly anti abolitionist riots interracial sex and marriage were described in metallurgical terms as amalgamation or a mixture of race blood this changed when a third wave of white hysteria about interracial sex and marriage broke over the country in the wake of republican president abraham lincoln s emancipation proclamation the opposing party was not pro slavery but like most whites at that time democrats wanted clearly demarcated limits to black freedom in one pamphlet published in 1864 two democrats aiming to foil lincoln s bid for re election accused him of advocating what they termed miscegenation a neologism crafted from the latin to refer to race mixing in another pamphlet published the same year an interracial couple was shown in profile to make the case yet again that a species boundary would be violated if the cause of black freedom continued to be advanced l seaman what miscegenation is and what we are to expect now that mr lincoln is re elected 1865 courtesy boston public library while the term miscegenation has almost disappeared from the american lexicon it was the term used for decades to set limits on black freedom and equity so called miscegenation laws not struck down by the supreme court until 1967 were a powerful means used by whites to deny blacks their full legal rights in short the insistence by white men that they must use legal and extralegal means to protect white women from black men has always been a proxy for white men s fear that equity will result in the loss of white power and entitlements sadly some white women as seems to have been the case with amy cooper have weaponized this history in a similar attempt to hold on to what they perceive as their white right to resources even if just a piece of parkland where their dog can roam freely a case in point in 1955 a year after brown v board of education ended racial segregation in public schools emmett till was lynched by white men who convinced themselves the black fourteen year old had flirted with a white woman since the election of the nation s first black president in 2008 the nation has been engulfed in another wave of hate crimes against african americans with ahmaud arbery just one of scores of victims roddie bryan has already been convicted on three counts of felony murder in georgia state court but because georgia did not have a state hate crimes law at the time of mr arbery s murder prosecutors shied away from mentioning race an omission that greatly pained those americans who understand that the young man would still be alive if he had been jogging while white instead because he was black mr arbery was lynched the valentine s day revelations are an opportunity for the arbery family to finally get justice for ahmaud with a declaration in court that at least so far as roddie bryan s involvement goes ahmaud arbery was another victim of the white fear that with equity will come interracial love and the end of white power

concerns of a more hawkish fed is causing volatility in the global stock market including the philippines on the positive side this is creating an opportunity for investors with a lot of excess cash to finally deploy their money and earn higher yields as interest rates on fixed income products have gone up admittedly interest rates on bank deposits remain low this is because of ample liquidity as the economy is still recovering from the pandemic and demand for loans remains weak advertisement nevertheless the yields on 5 year and 10 year government bonds are already at 4 62 percent and 5 39 percent respectively these rates are above both their respective five year historical averages and end 2019 levels an instrument that retail investors can now buy to capitalize on higher interest rates is retail treasury bonds or rtbs up to feb 28 investors with as little as p5 000 can go to several banks to buy these 5 year bonds with a coupon of 4 875 percent aside from being more affordable than other bonds the reason why i find this rtb attractive is because its coupon is higher than the 4 38 percent average yield for 5 year bonds during the past five years it is also higher than the 5 year bond rate as of end 2019 of 4 06 percent although domestic interest rates could go up some more as the us fed starts raising rates in march i believe that the impact will be more on shorter term interest rates less than five years since interest rates on longer term bonds have already gone up recently pricing in the rate hikes as mentioned earlier the 5 year and 10 year government bond rates are already at levels that are above where they were as of end 2019 prior to the pandemic personally i don t think domestic long term rates have much room to go up especially not on a sustainable basis although january inflation in the united states jumped to a 40 year high there are signs that inflation is already peaking as consumer demand is weakening and as supply bottlenecks are slowly being resolved moreover while the fed is expected to be more aggressive in raising rates this year it is still not expected to bring rates back to prepandemic levels locally inflation is under control and well within the bsp s target range of 3 percent to 4 percent also although the government now has a larger budget deficit and a higher debt level because of the pandemic the uptrend should reverse soon as economic growth is picking up this is the main reason why fitch recently affirmed its bbb rating on the philippines despite the country s higher deficit and debt level for investors with higher risk tolerance you can also buy real estate investment trusts or reits as prices of reits have also gone down because of higher interest rates advertisement the average 2022 dividend yield of philippine reits is now 5 5 percent although this is only at par with the 10 year government bond rate cash dividends of reits are taxed at only 10 percent on the other hand coupons on bonds are taxed at 20 percent as such the after tax yield of some reits is already higher than that of the benchmark government bond moreover while coupons on bonds are fixed over the life of the bond the dividends of reits go up over time due to rental escalation and yield accretive acquisitions this explains why reits whose sponsors have more mature quality rental assets that they can inject into their reit companies trade at lower yields your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up buying bonds or reits is a good way to take advantage of higher rates brought about by concerns of a more hawkish fed the decision on which instrument to buy will depend on your risk appetite with bonds being more suitable for conservative investors who want fixed returns and reits more suitable for investors who are willing to take on more risk to generate higher returns inq

of dangerous buildings in limerick city and the issues associated with falling masonry and the risk of collapse documents released under freedom of information by limerick city and county council show a catalogue of dangerous structures the council keeps a register of dangerous buildings and released correspondence from their engineers regarding the action taken to make the structures safe the local authority identifies problem structures and issues orders for engineering studies to be carried out on them and then use powers to compel the owner to carry out emergency remedial work read more here on how to support a major noteworthy project to examine if limerick city will ever get the chance it was promised to eliminate deprivation the most dangerous building is on lower hartstonge street in the city identified in the documents as being an immediate danger by engineers a council engineering report in september 2021 stated that the upper structures of the building were in an extremely dangerous condition internal rafters bracing the structure have clearly failed and this has caused the upper portion of the external wall to bulge outwards the stability of upper portion of the external wall is now extremely questionable the report reads horizontal movement of the upper part of the external wall has caused the roof parapet upstand to deviate inwards posing a risk to any occupants within the terraced structure this property in its current condition represents a clear health and safety risk to users of the adjacent footway roadway there are also problem buildings in

comprehensive derelict structures register with 290 buildings listed these are spread across the county and metropolitan area there is a large volume of derelict buildings in the city s suburbs and in villages across the county s rural towns and villages advertisement in keeping with our previous study of cork city the journal set about looking at dangerous structures in the city centre we eliminated the structures outside the immediate core business district of the city and found 58 buildings which are derelict a geoview residential buildings report for the last three months of 2021 showed that the national residential vacancy rate is 4 4 per cent that would suggest a one in 20 properties in ireland are empty or derelict in a previous article we examined the dangerous buildings and dereliction in cork city in that study councillors stated that much of leeside s difficulties were because of building owners keeping hold of their properties so as to sell them when the price was right in the market councillor catherine slattery cathaoirleach of the limerick metropolitan area echoed that view and suggested that landlords speculating on the property market could be to blame for derelict structures the council are very active on the dangerous buildings in the city centre and they react very quickly she said they carry out engineer reports and have a system in place where they move rapidly to either solve the problem or get the building demolished the lower hartstonge street building was quickly identified as a risk and they have closed off the footpath and are making efforts to get that solved i must compliment the council on their work on dangerous buildings but there is a very real problem with derelict houses where there is not enough being done to refurbish them i have no issue with how dangerous buildings are being dealt with they are very active and get plans to either fix or demolish the structures we do have a problem with derelict houses the landlords are getting grants and contracts from the council to refurbish houses and get them out onto the register property speculating slattery believes that like in cork landlords are sitting on good properties in the hope that the value of the building increases i am aware of houses which are lying derelict the next door neighbours are then suffering the consequence of dampness and rats she said the landlords are offered a great scheme they get a grant to repair the structure and lease it back to the council it is a win win the council get to take someone off the housing list and that person gets housed it is generally a 35 year deal but i have examples of buildings where two years down the line nothing has happened you can t blame the council totally for this there are landlords out there it is beginning to look like that some landlords may be property speculating hoping property prices rise and get more money for the property slattery believes that landlords need to be held to account for derelict and at times dangerous buildings there are some issues in the city which i have come across some streets particularly georgian buildings where they have been done out in one bed flats for people i ve have noticed that these properties need to be refurbished it feels like they are renting out to people but do not provide proper amenities she added

new york feb 20 2022 globe newswire mesoblast limited nasdaq meso asx msb global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases today announced positive results from an interim analysis of the first patient cohort in the randomized controlled study of remestemcel l by direct endoscopic delivery to areas of inflammation in patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis or crohn s colitis a single local delivery of remestemcel l by colonoscopy resulted in rapid mucosal healing and disease remission in these refractory patients at high risk of progression to surgery the results of the first cohort of patients were presented at the 17th congress of european crohn s and colitis organisation ecco february 16 19 by the trial s lead investigator dr amy l lightner associate professor of surgery in the department of colon and rectal surgery at cleveland clinic and were published in the journal of crohn s and colitis 1 2 mesenchymal stromal cells remestemcel l offer a safe therapeutic for the treatment of medically refractory ulcerative colitis and crohn s colitis said dr lightner early data suggests improved clinical and endoscopic scores as early as two weeks following remestemcel l delivery the study at cleveland clinic will randomize up to 48 patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis or crohn s colitis in a 2 1 fashion to receive a single intervention with remestemcel l at a dose of 150 300 million cells or placebo delivered via direct injection using a 23 g sclerotherapy needle at the time of colonoscopy medically refractory ulcerative colitis and crohn s colitis patients are defined as having active disease for at least 6 months and having lost response to at least one monoclonal antibody anti tnf or anti integrin medically refractory crohn s colitis patients exclude small bowel involvement and colorectal strictures outcomes are evaluated by validated endoscopic and clinical scoring systems at 2 weeks 6 weeks and 3 months post intervention 3 4 key results of the interim analysis performed in the first 12 enrolled patients were as follows colonoscopic delivery of remestemcel l was not associated with any treatment related adverse events all ulcerative colitis patients treated with remestemcel l had improved clinical and endoscopy scores within two weeks as defined by the mayo clinical score and mayo endoscopic severity mes score and all achieved clinical and endoscopic remission by six weeks all ulcerative colitis patients were extremely satisfied or satisfied with remestemcel l treatment at three months based on the inflammatory bowel disease patient reported treatment impact ibd prti and response was described as excellent or good in all patients all crohn s colitis patients treated with remestemcel l showed treatment remissions or responses by three months as measured by the simple endoscopy score for crohn s disease ses cd mean score 17 at baseline decreased to 5 at three months remestemcel l treatment resulted in reduction of fecal calprotectin a validated biomarker of disease activity 5 from mean of 231 at baseline to 67 at three months indicative of remission from mean of 231 at baseline to 67 at three months indicative of remission in controls with ulcerative colitis and crohn s colitis over three months endoscopy scores increased fecal calprotectin levels increased from a mean of 330 to 505 and clinical responses were described as poor or unchanged mesoblast chief medical officer dr eric rose said we are delighted to be involved with dr lightner and her team at cleveland clinic in this latest cutting edge study this randomized controlled trial is the first to evaluate local delivery of remestemcel l directly into the inflamed colon using objective endoscopic measures of mucosal healing in patients with colitis who are at high risk of surgical resection of their colon about inflammatory bowel disease according to recent estimates more than three million people 1 3 in the us alone have inflammatory bowel disease with more than 33 000 new cases of crohn s disease and 38 000 new cases of ulcerative colitis diagnosed every year 6 8 despite recent advances approximately 30 of patients are primarily unresponsive to anti tnfα agents and even among responders up to 10 will lose their response to the drug every year up to 80 of patients with medically refractory crohn s disease and 20 of patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis eventually require surgical treatment of their disease 9 10 which can have a devastating impact on quality of life about objective measures of disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease objective measurement of disease activity can be achieved by endoscopy histopathology imaging and biomarkers 3 fecal calprotectin is a very sensitive biomarker for inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract with the presence of calprotectin a result of neutrophil migration into the gastrointestinal tissue due to an inflammatory process 5 it is used for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and crohn s disease for monitoring disease activity and response to treatment for prediction of disease relapse and post operative recurrence in inflammatory bowel disease and for predicting those patients at highest risk of progressing to bowel resection 5 regulatory guidance recommends that registration trials of potential therapies for ulcerative colitis use primary endpoints incorporating both endoscopy and patient reported outcomes pros 3 clinical trials for ulcerative colitis most commonly use the mayo endoscopic subscore mes and the composite mayo clinic score fda has consistently recommended the inclusion of endoscopic evaluation of mucosal healing in crohn s disease as a co primary endpoint to ensure that a clinical improvement is accompanied by a benefit in the underlying disease process simple endoscopic score for crohn s disease ses cd is a reliable and responsive instrument 4 but correlates poorly with symptoms the current regulatory recommendation for trial eligibility is an ses cd score 6 to define baseline endoscopic disease severity with endoscopic remission defined by an ses cd score of 0 to 2 and endoscopic response defined by a 50 reduction in the ses cd score from baseline

chicago feb 20 2022 prnewswire mcdonald s corporation nyse mcd board of directors today issued the following statement in response to a director notification nomination from carl icahn mcdonald s can confirm that carl icahn has nominated leslie samuelrich and maisie ganzler to stand for election at the 2022 annual meeting there is no shareholder action required at this time the board will evaluate the nominees as it would any other candidates proposed to it the board utilizes director selection process guidelines to evaluate nominees which were updated in 2020 to more closely align with the company s values and the strategic drivers of its business strategy mr icahn s stated focus in making this nomination relates to a narrow issue regarding the company s pork commitment which the humane society u s has already introduced through a shareholder proposal this is an issue on which mcdonald s has been a leader the company sources only approximately 1 of u s pork production and does not own any sows or produce or package pork in the united states nevertheless in 2012 it became the first major brand to make a commitment to source from producers who do not use gestational crates for pregnant sows since making this commitment mcdonald s has led the industry and today an estimated 30 35 of u s pork production has moved to group housing systems mcdonald s pioneering commitment was shaped with the industry and the american association of swine veterinarians and builds on the company s decades long commitment to animal health and welfare and its overall esg strategy by the end of 2022 the company expects to source 85 to 90 of its u s pork volumes from sows not housed in gestation crates during pregnancy despite industry wide challenges for farmer and producers such as the covid 19 pandemic and global swine disease outbreaks the company expects 100 of its u s pork will come from sows housed in groups during pregnancy by the end of 2024 for more information on mcdonald s commitments please visit our animal health welfare page mr icahn who states that he holds 200 shares of mcdonald s stock is the majority owner of viskase a company that produces and supplies packaging for the pork and poultry industry mr icahn s ownership provides him with unique exposure to the industry wide challenges and opportunities in migrating away from gestation crates thus it s noteworthy that mr icahn has not publicly called on viskase to adopt commitments similar to those of mcdonald s 2012 commitment despite mcdonald s progress mr icahn has instead asked for new commitments including to require all of mcdonald s u s pork suppliers to move to crate free pork and set specific timeframes for doing so while the company looks forward to promoting further collaboration across the industry on this issue the current pork supply in the u s would make this type of commitment impossible furthermore it reflects a departure from the veterinary science used for large scale production throughout the industry and would harm the company s shared pursuit of providing customers with high quality products at accessible prices mcdonald s board of directors takes seriously its role to ensure sustainable value creation for shareholders while acting on some of the world s most pressing social and environmental challenges that are important to our stakeholders the board has long been committed to good corporate governance and has the right balance of skills experiences and perspectives to fulfill the company s obligation to shareholders while providing strong oversight under the director selection process guidelines the board considers criteria including a candidate s ability to represent the interests of all shareholders of the company their demonstrated knowledge of corporate governance matters applicable to u s based multi national companies and their ability and willingness to devote specific time to board duties the mcdonald s board looks forward to continuing to oversee long term growth for the company s shareholders and all stakeholders about mcdonald s mcdonald s is the world s leading global foodservice retailer with more than 40 000 locations in over 100 countries approximately 93 of mcdonald s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local business owners forward looking statements this release contains certain forward looking statements which reflect management s expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date hereof these forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission such as its annual and quarterly reports and current reports on form 8 k the company undertakes no obligation to update such forward looking statements except as may otherwise be

san francisco and suzhou china feb 20 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announced the first patient dosing for its first in class igg based universal modular claudin 18 2 targeting chimeric antigen receptor t car t cell product development code ibi345 for the treatment of advanced claudin18 2 positive solid tumors in an investigator initiated trial iit since innovent announced its strategic cooperation with roche on june 9 2020 this is the first disclosure of the development milestone for the cell therapy products based on roche s proprietary innovative technology platform the study nct05199519 is an investigator initiated clinical trial with the primary objective of evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ibi345 in subjects with claudin18 2 positive solid tumors car t cell therapy has established a meaningful role in the treatment of hematological tumors with 5 products approved by the fda and 2 by the nmpa in china respectively however antitumor efficacy for solid tumors remains a challenge calling for technological breakthroughs as the world s first universal modular car t cell product ibi345 has potentially differentiated advantages over conventional car t cell therapy products including 1 leveraging antibody function to target tumor antigens and consequently amplifying the tumor antigen signal to guide car t cells to enter the tumor thus aiding in the initiation of tumor recognition and killing 2 controlling the functional activity of the car t cells via concomitantly administered antibodies which act as a bridge between the target cell and car t cell potentially providing a better safety profile 3 allows for the sequential or simultaneous administration of more than one antibody targeting different antigen targets without changing car t cells to treat tumors with highly heterogeneous antigen expression or relapsed tumors due to antigen loss thereby improving the accessibility and increasing the flexibility of car t cell therapy for patients the principal investigator of the study professor weichang chen the secretary of the party committee and chief physician of the department of gastroenterology of the first hospital affiliated to soochow university pointed out as gastric and pancreatic cancer are highly aggressive tumors with high incidence rates in the world patients are in urgent need of novel treatment options to improve clinical outcomes ibi345 with its unique design to control car t functional activity through the antibody bridging will likely provide improved safety and efficacy we look forward to the positive results of the safety tolerability and efficacy data of ibi345 in patients with solid tumors which will potentially provide a new option for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric or pancreatic cancer dr xu wei vp of innovent r d head of cell therapy said ibi345 is a highly differentiated car t cell product with a new mechanism of action developed by innovent based on roche s proprietary technology as a universal modular car t cell therapy product equipped with a precisely targeted antibody switch it regulates the expansion of car t cells to control side effects potentially providing an opportunity to switch to another antibody that targets different antigens to prevent recurrence and treat different tumors our preclinical studies have validated this modular car t technology which provides us with the sufficient scientific data to initiate clinical studies in the following clinical studies we will explore the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ibi345 and optimize the clinical dosage and regimen to support the subsequent ind application we firmly believe that innovent will be able to introduce more innovative cell therapies through platform technology innovation product transformation and in depth collaboration with the clinical academic community that will ultimately benefit more patients and families about claudin 18 2 claudin protein is a critical component of tight junction complex molecules which play an important role in the life activities of the human body on the one hand tight junctions can function as a barrier to select the size and charge of substances thereby regulating the transport of substances in the para cellular pathway for example brain vascular endothelial cells can pass through this barrier preventing blood from mixing with the extracellular fluid in the brain on the other hand tight junctions can also function as fences maintaining cell polarity by regulating the free diffusion of lipids and proteins between the apical and the basolateral membrane claudin18 2 is a member of the claudin protein family which is a highly tissue specific protein expressed only in differentiated epithelial cells on the gastric mucosa under normal physiological conditions previous studies have revealed that claudin18 2 is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer such as gastric cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma the unique feature of limited expression in normal tissues and highly specific expression in cancer makes claudin18 2 an ideal target for developing the immunotherapeutic for solid tumors globally there is currently no therapy targeting claudin18 2 approved for marketing but there are many candidate therapies in clinical development the drug modalities under development include monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies antibody conjugated drugs and car t cell products about gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma gastric and pancreatic cancer are both malignant tumors of the digestive system that seriously endanger human life and health the latest global cancer statistics show that there will be about 1 089 million new cases of gastric cancer worldwide in 2020 accounting for 5 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 768 000 deaths accounting for 7 7 of the global cancer deaths there are about 495 000 new cases of pancreatic cancer accounting for 2 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 466 000 deaths accounting for 4 7 of the global cancer deaths according to the national cancer statistics released by the national cancer center of china in 2019 the incidence of gastric cancer in china in 2015 was about 403 000 accounting for 10 26 of the total cancer incidence second only to lung cancer at 20 03 with an incidence rate of 29 31 100 000 people and about 291 000 deaths accounting for 12 45 of the total cancer deaths behind lung and liver cancer with a mortality rate of 21 16 100 000 people in 2015 the number of cases and deaths of pancreatic cancer nationwide were 95 000 and 85 000 respectively ranking the 10th and 6th in the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors the mortality ratio of pancreatic cancer was 0 89 making it a true king of cancer despite the treatment progress in recent years drug resistance recurrence and metastasis are still inevitable the 5 year survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer is about 5 20 and the median survival rate is about 10 months pancreatic cancer has a worse prognosis with a 5 year survival rate of only 6 to 8 about ibi345 ibi345 is the first universal modular car t cell product developed by innovent based on roche s proprietary technology it is an internationally pioneered highly differentiated car t cell product with a new mechanism of action different from conventional car t cells that directly recognize and kill tumor cells ibi345 comprises of two components anti claudin18 2 antibodies and modular car t cells where anti claudin18 2 antibody recognizes tumor antigen thus calibrating and amplifying the antigen signal and guides modular car t cells to enter the tumor to initiate the cytotoxic and antitumor activity of car t cells compared with conventional car t cells ibi345 has a variety of potential advantages including dual effects of antibodies and car t cells to increase antitumor efficacy and flexible control of side effects by regulating car t cell activity through antibodies in addition as having a universal car molecule modular car t cells can be easily switched to different antibodies without changing car t cells by sequentially or simultaneously administering more than one antibody targeting different antigen targets to treat tumors with highly heterogeneous antigen expression or antigen loss relapsed tumors which holds a great potential to reduce the cost of car t cell therapy and improve the accessibility of car t cell therapy for patients innovent announced that first patient dosing has been completed in february 2022 in the investigator initiated clinical trial of ibi345 for the treatment of advanced claudin18 2 positive solid tumors and enrollment is currently ongoing the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ibi345 will be explored and the clinical dosage and regimen will be explored to provide clinical data support for the subsequent ind application about innovent inspired by the spirit of start with integrity succeed through action

ten years ago la palina cigars released a new line with a relatively unique backstory according to the company the cigar was jokingly referred to as the kill bill or kb for short during its initial testing stages after founder bill paley couldn t finish smoking the first prototype due to the blend s overwhelming strength originally an extension of la palina s el diario line the blend debuted in a 4 1 4 x 40 petit corona that was packaged in four pack cartons that began shipping in march 2012 later that same year la palina released a second vitola in the kill bill series a 6 x 40 corona gorda appropriately named kill bill ii while the blend was the same as the original kill bill the larger size was packaged in boxes of 30 instead of cartons not much new was heard from the line until the 2021 pca convention trade show when la palina showed off a new incarnation of the kill bill series made up of four different regular production vitolas including the two original sizes that have been renamed as part one and part two each vitola is being sold in 30 count boxes that feature updated artwork specifically paley is featured on the front of the new boxes with his eyes crossed out while the back of the bands feature a line that says he s almost dead anyway blend wise each of the newest versions of the kill bill incorporates a honduran corojo wrapper covering a honduran criollo double binder as well as nicaraguan corojo and criollo tobacco in the filler however according to the company the blend was tweaked in the two new sizes part three and part four by adding higher primings of ligero the kb series is currently made up of four different sizes that are being produced at the raíces cubanas factory located in danlí honduras kb series part one 4 1 4 x 40 kb series part two 6 x

released regular production regular production number of cigars smoked for review 3 surprisingly i can smell the la palina kb series part three even before i take it out of the cellophane fully a combination of strong sweet berries earth leather oak and cinnamon the wrapper is a very attractive mocha brown color with a reddish tint and plenty of oil as well as sandpaper rough to the touch and nicely firm when squeezed an extremely aggressive aroma emanating from the foot has me almost convinced the cigar is flavored with the same sweet berries cloves milk chocolate oak and apple juice sweetness interestingly after a v cut the cold draw features an entirely different set of flavors none of which are even close to as sweet as the aforementioned aroma that includes strong oak earth leather tack espresso beans hay and slight varnish while it is a bit odd to smell something so sweet on a non infused cigar while lighting the foot the first few puffs make it clear that this is a non infused blend pretty quickly the profile starts out both earthy and spicy on the palate while the earth note easily remains one of the top flavors in the first third it is joined by a strong note of roasted coffee beans in addition there is a bit of mineral saltiness on my lips along with secondary flavors that include baker s spices nutmeg hay cocoa nibs and oak the latter of which seems to be increasing more noticeably as the first third burns down there is plenty of black pepper on the retrohale but almost no sweetness other than brown sugar and precious little of that but an interesting peanut note does creep into the profile every now and then on two samples if only for a few moments flavor and body are medium while the strength which started at just under medium builds quickly and is just over medium by the end of the first third finally the draw is a bit of a mixed bag after v cuts one sample is slightly more loose than i would like while the other two have no issues and although the burn is far from perfect none of the cigars are problematic enough to need corrections it is hard not to notice how slow this cigar is burning as the second third begins after more than 45 minutes of smoking time there is a bit more spice on my tongue compared to the first third but less saltiness on my lips and while the earthy flavor easily retains its top status in the profile a new flavor of creamy oak has overtaken every other note to reign alongside it additional flavors of leather hay sourdough bread nutmeg and espresso beans all make themselves known at various points while the retrohale remains about the same plenty of black pepper slight brown sugar sweetness and some nuttiness every once in a while thankfully the draw has tightened up on my one problematic cigar the other two continue to give me no issues in that regard but the same cannot be said of the burn which needs attention from my lighter on two samples before the halfway point flavor has increased slightly to just over medium while the body remains at a solid medium but the strength has increased to medium full and is still rising gritty earth and creamy oak are the kings of the mountain when it comes to the la palina s profile in the final third but a very interesting citrus peel note has become more noticeable on the finish as well the strength level which has easily reached the full mark by the middle of the final third starts to really affect the overall balance meaning that although i can still taste additional flavors of cocoa nibs leather tack hay toasted bread and cloves my enjoyment of the cigar is waning a bit that fact is not help much by the amount of aggressive black pepper that continues to dominate the retrohale which all but drowns out that vast majority of whatever sweetness remained in the profile construction wise the draws on all three samples give me no issues whatsoever and while the burn needs a couple of touch ups on two cigars they are both pretty minor flavor and body mirror each other by ending up just over medium but as previously noted the strength easily hits the full mark before i put the nub down with about an inch remaining final notes interestingly there was a third vitola in the kill bill series measuring 4 1 2 x 54 which was shown off during the 2016 ipcpr convention trade show which i photographed when i covered the la palina booth that year however according to sam phillips president of la palina that size was only released 0nce to a very small number of retailers and was never produced again la palina has stated that despite the obvious difference in ring gauges all four of the vitolas were blended to share a common flavor profile fresh out of the cellophane this cigar smells so sweet i honestly had to look up the details to make sure it was not infused having said that other than a very fleeting brown sugar note there is almost no sweetness on the palate finish or retrohale of the cigar making this one of the most distinct juxtapositions of a profile that i have smoked in a very long time as noted above the words he s almost dead anyway are printed on the inside of band under a depiction of paley s face with his eyes xed out i look forward to doing a redux review of this cigar to see if the strength calms down significantly and if so what impact that will have on both the flavors in the profile and the balance there are a multitude of flavors that are trying to punch through but are held back from affecting the profile by the overwhelming combination of black pepper and strength with a final smoking time that averaged just under two hours one hour and 51 minutes to be exact this cigar burns at an incredibly slow pace a rate that was only accentuated by me slowing down as the profile became stronger near the end the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel none of our retail sponsors have the la palina kb series part three in stock but atlantic cigar co has other vitolas for sale on its website here 85 overall score you know how you hear or read a cigar is really really strong but then you smoke it and think oh what are they thinking this is like medium at best well the la palina kb series part three is not one of those in fact this is a powerhouse from almost the first puff and by the halfway point of the first sample i was wishing i had eaten a much more substantial breakfast of course having that much strength in a blend has consequences specifically when it comes to the balance of the cigar which while not nearly as bad as it could be in the

behalf of private insurers its main source of revenue is commissions from selling medicare advantage medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug policies on january 1 2018 ehealth adopted and implemented a new accounting standard for recognizing revenue this standard referred to herein as accounting standard codification 606 or asc 606 allowed ehealth to recognize immediately the entirety of the commissions it expected to receive over the expected life of the policies although ehealth sold annual policies that could be cancelled at any time by the consumer it assumed that its policies would be renewed for several years consequently for many of ehealth s medicare related policies it recognized between three and five years of commissions immediately upon the sale of the policy the complaint in the class action alleges that the assumption that ehealth s customers would renew its policies was unrealistic and contrary to ehealth s recent experience of both cancellations and renewals beginning in 2017 ehealth started soliciting medicare customers with television advertising late night commercials boasting 0 monthly plan premiums effectively generated a surge in customers in a short period of time between 2017 and 2018 the number of medicare related insurance applications submitted to ehealth by applicants grew by 39 these customers however were notorious for cancelling their policies in short periods of time causing ehealth to experience sky rocketing member churn ratios i e the percentage of customers who cancel their policies within the first year notwithstanding ehealth was able to provide analysts and investors with record setting earnings due to the fact that it was able to recognize three to five years of commission revenue for these policies upfront and immediately the complaint further alleges that class members were materially harmed by ehealth s false and misleading statements as a direct result of defendants materially false and misleading statements ehealth s stock price artificially increased from a relative steady price of around 15 32 per share of common stock on march 19 2018 to 136 32 prior to april 8 2020 it was on that day that muddy waters capital a well known and highly respected research firm published a report revealing ehealth s accounting misconduct the report disclosed among other things that ehealth s highly aggressive accounting masks a significantly unprofitable business that the key driver of growth since 2018 has been ehth s reliance on direct response television advertising which attracts an unprofitable high churn enrollee that ehth s persistence assumptions in its ltv model seem highly aggressive when compared to reality muddy waters report also disclosed that ehealth s financial statements for 2019 a overstated revenue by 128 million b overstated operating profit by 263 million and c understated an operating loss of 181 million the muddy waters report resulted in a sharp

overall market turnover to more than 62 per cent transactions on the trio of access bank plc guaranty trust holding company gtco and fidelity bank accounted for more than 29 per cent of the total

commission sec public companies now have the option of filing the unaudited fourth quarter financial statement within 30 days after the end of the quarter and file annual audited financial statements within 90 days after the year end alternatively public companies may not file the fourth quarter unaudited returns but file the yearly audited financial statements within 60 days after the year end every public company is expected to adopt a filing regime and strictly adhere to its preferred filing option any public company that fails to abide by an adopted filing regime will be deemed a violator of section 60 of the investments and securities act 2007 in the coming weeks we expect the ngx floor to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish their audited 2021 full year numbers accompanied by dividend declarations we believe this would provide a catalyst for buying activities even as risk averse investors are likely to remain cautious due to medium term expectations of an uptick in fixed income yields overall we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings cordros capital stated in a weekend investment advisory note analysts at afrinvest securities said they anticipated that bargain purchase activities would drive a modest

should grow at above trend rate in 2022 given that recovery from the covid 19 related downturn hasn t been completed and some sectors continue to operate below capacity risks to our growth outlook are squarely on the downside and include a delayed exit from the pandemic a deeper slowdown in china and bumpy transition from recovery related ultra accommodative policies to generally tighter steady state expansion policies s p global ratings stated the rating agency noted that inflation continues to rise in many ems because of higher fuel and food prices and supply chain disruptions according to the report imported inflation is an important factor as export prices across major trading partners have shot up and this effect is in some cases compounded by weaker currencies unlike in advanced

level since july 2011 with little signs of receding in the near term at the same time exporters and factories are struggling with supply chain disruptions shortages shipping delays and chronic port congestion imported inflation is also an important factor because export prices in major trading partners have shot up and this effect is in some cases compounded by weaker currencies s p global ratings stated the rating agency however noted that inflation would soon peak as there are signs that inflation is starting to slightly ease as supply bottlenecks unjam higher prices weaken demand and

banks worried about risk are turning away the owners of independent atms a lifeline to the underbanked one of the ellis atms at a liquor and smoke shop in tucson arizona such atms are often used by people in places where there are few bank branches photos by cassidy araiza for the wall street journal dozens of banks had rejected ann marie and dan ellis when they opened bank of america corp checking accounts last february to fund their southern arizona network of automated teller machines in april the bank closed the accounts their money used to fund around 450 000 in weekly customer withdrawals was frozen branch managers told them to call the bank s risk and fraud department banks are cutting off small business owners who run the independent atms found in america s gas stations bars and bodegas atm operators say it is getting harder to find a bank willing to hold the funds needed to keep their machines stocked with cash the banks that will work with them atm operators say are jacking up their fees for banks it is a simple matter of risk the sole product of atms is cash which can make them a convenient way for criminals to launder the proceeds of their illegal activities a bank that does business with unscrupulous atm owners could face the wrath of regulators for violating anti money laundering rules legitimate businesses and their customers get caught in the middle independent atms serve as a lifeline to people in areas where traditional banks have retrenched an estimated 90 billion was withdrawn from the roughly 225 000 non bank atms in the u s in 2020 according to the latest data from research and consulting firm rbr basically our atm is their bank said ms ellis who with her husband built a network of around 100 atms during their 21 years in the business the couple relied on loans from friends and family while they waited for bank of america to release their money bank of america declined to comment atm owners typically need at least two bank accounts to run their business one account holds the cash that they use to stock the atms and receives deposits from the user s bank when a withdrawal is made the other account collects the fee an atm user pays for the convenience of withdrawing cash from the machine the funds flowing out of an atm owner s bank account into a cash machine should roughly match the deposits coming in if the inflows are greater than the outflows that could indicate that the owner is stocking the machine with additional cash perhaps the proceeds of criminal behavior atm operators were among the businesses that got caught up in the justice department s operation choke point an investigation launched in 2013 into banks dealings with companies seen as more likely to be involved in illegal activity rather than go after the companies individually prosecutors targeted the financial infrastructure keeping them in business choking them off from the very air they need to survive a department official told the wall street journal at the time the initiative ended in 2017 but the account shutdowns didn t banks continued to rely on regulatory guidance that warned independent atm operators were a higher fraud and money laundering risk late last year following a yearslong lobbying push by atm owners that earned the backing of lawmakers from both parties regulators softened the guidance language discouraging banks from working with atm owners was replaced with an acknowledgment of their role in bringing financial services to underserved areas but atm owners say the new guidance has done little to make their lives easier bank ozk recently shut down deposit accounts of several board members of the national atm council inc the industry s trade group citing risk bank ozk declined to comment curt selman s account was among them and it wasn t the first time jpmorgan chase co regions financial corp and a local community bank had previously cut him off the window is getting smaller and i just wonder when the music stops who ll be there said mr selman who now has accounts with simmons bank and veritex community bank jpmorgan and regions declined to comment atm owners say they tend to place their machines in areas where there are fewer bank branches and many customers rely on them to access their paychecks and government benefits dan ellis works on an atm at his home in tucson arizona rev nathan jordan put an atm in his grocery store in hattiesburg miss about nine months ago after fielding requests from customers the nearest bank is about 4 miles away he said and many people in the area don t drive it s very hard for people to get access to loans and financial services he said the community i live in the people have been denied access for so long katiki hinton has an account at a credit union that is about 15 miles away from her home the 47 year old caregiver relies on the atm at rev jordan s store to get cash to pay her light and water bills and to go grocery shopping i d rather pay the atm fee than pay 20 in gas she said it makes a big difference the relationship between atm owners and banks is complex because the two are also competitors when people use their debit cards at independent atms the bank that issued the card pays a fee to the atm s owner that interchange fee is set by card networks atm owners say their cut of the fee has fallen in some cases banks have put pressure on the merchants that provide space to atm operators jay osman who runs a string of atms in mississippi said he had to remove a few machines after a local bank told its customers that it would charge them 200 a month for having an atm in their store in a december 2020 letter reviewed by the journal the citizens bank of philadelphia mississippi cited state and federal regulations that view privately owned atms as high risk and requiring enhanced due diligence by banks as the reason for the charge mr osman said he repeatedly told bank employees that the merchants aren t handling the cash in his atms he said the bank declined to change its policy it didn t respond to requests for comment after bank of america shut down their accounts the ellises began relying more on another bank they worked with bmo harris the bank told the ellises they had to hire armored trucks to transport the cash and it later increased their fees and limited the amount of money they could withdraw to make up the difference they opened accounts at a comerica inc branch roughly 100 miles away their banking costs have swelled to about 2 000 a month up from roughly 400 that includes 600 in rent for office space needed to accept deliveries from the armored trucks which comerica also required bmo harris which reversed the fee increase after the journal contacted the bank declined to comment personally transporting large sums of cash in and out of the banking center increases the risk to the safety of our customers and colleagues so we work to ensure the safest possible environment a comerica spokeswoman said the couple raised fees on some of their atms by 50 cents to cover the extra costs it was a nightmare said mr ellis it s knocked 10 years off my life

electric vehicles to white collar office goers for last mile connectivity the pandemic was a body blow for all mobility companies and yulu found itself in a downward spiral as work from home took over but something changed after the second wave of covid in 2021 the demand for delivery workers skyrocketed amid rising demand for home delivery of both food and essential goods we treated them like a

introducing a slew of new products to help them earn interest on their deposits or draw loans against them without attracting the new tax the budget proposed a 30 tax on returns from digital currencies and a 1 tax deducted at source tds on digital assets the government has not used the term cryptocurrency in the budget but rather virtual digital assets but this means there shouldn t be any tax on crypto based products some founders and investors said the way the regulations are today investors who invest in crypto based products should not be covered either under the 1 tds or 30 tax on income however we have sought clarity on this from the government and will be approaching them in this regard said darshan bathija cofounder and chief executive of vauld a singapore based cryptocurrency exchange crypto platform executives said if crypto based products are not taxed demand from investors could shoot up it tax will increase our operations as people will prefer to take out a loan on their crypto holding instead of selling it to avoid the tax said kumar gaurav founder and ceo of cashaa it will also boost long term holders who will use our savings account to generate passive income without trading which will trigger tds complications he added cryptocurrencies crashed over the weekend as the threat of russia invading ukraine escalated causing the crypto investor

volatility and descending trends that s the path the markets are taking these days while the usual headwinds are all in play the chief worry now is coming from eastern europe will russia invade or won t it a shooting conflict involving a superpower taking place in one of europe s most agriculturally productive and mineral rich countries has huge potential for political and economic fallout enough to keep pundits and market watchers awake at night but an in depth analysis of geopolitical events over the past several decades by truist advisory would suggest that investors may not need to worry quite so much the firm looked at 12 major events including the cuban missile crisis of 1962 the iran hostage crisis of 1979 and the iraq war of 2003 and followed market fluctuations for a year after each event on average the s p 500 gained 8 6 in the post event period the index posted a one year gain in 9 of the 12 periods examined truist s co chief investment officer keith lerner sums up this findings saying when you look at the history of geopolitical events they tend to have a short term impact on the markets and as long as they don t drive you into recession then the markets tend to rebound the conclusion is that we don t think investors should overreact to this situation by itself with all of this in mind let s take a look at two stocks that have shown sharp losses recently and are still showing substantial upside suggesting they may jump when the geopolitical situation calms down according to the latest tipranks data both are strong buy stocks and both show potential for triple digit percentage gains in the coming months porch group prch the first stock we re looking at is porch group an online service company offering software and platforms that connect homeowners with the services they need to maintain and improve their properties these include home improvement and warranty contracting moving and home inspection taken together porch can connect customers with service providers in every segment of the 500 billion annual home improvement market the company went public in december of 2020 through a spac transaction and the shares saw a volatile 2021 before falling sharply from their november peak into the beginning of this year the stock is down 68 from that peak it s important to note however that even as porch s share price has declined the company has continued to execute on its expansionary strategy it announced in december the addition of the newest module in its software offerings for home inspection services the inspection support network the new module allows homebuyers and agents to pay for inspections at the home closing in another expansion move in january the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiary homeowners of america hoa announced that it is introducing services in new mexico and montana hoa now operates in 14 states porch s expansion continues and the company is looking forward to its 4q21 earnings release set for march 1 in the last release for 3q21 the company increased its full year 2021 revenue guidance from 187 5 million to 195 million achieving the new guidance will put the company on track for 170 year over year revenue growth looking at porch for berenberg bank analyst nate crosset gives an upbeat take on the broad picture prch s differentiated business model essentially gives home service providers early access to high intent customers i e new homebuyers delivering solid growth the company has a substantial tam with low penetration which we believe leaves room for growth while continued m a execution could increase the tam lastly we believe the street is underappreciating prch s differentiated business model and solid growth we think prch deserves a higher multiple crosset opined crosset thinks the stock has some way to go and by some way we mean 157 of upside those are the returns investors are looking at should the stock make it all the way to crosset s 21 price target no need to add the analyst s rating is a buy to watch crossett s track record click here overall even though this stock s price is down the analysts remain bullish prch has 4 positive reviews for a unanimous strong buy consensus rating the shares are selling for 8 15 and their 21 63 average price target suggests a strong upside of 165 for the year ahead see prch stock forecast at tipranks renewable energy group regi from homes we ll turn to energy renewable energy group regi is in the biofuel business producing renewable fuels for a variety of markets the company has facilities to produce distribute and retail a wide range of fuels including biodiesel and other transportation fuels oils for blended heating fuels and bio based glycerine and methyl esters for industrial and agricultural uses the company has 12 biorefineries ten located in the united states and two in germany eleven of its biorefineries produce biodiesel while its geismar la biorefinery produces renewable diesel these assets have allowed regi to post two consecutive quarters 2q21 and 3q21 of rising revenues the 3q21 result the last reported of 1 01 billion was up 22 from q2 and an impressive 73 year over year the company attributed the gains to higher average selling prices in the past six months earnings per share also rose although not as much as revenues the 83 cent eps reports in q3 was up from 60 cents a gain of 38 but was only half the q2 value of 1 62 the divergence reflects the volatile nature of the fuel industry in recent weeks regi has been expanding its operations in january the company acquired amber resources a california based distributor of gasoline diesel lubricating oils and other transportation fuel components the move adds more than 60 million gallons per year of sales to regi s portfolio in february the company made two important announcement first that it will be investing in a pretreatment facility in germany in a project in emden the project will improve regi s ability to refine low carbon intensity hard to convert waste fats and oils for biodiesel production in the european markets and in the us markets regi has entered into a partnership with bunker holding group the world s largest marine fuel supplier the move will expand regi s footprint in the us and eu markets for marine biodiesel fuels despite the company s rising revenues and continued profitability regi has seen its share price drop 65 over the past 12 months in coverage for cowen analyst jason gabelman explains why he sees this drop as an opportunity for investors we estimate regi is getting 0 value for its biodiesel business ex volumes sold with rd and see current price levels as an attractive entry point especially for those willing to wait until geismar value is more reflected in equity the stock could also benefit as investors embed value for cali s cap and trade gabelman noted the stock has been impacted by concerns around renewable volume obligations rvos and declining lcfs prices proposed rvos should accommodate new biomass based diesel coming online in 22 reducing competitive risk to regi s biodiesel business the analyst added to this end gabelman sets an outperform i e buy rating on regi and his 75 price target indicates its potential for 125 upside by the end of 2022 to watch gabelman s track record click here overall

san francisco and suzhou china feb 20 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announced the first patient dosing for its first in class igg based universal modular claudin 18 2 targeting chimeric antigen receptor t car t cell product development code ibi345 for the treatment of advanced claudin18 2 positive solid tumors in an investigator initiated trial iit since innovent announced its strategic cooperation with roche on june 9 2020 this is the first disclosure of the development milestone for the cell therapy products based on roche s proprietary innovative technology platform the study nct05199519 is an investigator initiated clinical trial with the primary objective of evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ibi345 in subjects with claudin18 2 positive solid tumors car t cell therapy has established a meaningful role in the treatment of hematological tumors with 5 products approved by the fda and 2 by the nmpa in china respectively however antitumor efficacy for solid tumors remains a challenge calling for technological breakthroughs as the world s first universal modular car t cell product ibi345 has potentially differentiated advantages over conventional car t cell therapy products including 1 leveraging antibody function to target tumor antigens and consequently amplifying the tumor antigen signal to guide car t cells to enter the tumor thus aiding in the initiation of tumor recognition and killing 2 controlling the functional activity of the car t cells via concomitantly administered antibodies which act as a bridge between the target cell and car t cell potentially providing a better safety profile 3 allows for the sequential or simultaneous administration of more than one antibody targeting different antigen targets without changing car t cells to treat tumors with highly heterogeneous antigen expression or relapsed tumors due to antigen loss thereby improving the accessibility and increasing the flexibility of car t cell therapy for patients the principal investigator of the study professor weichang chen the secretary of the party committee and chief physician of the department of gastroenterology of the first hospital affiliated to soochow university pointed out as gastric and pancreatic cancer are highly aggressive tumors with high incidence rates in the world patients are in urgent need of novel treatment options to improve clinical outcomes ibi345 with its unique design to control car t functional activity through the antibody bridging will likely provide improved safety and efficacy we look forward to the positive results of the safety tolerability and efficacy data of ibi345 in patients with solid tumors which will potentially provide a new option for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric or pancreatic cancer dr xu wei vp of innovent r d head of cell therapy said ibi345 is a highly differentiated car t cell product with a new mechanism of action developed by innovent based on roche s proprietary technology as a universal modular car t cell therapy product equipped with a precisely targeted antibody switch it regulates the expansion of car t cells to control side effects potentially providing an opportunity to switch to another antibody that targets different antigens to prevent recurrence and treat different tumors our preclinical studies have validated this modular car t technology which provides us with the sufficient scientific data to initiate clinical studies in the following clinical studies we will explore the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ibi345 and optimize the clinical dosage and regimen to support the subsequent ind application we firmly believe that innovent will be able to introduce more innovative cell therapies through platform technology innovation product transformation and in depth collaboration with the clinical academic community that will ultimately benefit more patients and families about claudin 18 2 claudin protein is a critical component of tight junction complex molecules which play an important role in the life activities of the human body on the one hand tight junctions can function as a barrier to select the size and charge of substances thereby regulating the transport of substances in the para cellular pathway for example brain vascular endothelial cells can pass through this barrier preventing blood from mixing with the extracellular fluid in the brain on the other hand tight junctions can also function as fences maintaining cell polarity by regulating the free diffusion of lipids and proteins between the apical and the basolateral membrane claudin18 2 is a member of the claudin protein family which is a highly tissue specific protein expressed only in differentiated epithelial cells on the gastric mucosa under normal physiological conditions previous studies have revealed that claudin18 2 is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer such as gastric cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma the unique feature of limited expression in normal tissues and highly specific expression in cancer makes claudin18 2 an ideal target for developing the immunotherapeutic for solid tumors globally there is currently no therapy targeting claudin18 2 approved for marketing but there are many candidate therapies in clinical development the drug modalities under development include monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies antibody conjugated drugs and car t cell products about gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma gastric and pancreatic cancer are both malignant tumors of the digestive system that seriously endanger human life and health the latest global cancer statistics show that there will be about 1 089 million new cases of gastric cancer worldwide in 2020 accounting for 5 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 768 000 deaths accounting for 7 7 of the global cancer deaths there are about 495 000 new cases of pancreatic cancer accounting for 2 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 466 000 deaths accounting for 4 7 of the global cancer deaths according to the national cancer statistics released by the national cancer center of china in 2019 the incidence of gastric cancer in china in 2015 was about 403 000 accounting for 10 26 of the total cancer incidence second only to lung cancer at 20 03 with an incidence rate of 29 31 100 000 people and about 291 000 deaths accounting for 12 45 of the total cancer deaths behind lung and liver cancer with a mortality rate of 21 16 100 000 people in 2015 the number of cases and deaths of pancreatic cancer nationwide were 95 000 and 85 000 respectively ranking the 10th and 6th in the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors the mortality ratio of pancreatic cancer was 0 89 making it a true king of cancer despite the treatment progress in recent years drug resistance recurrence and metastasis are still inevitable the 5 year survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer is about 5 20 and the median survival rate is about 10 months pancreatic cancer has a worse prognosis with a 5 year survival rate of only 6 to 8 about ibi345 ibi345 is the first universal modular car t cell product developed by innovent based on roche s proprietary technology it is an internationally pioneered highly differentiated car t cell product with a new mechanism of action different from conventional car t cells that directly recognize and kill tumor cells ibi345 comprises of two components anti claudin18 2 antibodies and modular car t cells where anti claudin18 2 antibody recognizes tumor antigen thus calibrating and amplifying the antigen signal and guides modular car t cells to enter the tumor to initiate the cytotoxic and antitumor activity of car t cells compared with conventional car t cells ibi345 has a variety of potential advantages including dual effects of antibodies and car t cells to increase antitumor efficacy and flexible control of side effects by regulating car t cell activity through antibodies in addition as having a universal car molecule modular car t cells can be easily switched to different antibodies without changing car t cells by sequentially or simultaneously administering more than one antibody targeting different antigen targets to treat tumors with highly heterogeneous antigen expression or antigen loss relapsed tumors which holds a great potential to reduce the cost of car t cell therapy and improve the accessibility of car t cell therapy for patients innovent announced that first patient dosing has been completed in february 2022 in the investigator initiated clinical trial of ibi345 for the treatment of advanced claudin18 2 positive solid tumors and enrollment is currently ongoing the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ibi345 will be explored and the clinical dosage and regimen will be explored to provide clinical data support for the subsequent ind application about innovent inspired by the spirit of start with integrity succeed through action

left voice lv the publication of an american pseudo left group allied with the morenoite trotskyist fraction of the fourth international ft has issued a working class program for safe school reopenings the statement marks the group as the enemy of both the working class and safe schools the document was issued january 28 as american covid 19 fatalities were soaring towards 900 000 and the worldwide death toll was estimated at between 6 and 20 million the catastrophe facing the world working class is however of no great import for these upper middle class opportunists their statement reeks of complacency and indifference it amounts to a collegial debate with members of the democratic socialists of america dsa and the pseudo left more generally the series of left voice pandemic policy statements published over the last two years has the character of friendly advice to the union bureaucracies on the most expedient tactical slogans for sabotaging opposition and forcing educators and students back into covid ridden schools a a summer school student wears a protective mask while listening to instruction at the e n white school in holyoke mass on wednesday aug 4 2021 ap photo charles krupa lv makes a few rhetorical criticisms but they are not directed against the reopening of schools rather they are limited to concerns about how this reckless and murderous policy is being carried out in the january 28 statement lv writes that the decision to reopen schools shouldn t be up to the capitalists it should be decided by the people who live and work within their communities the statement then immediately dispels the idea that workers should insist on fully remote education as part of a zero covid policy stating teachers students and parents are keenly aware that remote learning does not compare to the experience of learning in person it goes on to parrot the hypocritical justification of the biden administration and the teachers unions for herding young innocents into covid infested schools emphasizing virtual learning s long term impacts on students social and emotional development thus as the headline working class program for safe school reopenings suggests lv rejects the necessary scientific program of closing schools and nonessential businesses in temporary lockdowns and deploying the full arsenal of public health measures as part of a strategy to eliminate the virus this is despite the clear scientific evidence that schools are primary vectors of community infection left voice s insistence on reopenings marks a further capitulation to the government and the trade unions last september lv had allowed for a shutdown some industries as necessary at that time an estimated 660 000 americans had died of covid 19 but by january of this year when a quarter million more souls had been lost lv dropped any mention of shutdowns this shift was a response to the mounting economic and political crisis of the biden administration and the entire us political system facing meltdown under conditions where the response of both big business parties to the coronavirus has exposed the bankruptcy of the capitalist system biden s promise to follow the science has proven no less a fraud than trump s lies the democratic administration seized on the omicron surge as the pretense for dropping any and all mitigation measures and adopting trump s fascistic herd immunity policy the centerpiece of this policy of mass infection and death is the reopening of the schools which has rapidly proved to be a death sentence for hundreds of school children and hundreds of thousands of parents educators and other workers at the bidding of the corporate oligarchy which from the start rejected any covid 19 policies that threatened to depress the stock market and reduce profits biden insisted on a full scale return to in person instruction american federation of teachers aft president randi weingarten and the chicago teachers union led by dsa member jesse sharkey shut down and sold out the january strike by chicago teachers in opposition to this policy along with the national education association nea the aft continues to block efforts of teachers parents and students to fight back in the course of its latest statement on school openings left voice admits that the chicago teachers union ultimately betrayed the teachers this however does not prevent it from stating in point 7 every education worker needs a union followed by the absurd claim that unions are the largest organizations of the working class to stand up against capitalist interests and fight for safe conditions left voice s half truths and outright lies have one purpose to reinforce the unions in their suppression of the class struggle the betrayal of the teachers in chicago part of weingarten s nationwide campaign to keep the schools open has profoundly discredited the unions teachers are well aware there has not been a single nationally organized action taken during the pandemic by the aft nea to shut the schools despite the ever increasing death toll among educators children and families of course biden and the democrats agree with point 7 last week biden announced a task force on worker organizing and empowerment aimed at strengthening the pro corporate trade unions as critical instruments to keep workers on the job and suppress wages why the desperate drive to force children back into disease ridden schools because as biden and his covid 19 advisers acknowledge this is key to forcing parents back into factories and workplaces what they omit to say is that the inevitable explosion of infections and deaths is critical to continuing the flow of profits to the corporate elite despite left voice s occasional recourse to verbal rabble rousing seizing schools abolishing capitalism it puts forward the most limited demands to reassure the capitalists and the union bureaucrats that its program is safely reformist it states this is not a blueprint for a new society but merely for basic measures lv s initial pandemic program published in march 2020 was written as the cares act was being adopted by congress on a near unanimous vote of both big business parties little wonder the capitalist politicians including bernie sanders backed it since it funneled trillions of dollars to the rich even as the pandemic was beginning to rip through the population in addition to hundreds of billions in direct handouts to corporations it enabled the federal reserve to pump some 4 trillion into the stock market so that multi billionaires like jeff bezos and elon musk could double their wealth during the pandemic lv ignored these class and political issues instead it put forward a list of reforms such as free health care universal paid sick leave and a freeze on layoffs admitting that they were minimal in nature it peddled the illusion that such basic social measures could be achieved by putting pressure on the unions and the democratic party the subsequent evolution of the biden administration and the democratic controlled congress has demonstrated that no social reforms can be achieved outside of a struggle for socialism the democrats have joined with the republicans to scrap all earlier pandemic relief measures and dropped any fight for even the timid reforms included in the build back better plan by contrast a month before the passage of the cares act the international committee of the fourth international icfi issued an urgent call for the mobilization of the international working class in a globally coordinated emergency response to the spreading coronavirus pandemic the icfi warned that the danger cannot be overstated and called for scientists from all over the world to share their research and technology unencumbered by national interests and geopolitical conflicts it concluded in demanding that capitalist governments implement these emergency measures the international working class does not abandon its fundamental aim the ending of the capitalist system rather the fight for emergency action will raise the consciousness of the working class develop its understanding of the need for international class solidarity and increase its political self confidence by the time of its september 2021 covid 19 statement left voice finally admitted that the pandemic could significantly worsen but it pointed encouragingly to president biden s six pronged path out of the pandemic this plan devised by wall street financiers such as the head of biden s covid task force jeffrey zients estimated wealth 89 3 million can be summed up as vaccines only keep schools open protect profits while holding out hope in biden s plan lv cautioned that it might fall short for our part the world socialist web site and the icfi were assisting workers in forming rank and file safety committees independent of the unions and the capitalist political parties among autoworkers health care workers teachers parents and others in the us and around the world to fight for a zero covid policy the icfi launched a global workers inquest into the covid 19 pandemic partnering with leading scientists to counter the official lies and provide critical information to the working class in the midst of the public health catastrophe as medical professionals were straining every nerve to save lives and workers of all nationalities races and ethnicities were being sacrificed to the manic greed of the ruling class the left voice s program made a criminally light minded and divisive call for dismantling a system of medicine built on racism and white supremacy such is the reactionary anti worker outlook of the pseudo left s identity politics as part of the need to start addressing the long history of medical coercion lv strenuously objected to vaccine mandates which it claimed open the doors for increased state surveillance coercion repression and domination here lv aligned itself with the anti vax current promoting a poisonous form of middle class individualism that plays into the hands of the pandemic profiteers and the far right there is a long history in public health of mandatory vaccinations accompanied by mass education which have saved countless lives as the wsws has made clear the task of socialists in the pandemic is to help the working class enforce a scientific policy that protects the lives health livelihoods and liberties of the population against the policy of social murder implemented and ferociously defended by the ruling class left voice talks out of both sides of its mouth it claims to be for science but disputes the clear public health necessity for protecting the population with vaccine mandates the working class as a class has the social right and responsibility to protect the broad masses of society from a deadly pandemic that is killing millions due to the criminal priorities of the profit system above all schools and nonessential businesses must be closed until viral transmission is ended with full compensation to workers and assistance for small businesses the authors of the lv program should explain how they propose to make reopened schools safe while allowing the airborne virus to circulate freely in poorly ventilated school buildings left voice has sought to counter the widespread support among educators and other workers for the building of rank and file safety committees independent of the pro corporate unions campaigned for by the world socialist web site and the socialist equality parties in the us and around the world it does so by calling for self organized assemblies of education staff students and communities this is just another means of subordinating workers to the pro corporate union structure and the capitalist state as lv explains the unity of the class through democratic committees and assemblies is the only way to properly fight against these measures to build towards that we have to push our current organized bodies such as labor unions to throw their full support behind organizations like the ones organizing student walkouts for safe schools the only support the unions will give to student walkouts is the support of a noose around the neck of the hangman s victim randi weingarten has notoriously bragged about her 15 hour days pushing for kids in seats demonstrating last week that there is no line she will not cross in the service of big business she stated that it was time to end mask mandates in schools the alignment of lv with biden and world imperialism and against the preservation of life is expressed most starkly by lv s co thinkers in their attack on china and its successful zero covid policy china has remained ruthless in their zero tolerance policy against covid writes the revolutionary workers current crt in spain this organization denounces the safety measures that have saved millions of lives in the largest nation on earth in terms that could have been lifted from the us state department or cia mouthpieces such as the new york times the crt condemns the use of temporary lockdowns combined with systematic contact tracing and quarantining as authoritarian the result of these measures which enjoy broad popular support in china is four covid deaths in a country of 1 4 billion people since april 2020 this compares to the supposedly humanitarian and democratic policies of most capitalist governments which have led to some 950 000 deaths in the us and 80 000 in spain over the same period the morenoite attack on china s covid 19 policy dovetails with the american unions anti lockdown policies and the us government s escalating war buildup against china the fact that left voice aims to provide a left veneer to the herd immunity policies of the ruling class is in keeping with the reactionary anti trotskyist history of the morenoite tendency in argentina where the political tendency originated the morenoites popular front policies disarmed the working class and paved the way for the junta s 1976 military coup engineered in conjunction with the us nahuel moreno s adaptation to the peronist argentine state was responsible for the deaths of thousands today this opportunist tendency responds to the resurgence of class struggle on an international scale by joining forces openly with neo stalinists and bourgeois politicians the movement of growing layers of the working class into struggle against the capitalist system and its national states is undermining the discredited nationalist trade unions and driving the morenoites and other pseudo left parties of the upper middle class into the arms of imperialism there is nothing remotely socialist or trotskyist about left voice which has lined up with the global capitalist policy of mass infection and a forever pandemic

myanmar economy in dire straits as its neighbours and the wider world debate whether the junta can be persuaded to engage in meaningful dialogue once perceived as asia s final frontier myanmar has been tested severely by dual shocks a surge in covid 19 cases in 2021 and the military coup that has brought its economy close to a standstill and left its people suffering from ongoing violence a steady decline in covid cases and deaths from july to january has led to an easing of containment measures but new daily infections have moved back above four digits and rising for the past two weeks myanmar remains highly vulnerable to the omicron variant and further waves of the pandemic experts say citing very low vaccination rates and weak public health capacity as well the reliability of data is uncertain anecdotal reports suggest covid transmission could be higher in some areas particularly near the border with india which is facing a significant surge in omicron cases covid is just one of many complications in a country that began its second year under military rule on feb 1 the security environment continues to deteriorate in many parts of myanmar including in states and regions that have historically been relatively peaceful a growing number of disaffected citizens have fled to the hinterlands and taken up arms often alongside ethnic armed groups and violent clashes with the army are increasing in frequency the pervasive atmosphere of conflict and dimming hopes for a resolution have dealt a severe blow to business operations logistics confidence and the appetite to invest many foreign firms are pulling out of the country as revenue falls amid sluggish consumption the world bank projects the economy of myanmar will expand by a mere 1 in the year to september 2022 but that follows an estimated contraction of 18 in the last fiscal year even with recent signs of stabilisation in some areas the forecast remains consistent with a critically weak economy around 30 smaller than it might have been in the absence of covid and the coup in the near term the outlook will depend on the impact of new wave s of covid 19 the extent and effects of conflict and the degree to which foreign exchange and financial sector disruptions persist together with other disruptions such as to electricity logistics and internet services the bank stated in its myanmar economic monitor released in late january most indicators suggest that private investment has fallen markedly and previously viable projects are becoming unviable as demand remains weak the cost of imports has risen and kyat denominated revenues are worth less in foreign currency terms said kim edwards the bank s senior economist for myanmar recent trends of escalating conflict are concerning firstly from a humanitarian perspective but also from the implications for economic activity added mariam sherman the bank s country director for myanmar cambodia and laos even as mobility improved following the decline in covid cases and easing of lockdowns economic activity continues to be affected by substantial weaknesses in both supply and demand some 80 of firms surveyed by the world bank reported a decline in sales since january 2021 with an average decline of 59 around half of all firms experienced disruptions in the supply of inputs and raw materials largely because of increases in costs exacerbated by a sharp exchange rate depreciation in september a similar proportion reported poor cashflow with 28 struggling to pay suppliers and employees due to limited banking services financial dysfunction is the primary concern of japanese companies in myanmar for current operations said atsushi taketani president of the japan external trade organization jetro in bangkok and chief representative for asean the liquidity of the us dollar and myanmar kyat decreased drastically after the political upheaval it remains quite difficult to convert kyat to or procure dollars in the financial market the kyat which was trading around 1 330 to the us dollar just before the coup sank as low as 2 200 in september last year it was trading around 1 780 last week mr taketani shared the view of other experts that the crisis in myanmar is adversely affecting the potential growth of asean as a whole before the coup japanese companies in thailand considered myanmar the fourth most promising export market next to vietnam india and indonesia he told asia focus myanmar was in the process of integration into the asean wide supply chain i understand that there were economic interactions not only in manufacturing but also in energy between myanmar and other asean nations disruptions in such a relationship would have a negative impact on the overall asean wide economy most asean member states are not in the position to tackle questions of democracy and human rights because they are not democratic says kasit piromya a former foreign minister of thailand patipat janthong political divisions myanmar s crisis has further deepened asean s political divisions as well as such it weakens asean s potential said thitinan pongsudhirak director of the institute of security and international studies isis at chulalongkorn university in bangkok indonesia malaysia singapore and the philippines have called for a return to the democratic process while other asean members including thailand are turning a blind eye to the military s brutality against myanmar people he told asia focus by email the asean narrative of being a single market and production hub has been undermined asean now has nine functioning member states while the 10th rogue member is giving the whole organisation a bad name in front of the international community between july and november 2021 myanmar approved just 17 foreign direct investment fdi projects with committed funds of us 267 million five times lower than in the same period last year the world bank report noted international firms continued to announce suspension or termination of their operations or otherwise changed their investment plans for pipeline projects indicating a deteriorating investment and business climate it said india s adani ports and special economic zone ltd for example announced the withdrawal of its plan to build a container port in the military owned ahlone port in yangon by june this year several other noticeable suspensions or divestments included the cessation of operations by the german retailer metro the swiss hotelier kempinski and british american tobacco moreover the european telecom company telenor agreed to sell 51 of its shares in wave money a mobile financial services company to the local conglomerate yoma strategic holdings in january this year following an announcement that it would sell its myanmar mobile operations the nay pyi taw government rejected telenor s original proposal to sell the mobile business to the lebanon based m1 group pushing instead for the latter to partner with shwe byain phyu group a local conglomerate involved in everything from petroleum to jade mining with numerous links to the military and its businesses in january totalenergies of france announced that it would withdraw from the yadana gas field and from moattama gas transportation company mgtc which operates the pipeline that transports gas from the yadana field to thailand us based chevron another yadana partner quickly followed suit ptt exploration and production pttep of thailand which already holds a 25 5 stake in yadana is seen as the main candidate to acquire the interests of total and chevron but the junta is pushing for more myanmar based investors to acquire shares asean now has nine functioning member states while the 10th rogue member is giving the whole organisation a bad name says thitinan pongsudhirak director of the institute of security and international studies isis at chulalongkorn university chulalongkorn university damage to livelihoods the departures of foreign firms are likely to mean a reduction in employment and new job creation as well as a decline in access to foreign expertise and technology the world bank report said the report also noted a rise in conflict in every state and region of myanmar since last august with noteworthy increases in the northern and central states particularly in sagaing magway and mandalay but also in kachin shan and chin subregional gdp data indicate that these six states were responsible for around 38 of total economic activity in 2019 yangon responsible for a further 25 of gdp has also seen a sharp rise in conflict conflict insecurity and displacement are having severe impacts on the lives and livelihoods of people across the country said the report citing a united nations estimate that 223 000 people have been displaced since feb 1 2021 through several different channels conflict can also act to exacerbate income declines price increases and economic constraints faced by the broader population particularly those living in rural areas who are dependent on the agriculture sector for their livelihoods the world bank said this is in addition to the direct impacts on security freedom of movement and accessibility of critical services the household level impacts of recent shocks are therefore likely to be particularly severe in areas where conflict is greatest the share of the population living in poverty is estimated to have more than doubled since before the pandemic began inflation and credit liquidity constraints will further compound food security risks particularly for the poor the world bank noted the international labour organization ilo estimated some 1 6 million jobs were lost in myanmar last year with the coup compounding the impacts of the pandemic one year on from the military takeover the labour market remains fragile the un agency said late last month adding that working hours are estimated to have decreased by 18 in 2021 relative to 2020 equivalent to the working time of at least 3 1 million full time workers these working hour losses were driven by employment losses as well as increased underemployment it explained key sectors have suffered considerably with farmers hard hit by armed conflict violence and insecurity construction garments and tourism and hospitality were also among the hardest hit industries in 2021 with year on year employment losses reaching an estimated 31 27 and 30 respectively the losses in both working hours and employment were disproportionately greater for women than men overall the ilo said women also accounted for an overwhelming majority of job losses in garments as well as tourism and hospitality donglin li country director of ilo myanmar said the military takeover and the pandemic have put millions of workers in myanmar in a grim situation we are witnessing a reversal of years of progress in the labour market should this continue it can only lead to increased poverty and insecurity across the country he added the world bank has observed that over the longer term recent events will limit myanmar s potential to recover and grow as the dual shocks of covid and the coup have had substantial impacts on physical and human capital accumulation lost months of education together with rapid increases in unemployment and displacement will reduce human capital and productive capacity over the longer term said mr edwards financial dysfunction is the primary concern of japanese companies in myanmar for current operations says atsushi taketani president of jetro bangkok photo credit ways forward attempts to find a political solution or even bring the junta and other parties to the negotiating table are proving extremely difficult cambodia s foreign minister said last thursday that he hopes to visit myanmar next month in his role as the asean special envoy prak sokhonn said he hoped the junta will allow him to talk to members of a shadow government that it has labelled terrorists but conceded that this would be a challenge the asean parliamentarians for human rights aphr has proposed that asean recognise the national unity government of myanmar nug said kasit piromya who served as foreign minister of thailand from 2008 11 and is a member of aphr this is very important because the nug is more or less the legitimate representative of the myanmar people he told an online forum hosted by isis late last month you cannot have dialogue unless and until asean through its chair or individual member states can speak not only to the military junta but also to start talking to the nug to provide a sense of balance and fair play to boost the nug in the 10 member asean bloc indonesia singapore malaysia and the philippines have been the most outspoken in their condemnation of the myanmar military s intransigence the aphr believes those four states should work together to push cambodian prime minister hun sen to uphold the collective role of the asean team not a unilateral individualistic role said mr kasit in his capacity as asean chair this year the cambodian strongman travelled to myanmar in january and met with junta leader senior gen min aung hlaing the visit was controversial as he did not consult other asean states beforehand the aphr has emphasised the need for the un to oversee humanitarian assistance in myanmar and press the junta to drop its insistence that all aid agencies must go through them it also is pressing the thai government to facilitate humanitarian assistance along its border said mr kasit dr thitinan observed that the tatmadaw may have seized power but it has not been able to consolidate control over the country losing ground in a war of attrition war waged by myanmar people like minded asean member states should broaden dialogue with the civilian led opposition alliance to put more pressure on the junta he said piling on more pressure he cautioned may lead to rifts and change inside the high command sufficient to bring the generals to the negotiating table mr kasit said the crisis had underlined the need for asean to undergo drastic reform to be more democratic so that it can play a more concrete role in addressing regional and global issues when it comes to the challenges in regard to democracy and human rights asean collectively is not in a position to handle this issue he said that has been reflected in this attempt to handle the myanmar issue spiritually ideologically and so on most asean member states are not in a position to tackle questions of democracy and human rights because they are not democratic and they do not go for universal values the myanmar crisis he stated has shown that asean cannot go on operating without some form of common ideology they won t be able to handle anything or to have a common collective stance when it comes to normal global issues like terrorism or things that have been going on such as ethnic conflicts and the rise of authoritarianism the veteran diplomat said a paper by the indonesian foreign ministry on the future of asean might set the tone for reform i think there is something going on already related to the reform of asean to bring it more in tune with the asean mentality and to link that to being people centred and promoting asean centrality he explained both of these principles cannot move forward unless and until the thinking inside each asean member state and inside asean as a whole is based on democratic principles

afcfta is nigeria ready to seize the opportunities trading under the african continental free trade area afcfta kicked off on january 1 last year one year after how has nigeria prepared and strategically positioned its private sector to grab the opportunities offered by the trade liberalisation deal what are the recent developments within and outside nigeria that may have indicated its readiness to live to its billing as biggest potential beneficiary of the new economic bloc that seeks to unlock a market of 1 2 billion africans with a combined gross domestic product gdp of 3 trillion assistant editor chikodi okereocha reviews nigeria s participation in the afcfta one year after even before president muhammadu buhari signed the landmark african continental free trade area afcfta agreement on july 7 2019 after 16 months of foot dragging experts in international trade and diplomacy had tipped nigeria as the biggest potential beneficiary of the trade liberalisation deal this was on the strength of nigeria s nearly 200 million population and huge market for trade indeed nigeria as the single largest market in africa is said to stand the chance of gaining a lot from increasing access to its goods and services to a wider african market also the opportunity of up scaling her manufacturing sector and possibly taking over from china as the global manufacturing hub is another potential benefit too glaring to ignore under the afcfta the afcfta was adopted by the 18th ordinary session of the assembly of heads of state and government of the african union au in addis ababa ethiopia in january 2012 it seeks to create the world s largest free trade area one that integrates 1 3 billion people across 54 african countries with the objective of tapping into a combined gross domestic product gdp of over 3 trillion seen as an opportunity to remake african economies the afcfta fundamentally will put african economies and african citizens on a better economic footing it will enhance competitiveness and stimulate investment innovation and economic growth by increasing efficiency and eliminating barriers to trade the agreement commits countries to removing tariffs on 90 per cent of goods and incrementally apply the same to services and the removal of tariffs on goods in particular is projected to increase the value of intra african trade by 15 to 25 per cent by 2040 this would translate to between 50 billion and 70 billion in value the operational phase of the continental trade deal was earlier scheduled to start officially on july 1 2020 but was delayed by six months due to the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic and its restrictive measures which came at a time the afcfta was in its critical phase of implementation factors against intra african trade containment measures such as border closure travel bans and in some cases total or partial lockdowns enforced by most african countries including nigeria to curb the spread of the deadly virus directly impacted on economic integration and intra african trade which are at the core of the free trade deal accordingly commercial trading under the afcfta commenced on january 1 2021 one year down the line how has nigeria fared is africa s most populous and largest market on course in maximising the opportunities promised by the afcfta the agreement admittedly potentially cleared the coast for nigeria s competitiveness in continental and international trade while vigorously driving her economic diversification and industrialisation agenda but how has the private sector strategically positioned itself to seize the opportunities promised by the afcfta these questions have become imperative particularly considering the initial doubts controversies and uncertainties over whether or not nigeria should sign the treaty this was why for instance it took nigeria s president 16 months of foot dragging to sign the document during which the federal government said it needed to consider the deal and country wide sensitisation and consultation of stakeholders the delay in signing the deal came after members of the organised private sector ops particularly manufacturers opposed the move they had warned the federal government not to sign the policy document as doing so according to them would cripple the economy and leave more nigerians unemployed many of them expressed fears that the deal will be injurious to the nation s industrial sector and the economy they argued for instance that the agreement would turn nigeria into a dumping ground for imported foreign goods they insisted that the likely negative impacts of the afcfta on private businesses and the economy far outweigh its supposed benefits stakeholders react however proponents of the free trade deal had kicked their heels in insisting that afcfta the world s largest free trade area since the creation of the world trade organisation wto in 1994 will boost intra african trade by about 60 per cent by 2022 currently intra african trade is abysmally low standing at just 16 per cent of the continent s total trade compared with 19 per cent in latin america 51 per cent in asia 54 per cent in north america and 70 per cent in europe however one year into the implementation of the afcfta the initial feeling of uncertainty and dilly dallying concerning nigeria joining the new economic bloc the nation learnt appear to have given way to optimism that nigeria will eventually rise to the occasion and lead the charge to remake her economy and by extension the african economies by leveraging the afcfta for instance renowned diplomat and director general of national association of chambers of commerce industry mines and agriculture naccima ambassador ayo olukanni expressed optimism that given nigeria s readiness and preparedness the country can effectively compete under the afcfta as some of her manufacturers have shown some nigerian banks are also gradually making inroads and in fact being invited to commence operations in some african countries olukanni told the nation pointing out however that continuous preparations are the key strategic options now in readiness when the momentum and condition for trading increase the second deputy president of naccima jani ibrahim also shares in olukanni s optimism we have the capacity we have the people we have the products and if you notice a lot of nigerian products are beginning to find their way in other african countries he said apparently encouraged by the aggressive sensitisation of private sector operators across the country in collaboration with the public sector ibrahim told the nation that nigeria is so prepared for trading to the extent that other state parties to the trade deal are beginning to get worried about what nigeria can do our members are being sensitised we are working with the national action committee on afcfta and naccima is a frontline member of that committee sensitisation programmes are being carried out across the country with the committee naccima is also closely working with the nigerian export promotions council nepc to develop our members for export so that our products will meet international standards so that when their products go out of the country they will be accepted ibrahim said the naccima boss added that one major thing that nigeria has been able to achieve working with other african countries and relevant institutions in one year of trading under the afcfta was the recent launch of the pan african payment and settlement system papss about a fortnight to help resolve the major issue of dollarisation and dollar availability among african countries enters papss the african export import bank afreximbank working with the afcfta and the central bank of nigeria cbn to come up with the papss where if you as a nigerian exporter sends goods to ghana you will be paid locally in naira the other person does not need to go and be looking for dollar to pay you in the same way a company will not go and be looking for dollar in order to carry out a transaction he explained launched in january this year in accra ghana papss which was developed by afreximbank is expected to boost intra african trade by transforming and facilitating payment clearing and settlement for cross border trade across africa papss will enable a customer in one african country to pay in his own currency while a seller in another country receives payment also in his own currency at the unveiling of the payment platform afcfta secretary general wamkele mene stated that the papss is expected to boost intra african trade and save the continent 5 billion yearly in payment transaction costs while also playing an increasingly significant role in accelerating the continent s transactions underpinning the operationalisation of the afcfta afreximbank s chief speaks the president and chairman afreximbank prof benedict oramah said we are eager to build upon the afcfta s creation of a single market throughout africa and papss provides the state of the art financial market infrastructure connecting african markets to one another thereby enabling instant cross border payments in respective local african currencies for cross border trade the nation learnt that afreximbank as the main settlement agent for papss will provide settlement guarantees on the payment system and overdraft facilities to all settlement agents in partnership with africa s participating central banks according to oramah papss will effectively eliminate africa s financial borders formalise and integrate africa s payment systems and play a major role in facilitating and accelerating the huge afcfta induced growth curve in intra african trade according to the pan african multilateral financial institution papss provides the solution to the disconnected and fragmented nature of payment and settlement systems that have long impeded intra african trade indeed before papss over 80 per cent of african cross border payment transactions originating from african banks were said to be routed offshore for clearing and settlement using international banking relationships expectedly that posed multiple challenges ranging from payment delays to operational inefficiencies and compliance concerns for the disparate regional payment systems ibrahim said naccima was working with the economic community of west african states ecowas region and once the region stabilises others would also come on board he said this would apply to phase i of the afcfta which is trade in goods we are discussing and negotiating on the phase two which is services intellectual property investments etc and also in terms of conflict resolutions ibrahim said underscoring nigeria s readiness to play a leading role in the unfolding effort to leverage the afcfta to force africa s economic rebirth noting that the private sector in nigeria has always been worried about being a dumping ground for goods from other countries he however said the rules of origin roo were being marshalled thoroughly and that the national office for trade negotiations notn and the national action committee were working very hard to see that they establish the roo such that no country could dump any goods on another country man s position this must be reason the director general of manufacturers association of nigeria man mr segun ajayi kadir harped on the need to constitute the national rules of origin administration board that will superintend the implementation of roo and also validate the process application and registration of issuing the certificate of origin roo is key for trade in goods they are used to determine the country of origin of a product for the purpose of international trade and even before nigeria signed on to the treaty roo was a subject of intense agitation by members of the ops especially manufacturers who had expressed fears that the roo in the afcfta cannot be adequately enforced to guard against the influx of goods into the nigerian market their argument was that roo might not be adequately enforced because goods from the european union eu might find their way into one of the african countries that have bilateral agreement with the eu and when such goods get into any of the african countries they could repackage them change the label from made in europe to that of the african country that way manufacturers believe that those same goods will surely find their way to nigeria which is the main target market for the eu but with ibrahim s assurances such fears are gradually being dispelled to pave way for nigeria to fully take its pride of place in the new continental free trade regime

accumulation of soldiers along the ukrainian border russia will extend military drills in belarus that were due to end on sunday the belarusian defense ministry announced adding to mounting tensions as satellite images appeared to show new deployments of russian armor and troops close to ukraine the white house said president joe biden was canceling a trip to delaware and remaining in washington following a two hour meeting of his national security council biden instead spoke by phone with french president emmanuel macron about the russian buildup the white house said russia s move to prolong its belarus exercises has rattled nerves that have been frayed for weeks over russia s accumulation of soldiers along the ukrainian border us secretary of state antony blinken said the move only made him more worried that russia was on the brink of invading moscow has repeatedly denied such plans us based satellite imagery company maxar reported multiple new deployments of russian military units in forests farms and industrial areas as little as 15 km 9 miles from the border with ukraine something maxar said represented a change from what had been seen in recent weeks until recently most of the deployments had been seen primarily positioned at or near existing military garrisons and training areas the company said blinken told cnn that everything we are seeing suggests that this is dead serious adding that the west was equally prepared if moscow invades until the tanks are actually rolling and the planes are flying we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade president vladimir putin from carrying this forward blinken said his planned meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was still set to proceed this week as long as moscow did not go ahead with the invasion an adviser to macron said france and russia had agreed that a meeting of the organization for security and co operation in europe osce with representatives from ukraine and russia should be held on monday poland currently the osce chair said earlier that at ukraine s request it was convening an extraordinary session of its council which is dedicated to preventing armed conflict belarus did not say how long russian troops stationed there estimated by nato to number 30 000 might now remain in the country which lies north of ukraine belarus defence minister viktor khrenin said the focus of the extended exercises was to ensure an adequate response and de escalation of military preparations of ill wishers near our common borders sporadic shelling across the line dividing ukrainian government forces and russian backed separatists in that region increased sharply since thursday and continued on sunday nato says russia could use the troops in belarus as part of an invasion force to attack ukraine moscow denies any such intention it is not an exaggeration to say that europe is a step away from war which was something unimaginable not long ago czech prime minister petr fiala said in a tv interview mykhailo podolyak an adviser to the ukrainian president s chief of staff told reuters the extension of the exercises underlined that official promises from moscow should not be taken as binding wide reaching sanctions kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the repeated warnings by the west that russia was about to invade were provocative and could have adverse consequences which he did not spell out russia says the west has raised tensions by sending nato reinforcements to eastern europe during the crisis western countries are preparing sanctions they say would be wide reaching against russian companies and individuals in case of an invasion british prime minister boris johnson told the bbc such measures could include restrictions on russian businesses access to the dollar and the pound european commission president ursula von der leyen told german broadcaster ard that russia would in principle be cut off from the international financial markets and be cut off from major european exports ukraine s foreign minister dmytro kuleba said it was time for the west to implement at least part of the sanctions it has prepared russia has to be stopped right now we see how events are unfolding kuleba said the biden administration has so far refused to do so saying their deterrent effect would be lost if they were used too soon as soon as you trigger them that deterrence is gone blinken said on cnn s state of the union show the focus of tensions in recent days has been on the swathe of eastern ukraine that russian backed rebels seized in 2014 the same year russia annexed crimea from ukraine more than 14 000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskiy called on sunday for an immediate ceasefire in the eastern part of the country macron blamed the separatists for the renewed hostilities while putin blamed ukraine the french presidential adviser said on sunday a reuters

center of donetsk its origin was unclear more than 30 000 people from donetsk and nearby luhansk have crossed the russian border in the past 24 hours tass news agency said quoting authorities in

sunday that two civilians had been killed and five buildings damaged in shelling by the ukraine military ukraine s joint forces said late sunday that pro russian forces were shelling their own compatriots in eastern ukraine to blame the attacks on kyiv the statement could not immediately be verified although ukraine and its allies have for weeks been warning of russian false flag attacks

2 57pm feb 21 2022 oz minerals managing director andrew cole hopes carbon offsets won t be required to achieve the company s new net zero by 2030 target as he used the copper miner s biggest profit in 11 years to focus on decarbonisation full year profit more than doubled to 530 7 million enabling the company to pay decade high total dividends for the year of 34 per share the strong result was driven by bumper copper prices and higher sales volumes leaving oz debt free and boasting a 215 4 million war chest ahead of this year s final investment decision on a 1 billion nickel and copper mine at west musgrave and a nine year decarbonisation mission oz minerals boss andrew cole ben searcy monday s enhanced decarbonisation strategy requires oz to halve its scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by 2027 and achieve net zero by 2030 a target that puts oz at the ambitious end of the mining sector alongside companies like fortescue metals mr cole said oz would strive to do better than net zero our ultimate intent is to not have to use offsets we just need to do a bit more trialling and technology development to allow us to get there he said net zero is an interim position as we continually work to eliminate emissions from the operations oz s two major mines are in south australia where mr cole said the decarbonisation agenda was helped by the fact the grid was already more than 60 per cent powered by renewables and is on track to be fully renewable by 2030 the company expects renewables and batteries to provide a large share of power at west musgrave which will be built away from existing power networks in outback wa oz is yet to decide whether to build and operate that generation capacity itself an option that would require higher initial spending but lower operating costs thereafter or strike a power purchase agreement with an external provider with mines that are largely powered by renewables mr cole said finding an alternative to diesel loomed as the biggest challenge over the next nine years to be clear that means effectively complete elimination of diesel from our operating assets he said oz is trialling numerous battery powered devices in the hope it can eliminate the need for diesel fuel both underground and at surface while battery electric vehicles have been tipped to dominate the light vehicle sector in future conventional wisdom has suggested that vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells will be the decarbonisation technology of choice for large heavy vehicles like trucks and trains used by mining companies but mr cole said that may not be the case with oz trialling a battery powered truck to carry copper concentrate from its south australian mines to port i would have said that hydrogen would more than likely play a part in moving our concentrate from our mines to port only a year ago he said whereas today it looks more like a battery solution in a prime mover to take the concentrate at the weights and loads and distances we are talking about so i think the jury is out technology is moving extremely quickly i would say faster than people had predicted and faster than we can predict going forward the comments come barely a month after fortescue which is extremely bullish about future demand for hydrogen acquired the engineering company it had previously hired to develop a battery powered version of the giant haul trucks that carry iron ore around its wa mines a plan to run hydrogen powered buses around fortescue s mines has been delayed by a year while the company studies ways to optimise the refuelling network in the hope that both small and large vehicles can use hydrogen
