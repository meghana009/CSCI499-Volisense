children s medicine shortage hits as flu season picks up a sign is placed near the section for children s medicine sunday dec 18 2022 at a cvs in greenlawn n y caring for a sick child has become even more stressful than usual for many u s parents in recent weeks due to shortages of children s tylenol and other medicines ap photo leon keith caring for sick children has become extra stressful recently for many u s parents due to shortages of children s tylenol and other medicines doctors and other experts say the problem could persist through the winter cold and flu season but should not last as long as other recent shortages of baby formula or prescription drugs they also say parents have alternatives if they encounter empty store shelves here s a closer look what s happening an unusually fast start to the annual u s flu season plus a spike in other respiratory illnesses created a surge in demand for fever relievers and other products people can buy without a prescription there are more sick kids at this time of year than we have seen in the past couple years said dr shannon dillon a pediatrician at riley children s health in indianapolis experts say that s the main factor behind the shortages which vary around the country and even within communities at this point it s more like toilet paper at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic dillon said you just have to look in the right place at the right time drugmaker johnson johnson says it is not experiencing widespread shortages of children s tylenol but the product may be less readily available at some stores the company said it is running its production lines around the clock in the meantime cvs health has placed a two product limit on all children s pain relief products bought through its pharmacies or online walgreens is limiting customers online to six purchases of children s over the counter fever reducing products that limit doesn t apply in stores aside from over the counter products the prescription antibiotic amoxicillin also is in short supply due to increased demand according to the food and drug administration the drug is often used to treat nose and throat infections in children what to do check first for alternatives in the store if some products aren t available generic versions of brand name products are perfectly safe and often a much more affordable option dillon said other stores nearby also may have better options manufacturers say there are no widespread national shortages of these medications according to the consumer healthcare products association a family doctor may know which stores have decent supplies a doctor also may be able to tell parents whether they can try alternatives like crushing the proper dose of a pill version and mixing it with food or chocolate syrup doctors say parents or caregivers should not try this on their own because determining proper doses for children can be tricky you don t need to experiment at home said dr sarah nosal a south bronx family physician your family doctor wants to talk to you and see you going without doctors also caution that fevers don t always have to be treated they are a body s natural defense against infection and they make it hard for a virus to replicate dillon noted for instance that a fever may not be intrinsically harmful to older children however parents should take a newborn under 2 months old to the doctor if the child has a fever of 100 4 degrees or more and doctors say any child with a fever should be monitored for behavior changes instead of medicine consider giving the child a bath in lukewarm water cold water makes the body shiver which can actually raise the temperature put fans in the child s room or set up a cool mist humidifier to help their lungs nosal also said two teaspoons of honey can help control coughs in children older than a year avoid using honey for young children because it carries a risk of infant botulism when will supplies get better shortages might last in some communities until early next year resolving them can depend on whether there are enough workers at warehouses and stores to deliver the product and stock the shelves noted erin fox she researches drug shortages and is the senior pharmacy director at university of utah health which runs five hospitals fox said there are no problems at factories or a lack of ingredients contributing to current shortages those obstacles can lead to long supply disruptions i don t expect this to last a year or more like some of our other shortages do she said ___ ap health writer matthew perrone in washington contributed to this story murphy reported from indianapolis

tesla and spacex chief executive officer elon musk speaks at the satellite conference and exhibition in washington on march 9 ap file photo millions of twitter users asked elon musk to step down as the head of twitter in a poll the billionaire created and promised to abide by but by monday afternoon there was no word on whether musk would step aside or who the new leader might be twitter has grown more chaotic and confusing under musk s leadership with rapidly vacillating policies that are issued then withdrawn or changed among those voting with the go camp almost certainly were tesla investors who have grown tired of the 24 7 twitter chaos that they say has distracted the eccentric ceo from the electric car company his main source of wealth musk also used his tesla stock to partially fund the acquisition of twitter shares of tesla are down 35 since musk took over twitter on oct 27 costing investors billions tesla s market value was over 1 1 trillion on april 1 the last trading day before musk disclosed he was buying up twitter shares the company has since lost 58 of its value at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on tesla s dominant share of electric vehicle sales this has been a black eye moment for musk and been a major overhang on tesla s stock which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the twitter soap opera began wedbush analyst dan ives wrote monday if musk s tenure ends it would be a major positive for tesla stock and a sign that musk is finally reading the room that has been growing frustration around this twitter nightmare ives wrote musk attended the world cup final sunday in qatar where he opened the poll since the poll closed early monday musk has been uncharacteristically silent on twitter as he appeared to be flying back to the u s musk has taken a number of unscientific polls on substantial issues facing the social media platform including whether to reinstate journalists that he had suspended from twitter which was broadly criticized in and out of media circles the polls have only added to a growing sense of tumult on twitter since musk bought the company for 44 billion potentially leaving the future direction of the company in the hands of its users among those users are people recently reinstated on the platform under musk people who had been banned for racist and toxic posts or who had spread misinformation since buying twitter musk has presided over a dizzying series of changes that have unnerved advertisers and turned off users he s laid off half of the workforce axed contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors he has dropped enforcement of covid 19 misinformation rules and called for criminal charges against dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert musk clashed with some users on multiple fronts and on sunday he asked twitter users to decide if he should remain in charge acknowledging he made a mistake in launching new restrictions that banned the mention of rival social media websites the results of the online survey which lasted 12 hours showed that 57 5 of the 17 5 million respondents wanted him to leave while 42 5 wanted him to stay the poll followed just the latest significant policy change since musk acquired twitter in october twitter had announced that users will no longer be able to link to facebook instagram mastodon and other platforms targeted for prohibition early monday the tweets from twitter s support account and the twitter blog announcing the prohibitions disappeared without explanation twitter no longer has a press office so it was not possible to ask why that decision had generated immediate blowback including criticism from past defenders of twitter s new owner musk then promised that he would not make any more major policy changes to twitter without an online survey of users the action to block competitors was musk s latest attempt to crack down on certain speech after he shut down a twitter account last week that was tracking the flights of his private jet the banned platforms included mainstream websites such as facebook and instagram and rivals mastodon tribel nostr post and former president donald trump s truth social a growing number of twitter users have left under musk or created alternative accounts on rival platforms and included those addresses in their twitter profiles musk has advocated for free speech on twitter but shut down the jet tracking account calling it a security risk he used that to justify the decision last week to suspend the accounts of numerous journalists who cover twitter and musk among them reporters working for the new york times washington post cnn voice of america and other publications many of those accounts were restored following an online poll by musk the washington post s taylor lorenz was suspended over the weekend after requesting an interview with musk in a tweet tagged to the twitter owner sally buzbee the washington post s executive editor called it an arbitrary suspension of another post journalist that further undermined musk s promise to run twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech again the suspension occurred with no warning process or explanation this time as our reporter merely sought comment from musk for a story buzbee said by midday sunday lorenz s account was restored as was the tweet she thought had triggered her suspension musk was questioned in court on nov 16 about how he splits his time among tesla and his other companies including spacex and twitter he had to testify in delaware s court of chancery over a shareholder s challenge to musk s potentially 55 billion compensation plan as ceo of the electric car company musk said he never wanted to be a ceo of any company preferring to see himself as an engineer in public banter with twitter followers sunday musk expressed pessimism about the prospects for a new ceo saying that person must like pain a lot to run a company that has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy no one wants the job who can actually keep twitter alive there is no successor musk tweeted

median income or considered low income spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing or were considered moderately cost burdened according to the report in the greater tampa bay region around half of all renters were considered moderately cost burdened or spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing so while there are less folks literally on the streets more folks are in an unstable housing condition nesbitt said screenshot of tableau public florida housing coalition a screenshot of a data analysis by the florida housing coalition shows that between 48 and 51 percent of all renters in the greater tampa bay region paid more than 30 percent of their income to housing costs in 2020 the retention of affordable housing stock is at risk as the need for affordable housing grows in florida the supply of existing units is continually shrinking more than 66 000 affordable housing units could be permanently lost from the state s affordable housing supply in the next twenty years according to data published by the shimberg center for housing studies it s really important that as a state we look at preserving those units so that they continue to be within the affordable housing stock nesbitt said rental units that are subsidized could be taken out of the affordable housing market after their agreement period expires which is typically 15 to 20 years affordable units can also be lost if the property faces foreclosure or is removed due to poor management in the tampa st petersburg clearwater metropolitan area in 2019 there were 39 affordable and available units for every 100 renters earning up to 50 percent of the area median income according to the latest data from the shimberg center for housing studies screenshot of tableau public florida housing coalition a screenshot of a data visual by the florida housing coalition that shows the number of affordable and available units per 100 renters racial disparities remain in florida s rental and housing markets the annual report also found that black families in the state have the lowest homeownership rate with more than half of all households renting in florida however despite systemic barriers to higher wages and home financing the first two years of the pandemic actually created an opportunity for black households nesbitt said there was a surprising jump in black homeownership through 2020 2021 he said with the low interest rates it really kind of created the opportunity for a lot of folks to get into homeownership nonetheless nesbitt said racial disparities are still pronounced in the housing market so while there have been some gains before interest rates started going up the gap still exists and you know we re still dealing with the legacy of redlining the racially steeped legacy of redlining when the government deemed predominantly black neighborhoods risky investments during the 30s and 40s has contributed to ongoing racial disparities in the housing and rental markets nationally and in florida of all florida households in 2020 more than three quarters of white residents were homeowners compared to only 49 percent of black residents solutions to achieving housing affordability the florida housing coalition argues that the state has two powerful tools at its disposal in achieving and preserving housing affordability community land trusts and the sadowski housing trust fund so really this is all about creating permanent affordability nesbitt said what we see as the best way to create that is through taking land and property out of the speculative market permanently nesbitt said the community land trust model allows local governments as well as nonprofit community partners to own the land underneath existing or prospective affordable housing development through a 99 year ground lease therefore safeguarding the affordability and availability of rental units courtesy of florida housing coalition in 2017 sen kathleen passidomo filed a bipartisan bill aimed at protecting the state s affordable housing trust funds alongside the florida housing coalition florida is a national leader in growth of community land trusts and is the first in the nation to have a certification program according to the report enacted in 1992 the william e sadowski affordable housing act was designed to allocate stamp tax revenue toward affordable housing initiatives when the revenue is used as designed nesbitt said the trust fund can help lessen the burden of housing costs for floridians but historically funding from the sadowski fund has been unreliable in recent years florida lawmakers came under fire for the longtime siphoning of affordable housing dollars since its inception nearly 2 2 billion has been swept from the trust fund to other priorities the 2021 legislative session marked the first time in a decade that the housing fund wasn t swept for other priorities it remains to be seen how florida lawmakers will address the ongoing affordable housing crisis in the upcoming session and how local governments will work to prioritize renters and homeowners after a year of record high inflation and migration to the state gabriella

massachusetts senator elizabeth warren is questioning whether tesla s board is protecting the electric car company s shareholders in the aftermath of ceo elon musk s 44 billion purchase of twitter tesla directors are legally bound to look after the interests of the company workers and shareholders the democratic lawmaker wrote monday in a letter to robyn denholm chairman of the tesla board yet musk s steps as the new twitter ceo raise questions about possible violations of securities or other laws warren added tesla worth 1 2 trillion at the start of 2022 has shed about 700 billion in market value this year amid questions about musk s judgement and commitment to the electric vehicle maker the billionaire s attention has been consumed by twitter since its purchase in october which has prompted him to sell almost 40 billion in tesla stock to shore up investment in the money losing social media network every board of directors of a company with multiple shareholders especially publicly traded companies is responsible for ensuring that a controlling shareholder especially one who is also a chief executive officer or ceo does not treat the company as a private plaything warren stated the senator called on the board to account for how it was dealing with conflicts of interest misappropriation of corporate assets and other actions by mr musk that appear not to be in the best interest of tesla and its shareholders those steps include pulling tesla engineers and other key staff at the automaker to work at twitter warren noted she also cited the potential for conflicts of interest given that twitter relies on ad revenue from tesla competitors such as audi and ford musk may decide to run the company to maximize badly needed revenue even if that includes great deals for tesla s competitors and potential injury to tesla she stated musk could decide he is personally better served if tesla overpays twitter for advertising or pays up front to give twitter access to much needed cash the board is responsible for ensuring musk is an effective ceo and acts in the best interests of tesla and its shareholders not just himself warren wrote the fact that mr musk was until recently the world s richest man does not absolve him of those legal responsibilities she said referencing musk s slide last week to the second spot on the forbes and bloomberg wealth rankings tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment the new york times earlier reported on warren s letter

tesla s fate is hanging in the balance as elon musk occupies his time with petty quarrels on twitter while investors started questioning elon s role at tesla we think it s time he set up one of his beloved polls about him staying in charge of the ev maker company elon musk surprised everyone when he announced his intention to buy twitter last april we re not sure how serious he was then but how things went would hunt musk for the rest of the year he tried his best to get out of the deal but his offer was too sweet to pass for the twitter board in the next months elon and his team struggled to find flaws in twitter s operations that would have been serious enough to allow him to back off finally he was forced to put the money where his mouth was or fingers considering all went live on twitter the battle over not owning twitter must ve taken a heavy toll on musk s fragile character because it all went downhill after that once hailed as a brilliant manager musk ruined twitter as a workplace and social platform erratic tweets poll after poll and controversies galore elon musk antagonized users advertisers and pretty much everybody from left to right musk is nevertheless proud of this as he considers annoying everyone as proof of being fair but we re not here to discuss musk s twitter drama his never ending tantrum is too minuscule to matter in the grand scheme of things we re here to discuss tesla and how things are going while its self proclaimed techno king is waging battle after battle to shatter every last piece of his pedestal he once pledged to save humanity and colonize mars but now he s upset people booed him on stage musk has lost his cool which obviously affects not only him but also the companies he was supposed to oversee tesla shares have crashed into the ground since the twitter drama started none of musk s tweets from the past couple of months are related to electric vehicles batteries or other technologies the boring company is quietly abandoning plans to change transportation while his neuralink company seems to have hit a wall with regulators over animal welfare spacex is still going by as planned since it s an important company for the u s government and musk seems to still find time to share tweets about its achievements as for tesla it s total silence the public has no idea what tesla plans for the near future since musk dissolved it years ago there has been no public relations department to provide updates to the media the model 3 is supposed to have a refresh soon but tesla s lineup is still one of the oldest in the industry meanwhile tesla is in the middle of a difficult ramp up at giga texas and giga berlin while being under attack from all sides by other car companies recently bloomberg reported that musk brought tesla china boss tom zhu to the u s to oversee production ramp up at giga texas tesla or musk did not confirm the move but the chinese media went even further with speculations supposedly zhu went to the u s to replace musk as ceo this is not a bad idea especially considering musk s twitter distraction and unpredictable state of mind tesla investors have already expressed concerns over musk s tenure as tesla s ceo musk sold a huge number of tesla shares contributing to the tanking of the stock many investors would ve wanted tesla to step in and buy shares to stabilize the price but there s no one seemingly running tesla at the moment we re in literally the best part of the company s history and it s being totally demolished by twitter ross gerber a tesla investor who supported musk s twitter bid told washington post i think the stock would rally big time if they just said elon s not ceo of tesla anymore musk has also taken a political stance lately which is not the wisest thing to do elon s controversial views are on a collision course with his companies interests considering that ev buyers mainly come from a public he mockingly labeled as woke liberals as you d imagine investors are annoyed and gary black the managing partner of future fund llc a tesla investor voiced his concern he will realize soon if not already that his polarizing political views are hurting customer perceptions of evs black wrote in a tweet customers don t want their cars to be controversial they want to be proud as hell to drive them not embarrassed we get it that musk is suffering from twitter fatigue right now and that s why we think he seriously needs to consider stepping down this could actually be already happening if musk stays true to his promises earlier in the day he set up a poll asking whether he should step down as head of twitter unsurprisingly the poll went 57 5 in favor of this option and now people fully expect musk to comply but the trillion dollar question is whether musk should also step down as tesla ceo maybe it s high time elon sets up a poll to find out as he used to say vox populi vox dei

a sign is placed near the section for children s medicine sunday dec 18 2022 at a cvs in greenlawn n y caring for a sick child has become even more stressful than usual for many u s parents in recent weeks due to shortages of children s tylenol and other medicines ap photo leon keith caring for sick children has become extra stressful recently for many u s parents due to shortages of children s tylenol and other medicines doctors and other experts say the problem could persist through the winter cold and flu season but should not last as long as other recent shortages of baby formula or prescription drugs they also say parents have alternatives if they encounter empty store shelves here s a closer look what s happening an unusually fast start to the annual u s flu season plus a spike in other respiratory illnesses created a surge in demand for fever relievers and other products people can buy without a prescription there are more sick kids at this time of year than we have seen in the past couple years said dr shannon dillon a pediatrician at riley children s health in indianapolis experts say that s the main factor behind the shortages which vary around the country and even within communities at this point it s more like toilet paper at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic dillon said you just have to look in the right place at the right time drugmaker johnson johnson says it is not experiencing widespread shortages of children s tylenol but the product may be less readily available at some stores the company said it is running its production lines around the clock in the meantime cvs health has placed a two product limit on all children s pain relief products bought through its pharmacies or online walgreens is limiting customers online to six purchases of children s over the counter fever reducing products that limit doesn t apply in stores aside from over the counter products the prescription antibiotic amoxicillin also is in short supply due to increased demand according to the food and drug administration the drug is often used to treat nose and throat infections in children what to do check first for alternatives in the store if some products aren t available generic versions of brand name products are perfectly safe and often a much more affordable option dillon said other stores nearby also may have better options manufacturers say there are no widespread national shortages of these medications according to the consumer healthcare products association a family doctor may know which stores have decent supplies a doctor also may be able to tell parents whether they can try alternatives like crushing the proper dose of a pill version and mixing it with food or chocolate syrup doctors say parents or caregivers should not try this on their own because determining proper doses for children can be tricky you don t need to experiment at home said dr sarah nosal a south bronx family physician your family doctor wants to talk to you and see you going without doctors also caution that fevers don t always have to be treated they are a body s natural defense against infection and they make it hard for a virus to replicate dillon noted for instance that a fever may not be intrinsically harmful to older children however parents should take a newborn under 2 months old to the doctor if the child has a fever of 100 4 degrees or more and doctors say any child with a fever should be monitored for behavior changes instead of medicine consider giving the child a bath in lukewarm water cold water makes the body shiver which can actually raise the temperature put fans in the child s room or set up a cool mist humidifier to help their lungs nosal also said two teaspoons of honey can help control coughs in children older than a year avoid using honey for young children because it carries a risk of infant botulism when will supplies get better shortages might last in some communities until early next year resolving them can depend on whether there are enough workers at warehouses and stores to deliver the product and stock the shelves noted erin fox she researches drug shortages and is the senior pharmacy director at university of utah health which runs five hospitals fox said there are no problems at factories or a lack of ingredients contributing to current shortages those obstacles can lead to long supply disruptions i don t expect this to last a year or more like some of our other shortages do she said ap health writer matthew perrone in washington contributed to this story murphy reported from indianapolis
millions of twitter users asked elon musk to step down as the head of twitter in a poll the billionaire created and promised to abide by but monday afternoon there was no word on whether musk would step aside or who the new leader might be twitter has grown more chaotic and confusing under musk s leadership with rapidly vacillating policies that are issued then withdrawn or changed among those in the go camp almost certainly were tesla investors who have grown tired of the 24 7 twitter chaos which they say has distracted the eccentric ceo from the electric car company his main source of wealth musk also used his shares in the company to partially fund the acquisition of twitter shares of tesla are down 35 since musk took over twitter on oct 27 costing investors billions tesla s market value was over 1 1 trillion on april 1 the last trading day before musk disclosed he was buying up twitter shares the company has since lost 58 of its value at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on tesla s dominant share of electric vehicle sales this has been a black eye moment for musk and been a major overhang on tesla s stock which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the twitter soap opera began wedbush analyst dan ives wrote monday if musk s tenure ends it would be a major positive for tesla stock and a sign that musk is finally reading the room that has been growing frustration around this twitter nightmare the billionaire tesla ceo musk attended the world cup final sunday in qatar where he opened the poll since the poll closed early monday musk has been uncharacteristically silent on twitter as he appeared to be flying back to the u s more than half of the 17 5 million respondents voted yes in answer to musk s twitter poll asking whether he should step down as head of the company musk has taken a number of unscientific polls on substantial issues facing the social media platform including whether to reinstate journalists that he had suspended from twitter which was broadly criticized in and out of media circles the polls have only added to a growing sense of tumult on twitter since musk bought the company for 44 billion potentially leaving the future direction of the company in the hands of its users among those users are people recently reinstated on the platform under musk people who had been banned for racist and toxic posts or who had spread misinformation since buying twitter musk has presided over a dizzying series of changes that have unnerved advertisers and turned off users he s laid off half of the workforce axed contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors he has dropped enforcement of covid 19 misinformation rules and called for criminal charges against dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert musk clashed with some users on multiple fronts and on sunday he asked twitter users to decide if he should remain in charge acknowledging he made a mistake in launching new restrictions that banned the mention of rival social media websites the results of the unscientific online survey regarding whether musk should remain as top executive at twitter which lasted 12 hours showed that 57 5 of those who voted wanted him to leave while 42 5 wanted him to stay the poll followed just the latest significant policy change since musk acquired twitter in october twitter had announced that users will no longer be able to link to facebook instagram mastodon and other platforms the company described as prohibited that decision generated immediate blowback including criticism from past defenders of twitter s new owner musk then promised that he would not make any more major policy changes to twitter without an online survey of users the action to block competitors was musk s latest attempt to crack down on certain speech after he shut down a twitter account last week that was tracking the flights of his private jet the banned platforms included mainstream websites such as facebook and instagram and upstart rivals mastodon tribel nostr post and former president donald trump s truth social a growing number of twitter users have left the platform under musk or created alternative accounts on mastodon tribel nostr or post and included those addresses in their twitter profiles musk has advocated for free speech on twitter but shut down the jet tracking account calling it a security risk he used that to justify the decision last week to suspend the accounts of numerous journalists who cover twitter and musk among them reporters working for the new york times washington post cnn voice of america and other publications many of those accounts were restored following an online poll by musk the washington post s taylor lorenz was suspended over the weekend after requesting an interview with musk in a tweet tagged to the twitter owner sally buzbee the washington post s executive editor called it an arbitrary suspension of another post journalist that further undermined musk s promise to run twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech again the suspension occurred with no warning process or explanation this time as our reporter merely sought comment from musk for a story buzbee said by midday sunday lorenz s account was restored as was the tweet she thought had triggered her suspension musk was questioned in court on nov 16 about how he splits his time among tesla and his other companies including spacex and twitter he had to testify in delaware s court of chancery over a shareholder s challenge to musk s potentially 55 billion compensation plan as ceo of the electric car company musk said he never wanted to be a ceo of any company preferring to see himself as an engineer in public banter with twitter followers sunday musk expressed pessimism about the prospects for a new ceo saying that person must like pain a lot to run a company that has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy no one wants the job who can actually keep twitter alive there is no successor musk tweeted o brien reported from providence rhode island while chan reported from whalley england and krisher reported from detroit ap

contrafect corporation nasdaq cfrx a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of direct lytic agents dlas including lysins and amurin peptides as new medical modalities for the treatment of life threatening antibiotic resistant infections today announces the database lock of its phase 3 disrupt direct lysis of staph aureus resistant pathogen trial study of exebacase in patients with staph aureus bacteremia and a summary of the topline data and the preliminary findings from its own analysis of data from the interim futility analysis the futility dataset all patients in the disrupt study have now been independently adjudicated and the study database has been locked the blinding and data integrity of the study was maintained throughout enabling the company to not only share the futility dataset but also to utilize the results of the study including the safety data in future regulatory filings for exebacase the interim futility analysis was conducted as planned when approximately 60 of the primary endpoint population patients with methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa bacteremia had been randomized and followed for 14 days after treatment the results below from the futility dataset and the company s own analysis were generated based on the clinical response of the primary endpoint at day 14 in 84 mrsa bacteremia patients of which 55 patients were treated with exebacase plus standard of care soc antibiotics the exebacase arm and 29 patients were treated with placebo plus soc antibiotics the soca arm clinical response at day 14 was 52 7 in the exebacase arm n 55 compared to 58 6 in the soca arm n 29 the two arms were well balanced in most baseline factors including final diagnosis primary source of infection risk factors for bacteremia soc antibiotic used and age there was an imbalance in the baseline disease severity of patients as determined by the apache ii score with 34 8 of patients in the exebacase arm having an apache ii score 15 at randomization as compared to only 13 8 of patients in the soca arm a patient with an apache ii score above 15 is considered to have an extremely poor prognosis and a significantly increased risk of mortality subgroup analyses of clinical response were all as expected based on the topline results other than apache ii subgroups proper study randomization and drug allocation was confirmed by pharmacokinetic data the unprecedented clinical response in the placebo arm of this study which is nearly double the response rate observed in our phase 2 study of exebacase and in comparable phase 3 studies of daptomycin and fosfomycin coupled with the conduct of the study during the covid pandemic leaves us with trial results that are uninterpretable said roger j pomerantz md president chief executive officer and chairman of contrafect however the importance of completing the full study in a blinded placebo controlled manner cannot be understated the full results which will be coming in the first quarter including the safety database will be used as part of any future regulatory submissions for the approval of exebacase we believe given the response rates and strong safety profile observed in our studies to date that another study in this patient population should be conducted in the future by us or a partner while we look forward to repeating this study in staph bacteremia in the future we remain keenly focused on our near term opportunities to significantly improve patient outcomes in serious infectious diseases we are poised to start dosing patients early in the first quarter of the new year in our phase 1b 2 study of patients with chronic prosthetic joint infections of the knee using intra articular exebacase with which we have seen promising effects in a significant group of compassionate use patients in addition we remain on track to initiate a phase 1 study of cf 370 our first engineered lysin targeting gram negative pathogens in the second quarter of 2023 added garrett nichols md contrafect s interim chief medical officer the phase 3 disrupt study of exebacase is a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical study conducted in the united states in 259 of the planned 348 patients with s aureus bacteremia including right sided endocarditis enrollment in the trial was stopped following a review of the pre specified interim futility analysis by the independent data safety monitoring board dsmb the dsmb recommended the trial be stopped because the conditional power of the trial was below the pre specified threshold for futility as per the dsmb charter no safety concerns were noted by the dsmb all patients have completed all study visits and all patient outcomes have been verified by the blinded adjudication committee the full results and the clinical study report are expected in the first quarter of 2023 the company is planning a virtual fireside chat in the first quarter of 2023 for an in depth review and discussion of the disrupt study about contrafect contrafect is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of dlas including lysins and amurin peptides as new medical modalities for the treatment of life threatening antibiotic resistant infections an estimated 700 000 deaths worldwide each year are attributed to antimicrobial resistant infections we intend to address life threatening infections using our therapeutic product candidates from our platform of dlas which include lysins and amurin peptides lysins are a new class of dlas which are recombinantly produced antimicrobial proteins with a novel mechanism of action associated with the rapid killing of target bacteria eradication of biofilms and synergy with conventional antibiotics our dlas exhibit broad spectrum activity against a wide range of antibiotic resistant gram negative pathogens including p aeruginosa acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter species we believe that the properties of our lysins and amurin peptides will make them suitable for targeting antibiotic resistant organisms such as mrsa and p aeruginosa which can cause serious infections such as bacteremia pneumonia and osteomyelitis we have completed a phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of staph aureus bacteremia including endocarditis with our lead lysin candidate exebacase which is

bases to support the philippines landing operations scheduled for 17 october uss carson city slides down her building way to the waiting waters of the los angeles harbor on the 13th of november 1943

city in company with the sister frigates uss burlington pf 51 and san pedro pf 37 were tasked to escort a convoy of motor torpedo boat squadrons 9 and 10 composed of 26 patrol torpedo pt boats and their two tenders the convoy came under heavy air attack off morotai island and the carson city opened fire expending 47 3 inch rounds and a substantial number of 40 mm and 20 mm rounds and assisted in the downing of three enemy planes october 1944 after safely delivering the pt boats and their tenders to leyte in the philippines the carson city steamed to hollandia new guinea there she was assigned to escort convoys of troop transports and cargo ships being assembled for the follow on support for the leyte ground operations on 16 october she sailed from humboldt bay new guinea as escort

seattle washington to dutch harbor without incident she then was tasked to perform a series of tedious patrols on the cold rough foggy waters of the gulf of alaska the uss carson city getting underway in alaska for convoy escort duty in 1945 wayne scarpaci soviet service in early 1945 the navy was directed to transfer an adequate number of ships of appropriate types to the soviet union for use in invading the northernmost japanese island of hokkaido during operation downfall the planned allied invasion of japan on 29 august 1945 the carson city and the 27 other tacoma class frigates that were to be transferred were decommissioned from the u s navy and transferred under the secret project hula at cold bay alaska to the soviet navy the soviet navy designated the ship as a storozhevoi korabl escort ship ek and commissioned her as the unnamed ek 22 the ship was transferred too late to participate in the operation august storm landings on the kuril and seisin islands on 13 and 18 august 1945 little is known about her soviet service but she is believed to have served in support of the ongoing postwar occupation operations a total of 28 frigates 528 small landing ships and craft and small support ships were transferred under project hula after world war ii the soviets were to return all loaned u s and british ships under the terms of the lead lease agreement a snapshot of the uss carson city just prior to being transferred to the soviet union courtesy of the author as the ships were not forthcoming on 8 may 1947 u s secretary of the navy james forrestal formally requested they be returned but the soviets apparently had no intention of returning any of them only after protracted negotiations which included retired british prime minister winston churchill finally implying the united states and great britain might decide to get them back by force of arms if necessary did the soviets reluctantly agreed to return them the soviets returned the carson city at yokosuka japan on 31 october 1949 in very poor material condition everything removable was gone and she suffered from a severe lack of maintenance the ship re assumed the name carson city and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on the same day at the yokosuka naval base the sakura the ship remained in reserve until she was selected under the u s postwar map military assistance program to be loaned to a friendly foreign nation she was overhauled in japan at u s expense and loaned to the japanese maritime self defense force on 30 april 1953 she was renamed the sakura cherry blossom tree and redesignated pf290 sakura remained in service until 31 march 1966 when she was decommissioned and redesignated auxiliary stock craft yac16 a harbor service craft she remained in service as such until stricken from the japanese maritime self defense force on 31 march 1971 uss carson city as the jmsdf sakura pf290 courtesy of the author custody of the ship was returned to the u s navy at yokosuka and she was transferred to the u s department of defense surplus property division she was immediately stricken from the u s navy vessel registry and put up for sale for scrapping in 1972 the hulk was towed to the chien ho fa steel and iron works in taiwan and broken up ending the 28 year three nation career of the uss carson city patrol frigate 50 the tacoma class the carson city was the 48th ship in the 100 vessel tacoma class patrol frigate program during world war ii and the korean war 79 tacoma class patrol frigates were operated by the united states ordered into production by president franklin roosevelt they were intended to be a quick way to get a hundred war emergency convoy escorts the class was originally ordered as 100 ships but four were canceled and 14 were transferred to great britain the tacoma class ships were based on the british river class frigate design the royal navy provided two canadian built examples of river class frigates to the u s navy the uss asheville pf 1 and natchez pf 2 built to merchant ship standards they lacked many features considered essential damage resistance and damage control capabilities for a u s navy warship and reciprocating main engines all of which contributed to an unwanted status in the u s navy the navy did not crew any of the tacoma class ships during world war ii assigning them instead to the coast guard the tacomas were designed for production line assembly in civilian yards like the liberty ship program and like the liberty ships they were considered expendable one veteran of the carson city told me that as they steamed into the combat zone their commanding officer told the crew not to worry as the japanese would not waste a torpedo on them despite their light construction and orphan status these ships performed sterling service during world war ii they escorted convoys their designed function acted as weather ships supported amphibious landings and performed endless hours of tedious escort and patrol duty they operated in every theater of the war from the sweltering heat of general douglas macarthur s southwestern pacific area across the notoriously rough north atlantic and in the cold dark stormy waters of the bering sea on the alaskan sea frontier some of the patrol frigates remained in foreign service into the 1990s not bad for a one off design legacy the legacy of the uss carson city

small companies in the united states mark the beginning of a sharp recovery with a supercycle behind the time holding shares as the stock cycle continues the central bank must not forget the delayed reaction of the economy to changes in monetary policy and more on the new pearls of the week markets are still high peter oppenheimer the bank s chief strategist told bloomberg that the data coming from the u s economy was mostly good and in his opinion there would be a strong recovery in the united states it will be similar in the entire world economy including europe which can catch up with the united states in the field of vaccination and stocks will benefit from this growth in the coming months but how much good news is already reflected in stock market prices the strategist responded that markets were initially helped by economic stimulus and now he expects both the economic recovery and the growth of business profits to be stronger than currently expected this should allow for further growth of the markets however it should not be as sharp as last year it will therefore be driven by a change in expectations and to some extent a decline in stock market risk premiums when will markets start thinking about the developments of 2022 oppenheimer responded to this question by saying that the us economy will continue to trend next year which means growth should be even faster therefore the economy should not slow down the markets next year but according to the strategist their revenues will fall and a significant cycle will take place below the surface overall the choice of stocks and sectors will gain importance regarding this cycle the strategist said there will be more and more choices over the past decade it has particularly preferred growth stocks which now have a sense of rotation towards revolving stocks and more recently value stocks according to the strategist some small businesses may be more interesting especially those doing business in services thus making more profit as the economy opens up this should reflect a sharp increase in consumption supported by strong housing balances when asked about bubbles the strategist replied that the last centuries point to some common features of the bubble multiplication period in his opinion we do not currently see many such characteristics at most in certain market segments we must not forget that we are still operating in a low cost environment so when ratings were high for example during the internet bubble and the dividend yield was only 1 the long term government bond yield was 6 5 now the yield is very low and this should be taken into account when looking at the current high estimates which are not exaggerated in this view according to the strategist real rates will continue to benefit stocks and changes in central bank policy will not be a barrier to them sharp acceleration the following chart shows the sales growth of small american companies at the end of last year they slowly back up in january as the bank s analysts write they are now actively accelerating source twitter what s next what showed the big gains in us stocks last year investment management s andrew slimon thinks there are two main things first markets are growing every time the us federal reserve increases its liquidity supply second markets are always looking forward and will begin to grow before it is generally clear that the economy is facing improvement that is why it is sometimes very difficult to understand that stocks are rising in the midst of a recession now this issue is relevant again because the markets already reflect the expected recovery and the question is what s next so is it time to put more money into your investment portfolio and reduce the weight of stocks in this context slimon noted that after the rapid growth of stocks since 2020 it is natural for consolidation to take place on the other hand according to the strategist we are in the second year of the new bull market and history shows that the second year is generally good for stocks but volatile consolidation and volatility can be expected but i think the stock markets will be favorable by the end of this year the strategist said slimon considers that we are not yet close to where value stocks have lost their appeal because many of them are historically cheap these for the most part include financial topics there may come a time when development topics will work better again but according to the strategist history shows that the rally in value is not over yet in addition central bank chairman powell said he would do nothing until the labor market situation improved significantly that means the economy will grow sharply and the eco cycle will be favorable for stocks at the beginning of the last century according to the following chart investors held shares for an average of 1 2 years at the beginning of the last century from the early 1930s this period began to last considerably and from the 1940s it was generally more than ten years another turning point occurred in the early 1960s when the trend of reducing average holding hours began currently we are approaching the standard again from the beginning of the last century the average holding period is about two years source twitter don t forget about delays bond yields may take a break now but there will be a massive increase in demand in the economy caused by employment growth companies will raise prices we have strong inflation and rising prices which will raise rates this was stated by richard fisher president of the dallas federal reserve for cnbc according to him europe is lagging behind and the united states is the best in the field of vaccination this should be reflected in the flow of capital which should move more to the united states thus preventing rates from rising on the other hand the us government will run a high deficit which will raise rates will high inflation be temporary fisher responded that companies as always would try to increase their margins and raise prices especially if their costs increase the central bank now believes that high inflation is only a temporary phenomenon but fisher says monetary policy is being delayed in the real economy while inflation is not a temporary phenomenon it will be reflected if the central bank eventually tries to reduce it fisher added i now understand the central bank s leadership but there are risks involved largest on the market in 1955 it accounted for almost 10 of the total u s market capitalization its

by marc jones london reuters strategists at a uk bank have proposed the idea of a super sized 10 billion brazilian government bond that would be specifically designed to help halt the destruction of the amazon rainforest stopping deforestation of the amazon which absorbs vast amounts of planet warming greenhouse gas is part of brazilian president elect luiz inacio lula da silva s sweeping plan to reclaim leadership on climate change measures he has recently asked the united states britain france switzerland and canada to join an international amazon protection fund set up during his first 2003 10 administration and has made a firm commitment to zero deforestation by 2030 to help stick to that pledge strategists at natwest have proposed what would be the world s biggest ever sustainability linked bond a special type of government debt that would have an explicit promise to protect the rainforest it would be a big way for lula to signal his intent natwest s head of emerging markets and esg macro strategy alvaro vivanco told reuters the scale and importance of the amazon everyone can relate to it a 10 billion bond would be a record for the nascent sustainability linked debt markets one of the biggest emerging market sovereign bonds ever sold and four times bigger than any of brazil s current bonds money raised via sustainability linked debt can be used for almost any purpose so lula would have a huge injection of resources for his conservation plans and the other key parts of his political agenda amazon deforestation rates bond structure importantly vivanco sees the bond having a structure used by uruguay this year where the regular annual interest payments investors receive known as coupons would go down if the government beats its targets but also up as a penalty for missing them it could be set as 100 basis points for every 1 000 km2 up or down from the target up to a maximum of 200 bps in either directions for example if the baseline was to reduce deforestation to 12 250 km2 but the actual loss was 13 250 km2 the government would be have to increase the bond s 2024 coupon payment by 100 bps as an incentive to do as much as possible though the coupon payment would go down by 100 bps if the loss was 11 250 km2 as a reference a 2034 brazilian bond is currently yielding around 6 35 making the step up down feature potentially financially material for brazil vivanco s initial outline of the plan last week said the bond could run to 2035 and the deforestation numbers could be verified using satellite images by a third party such as the united nations the huge 10 billion scale shouldn t be a huge hurdle either with all types of investors from major pension and wealth funds to even global central banks likely to be keen to show they are trying to tackle climate change if lula goes around the world selling this bond you would have to have a reason not to be part of it vivanco said reporting by marc jones editing by anna driver
surrounded by pictures knickknacks and a guitar signed by country music star alan jackson in his second floor state house office gov larry hogan took stock of his dwindling time as governor it s not that i m counting but my calendar has a countdown on it hogan told the baltimore sun in an interview monday it says 30 days today the rare two term republican governor has reached his term limit and will pass the baton to democratic gov elect wes moore who will be inaugurated as maryland s first black governor on jan 18 with only a month left of an eight year stint as the state s chief executive hogan recalled his wins both intentional and by happenstance fumbles and where he d like to see the state of politics head next win lose or draw hogan said that he is the most proud of maryland s economic turnaround something he campaigned on in 2014 he is leaving the state with a 5 5 billion surplus thanks in part to federal pandemic relief funds it s the main focus of why i ran so i feel like delivering on the main focus of what we promised to do he said maryland gov larry hogan a republican reflects on his eight years in office monday in annapolis while hogan was able to checkoff boxes for his gubernatorial master plan his administration did face stormy seas 89 days into his first term freddie gray died of injuries sustained while in baltimore police custody nearly two months after that hogan was diagnosed with stage 3 non hodgkin s lymphoma leaving him to run maryland from a hospital bed he said and in 2020 he was faced with the covid 19 pandemic which hogan said no one at the federal state or local level was prepared to take on and while he isn t claiming infallibility there have been factual disputes over hogan s recounting of the aftermath of gray s death in his 2020 memoir and a series of inquiries related to flawed procurement deals made during the covid 19 state of emergency among other pandemic related issues hogan believes his administration did a pretty good job of fielding unanticipated crises i d like to say we were defined by the things that we said we were going to do and we did but i think also it s how we had to respond to crises and how we led during a crisis and i think we did a pretty good job of those things as well hogan said monday but the governor feels he fumbled at least one ball legislatively pointing to a failure to pass a bill to place tougher penalties on repeat violent offenders despite three attempts democrats enjoy a veto proof in the state legislature baltimore has seen at least 300 homicides annually since 2015 both the year of gray s death and when hogan took office the governor blamed city and legislative leadership for the lack of movement on his tough measures to get the few violent criminals off the streets throughout his tenure the republican governor has repeatedly butted heads with city leadership hogan said monday he thinks leadership was hesitant to work with him because he is a republican and that there may be more attempts to try to cooperate with the governor s office when moore is inaugurated critics of hogan allege many accomplishments over the past two terms were not his own but the work of the general assembly in response hogan said he promised bipartisanship from day one when i was giving my inaugural address in 2015 i said that the politics that have divided our nation need not divide our state that i was going to take the best ideas regardless of which side of the aisle they came from he said if partisan legislators criticize it was our idea and he took it i promise to say i didn t care if it was a republican or democratic idea we were going to try to work together to get them done and we did and then they criticize me for going along with their idea it doesn t make any sense looking ahead many are wondering where the governor s political compass may lead him next hogan who described himself as a common sense conservative from the republican wing of the republican party has expressed dismay at the state of the national gop openly denouncing former president donald trump and refusing to vote for dan cox maryland s republican gubernatorial nominee the party has still got some issues hogan said i m doing everything i can to kind of return to more common sense you know back to a more traditional kind of bigger tent republican party that has a message that can appeal to more people hogan who won both the 2014 and 2018 elections with the help of unaffiliated and democratic voters said he believes the only way maryland will see another republican governor is if they have a message that speaks to voters beyond their political base i think it s certainly a possibility but it s going to take the right kind of candidate he said they d have to follow the road map that we left as opposed to veering off the road completely and getting stuck in a ditch hogan may take his road map to the national stage with a potential presidential bid in 2024 while he declined to say what comes after he leaves annapolis in january he plans to get us back to a republican party that more reflects the things that i believe in he first will talk with his family friends and advisors about his next moves and said there s no real time frame in regard to any announcement hogan has recently made visits to both iowa and new hampshire and has recently ramped up fundraising for a new political action committee ahead of a possible presidential run people have been encouraging me and i ve been out speaking around the country i ve been to 24 different states and i plan to continue to travel and i ve got things planned after i m no longer governor but i also said i m going to finish being governor for another 30 days hogan said but i m definitely going to be involved somehow

global venture dollars through third quarter 2022 are only 369 billion compared with all of last year s 679 4 billion invested globally venture capital firms have been pulling back on deploying capital with valuations plunging and economic headwinds slowing growth in 2022 the companies that actually last this winter will prove to be survivors of the down market situation so in a way the market is doing a lot of work for us said jessica koh director of investments at vertex ventures venture capital firms in southeast asia will probably be pickier next year with valuations plunging and economic headwinds slowing growth in 2022 the era of easy money is already history said yinglan tan ceo and founding managing partner at singapore based insignia ventures partners the biggest thing to watch out next year is how companies are going to grow defend their valuation and survive the challenging environment said jefrey joe co founder and managing partner at indonesia based alpha jwc ventures get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters according to data firm crunchbase venture capital backed companies raised only 369 billion for the first three quarters of 2022 a far cry from the whole of last year s record breaking feat of 679 4 billion invested globally which was a 98 increase from the year before that we have observed southeast asian vc deployment contract by 25 30 this year relatively more so in indonesia and at the series b stage and less so at the seed and series a stages said gavin teo general partner at altara ventures but there is still a lot of dry powder according to venture capitalists who spoke to cnbc most funds have capital to deploy but they are looking for great investment opportunities said jussi salovaara co founder and managing partner of asia at antler venture capital funds raised 151 billion in the first three quarters of this year that is money they brought on hand to invest exceeding any prior full year fundraising according to data from private market data platform pitchbook sequoia southeast asia raised a 850 million fund in june east ventures raised 550 million in july and insignia ventures partners raised 516 million in august we can be active and aggressive in deploying but at what valuation asked alpha jwc ventures joe too caught up in the money cycle tech stocks took a tumble at the start of the year amid rising interest rates and disappointing earnings results startups in southeast asia are still largely unprofitable with names like sea group and grab amassing billions of losses annually for the last 10 years it has been fomo investing said peng t ong co founder and managing partner at monk s hill ventures he was referencing how big name investors poured money into the collapsed crypto exchange ftx for fear of missing out southeast asian tech companies have lost most of their valuations since going public e commerce giant and nyse listed sea s market capitalization stands at around 30 billion down from more than 200 billion late last year goto s 400 trillion rupiah 28 billion valuation has dropped more than 75 since it went public in jakarta in april while grab has lost 69 of its initial valuation of about 40 billion since its december 2021 debut we are back to reality people are starting to go you need to have a path to profitability you need to be default alive said ong using a term to refer to companies that can turn a profit before they run out of money you need to have positive contribution margins these are the things that we should have been saying all along but we were too caught up in the money cycle venture capital firms have been pushing their portfolio companies to extend their runways as uncertainty lies ahead investors are spending more of their deployable capital and time into supporting portfolio companies to shape up their capital efficiency said insignia s tan it s not that we didn t care about last time said alpha jwc ventures joe but almost no startup is profitable in the first five years maybe the shift in mindset is let s be more prudent in growing yes they can burn no they do not need to be profitable now as long as they are capital efficient and have strong unit economics survival of the fittest this drier fundraising landscape is a litmus test revealing the true sustainability of business models and sector demand said insignia s tan the companies that actually last this winter will prove to be survivors of the down market situation so in a way the market is doing a lot of work for us said jessica koh director of investments at vertex ventures some sectors such as quick commerce have already seen casualties quick commerce promises to place orders in customers hands in less than 30 minutes indonesian quick commerce firm bananas announced in october that it was closing its e grocery operations after failing to make the economics work it first launched in january indonesia based e grocery company happyfresh ceased operations in malaysia after seven years while grab discontinued its quick commerce service grabmart kilat in indonesia internationally several companies gopuff gorillas jiffy getir zapp and buyk have announced closures strategy pivots or layoffs the 15 minute model of quick commerce in southeast asia is very difficult because the unit economics are very negative basket sizes and order sizes are quite small said teo of altara ventures with the flood of cash now swept away it is becoming more clear which companies were not ready for the challenging environment said insignia s tan

round this time of year rose keiko higa often finds herself making holiday cards for family and friends an art history major at oberlin college in ohio she uses cut and layered paper to craft christmas cards and paints traditional japanese new year s cards on watercolor paper written words can be such a meaningful gift on their own it s nice to be able to create a vessel for them in the form of a handmade card higa says not only can handmade cards feel more special than store bought or digital ones or none at all but gathering to make them can be a social activity for kids and grown ups ahead of the winter holidays they ve always been a thing but they re definitely having a moment now with more people wanting to keep in touch in a low fi way says leslie corona senior home editor at real simple handmade cards also speak to a time when more people are thinking of ways to reconnect with their inner crafter says oma blaise ford executive editor of better homes gardens it s a great craft for people who just want to dip their toe in you can just make one or two cards it doesn t have to involve a mass mailing suggests ford and diy cards touch on issues of sustainability and not consuming as much over the holidays she says christopher paul stevens an artist in the atlanta area makes distinctive holiday cards from old fashioned looking block prints of winter scenes and sells them on etsy com at 111 restoration and vintage goods judy a steiner an artist in ada michigan makes cards featuring elegant christmas trees formed from watercolor brush strokes in shades of green and blue it s kind of neat for both purchaser and receiver to know cards are handmade says steiner who has been making cards for decades and sells them through steiner studio on etsy while paintings are often expensive she notes handmade cards are a more affordable form of art a gift unto themselves tips for beginning card makers include aim for quality not quantity avoid getting too ambitious warns corona don t set out to make 300 cards by hand or if you do make it very simple it s a good idea to try making just five or 10 beautiful cards for closest family and friends attempting anything overly grand can become overwhelming and stressful she says you want to walk away from it with a positive memory she says consider what you have at hand before heading to the craft store look at what you have around you for example round basket coffee filters or cupcake liners can make great snowflakes fold a few times and cut out designs along the sides and top then paste them onto card stock suggests ford if you put a few drops of food coloring in some warm water you can fold dip dye and then allow the filters to dry before cutting the snowflakes they re similar to tissue paper but

support from commodity prices slippery slope an index of us housing market sentiment last night showed a reading of 31 for this month which on a 100 neutral index is a tad pessimistic it s the twelfth

of the overall picture us bond yields were higher again with the ten year rising 10 points to 3 58 caught between fed hawkishness and recession expectations it should be noted the biggest seller in

power to the people is a column by donald m kreis new hampshire s consumer advocate kreis and his staff of four represent the interests of residential utility customers before the nh public utilities commission and elsewhere by donald m kreis power to the people welcome to the winter solstice the darkest point in the year and the juncture at which we inhabitants of the northern hemisphere pause to consider what is truly eternal among those things it is generally agreed are family love and the prospect of sleeping in heavenly peace indepth your inbox get unbiased nonprofit watchdog news sent directly to your inbox to that list i humbly add in the spirit of the season energy efficiency people seem to smile in the face of the habit i have acquired in recent years of proclaiming chanukah the jewish festival of energy efficiency but it s no joke most of what i know about the holiday i learned from my fellow indepthnh org writer michael davidow as the 2020 edition of michael s annual chanukah column teaches back when the seleucid dynasty based in syria inherited control of ancient judea their leaders desecrated the temple in jerusalem a rebellion followed let by a group of zealots called the maccabees davidow wrote two years ago against all odds that rebellion succeeded those zealots recaptured jerusalem they re dedicated the temple the oil required for that ceremony allegedly lasted for those notorious eight days and they gave judea an independent kingdom again michael is fascinated by the different potential glosses on the chanukah story as it has passed down through the generations were the maccabees freedom fighters or were they religious fundamentalists whose views would be out of step with the largely secularized american jewish community who nevertheless have made sure chanukah is high on our national agenda for season s greetings it matters not for present purposes i m interested in the part davidow consigned to parentheses the legend that when the maccabees took over the temple in jerusalem they had only enough consecrated oil to last a day and yet the flame endured for an astonishing eight days that folks is energy efficiency today s maccabees would reach for the temple s light fixtures and swap out the incandescent bulbs so redolent of seleucid esque thinking for leds kids in observant jewish families celebrate chanukah by spinning dreidels small four sided tops they are decorated with four hebrew letters that stand for a phrase meaning a great miracle happened there but it wasn t a miracle or at least energy efficiency is no miracle it s science squeezing more work out of each unit of energy consumed in the spirit of ecumenism it should be made clear that energy efficiency or perhaps the lack thereof also plays a distinctive role in the christmas story as recounted in the new testament as it says in luke 2 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn as with the question of whether the maccabees were patriots or zealots we ll leave to one side the moral implications of no room at the inn consider instead the manger was there ever a dwelling place more in need of home weatherization again it is no joke the housing stock most in need of energy efficiency upgrades in new hampshire are the homes of low income people or to dispense with the euphemism the poor whether you celebrate christmas or chanukah or any of the other holidays that cluster around the winter solstice in all of its darkness this is a yuletide like no other for new hampshire s struggling ratepayers just as distant empires imposed a cruel hegemony on the holy land at the time of the maccabees and the nativity so too are we under the cruel thumb of distant forces operating at a global scale the global surge in natural gas prices combined with our region s overreliance on natural gas to produce electricity have sent electricity prices soaring everywhere granite staters are struggling to afford their utility bills the solstice will give way eventually to spring and to summer but alas i fear those high electric prices will be with us for the foreseeable future it is good news that the default energy service rate for eversource customers is falling slightly to 20 2 cents per kilowatt hour on february 1 but the days of that rate being 10 cents or less as it was a little more than a year ago are over we know that by looking at natural gas futures prices they foretell a decline but only a small one meanwhile people seem freaked out by what has occurred or at least that s the only explanation i have for why so few residential customers are exercising their right to spurn default energy service in favor of electricity offered by a competitive supplier likewise it s discouraging to read the news delivered recently by governor sununu to a group of journalists that the state s 42 million emergency energy assistance program has not been receiving enough applications the keene sentinel speculated that maybe people find the application process difficult and confusing under the program which mostly relies on federal funds if your household income is between 60 and 75 percent of the state median income you may qualify for a one time credit of 450 for heating assistance and 200 for electricity sixty percent of the state median income for a family of four is about 75 000 this is no christmas or chanukah miracle as the sentinel editorial noted look at this aid as a tax rebate of sorts you and other taxpayers paid for it and if you qualify you ought to take the opportunity to get back some of your investment in this year s edition of his annual holiday column michael davidow writes chanukah is how we remember that over two thousand years ago the local elite in jerusalem colluded with the heirs to alexander to meld the hebrew religion into their day s dominant greek culture a group of rural protestors refused to go along and they actually won a war of rebellion to keep their religion safe let s keep that rebellious spirit of the season going to keep new hampshire safe overcome the confusion and the difficulties insist on getting what is rightfully yours as a taxpayer and a ratepayer and above all tell anyone who will listen your elected officials your utilities your neighbors

when people write op eds many are anything but experts in the topic they re discussing they may be educated to some degree on the topic but they re still laymen and women this is especially true about guns as we ve all seen advertisement a prime example comes from a connecticut publication where the writer of this op ed clearly doesn t know what he s talking about mass shootings and gun violence are fundamental american phenomena we are utterly riddled with and by both of them over the last four decades the united states has suffered through 158 mass shootings in the sandy hook and uvalde sense these are indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by guns but defined more broadly as any incident where four or more people are killed or injured by guns we have experienced 3 500 mass shootings in the 10 years since sandy hook today the leading cause of death among children is guns despite the horrific stamp mass shootings leave on our collective psyche most deaths attributed to gun violence are tied to incidents of domestic violence suicides and smaller scale homicides still mass shootings occur at such an absurd frequency that between 2013 and 2020 america has experienced just one full calendar week without one in the face of mass addiction to guns and the pandemic of gun related violence we have failed to do much of anything to combat either the political cycle is a familiar one mass shooting 24 hours of news coverage thoughts and prayers for the victims a renewed vigor to finally take legislative action lobbying and political pressure to do nothing to dribble out the clock until everyone moves on and finally and inevitably inaction i m just 31 years old and i ve seen this cycle play out over and over again advertisement so gun violence is an american problem but it s also a pandemic does the author know what a pandemic actually is honestly this isn t the point of me writing this at most this warrants a tweet yet it sets the stage for what comes next after all if he can t tell what a pandemic is despite it being in the news daily for almost three years now how can he understand guns well he can t the second amendment reads a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed i remember the first time i really read this amendment and was shocked about how sparse it was nowhere of course does it guarantee the right to military grade assault rifles or silencers or bump stocks or high capacity magazines or hollow point bullets and yet the mere suggestion the mere hint of curtailing these obviously absurd aspects of civilian gun enhancements is met with a second amendment infused tantrum first it actually does guarantee all of those things it s in the part that says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed an infringement isn t an elimination it s far milder which means anything that inhibits our ability to keep and bear arms is an infringement but then again this is someone who apparently thinks hollow point rounds are a bad thing advertisement hollow points which terrify the typical anti gunner mushroom on impact and create a larger wound channel than full metal jackets this is why people like the author wet themselves over the idea of ordinary americans having such rounds but that s also why they re ideal for self defense it makes it easier to stop the bad guy fmj ammo may well go right threw the bad guy and through the wall and into some innocent bystander see that s how i know this author doesn t know anything about what he s trying to pontificate on if he did he d understand that overpenetration is a problem and hollow points are the solution to them that s why law enforcement uses them almost exclusively the idea that they re not only not protected but should be restricted is how you know the author is an unserious person screeching about a subject they know nothing about which would be fine if some didn t hold up some of this as being a valid argument make no mistake though it s not

global venture dollars through third quarter 2022 are only 369 billion compared with all of last year s 679 4 billion invested globally venture capital firms have been pulling back on deploying capital with valuations plunging and economic headwinds slowing growth in 2022 the companies that actually last this winter will prove to be survivors of the down market situation so in a way the market is doing a lot of work for us said jessica koh director of investments at vertex ventures venture capital firms in southeast asia will probably be pickier next year with valuations plunging and economic headwinds slowing growth in 2022 the era of easy money is already history said yinglan tan ceo and founding managing partner at singapore based insignia ventures partners the biggest thing to watch out next year is how companies are going to grow defend their valuation and survive the challenging environment said jefrey joe co founder and managing partner at indonesia based alpha jwc ventures feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here according to data firm crunchbase venture capital backed companies raised only 369 billion for the first three quarters of 2022 a far cry from the whole of last year s record breaking feat of 679 4 billion invested globally which was a 98 increase from the year before that we have observed southeast asian vc deployment contract by 25 30 this year relatively more so in indonesia and at the series b stage and less so at the seed and series a stages said gavin teo general partner at altara ventures but there is still a lot of dry powder according to venture capitalists who spoke to cnbc most funds have capital to deploy but they are looking for great investment opportunities said jussi salovaara co founder and managing partner of asia at antler venture capital funds raised 151 billion in the first three quarters of this year that is money they brought on hand to invest exceeding any prior full year fundraising according to data from private market data platform pitchbook sequoia southeast asia raised a 850 million fund in june east ventures raised 550 million in july and insignia ventures partners raised 516 million in august we can be active and aggressive in deploying but at what valuation asked alpha jwc ventures joe too caught up in the money cycle tech stocks took a tumble at the start of the year amid rising interest rates and disappointing earnings results startups in southeast asia are still largely unprofitable with names like sea group and grab amassing billions of losses annually for the last 10 years it has been fomo investing said peng t ong co founder and managing partner at monk s hill ventures he was referencing how big name investors poured money into the collapsed crypto exchange ftx for fear of missing out southeast asian tech companies have lost most of their valuations since going public e commerce giant and nyse listed sea s market capitalization stands at around 30 billion down from more than 200 billion late last year goto s 400 trillion rupiah 28 billion valuation has dropped more than 75 since it went public in jakarta in april while grab has lost 69 of its initial valuation of about 40 billion since its december 2021 debut we are back to reality people are starting to go you need to have a path to profitability you need to be default alive said ong using a term to refer to companies that can turn a profit before they run out of money you need to have positive contribution margins these are the things that we should have been saying all along but we were too caught up in the money cycle venture capital firms have been pushing their portfolio companies to extend their runways as uncertainty lies ahead investors are spending more of their deployable capital and time into supporting portfolio companies to shape up their capital efficiency said insignia s tan it s not that we didn t care about last time said alpha jwc ventures joe but almost no startup is profitable in the first five years maybe the shift in mindset is let s be more prudent in growing yes they can burn no they do not need to be profitable now as long as they are capital efficient and have strong unit economics survival of the fittest this drier fundraising landscape is a litmus test revealing the true sustainability of business models and sector demand said insignia s tan the companies that actually last this winter will prove to be survivors of the down market situation so in a way the market is doing a lot of work for us said jessica koh director of investments at vertex ventures some sectors such as quick commerce have already seen casualties quick commerce promises to place orders in customers hands in less than 30 minutes indonesian quick commerce firm bananas announced in october that it was closing its e grocery operations after failing to make the economics work it first launched in january indonesia based e grocery company happyfresh ceased operations in malaysia after seven years while grab discontinued its quick commerce service grabmart kilat in indonesia internationally several companies gopuff gorillas jiffy getir zapp and buyk have announced closures strategy pivots or layoffs the 15 minute model of quick commerce in southeast asia is very difficult because the unit economics are very negative basket sizes and order sizes are quite small said teo of altara ventures with the flood of cash now swept away it is becoming more clear which companies
